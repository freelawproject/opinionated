In addition, in a supplemental assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d the count of criminal trespass in the second degree. For the reasons that follow, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on the count of criminal trespass in the second degree and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We begin by considering whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as it relates to the five counts of telephonic harassment. Those five counts arose out of defendant\u2019s conduct in calling various Washington County public offices. On January 5, 2007, in response to \u201cincreasingly disruptive, time-consuming, and rude\u201d telephone calls by defendant, the Office of Washington County Counsel issued a letter forbidding defendant from calling the Office of Washington County Counsel, the Washington County Administrator\u2019s Office, or the Washington County Human Resources Department, for a period of three years. In addition, that same day, the Washington County Sheriffs Office issued a letter forbidding defendant from calling the Washington County Sheriffs Office because defendant\u2019s calls to the Sheriffs Office had also become \u201cincreasingly time consuming and disruptive.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Defendant was instructed in both letters that he could conduct any necessary business with the respective offices through written correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In February 2007, defendant made calls to the Office of Washington County Counsel and the Washington County Human Resources Department. And, in October 2007, defendant made additional calls to the Washington County Administrator\u2019s Office and the Washington County Sheriffs Office. On the basis of those additional calls, defendant was charged with the five counts of telephonic harassment of which he was ultimately convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and, following the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, moved for a judgment of acquittal. As to the counts of telephonic harassment, he argued that there was no evidence that his intent at the time he caused the phones to ring was anything other than to discuss state law and obtain information. In particular, defendant contended that his intention was not to vex, annoy, or harass, but only to obtain information and communicate his views.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion and, ultimately, rendered a guilty verdict on each of the telephonic harassment counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that \u201cthe state is required to prove that a defendant charged with telephonic harassment under ORS 166.090(l)(b) had the intent to harass when he placed the call <em>and </em>knew that he was prohibited from calling by someone exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Defendant renews the argument he made below that the record is devoid of evidence that he had the intent to harass or annoy the recipients of the calls at the time he caused the telephones to ring; rather, according to defendant, the record indicates that his intent at that time was to obtain information. Defendant also argues that calls made before the issuance of the letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>forbidding him from calling are not relevant to determining his intent in placing the calls underlying the telephonic harassment charges. In addition, defendant argues that, if ORS 166.090 requires a factfinder to consider the content of the words spoken by the caller to determine whether the caller committed the crime of telephonic <em>harassment </em>\u2014 i.e., whether the caller intended to harass or annoy the recipient \u2014then ORS 166.090 violates the free speech protections of Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The state responds that the circumstantial evidence presented in this case could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant intended to harass or annoy the recipients of his calls. As part of the evidence from which defendant\u2019s intent can be inferred, the state relies on defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial. There, defendant testified that \u201cthe prerogative of the people is to bother their public servants until they do what their oath of office says.\u201d Further, defendant testified, \u201cWhen you first don\u2019t get a response, sometimes you escalate. * * * If you still don\u2019t get a proper response, you escalate some more.\u201d Although the state acknowledges that defendant may have intended to address various government policies with his calls, the state contends that \u201c[defendant] also intended to annoy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"> We review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Schneider, </em>229 Or App 199, 201, 211 P3d 306 (2009) (citing <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995)). Although defendant moved for judgment of acquittal following the state\u2019s case-in-chief, \u201cwe consider the whole record to determine whether there is sufficient corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Lamphere, </em>233 Or 330, 332, 378 P2d 706 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">A telephone caller commits the crime of telephonic harassment, as provided by ORS 166.090(1), if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201cthe caller intentionally harasses or annoys another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201c(a) By causing the telephone of the other person to ring, such caller having no communicative purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201c(b) By causing such other person\u2019s telephone to ring, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201c(c) By sending to, or leaving at, the other person\u2019s telephone a text message, voice mail or any other message, knowing that the caller has been forbidden from so doing by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In <em>State v. Allison, </em>325 Or 585, 589, 941 P2d 1017 (1997), the Supreme Court held that subsection (1)(a) of that statute requires proof of <em>both </em>intent to harass or annoy and \u201cno communicative purpose\u201d on the part of the caller. By parity of reasoning, subsection (l)(b) requires proof of intent to harass or annoy and knowledge that \u201cthe caller has been forbidden from [causing another person\u2019s telephone to ring] by a person exercising lawful authority over the receiving telephone.\u201d On appeal, defendant challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence as to his intent to harass or annoy the recipients of his calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\"> As an initial matter, we disagree with defendant\u2019s argument that a trier of fact is prohibited, under Article I, section 8, from considering the content of his calls when determining whether he possessed the requisite intent to have violated ORS 166.090(l)(b). Generally, \u201cthe content of a person\u2019s speech may be used to prove a mental element of a crime.\u201d <em>Allison, </em>325 Or at 590 (citing <em>State v. Plowman, </em>314 Or 157, 167, 838 P2d 558 (1992) (statement \u201cI am going to kill you\u201d may evidence the intent element of murder or attempted murder)). This case falls within that general rule, and defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Johnson, </em>345 Or 190, 191 P3d 665 (2008) <em>(Johnson I), </em>to persuade us otherwise is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In <em>Johnson I, </em>the court held that the prohibition contained in ORS 166.065(l)(a)(B) (harassment by publicly insulting another person by abusive words or gestures in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>manner intended and likely to provoke a violent response) was overbroad on its face so as to violate Article I, section 8. 345 Or at 197. The court, in reaching that conclusion, discussed, at length, the reasoning of <em>State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 416-18, 649 P2d 569 (1982). <em>Robertson </em>identified three categories of cases that raise Article I, section 8, concerns: (1) cases involving laws that focus on the content of speech and writing; (2) cases involving laws that focus on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of forbidden results by expressly prohibiting expression to achieve those results; and (3) cases involving laws that focus on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of forbidden results without referencing expression at all, but where a person is nonetheless accused of causing such results by language or gestures. 293 Or at 416-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The statute at issue in <em>Johnson I </em>fell squarely into the second <em>Robertson </em>category. ORS 166.065(1)(a)(B) prohibited harassment (a forbidden result) by the express means of abusive words or gestures (expression); the court found the statute to be facially overbroad. <em>Johnson I, </em>345 Or at 197. In contrast, ORS 166.090(l)(b) prohibits harassment (a forbidden result) by the express means of causing another person\u2019s telephone to ring (nonexpressive conduct), and defendant was charged accordingly. Put another way, the expressive conduct identified by defendant (his speech during the telephone calls) is not relevant to proving the forbidden result (harassment), as was the case in <em>Johnson I; </em>rather, that expressive conduct, along with other evidence, is relevant to show defendant\u2019s intent. Proof of a mental state is required for most crimes. <em>See </em>ORS 161.095(2) (describing the necessity of a culpable mental state for criminal offenses except as otherwise provided). Criminal laws are not unconstitutional under Article I, section 8, simply because that culpable mental state might be proved by expressive conduct. Here, the trier of fact\u2019s consideration of the content of the calls to infer defendant\u2019s intent to harass or annoy under ORS 166.090(l)(b) did not violate Article I, section 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Having reviewed the record as a whole in the light most favorable to the state, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to harass or annoy the recipients of his calls. We readily reach that conclusion based on the frequency and length of defendant\u2019s calls after receiving the letters forbidding him from calling, the content of those calls, and, most significantly, defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the five counts of telephonic harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We turn, then, to defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error regarding the charge of criminal trespass in the second degree. That count arose out of defendant\u2019s conduct in entering Washington County\u2019s Public Services Building. On January 24, 2007, the Sheriffs Office issued a notice of exclusion to defendant because, according to the notice, defendant twice insulted entrance security personnel at the county courthouse and disrupted the movement of people there. The notice excluded defendant from several county buildings, including the Public Services Building, for a period of one year. Defendant was allowed under the notice to enter the buildings to conduct necessary official business, including appearing on his own matters. The exclusion notice indicated that, if, during the exclusion period, defendant needed to conduct such necessary business in the buildings, he was to either register his presence with entrance security officers or contact a listed Sheriffs Office representative one day in advance. In addition, the notice provided that, if defendant wished to appeal the notice, he could \u201cfile a writ of review with the Washington County Circuit Court.\u201d On January 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>2007, the day after the notice was issued, defendant, in fact, filed such a petition for writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">On February 8, 2007, defendant had business to conduct in the courthouse regarding a set-over that he sought in his writ of review case. Two deputies escorted defendant around the courthouse while he conducted that business. Thereafter, the deputies watched defendant leave the courthouse and walk toward the Public Services Building. The deputies followed defendant and located him inside that building, where defendant told the deputies that he did not have any official business to conduct there. Defendant was then arrested and subsequently charged with criminal trespass in the second degree pursuant to ORS 164.245. The charging instrument alleged, \u201cThe defendant, on or about February 8,2007, in Washington County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly enter and remain in and upon premises located at 155 N. First Avenue, Hillsboro OR[,] contrary to the statutes and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d On March 9, 2007, a month after being charged with criminal trespass, an order was entered in defendant\u2019s writ of review case dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Before his criminal trial in November 2007, defendant filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d all charges, including the count of criminal trespass in the second degree. In his supporting memorandum, defendant argued that the notice of exclusion was unlawful and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on both substantive and procedural grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under substantive due process, defendant argued that the notice was unlawful because it interfered with his fundamental right to petition government departments and was not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. Under procedural due process, defendant argued that the notice was unlawful because the availability of the appeal process indicated in the notice was a \u201csham\u201d and that process \u2014 a writ of review \u2014 made no provision for the taking of evidence. Thus, defendant contended, \u201c[b]ecause of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>two due process violations, the [notice is] not lawful and cannot serve as the basis for criminal prosecution.\u201d The trial court denied the \u201cmotion to dismiss.\u201d Defendant later renewed his procedural due process argument in his motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial court also denied that motion and, ultimately, found defendant guilty of criminal trespass in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On appeal, defendant separately assigns as error the denial of his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d and the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on the count of criminal trespass in the second degree. Defendant reprises the same procedural due process arguments he made below with respect to each assignment of error; specifically, defendant contends that he had a fundamental liberty interest in petitioning his government for redress of grievances, and that, \u201c[b]ecause [he] did not have the ability to challenge the [notice of exclusion], the state failed to present evidence that [he] was lawfully directed not to enter\u2019 the Public Services Building as required by ORS 164.245.\u201d The state agrees with defendant that the trial court erred when it denied his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d and asks this court to vacate, rather than reverse, defendant\u2019s conviction; the state contends that a remand to the trial court to afford defendant process on the notice of exclusion is the appropriate disposition. In addition, the state notes that its \u201cconcession\u201d on defendant\u2019s assignment of error regarding the \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d obviates its need to address the merits of defendant\u2019s assignment of error regarding the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Although the state has conceded a legal conclusion\u2014 that the trial court erred in denying the \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d\u2014 we are not obligated to take such a concession at face value. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>345 Or 176, 186-87 n 7, 191 P3d 651 (2008). Indeed, in this case, both parties invite us to perpetuate their misunderstanding of the trial court\u2019s pretrial ability to dismiss a criminal case. As we have stated before,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cOregon law provides for motions to dismiss on a range of grounds. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 135.470 (former jeopardy); ORS 135.745 to ORS 136.750 (precharge delay and speedy trial); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>166 Or App 189, 194, 999 P2d 1161 (2000) (prosecutorial vindictiveness). However, we are unaware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>any Oregon authority by which a pretrial \u2018motion to dismiss\u2019 can be employed to challenge the sufficiency of the state\u2019s anticipated proof of a charge. <em>See State v. Huffman, </em>49 Or App 823, 826, 621 P2d 78 (1980) (dismissal inappropriate remedy when officer exceeded his authority in serving summons outside his jurisdiction).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>State v. Weber, </em>172 Or App 704, 714, 19 P3d 378 (2001). Here, defendant\u2019s challenge in his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d concerned whether he was \u201clawfully directed\u201d not to enter the Public Services Building. That is an evidentiary matter. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>163 Or App 74, 77, 988 P2d 913 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 589 (2000) <em>(Johnson II) </em>(whether a defendant was \u201clawfully directed\u201d to leave the premises was an evidentiary matter). Defendant\u2019s argument in his \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d specifically regards the sufficiency of the state\u2019s anticipated proof\u2014 the notice of exclusion. The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The proper procedural vehicle for challenging the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence in this case was a motion for judgment of acquittal \u2014 a motion that defendant, in fact, made. Therefore, we next consider whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as it pertained to the count of criminal trespass in the second degree. To recall, ORS 164.245(1) provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of criminal trespass in the second degree if the person <em>enters or remains unlawfully </em>in a motor vehicle or in or upon premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ORS 164.205(3)(c), in turn, defines \u201center or remain unlawfully\u201d as \u201c[t]o enter premises that are open to the public after being <em>lawfully directed </em>not to enter the premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, defendant\u2019s only challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof is that the notice of exclusion was not lawful because he was not provided with any process by which to challenge it. For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>been granted on the count of criminal trespass in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">To prevail at trial, the state had to produce evidence to show that defendant was \u201clawfully directed\u201d not to enter the Public Services Building. <em>See </em>ORS 164.205(3)(c). In <em>State v. Marbet, </em>32 Or App 67, 71-73, 573 P2d 736 (1978), we considered the meaning of \u201clawfully directed\u201d as used in a prior version of ORS 164.205, which then, as now, defined \u201center or remain unlawfully\u201d under subsection (3)(b) as \u201c[t]o fail to leave premises that are open to the public after being lawfully directed to do so by the person in charge.\u201d In <em>Marbet, </em>we stated that \u201c[w]hether a person has a constitutional right to remain as an incident to the proper exercise of a constitutionally protected right may be inquired into in contesting the lawfulness of the direction to leave the premises.\u201d 32 Or App at 73. Further, we explained, \u201c[i]f the authority of the person in charge to expel an individual from the premises is not limited by a constitutional or statutory right of the individual to remain, the order must be obeyed at the risk of a conviction for trespass.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We more recently discussed the meaning of \u201clawfully directed\u201d for purposes of proving criminal trespass in the second degree in <em>State v. White, </em>211 Or App 210, 154 P3d 124, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>213 Or App 584, 162 P3d 336, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007). In that case, the defendant, who had been convicted of interference with a peace officer under ORS 162.247, argued that his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted \u201cbecause the state failed to prove that he refused to obey a lawful order,\u2019 which is one of the elements of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213-14. The state asserted that the defendant should have raised the issue pretrial. <em>Id. </em>at 215. In concluding that the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence had been timely brought, we discussed similar challenges to the lawfulness of orders underlying charges for criminal trespass in the second degree. <em>Id. </em>at 215-16. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201c[A]n essential element of criminal trespass in the second degree, ORS 164.245, is that the underlying order to leave the premises must be \u2018lawful.\u2019 * * * <em>The lawfulness of such an order may be limited or circumscribed by statutory or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>constitutional provisions and may be raised as a defense. [Marbet, </em>32 Or App at 72]. * * * When the lawfulness of an order is raised as a defense, the state has the burden of proving the element and disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cargill, </em>100 Or App 336, 341, 341 n 5, 786 P2d 208 (1990), <em>aff'd by an equally divided court, </em>316 Or 492, 851 P2d 1141 (1993), <em>overruled on other grounds by Stranahan v. Fred Meyer, [Inc.,] </em>331 Or 38, 11 P3d 228 (2000).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added; footnote omitted); <em>cf. State v. Dahl, </em>323 Or 199, 205, 915 P2d 979 (1996) (holding that \u201c[w]hatever the meaning of \u2018lawful acts\u2019 in the context of ORS 133.033, that meaning must be consonant with the state and federal constitutions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Broadly construed, the phrase \u201clawfully directed\u201d contemplates inquiries into the lawfulness of the direction that go beyond the delegated authority of the person to issue the direction. Those inquires may include whether the order complied with particular constitutional provisions. Accordingly, in this case, we conclude that the state was required to prove at trial that the notice of exclusion directing defendant not to enter the Public Services Building did not run afoul of the constitutional right to procedural due process that defendant raised. <em>Cf. State v. Barnes, </em>232 Or App 70, 74, 220 P3d 1195 (2009) (holding that the defendant could not argue that he was denied procedural due process on the underlying exclusion order when the record established that he did not take advantage of the process available to him); <em>Johnson II, </em>163 Or App at 79-80 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s procedural due process challenge to the lawfulness of an underlying exclusion notice on its merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> \u201cProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property' interests.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 332, 96 S Ct 893, 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976). Most of the specific notice and hearing requirements dictated by procedural due process stem from balancing the nature of the private interest affected by the government action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such an interest given the nature of the procedures used, and the nature of the governmental interest at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>stake. <em>Id. </em>at 335; <em>see also Johnson II, </em>163 Or App at 79 (discussing the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">We agree with defendant that he has a protected liberty interest in petitioning his government for redress of grievances and that that interest was constrained by the notice of exclusion. <em>See Huffman and Wright Logging Co. v. Wade, </em>317 Or 445, 459, 857 P2d 101 (1993) (noting that Article I, section 26, of the Oregon Constitution protects the rights to assemble peaceably and to petition the government); <em>Marbet, </em>32 Or App at 75 (noting that the right of access to the courts and administrative agencies is part of the right of petition protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution). Accordingly, to comply with procedural due process, it was necessary that defendant be afforded some process compliant with the balancing test enunciated in <em>Mathews </em>by which defendant could have obtained timely review of the notice of exclusion in order to safeguard his liberty interest against the risk of erroneous deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Here, the notice of exclusion itself indicated that, if defendant wished to appeal the notice, he could \u201cfile a writ of review with the Washington County Circuit Court.\u201d However, as a matter of law, a \u201cwrit of review\u201d is available only where the decision sought to be reviewed is issued to a party to a \u201cprocess or proceeding\u201d before an \u201cinferior court, officer, or tribunal.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 34.020 (providing who may obtain a writ of review). Defendant was not a party to <em>any </em>process or proceeding before the issuance of the notice; therefore, the notice inaccurately instructed defendant to file a petition for a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The record before us is devoid of any other evidence indicating that defendant did obtain, or could have obtained, constitutionally adequate process on the notice of exclusion. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence in the record from which a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant was \u201clawfully directed\u201d not to enter the Public Services Building. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the count of criminal trespass in the second degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In Case No. A137720, conviction for criminal trespass in the second degree reversed; remanded for resentenc-ing; otherwise affirmed.

And, as relevant in this case, ORS 164.205(3)(c), in turn, defines \u201center or remain unlawfully\u201d as \u201c[t]o enter premises that are open to the public after being lawfully directed not to enter the premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> In moving for judgment of acquittal on the telephonic harassment counts, defendant also argued that he was making the \u201csame basic argument,\u201d under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, that he had previously made with respect to the criminal trespass count. On appeal, defendant does not renew his due process argument with respect to the counts of telephonic harassment and, accordingly, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> Article I, section 8, provides, \u201cNo law shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever; but every person shall be responsible for abuse of this right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b337-5\"> Defendant does not argue, and we do not consider, whether ORS 166.090(l)(b) is unconstitutional as applied to him in these circumstances because the statute improperly regulates the manner of his speech. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions v.

Likewise, petitioner does not contend that the application of ORS 166.090(l)(b) to him violates Article I, section 26, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides that \u201c[n]o law shall be passed restraining any of the inhabitants of the State from assembling together in a peaceable manner to consult for their common good; nor from instructing their Representatives; nor from applying to the Legislature for redress of greviances [sic].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> Given that our conclusion is based on the calls made after defendant was issued the letters forbidding him from calling, we need not address defendant\u2019s argument that calls made before the issuance of those letters are irrelevant to determining his intent to harass or annoy the recipients of his calls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in part, that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> Nor would recasting defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d as a demurrer lead to a different result. <em>\u201cA </em>defendant may demur to an accusatory instrument when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018it appears upon the face thereof* * * that the facts stated do not constitute an offense.\u2019 ORS 135.630.\u201d <em>Weber, </em>172 Or App at 713. The charging instrument in this case makes no reference to the notice of exclusion that defendant challenges in his motion; accordingly, defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d is not a facial challenge to the sufficiency of the charging instrument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> The proper remedy for that error is reversal of the criminal conviction.
