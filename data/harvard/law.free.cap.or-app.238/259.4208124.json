Following that trial, the court imposed upward departure sentences. Defendant now appeals, contending in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred in imposing upward departure sentences based on facts \u201cnot alleged in an indictment or other accusatory instrument, or otherwise formally pled in open court.\u201d In a second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could reach a nonunanimous verdict. We reject defendant\u2019s second assignment of error without discussion, <em>see State v. Cobb, </em>224 Or App 594, 198 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009), and write only to address his first assignment of error. As to that assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The few relevant facts are not in dispute and are procedural in nature. Prior to his resentencing in 2008, the state, in a letter, notified defendant of enhancement facts it intended to rely on to seek an upward departure sentence. Later, the state sent defendant an e-mail setting forth additional enhancement facts on which it intended to rely. The enhancement factors were not included in an indictment or other pleading, and neither the letter nor the e-mail was filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Prior to trial, defendant filed motions requesting that the court \u201cdisallow the enhancement fact * * * allegation^]\u201d because they were not pleaded in an indictment. Defendant asserted that the enhancement facts constituted elements of the offenses at issue and that, pursuant to the Oregon Constitution, those facts were required to be alleged by a grand jury in an indictment. In addition, he urged that \u201cno prosecution on [the enhancement facts could] proceed until the allegations * * * are filed with the Court.\u201d The trial court disagreed, denied the motions, and permitted the enhancement facts to be tried to the resentencing jury. After the jury returned a verdict finding that the state had proved a number of enhancement facts, the court entered a judgment imposing upward departure sentences, concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201c[a]ny one of [the enhancement] factors alone would have resulted in an upward departure.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Defendant first contends that, pursuant to the requirements of the Oregon Constitution, the state was required to plead the enhancement facts in the indictment. <em>See Gill v. Lampert, </em>205 Or App 90, 97, 132 P3d 674 (2006) (\u201cIt remains an open question whether Oregon law requires that sentence enhancement factors be pleaded in the indictment.\u201d). The foundation for that argument is defendant\u2019s interpretation of two United States Supreme Court cases. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 490, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), the Court held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Pursuant to that rule, the Court explained in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), enhancement facts required for the imposition of an upward departure sentence must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In order to ensure compliance with that constitutional jury trial requirement, the legislature enacted procedures to be followed when enhancement facts \u2014 facts \u201cthat [are] constitutionally required to be found by a jury in order to increase the sentence that may be imposed upon conviction of a crime\u201d \u2014 are at issue in a case. ORS 136.760(2); <em>see State v. Roberts, </em>231 Or App 263, 270, 219 P3d 41 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 608 (2010) (\u201cWhat is now ORS 136.765 was the product of a work group that the Governor established in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>* * *, which recognized a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to a jury trial on any facts that increase the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond a presumptive sentence under state sentencing guidelines.\u201d). Pursuant to ORS 136.765,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cIn order to rely on an enhancement fact to increase the sentence that may be imposed in a criminal proceeding, the state shall notify the defendant of its intention to rely on the enhancement fact by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201c(1) Pleading the enhancement fact in the accusatory instrument; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\u201c(2) Within a reasonable time after filing the accusatory instrument, providing written notice to the defendant of the enhancement fact and the state\u2019s intention to rely on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"> Defendant argues that in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>enhancement facts must be considered \u201celements\u201d of an aggravated form of the underlying offense and, as such, pursuant to the Oregon Constitution they must be found by a grand jury and pleaded in an indictment. Because, here, the grand jury did not find the enhancement facts nor were they included in an indictment, defendant contends that \u201c[t]he court erred when it empanelled the sentencing jury, and sentenced defendant to a durational departure sentence based upon [those] enhancement facts.\u201d In particular, it is defendant\u2019s view that ORS 136.765(2), which allows reliance on enhancement facts upon \u201cwritten notice to the defendant,\u201d conflicts with the requirements of Article I, section 11, and Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution. The state disagrees, stating that the constitution does not require that the indictment include facts relating only to sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the state for the reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury in the county in which the offense shall have been committed; to be heard by himself and counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In light of its recognition that that clause \u201cguarantees to every person accused of a crime the right to \u2018demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him[,]\u2019 \u201d the Oregon Supreme Court has determined that \u201c[i]t is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>within the power of the legislature to declare [a pleading to constitute] an indictment [when it] does not set forth those elements of a criminal offense required by the constitution to be contained in an indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>182 Or 497, 501-02, 188 P2d 998 (1948). In other words, an indictment must inform the accused of the charges against him or her; an indictment is sufficient if it \u201cshall be so drawn that it can be understood therefrom that the act or omission charged as a crime is clearly and distinctly set forth, in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In addition, Article VII (Amended), section 5(3), of the Oregon Constition provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, a person shall be charged in a circuit court with the commission of any crime punishable as a felony only on indictment by a grand jury.\u201d Article VII (Amended), section 5(6) further provides that \u201c[t]he district attorney may file an amended indictment or information whenever, by ruling of the court, an indictment or information is held to be defective in form.\u201d Under those provisions, the state may not make a substantive amendment to an indictment unless the grand jury makes the amendment. Defendant reads Article I, section 11, and Article VII (Amended), section 5, to collectively require that the type of enhancement facts at issue here be found by the grand jury and included in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Initially, we observe that defendant overstates the holdings of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>when he contends that, pursuant to those cases, enhancement factors must be treated as elements of a crime for indictment purposes. Both cases concerned a defendant\u2019s right to jury trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and did not address what must be included in an indictment. That the federal constitution requires a defendant to be afforded a jury trial with respect to enhancement facts does not transform those facts into elements of the offense for indictment purposes. <em>See State v. Sawatzky, </em>339 Or 689, 698, 125 P3d 722 (2005) <em>(Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>do not alter the statutory definition of \u201coffense\u201d nor do they require, \u201cas a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>matter of state criminal procedure, that enhancement factors be set out in the indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Furthermore, the Oregon Supreme Court has considered and rejected the argument that sentencing factors that allow for the imposition of a harsher sentence constitute elements of an aggravated form of the underlying criminal offense. In <em>State v. Wagner, </em>305 Or 115, 752 P2d 1136 (1988), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>492 US 914, 109 S Ct 3235, 106 L Ed 2d 583 (1989), the defendant had been convicted of aggravated murder and received a death sentence. He contended that the indictment did not support the sentence because it did not allege all the facts the jury had to find in order to impose the death penalty \u2014 specifically, it failed to allege that he acted with deliberation. The court noted that deliberation is <em>not </em>an element of aggravated murder and rejected defendant\u2019s contentions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cThe offense with which this defendant is charged is aggravated murder as defined in ORS 163.095(2)(a)(E) * * *. The ultimate facts that make up that offense are clearly alleged in the indictment. To be guilty of aggravated murder one does not need to act \u2018deliberately.\u2019 If one is guilty of aggravated murder but the jury does not unanimously find that the perpetrator acted deliberately, the guilty one is not sentenced to death but is yet guilty of aggravated murder. <em>There is no requirement of pleading an indictment that requires the indictment to set forth possible penalties that the law may fix for guilt on a particular charge.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 172 (emphasis added). Thus, the indictment in that case was sufficient to allow the jury to consider and impose the death penalty, notwithstanding that, for that penalty to be imposed, the jury was required to find that the defendant acted \u201cdeliberately\u201d and the indictment did not include that allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">More recently, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 351-52, 131 P3d 173 (2006), which was decided after <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>the defendant, who had been convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death, argued that the indictment in his case was defective because it failed to allege all the facts that the jury was required to find in order for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>receive a death sentence. He asserted that \u201c \u2018capital aggravated murder\u2019 constitutes a different crime from \u2018simple aggravated murder,\u2019 the distinction being that the former crime involves additional \u2018elements\u2019 not relevant to the latter crime, <em>viz., </em>that (1) defendant acted deliberately; and (2) with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased would result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. Although that contention was at odds with <em>Wagner, </em>the defendant asserted that the court\u2019s holding in that case was inconsistent \u201cwith more recent federal and Oregon cases pertaining to the constitutional right to jury trial[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, however, perceived \u201cno conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It noted that, under those cases, the jury must decide the \u201c \u2018deliberateness\u2019 and \u2018reasonable expectation of death\u2019 questions * * * because, depending on how they are answered, they may increase the punishment for the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cnothing in those cases suggests\u201d that those questions become elements of the offense such \u201cthat they must be set out in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, as in <em>Wagner, </em>the court rejected the defendant\u2019s challenge to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We recently considered the holdings in those cases in determining whether, pursuant to the Oregon Constitution, \u201csubcategory facts\u201d must be found by the grand jury. We held that, because they related only to sentencing, subcategory facts need not be submitted to the grand jury, specifically stating that \u201c[t]he Oregon Constitution does not require that a grand jury find facts that pertain only to sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>237 Or App 377, 383, 240 P3d 731 (2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching that conclusion, we observed that \u201ca fact that pertains only to sentencing is not a \u2018matter that is essential to show that an offense has been committed * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383-84 (quoting <em>State v. Wimber, </em>315 Or 103, 114, 843 P2d 424 (1992)) (omission in original). We further noted that the Oregon Supreme Court had already clearly held \u201cin <em>Wagner, </em>[and] reaffirmed in <em>Johnson, [State v. Terry, </em>333 Or 163, 37 P3d 157 (2001), <em>cert den, </em>536 US 910 (2002)], and <em>[State v. Moen, </em>309 Or 45, 786 P2d 111 (1990)], that <em>there is no requirement that facts that pertain only to sentencing be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>pleaded in the indictment[.T Williams, </em>237 Or App at 384 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Given the holdings in those cases, the Oregon Constitution does not require that enhancement factors be set forth in the indictment. The establishment of enhancement facts is pertinent only to sentencing \u2014 making defendant eligible for a harsher sentence than could be imposed were those facts not present. They do not, however, relate to the determination of whether a defendant committed the underlying criminal offense. And because enhancement factors pertain only to sentencing, they need not be found by the grand jury or pleaded in the indictment under the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s assertion that ORS 136.765(2) impermissibly permits enhancement factors to be submitted to the jury where the notice of the state\u2019s intent to rely on those factors has never been filed in the court record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, that subsection allows for the state to provide notice of its intent to rely on an enhancement fact by merely \u201cproviding written notice to the defendant of the enhancement fact and the state\u2019s intention to rely on it.\u201d Notably, it does not require that the notice be filed with the court. Defendant first makes a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument \u2014 that the failure to file a pleading alleging those enhancement factors with the court deprives the court of jurisdiction over them\u2014 which we reject without discussion. He also asserts that ORS 136.765(2) violates Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides that \u201c[n]o court shall be secret, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>but justice shall be administered, openly and without purchase, completely and without delay * * However, he failed to raise that issue before the trial court and, therefore, we do not address it. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45 (requiring preservation).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Finally, defendant contends that the Oregon and United States constitutions require judicial oversight over the prosecutor\u2019s decision to rely on enhancement facts. He contends that Article VII (Amended), section 5, requires that enhancement facts be formally presented to the court in a pleading and that <em>\u201ca </em>grand jury system, or a magistrate review system, or some other check on prosecutorial [use of enhancement factors] is necessary to satisfy Fourteenth Amendment due process concerns.\u201d We are not persuaded by those assertions and, accordingly, we reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not err in permitting the jury to consider the sentence enhancement facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> As both parties note, the Oregon Supreme Court concluded in <em>State v. Sawatzky, </em>339 Or 689, 698, 125 P3d 722 (2005), that the federal constitution does not require the state to allege aggravating or enhancing factors in the indictment, notwithstanding Blakely and <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\"> We concluded in <em>Williams </em>that the addition of subcategory facts to an indictment is not a \u201csubstantive\u201d amendment pursuant to Article VII (Amended), section 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> Our conclusion that the Oregon Constitution does not require that enhancement facts he set forth in the indictment is confirmed in light of the arguments that were before the court in <em>Johnson. </em>In that case, the defendant raised substantially similar arguments to those at issue here: that the facts that would make him eligible for the death penalty were \u201celements\u201d pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>and that, pursuant to Article I, section 11, and Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution, they must be alleged in the indictment. Defendant\u2019s Brief at 177-90, <em>State v. </em>Johnson, 340 Or 319, 131 P3d 173 (2006) (No S48826); <em>see also </em>State\u2019s Brief at 209-25, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>340 Or 319, 131 P3d 173 (2006) (No S48826). The Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s assertions, and, as noted, held that, although those facts increased the punishment for which the defendant was eligible and, therefore, had to be tried to a jury, the state was not required to set them out in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 352.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Defendant does not contend that the state\u2019s notice failed to comply with the requirements of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
