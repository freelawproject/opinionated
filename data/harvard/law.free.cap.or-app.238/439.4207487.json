In March 2008, the county adopted an ordinance that enacted the zone and comprehensive plan map amendments and related development approvals needed to facilitate the projects. Petitioners, various organizations and individuals opposed to the amendments and approvals, appealed the ordinance to the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) on a number of grounds. LUBA sustained two of the assignments of error, remanding the ordinance to the county for further findings on the application of three comprehensive plan policies that were approval standards for the requested rezonings. <em>Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop County, </em>58 Or LUBA 190 (2009) <em>(Bradwood I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On remand, the county readopted the ordinance with supplemental findings. After another appeal by petitioners, LUBA determined that the county again misconstrued the meaning of the plan policies and remanded the rezonings to the county for further deliberations. <em>Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop </em>County, _ Or LUBA _ (LUBA No. 2009-100, Apr 12, 2010) <em>(Bradwood II). </em>Intervenors seek review of LUBA\u2019s opinion and order in <em>Bradwood II, </em>contending that LUBA erred in its construction of the plan policies and in failing to defer to the county\u2019s interpretation of those policies under ORS 197.829. We review whether the LUBA order is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d under ORS 197.850(9)(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The proposed development is described in <em>Bradwood I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201cThe proposed site is located approximately 20 miles east of the City of Astoria at the former mill site and company town of Bradwood. The subject property consists of nine parcels totaling 411 acres with over a mile of frontage on the Columbia River. The subject property has upland forested areas and lowlands consisting mostly of estuarine shore lands and wetlands that adjoin the Columbia river where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the proposed terminal would be located. The only structures currently on the property are an abandoned pole barn and a small concrete building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cThe proposed terminal site is 38 river miles from the Pacific Ocean and lies at the junction of the main channel of the Columbia River and Clifton Channel, a large side channel navigable by small watercraft. The proposal calls for large, ocean-going vessels to transport LNG to the terminal, where the LNG will be temporarily stored and then re-gasified before being sent out by pipeline. The proposed underground pipeline would extend south and east from the terminal for 36 miles and thence under the Columbia River to connect with an interstate natural gas pipeline near Longview, Washington. The first six miles of underground pipeline would be in Clatsop County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201cThe proposed development involves a variety of land uses and activities and the county\u2019s decision includes numerous comprehensive plan amendments, zone changes, and development approvals that include: a bridge replacement, concrete batch plants, a construction worker park- and-ride facility, dredging of the Columbia River and disposal of the dredged materials, power lines, in-water facilities, storage and staging areas, LNG storage tanks and gasification plant, underground pipeline, railroad realignment, and road improvements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">58 Or LUBA at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As part of the terminal project, intervenors propose to dredge 46.4 acres in the Clifton Channel of the Columbia River to provide a turning basin for large container ships. Intervenors applied to amend the Clatsop County Comprehensive Plan (CCCP) designation for this area from \u201cConservation \u2014 Other Resource\u201d to \u201cDevelopment\u201d and to change its zoning from \u201cAC-2 (Aquatic Conservation-2)\u201d to \u201cAD (Aquatic Development).\u201d The current AC-2 zoning does not allow dredging, except in limited circumstances not applicable in this case. Intervenors also sought zone changes and comprehensive plan amendments in three areas on the shoreland from \u201cnatural\u201d to \u201cdevelopment\u201d designations to allow deposit of dredging spoils and construction of facilities related to the terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The project site consists, in part, of estuarine shoreland adjacent to the Columbia River and is part of the Columbia River Estuary planning area identified in the CCCP. <em>See Bradwood </em>II, _ Or LUBA at _ (slip op at 15). Statewide Planning Goal 16 (Estuarine Resources), OAR 660-015-0010(1), sets out policies for the regulation of development that affects estuaries. Statewide Planning Goal 17 (Coastal Shorelands), OAR 660-015-0010(2), contains related policies for the regulation of shorelands adjacent to estuaries. The CCCP implements those statewide planning goals in its section setting out the Columbia River Estuary Land and Water Use Plan. ORS 197.175(2)(a) requires counties to adopt comprehensive plans \u201cin compliance with goals approved by [the Land Conservation and Development Commission].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Under Clatsop County Land and Water Development and Use Ordinance (LWDUO) 5.412(1), a proposed zone change must be determined to be consistent with comprehensive plan policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over the course of the proceedings, the issues have narrowed to whether the proposed zone changes comply with two sets of plan policies: (1) a group of policies that limit development \u201cat Bradwood\u201d to that which is \u201csmall or moderate\u201d in scale; and (2) two policies that \u201cprotect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201ctraditional fishing areas\u201d from \u201cdredging * * * [and] other potentially disruptive activities\u201d and \u201c[e]ndangered or threatened species habitat * * * from incompatible development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">This case involves LUBA\u2019s review of the county\u2019s interpretation of those plan policies. In that kind of case, whether the LUBA order is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d depends, in the first instance, on whether LUBA failed to properly defer to the county\u2019s interpretation of its own policies under ORS 197.829. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201c(1) The Land Use Board of Appeals shall affirm a local government\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan and land use regulations, unless the board determines that the local government\u2019s interpretation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201c(a) Is inconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201c(b) Is inconsistent with the purpose for the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201c(c) Is inconsistent with the underlying policy that provides the basis for the comprehensive plan or land use regulation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">\u201c(d) Is contrary to a state statute, land use goal or rule that the comprehensive plan provision or land use regulation implements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Much of the dispute between the parties about the county\u2019s interpretation of its policies concerns whether that interpretation was \u201cinconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan\u201d under ORS 197.829(1)(a). We described the application of ORS 197.829(1)(a) in <em>Western Land &amp; Cattle, Inc. v. Umatilla County, </em>230 Or App 202, 209-10, 214 P3d 68 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">\u201cThus, under ORS 197.829, the rules of deference parallel some, but not all, rules of construction used in determining the meaning of an ordinance. Under the statute, if deference is owed to the locality\u2019s interpretation of its plan or regulation, then that interpretation must be affirmed. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>deference is not owed, LUBA can reverse that interpretation if it is inconsistent with the legislative intent in enacting the provision as revealed by the application of rules of statutory construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\u00ab\u00ed|\u00ed <em>% </em>\u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201cWhether a local government\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan or land use regulation is \u2018inconsistent with the express language\u2019 of the plan or regulation under ORS 197.829(l)(a) \u2018depends on whether the interpretation is plausible, given the interpretive principles that ordinarily apply to the construction of ordinances under the rules of <em>PGE </em>[v. <em>Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 <em>(1993)].\u2019 Foland v. Jackson County, </em>215 Or App 157, 164, 168 P3d 1238, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 690 (2007). Put another way, the \u2018consistency with the express language\u2019 inquiry looks at the text of the plan provision or the regulation in question, as well as the context of other parts of the plan or regulation that are relevant to the textual meaning of that \u2018express language.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThus, the reference in ORS 197.829(1) to \u2018express language\u2019 requires the application of constructional rules related to the text of an ordinance. Therefore, in determining whether a local government\u2019s interpretation of its land use plan or regulation is \u2018inconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation\u2019 under ORS 197.829(1)(a), we apply the statutory construction principles in ORS 174.010 and ORS 174.020(2) that are based on the \u2018express language\u2019 of a provision. Although those statutes are written to pertain to \u2018the construction of a statute,\u2019 we use them as well in the interpretation of local ordinances. <em>Ramirez v. Hawaii T &amp; S Enterprises, Inc., </em>179 Or App 416, 425, 39 P3d 931 (2002). We also apply other textual canons of construction in evaluating a local government\u2019s interpretation of its plan or regulation under ORS 197.829(1)(a). Those canons include some rules applied in \u2018first level\u2019 <em>PGE </em>analysis, such as giving words of common usage their \u2018plain, natural, and ordinary meaning\u2019 and recognizing that \u2018use of the same term throughout a statute indicates that the term has the same meaning throughout the statute.\u2019 <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">(Footnotes omitted.) <em>See also Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>231 Or App 585, 598-99, 220 P3d 427 (2009), <em>rev allowed, </em>348 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>19 (2010) (ORS 197.829 requires LUBA to defer to a local government\u2019s plausible interpretation of its ordinances). We turn, then, to LUBA\u2019s determinations on the relevant plan policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">A. <em>Comprehensive Plan Limitations on the Scale of Development</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Columbia River Estuary Land and Water Use Plan in the CCCP demarcates several Columbia River estuary planning subareas and sets out a plan for each of those subareas. The policies in each of those plans are \u201cdesigned to provide local government officials, planners, and other plan users with the background information needed to evaluate development proposals\u201d within the subarea.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The Bradwood subarea is a designated subarea and includes the property that intervenors seek to develop. The subarea is described in the CCCP as \u201cthe industrial area at Bradwood, a stretch of steep forested shoreline to the east, and portions of the Columbia River.\u201d The Bradwood subarea plan states that the \u201cBradwood industrial site offers limited potential for small to medium sized water-dependent industrial development.\u201d The subarea plan then provides that \u201c[fluture development which would require excessive filling (impacting aquatic areas in excess of 20 acres) along the Columbia River shoreline for the purpose of creating additional industrial land is not appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">That \u201csmall to medium sized water-dependent industrial development\u201d limitation is echoed in another sub-plan that is part of the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. The CCCP incorporates the Northeast Community Plan (NCP) that regulates land in the northern part of the county, east of Astoria. As incorporated into the applicable version of the CCCP, the NCP states a policy that petitioners contend precludes the approval of the rezonings \u2014 that \u201c[development activities at Bradwood shall be of small or moderate scale, not involving extensive filling to create new land areas.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>NCP contains a related finding that the \u201cBradwood industrial site is not currently used but offers excellent potential for small to medium size water dependent development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In the initial justification for the plan/zone changes, the county concluded that the proposed LNG development was \u201cof small or moderate scale\u201d because it did not require more than 20 acres of fill and because the 40-acre development on the uplands around the proposed LNG storage tanks and gasification plant was less than 100 acres, which the county concluded was the standard for measuring whether development was \u201clarge\u201d and not \u201csmall or moderate\u201d in scale. In <em>Bradwood I, </em>LUBA held that the county erred in deciding that the scale of a development could be determined by the amount of fill alone and that the county needed to provide further justification that the proposed development activities were \u201csmall to moderate in scale\u201d under the sub-plan standards. LUBA held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cThe focus of the scale limitation is \u2018development activities,\u2019 which presumably encompasses more than construction of buildings. The county apparently viewed the scope of the proposed \u2018development\u2019 to include only the 40 upland acres covered by the LNG facility itself. The county declined to consider the area needed for accessory uses such as power-lines, gas pipelines, or the 58 [sic] acres of estuary that would be dredged for the ship turning basin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cThe LWDUO defines \u2018development\u2019 as \u2018[a]ny man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to: construction, reconstruction, conversion, relocation or enlargement of any structure; any mining, excavation, landfill or land disturbance, any use or extension of the use of land.\u2019 That term would clearly encompass construction of powerlines and gas pipelines. It is less clear that it would encompass dredging of the estuary, although it would presumably include the pilings and other structures necessary to offload the LNG container ships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cGiven that the county erred in its primary conclusion that the scale restriction is a mere restatement of the fill limitation, and because the county erred in limiting the scope of\u2018development activities\u2019 to the upland acres covered by the LNG facility itself, we conclude that remand is necessary for the county to re-evaluate whether the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>development activities, considered as a whole, comply with the \u2018small or moderate\u2019 scale limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><em>Bradwood I, </em>58 Or LUBA at 231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On remand, the county reaffirmed that \u201clarge scale industrial development is that where the developed industrial site occupies more than 100 acres of land\u201d and that a \u201csmall or moderate [in] scale\u201d development is less than that size. In determining whether the \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood\u201d were less than 100 acres in size, the county addressed the meaning of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d and \u201cat Bradwood\u201d under the CCCP standard. LUBA summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cThe county concluded that the proposed dredging of 46 acres of river channel adjacent to the former mill site is not \u2018development activity\u2019 \u2018at Bradwood\u2019 for purposes of the CCCP limitation and in any case is not \u2018development\u2019 within the LWDUO definition, so that the 46 acres proposed to be dredged need not be included in the total acreage proposed for \u2018development.\u2019 * * * The county also concluded that \u2018[a]reas occupied during construction of a facility such as temporary construction easements for pipelines are not permanently occupied and are not part of the 100 acres.\u2019 * * * Based on those conclusions, the county concluded that the sum total of the acreage intervenors proposed to develop at Bradwood was just over 50 acres, which includes the 40 acres that will be permanently developed with the LNG facility at the former mill site, and \u2018inwater structures,\u2019 presumably referring to the pilings that must be installed in the Clifton Channel. The 40 acres used to calculate development activity at the former mill site apparently does not include approximately 30 acres of land that will be temporarily disturbed during construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201cThe county also made alternative calculations that took into account the 17.8 acres of powerline right of way within the entire county and the 6.2 miles of pipeline proposed to be developed within the entire county, albeit factoring in a 30-foot wide permanent easement rather than a 100-foot construction easement for pipeline construction, and concluded that even a conservative estimate of the total acreage of development yielded 80.4 acres, still less than the 100-acre threshold the county identified as exceeding \u2018small to moderate\u2019 development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201cFinally, the county calculated in the alternative than even considering the portion of the pipeline located on what the county termed \u2018Bradwood Landing Controlled Property,\u2019 and considering a 100-foot pipeline easement for construction, the total amount of acreage proposed for development activity was still less than 100 acres.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><em>Bradwood, </em>II, _ Or LUBA at _ (slip op at 6-7) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In their petition for review to LUBA, petitioners contended that the county erred in concluding that (1) the \u201cof small or moderate scale\u201d standard meant less than 100 acres in all cases and (2) the \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood\u201d area that is relevant to the application of the scale standard should not include areas occupied during construction, the dredging area, and onsite and offsite pipeline easement areas. LUBA concluded that it was obliged to defer to the county\u2019s construction of the \u201cof small or moderate scale\u201d standard because it was a plausible meaning of the provision, relying on <em>Siporen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">However, LUBA determined that the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood\u201d was implausible. Petitioners argued that \u201cdevelopment activities,\u201d as used in the plan policy, meant \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d as defined in the comprehensive plan provisions relating to Goal 16. Under the CCCP discussion in Goal 16 of \u201cdevelopment or use,\u201d an \u201cactivity\u201d is \u201cany action taken either in conjunction with a use or to make a use possible. * * * Several activities \u2014 dredging, piling, fill \u2014 may be undertaken for a single use \u2014 a port facility.\u201d According to LUBA, the area disturbed by construction activity for the project within the Bradwood subarea, as well as the area in the Clifton Channel that is proposed to be dredged, was \u201cdevelopment activity\u201d as defined by Goal 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Even under the less contextually relevant definition of \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the LWDUO, LUBA reasoned that the same result obtains. LWDUO 1.030 defines \u201cdevelopment\u201d to include \u201cconstruction * * * [and] land disturbance.\u201d LUBA further reasoned that \u201cat Bradwood\u201d meant the entire Bradwood subarea, including the adjacent portion of the Columbia River. It noted that the county\u2019s position that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>land development is constrained by the policy is inconsistent with the county\u2019s findings that inwater docking structures within the Clifton Channel were included as part of \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood.\u201d LUBA remanded the decision for a recalculation of the amount of acreage for \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood\u201d that is subject to the \u201cof small or moderate scale\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">B. <em>Comprehensive Plan Resource Protection Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Various parts of the Columbia River Estuary Land and Water Use Plan section of the CCCP set out required resource protections for the entire estuary. Section P20.2, relating to \u201cAquaculture and Fisheries,\u201d lists policies that \u201capply to all projects that could conceivably affect fisheries (either commercial or recreational) or aquaculture in the Columbia River Estuary.\u201d Policy 20.2(1) requires that \u201c[traditional fishing areas shall be protected when dredging, filling, pile driving or when other potentially disruptive in-water activities occur.\u201d The area proposed to be rezoned to AD and dredged for a channel, turning basin, and docking facility is located in a \u201ctraditional fishing area,\u201d the Clifton Channel of the Columbia River.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In addition, Section P20.8, entitled \u201cFish and Wildlife Habitat,\u201d applies \u201cto uses and activities with potential adverse impacts on fish or wildlife habitat, both in Columbia River estuarine aquatic areas and in estuarine shorelands.\u201d Policy 20.8(1) provides that \u201c[e]ndangered or threatened species habitat shall be protected from incompatible development.\u201d Habitat for threatened and endangered species of salmonids, Columbia white tailed deer, stellar sea lions, marbled murrelet, and northern spotted owl is present in the rezoning areas, and a wildlife refuge is located close to the industrial site.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In its initial justification of the zone changes, the county used a legal dictionary definition of \u201cprotect\u201d in evaluating compliance with those policies. In <em>Bradwood I, </em>LUBA held that the relevant meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d in the plan policies was the definition of \u201cprotect\u201d used in the statewide planning goals. 58 Or LUBA at 219. As defined under the statewide planning goals, \u201cprotect\u201d means to \u201c[s]ave or shield from loss, destruction, or injury or for future intended use.\u201d <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>at 218. LUBA concluded that \u201cthe term \u2018protect\u2019 as used in CCCP Policy 20.2(1) and CCCP Policy 20.8, which implement Goal[s] 16 and 17, is intended to have the same meaning [as it has under the goals].\u201d <em>Bradwood I, </em>58 Or LUBA at 218-19. Accordingly, the board remanded the decision to the county \u201cto apply the statewide planning goal definition of\u2018protect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">On remand, the county interpreted the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d as defined in the statewide planning goals, and as used in CCCP Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201c \u2018Protect\u2019 as defined by LCDC and as used by the County and acknowledged by LCDC in the County planning documents does not require that absolutely no disturbance occurs. Protection is provided by avoiding those areas to the extent possible and making development sensitive to the environment where it does in fact occur, so that estuarine and coastal shoreline values are maintained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Based on that understanding of the meaning of \u201cprotect,\u201d the county adopted findings that the proposed zone changes were consistent with Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8 because the imposed limitations on dredging and disposal of dredged materials and other mitigation measures shielded traditional fishing areas and wildlife habitat from substantial adverse effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On review in <em>Bradwood II, </em>LUBA found that that meaning of \u201cprotect,\u201d within the context of plan policies that implement Goal 16, was too lax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201cAlthough we agree with the county that the Goal definition of \u2018protect\u2019 does not require that estuarine resources identified for protection be completely or absolutely protected from any \u2018loss, destruction, or injury\u2019 whatsoever, the county has made a planning decision under the CCCP policies at issue that implement Goal 16 and the scheme set forth in the second paragraph of Goal 16, quoted above, to \u2018protect\u2019 as opposed to a decision to \u2018maintain,\u2019 \u2018develop,\u2019 or \u2018restore\u2019 traditional fishing areas and endangered or threatened species habitat. Having made that \u2018protect\u2019 planning decision, the local program to protect those estuarine resources must not allow \u2018loss, destruction, or injury\u2019 beyond a <em>de minimis </em>level. Thus, the development that is to be allowed by the disputed rezone is not consistent with the Goal definition of\u2018protect\u2019 unless the measures proposed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>seeking to rezone the property are sufficient to reduce harm to such a degree that there is at most a <em>de minimis </em>or insignificant impact on the resources that those policies require to be protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">_Or LUBA at_(slip op at 18). LUBA also rejected the county\u2019s arguments that (1) the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d under Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8 could be determined by how \u201cprotect\u201d is used in other parts of the plan, as well as in the LWDUO and other ordinances, and (2) findings on the protection of \u201cestuarine values,\u201d as a whole, were sufficient to satisfy the directives of Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8. Board Member Holstun summarized in his concurring opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u201cThe county\u2019s decision spends a good bit of time trying to reformulate its legal obligation under CCCP Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8 to \u2018protect\u2019 those resources as necessarily being satisfied by (1) simply applying existing acknowledged regulations that the county has adopted to protect estuarine resources, (2) showing that the estuary will be protected if the estuary is viewed as a whole, (3) mitigating any damage to those protected resources, (4) attempting to avoid damage to those protected resources, or (5) intending to avoid damage to those protected resources. I agree with the majority that those reformulations represent a misunderstanding of the county\u2019s legal obligation to protect the identified resources under Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Bradwood II, </em>_ Or LUBA at _ (Holstun, Board Member, concurring) (slip op at 31) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z\">A. <em>Scale of Development</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">On review, intervenors challenge LUBA\u2019s decision as to both the scale of the development arid resource protection policies. We take each argument in turn. Intervenors argue that LUBA failed to give proper deference to the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood.\u201d Intervenors initially assert that \u201cat Bradwood\u201d was properly interpreted to mean the shoreland area zoned for industrial use in the Bradwood subarea, rather than a larger area that includes other land in the subarea and under the river. We agree that it is plausible to interpret \u201cat Bradwood\u201d in the NCP to mean the \u201cBradwood industrial site\u201d referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>elsewhere in that plan; we also agree that the geographic definition of the Bradwood subarea in a different plan may not be relevant context for the NCP provision. The difficulty with the county and intervenors\u2019 more narrow construction of the meaning of \u201cat Bradwood\u201d is that it is inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s decision in <em>Bradwood I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In <em>Bradwood I, </em>LUBA remanded for more specific findings on the meaning of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cdevelopment activities at Bradwood.\u201d The county had argued that \u201cdevelopment\u201d covered only \u201cthe 40 upland acres covered by the LNG facility itself.\u201d 58 Or LUBA at 231. LUBA held that \u201cthe county erred in limiting the scope of \u2018development activities\u2019 to the upland acres covered by the LNG facility itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>LUBA concluded that a larger area was restricted by the policy and remanded to determine whether pipelines, docking structures and dredging areas outside the industrial site but within the Bradwood subarea were \u201cdevelopment activities.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As we have explained before,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201c[t]he Supreme Court has held that issues that LUBA decided in earlier proceedings, and upon which judicial review was not sought, are not subject to judicial review of a subsequent LUBA order. <em>Beck v.

Thus, when LUBA remands a case for further proceedings, the parties are limited to \u2018new, unresolved issues\u2019 relating to those remand instructions and cannot raise any \u2018issues that LUBA affirmed or reversed on their merits.\u2019 Id. at 153.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>Friends of the Metolius v.

City of Jacksonville, </em>113 Or App 675, 679-81, 835 P2d 923 (1992) (discussing <em>Beck). </em>The more narrow meaning of \u201cat Bradwood\u201d advanced by the county in its remand findings is inconsistent with the decision and remand instructions given by LUBA in <em>Bradwood I. </em>For that reason, LUBA did not err in failing to defer to the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cat Bradwood\u201d in the remand findings and in holding to its more expansive construction of that term. That construction of the meaning of \u201cat Bradwood\u201d as including the larger Bradwood subarea and adjacent estuary was not unlawful in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Intervenors next complain that LUBA erred in not deferring to the county\u2019s interpretation of the acreage of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d as not including land temporarily disturbed by construction of the proposed facilities and pipelines or the dredging area. We agree with LUBA that the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d is \u201cinconsistent -with the express language\u201d of the plan policy under ORS 197.829(l)(a) in light of the contextual definitions of \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the LWDUO and \u201cactivities\u201d in the CCCP. The CCCP defines \u201cactivity\u201d to include \u201cany action taken either in conjunction with a use or to make a use possible,\u201d including \u201cdredging, piling, [and] fill.\u201d The disturbance of land \u201cto make a use possible\u201d is plainly within the meaning of \u201cactivity.\u201d Even more pointedly, \u201cdevelopment\u201d is defined by the LWDUO as \u201c[a]ny man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to: construction, reconstruction, conversion, relocation or enlargement of any structure; any mining, excavation, landfill or land disturbance, any use or extension of the use of land.\u201d \u201cDevelopment\u201d includes, then, a change to real estate that occurs as part of \u201cconstruction * * * of any structure\u201d or \u201cexcavation.\u201d That plainly includes land disturbed as part of the construction of structures and land that is excavated by dredging.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We agree with LUBA that the county\u2019s reliance on the definition of \u201creal estate\u201d in an administrative rule on certification of real estate appraisers was not relevant context to the meaning of \u201creal estate\u201d as used in its code definition of \u201cdevelopment.\u201d We also conclude that LUBA did not err in failing to address the county\u2019s findings on an alternative meaning of \u201csmall or moderate in scale.\u201d That alternative meaning (whether the project was large in comparison with other industrial developments) was beyond the scope of the remand in <em>Bradwood I </em>(whether the acreage of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d exceeded the 100-acre standard established by the county). Thus, LUBA did not err in failing to defer to the county\u2019s interpretation of \u201cdevelopment activities\u201d and LUBA\u2019s own construction of the term was not unlawful in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>B. <em>Resource Protection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Intervenors next assert that LUBA erred in remanding the decision because the county failed to adopt findings showing that it would \u201cprotect\u201d traditional fishing areas and wildlife habitats from the effects of the planned dredging and related development. Intervenors claim that (1) petitioners failed to appeal some of the findings on compliance with the protection policies, and the adoption of those findings required LUBA to affirm the county\u2019s decision on the protection policies; (2) the contextual meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d in the CCCP is revealed by acknowledged county ordinances and that meaning is less rigorous than the <em>de minimis </em>harm standard adopted by LUBA; and (3) the <em>de minimis </em>harm standard is inconsistent with the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d as used in Goal 16. Petitioners respond that (1) their appeal to LUBA did contest the county\u2019s determination that the protection policies were satisfied by mitigation efforts and that LUBA properly rejected that construction of the policies; (2) the acknowledged county policies on dredging and estuary development do not provide relevant context to the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d; and (3) LUBA\u2019s construction of the word \u201cprotect\u201d was properly informed by the context of Goal 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Intervenors\u2019 first argument is that the county made alternative findings that justified the rezonings \u2014 findings that \u201cbalanced\u201d the protective policies with other plan policies promoting or limiting development; petitioners did not dispute that adopted rationale before LUBA; and so, LUBA erred in failing to affirm the county decision based on those alternative findings. LUBA is obliged to affirm a local government land use decision when the decision is justified on alternative bases and only one basis is challenged on appeal. <em>See Hard Rock Enterprises v. Washington </em>County, 36 Or LUBA 106, 119 (1999) (\u201cWhere a local government\u2019s approval rests on independent alternative grounds, petitioner must successfully challenge each of those alternative grounds in order to obtain reversal or remand of the decision, notwithstanding that petitioner demonstrates error in one of the alternative bases.\u201d); <em>cf. State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Parmentier, </em>203 Or App 677, 682, 127 P3d 652, <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 359 (2006) (\u201c[A]s a practical and legal matter, it makes no sense to advance substantial arguments challenging one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>basis for termination [of parental rights] where any consideration of those arguments will necessarily be precluded by the failure to assign error to the alternative ground for termination.\u201d); <em>State v. Stoudamire, </em>198 Or App 399, 403, 108 P3d 615 (2005) (Armstrong, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that, when a trial court bases a decision on multiple grounds, an appellant may prevail on appeal only after demonstrating that <em>all </em>of the bases for the court\u2019s decision were erroneous.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>Roop v. Parker Northwest Paving Co., </em>194 Or App 219, 236, 94 P3d 885 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 374 (2005) (\u201c[W]here plaintiffs fail to challenge the alternative basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we must affirm it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">However, we conclude that the county\u2019s \u201cbalancing\u201d findings are not an independent justification that the rezon-ings are consistent with the protection policies. Rather, those findings are nothing more than a restatement of the county\u2019s assertion that the protection policies should be construed in the context of other, less demanding, plan policies to allow significant adverse impacts by the dredging and related development on the protected areas. That position was attacked by petitioners in their appeal of the remanded decision to LUBA and was rejected by the board in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Again, LWDUO 5.412(1) requires that rezonings be \u201cconsistent with the policies of the Clatsop County Comprehensive Plan.\u201d In its findings on remand, the county reasoned that, even if rezonings were inconsistent with the individual protective policies, the plan consistency standard required a \u201cbalancing\u201d of relevant plan policies and that, on balance, the standard was met.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The adopted findings cite various policies that encourage development of shorelands with deep water access, require compatibility of industrial development with fishing, require development to \u201cminimize adverse environmental and aesthetic impacts,\u201d and regulate disposal of dredged materials. The findings then conclude that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201c[t]hese policies considered together and balanced are consistent with the LCDC definition of \u2018protect,\u2019 and the Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>does not require a showing that threatened and endangered species habitat or that traditional fishing areas will not be affected in any way or incur any loss, but rather promotes sensitive development that results in compatible development.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">On review, intervenors argue that the case law allows a balancing of approval standards for a land use decision so as to allow approval when most of the standards are met. We conclude that the adopted findings overstate the \u201cbalancing\u201d principle that can be used in the construction and application of local land use ordinances. We have held that a locality may need to reconcile facially inconsistent provisions of its land use regulations in making a land use decision. That was the case in <em>Waker Associates, Inc. v. Clackamas County, </em>111 Or App 189, 193-94, 826 P2d 20 (1992). There, a county ordinance conditionally allowed golf courses in areas zoned for agricultural uses, subject to a showing of plan consistency. The plan policies both promoted and precluded golf courses. Application of the plan policies that would have precluded golf courses would negate the zoning provision allowing those conditional uses. We held that a balancing of those plan policies was \u201cnecessary in county actions on conditional use applications\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201cIt follows that county decision-makers will often be confronted with situations, like this one, where a use is compatible with some of the goals and incompatible with others. It is not possible to approve or disapprove a use in those situations without engaging in a balancing exercise. Although the effect on and consistency of a proposed use with each of the goals must be considered, the weight to be given a goal and the magnitude of the effects that particular proposed uses will have on the values that different goals protect will inevitably vary from case to case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">A county, however, is not free to disregard a standard that precludes approval of a land use application merely because other standards favor, but do not compel, its allowance. In that case, it <em>is </em>\u201cpossible to approve or disapprove a use * * * without engaging in a balancing exercise.\u201d It is only when the standards themselves are incompatible in operation \u2014 by requiring both approval and disapproval of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>any generic application \u2014 that an overarching reconciliation of clashing standards is necessary. Intervenors do not argue, and the county did not find, that <em>all </em>industrial development of the Bradwood area would be precluded by application of the protection policies. In this case, the plan policies that generally support industrial development of the Bradwood area or that work to minimize environmental impacts of development in general are not facially inconsistent with policies that protect traditional fishing areas and wildlife habitats from particular developmental impacts. As such, the policies need no balancing in their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Thus, the county\u2019s \u201cbalancing\u201d justification is not an alternative route to an approval conclusion. Rather, it proceeds on the same path to the county\u2019s core conclusion \u2014 that the protection policies themselves should be interpreted to allow some significant adverse impacts on traditional fishing areas and wildlife habitats by the development facilitated by the rezonings. That is how the county framed its conclusion (\u201c[t]hese policies considered together and balanced are consistent with the LCBC definition of \u2018protect\u2019 \u201d as used in Policies 20.2(1) and 20.8). Petitioners attacked that conclusion \u2014 the determined meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d in the protection policies \u2014 in their briefing below. LUBA decided that the county\u2019s construction of the policies was inconsistent with the LCBC definition of \u201cprotect.\u201d Thus, LUBA adequately addressed the county\u2019s balancing findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Intervenors next argue that the county\u2019s plan and implementing ordinances have been acknowledged as consistent with Goals 16 and 17; the county found that the decision under review complies with certain mitigation provisions in the plan and ordinances that implement those goals by limiting development; and therefore, the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d in the protective policies should be interpreted in much the same way \u2014 as requiring measures to mitigate, rather than prevent, harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The problem with intervenors\u2019 contention is that they once again seek to relitigate the outcome reached in <em>Bradwood I. </em>LUBA held in <em>Bradwood I </em>that \u201cthe term \u2018protect\u2019 as used in CCCP Policy 20.2(1) and CCCP Policy 20.8 * * * is intended to have the same meaning [as it has under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the goals]\u201d and remanded the case to the county \u201cto apply the statewide planning goal definition of\u2018protect.\u2019 \u201d 58 Or LUBA at 218-19. That holding may or may not have been correct\u2014 either in not giving appropriate deference to the county\u2019s interpretation of its own comprehensive plan under ORS 197.829 or in not construing the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d contextually in light of other, related plan and ordinance provisions. It was, however, the determination in the first go-around of this case, and in the absence of an appeal from that decision, the county was limited to \u201cnew, unresolved issues\u201d relating to the remand instructions in further proceedings. <em>See Beck, </em>313 Or at 153. Thus, the county was obliged to apply the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d as used in Goals 16 and 17 and not the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d derived from related plan or ordinance policies. LUBA did not err in holding the county to its remand direction in <em>Bradwood I.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">More to the point, intervenors argue that LUBA\u2019s construction of the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d as used in Goal 16 (and incorporated into the CCCP protection policies) was inconsistent with the text and context of the term as used in the goal. Intervenors reason that protective measures under the goal can be those that shield or guard the estuary from harm, rather than those that largely immunize the estuary from the effects of the dredging and related development. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Because Goal 16, in some circumstances, operates to allow some conflicting uses to estuarine resources, intervenors contend that \u201cprotect\u201d under Goal 16 means to mitigate against harmful effects, rather than to preclude incompatible development. To assess that contention, we turn to the specific text of Goal 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Goal 16 (Estuarine Resources), OAR 660-015-0010(1), much like the other resource-specific goals, requires an inventorying and classification of the extent and quality of the relevant resource in the planning area and adoption of regulatory measures depending upon the quality of the resource. The stated purpose of the goal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cTo recognize and protect the unique environmental, economic, and social values of each estuary and associated wetlands; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cTo protect, maintain, where appropriate develop, and where appropriate restore the long-term environmental, economic, and social values, diversity and benefits of Oregon\u2019s estuaries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The goal requires classification of estuaries \u201cto specify the most intensive level of development or alteration which may be allowed to occur within each estuary,\u201d and then to \u201cprovide for appropriate uses,\u201d with the caveat that \u201c[ejstuary plans and activities shall protect the estuarine ecosystem, including its natural biological productivity, habitat, diversity, unique features and water quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Under the goal, the classification of estuaries is by \u201cdistinct water use management units.\u201d The types of units include, at a minimum, \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201cconservation,\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d management units. \u201cNatural\u201d management units include \u201cmajor tracts of salt marsh, tideflats, and seagrass and algae beds\u201d and are \u201cdesignated to assure the protection of significant fish and wildlife habitats, of continued biological productivity within the estuary, and of scientific, research, and educational needs.\u201d Generally speaking, only undeveloped or low-impact uses are allowed in natural management units, including \u201cprotection of habitat, nutrient, fish, wildlife, and aesthetic resources.\u201d Certain physical improvements <em>{e.g., </em>tidegates, pipelines, boat ramps) are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>allowed \u201c[w]here consistent with the resource capabilities of the area,\u201d which is defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201cwhen either the impacts of the use on estuarine species, habitats, biological productivity and water quality are not significant or that the resources of the area are able to assimilate the use and activity and their effects and continue to function in a manner to protect significant wildlife habitats, natural biological productivity, and values for scientific research and education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u201cConservation\u201d management units, on the other hand, allow for \u201clong-term uses of renewable resources that do not require major alteration of the estuary, except for the purpose of restoration.\u201d They are managed \u201cto conserve the natural resources and benefits.\u201d Permissible uses \u201c[w]here consistent with the resource capabilities of the area\u201d include \u201c[h]igh-intensity water-dependent recreation\u201d and \u201c[m]ining and mineral extraction, including dredging necessary for mineral extraction.\u201d In a conservation management unit, uses and activities are \u201cconsistent with the resource capabilities of the area\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cwhen either the impacts of the use on estuarine species, habitats, biological productivity, and water quality are not significant or that the resources of the area are able to assimilate the use and activity and their effects and continue to function in a manner which conserves long-term renewable resources, natural biologic productivity, recreational and aesthetic values and aquaculture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Finally, \u201cdevelopment\u201d management units are estuaries designated \u201cfor more intense development or alteration\u201d and include \u201c[n]avigation and water-dependent commercial and industrial uses,\u201d \u201c[d]redge or fill, as allowed elsewhere in the goal,\u201d \u201c[w]ater transport channels where dredging may be necessary,\u201d and other uses \u201c[w]here consistent with the purposes of this management unit and adjacent shorelands.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>As used in the statewide planning goals, \u201cprotect\u201d means to \u201c[s]ave or shield from loss, destruction, or injury or for future intended use.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> LUBA concluded that to \u201cprotect\u201d an estuarine resource, as \u201cprotect\u201d is used in Goal 16, means to regulate or prevent conflicting uses from affecting the resource in a significant way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cGoal 16 requires protection of the environmental, economic, and social values, diversity and benefits of estuaries, and allows estuarine development and restoration only \u2018where appropriate.\u2019 The goal sets out a hierarchy of priorities for management and use of estuarine resources, placing in first priority \u2018[u]ses which maintain the integrity of the estuarine ecosystem.\u2019 Within the remaining text of Goal 16, the word \u2018protect\u2019 appears almost exclusively in the Goal text describing the \u2018natural management unit\u2019 designation. That designation is the most protective classification of Goal 16 resources, and includes \u2018areas * * * designated to assure the <em>protection </em>of significant fish and wildlife habitats * * *.\u2019 The natural management unit allows uses and activities that allow the resources of the estuary to \u2018continue to function in a manner to <em>protect </em>significant wildlife habitats, natural biological productivity, and values for scientific research and education.\u2019 Thus, the most protective classification in Goal 16, the natural management unit designation, allows only activities that are sufficient to protect the identified resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cThe Goal language describing the other designations also provides context for the meaning of \u2018protect.\u2019 The description of the \u2018conservation management unit,\u2019 which is the current management designation of the subject property, does not include the word \u2018protect.\u2019 The description of the \u2018development management unit,\u2019 the proposed designation of the property, also does not use the word \u2018protect.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Taken together, the uses of the word \u2018protect\u2019 within Goal 16 itself indicate that the definition is not equivocal in requiring that identified resources are \u2018saved\u2019 or \u2018shielded\u2019 from more than <em>de minimis </em>damaging impacts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\u201cAlthough we agree with the county that the Goal definition of \u2018protect\u2019 does not require that estuarine resources identified for protection be completely or absolutely protected from any \u2018loss, destruction, or injury\u2019 whatsoever, the county has made a planning decision under the CCCP policies at issue that implement Goal 16 and the scheme set forth in the second paragraph of Goal 16, quoted above, to \u2018protect\u2019 as opposed to a decision to \u2018maintain,\u2019 \u2018develop,\u2019 or \u2018restore\u2019 traditional fishing areas and endangered or threatened species habitat. Having made that \u2018protect\u2019 planning decision, the local program to protect those estuarine resources must not allow \u2018loss, destruction, or injury\u2019 beyond a <em>de minimis </em>level. Thus, the development that is to be allowed by the disputed rezone is not consistent with the Goal definition of\u2018protect\u2019 unless the measures proposed in seeking to rezone the property are sufficient to reduce harm to such a degree that there is at most a <em>de minimis </em>or insignificant impact on the resources that those policies require to be protected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Bradwood II, </em>_ Or LUBA at _ (slip op at 17-18) (emphases in original; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Intervenors complain that LUBA\u2019s construction of \u201cprotect\u201d is inconsistent with the practical operation of Goal 16 to allow development within estuaries and with the particular industrial designation of the Bradwood area. We fail to see the inconsistency. The protection policies apply to particular development, wherever located within an estuary, that could affect fisheries or wildlife habitat. CCCP Section P20.2 states the ambit of Policy 20.2(1), as \u201capplying] to all projects that could conceivably affect fisheries (either commercial or recreational) or aquaculture in the Columbia River Estuary.\u201d Section P20.8 frames the scope of Policy 20.8(1) as applying \u201cto uses and activities with potential adverse impacts on fish or wildlife habitat, both in Columbia River estuarine aquatic areas and in estuarine shorelands.\u201d Thus, the plan expressly provides that the policies apply throughout the estuary, based on the nature of a proposed use or activity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>irrespective of management unit designation or zoning allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Moreover, under Goal 16, the overall classification of an estuary as one in which development is allowed does not inhibit the designation of natural management units within that estuary in order to protect specific land resources. The Land Conservation and Development Commission adopted rules to implement Goal 16 that are codified at OAR chapter 660, division 17. Under those rules, estuaries are classified as \u201cnatural estuaries,\u201d \u201cconservation estuaries,\u201d \u201cshallow-draft development estuaries,\u201d and \u201cdeep-draft development estuaries,\u201d in much the same way as management units of an estuary are classified under Goal 16. <em>See </em>OAR 660-017-0010. The Columbia River is a deep-draft development estuary. OAR 660-017-0015(4). OAR 660-017-0025(3)(b) provides that \u201c[sjhallow and deep-draft development estuaries shall have natural, conservation, and development management units as provided in the Estuarine Resources Goal.\u201d Thus, the overall character of an estuary as suitable for development is not inconsistent with the protection of discrete areas (natural management units) from the effects of particular development. It is consistent with the structure of Goals 16 and 17 in general, and with the plan allowance of industrial uses at Bradwood in particular, that the protection policies might inhibit intervenors\u2019 planned dredging uses and not other types of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We agree with LUBA\u2019s analysis of the meaning of \u201cprotect\u201d under Goal 16. \u201cProtect\u201d is used in the policies relating to natural management units, which are designated, in part, to \u201cassure the protection of significant fish and wildlife habitats.\u201d A use in those units must be \u201cconsistent with the resource capabilities of the area,\u201d which is defined to mean that the impacts of the use are not \u201csignificant\u201d or that significant wildlife habitats can continue to be \u201cprotected].\u201d In other management units, where resource values are conserved or not immunized from development effects, alterations of the estuary that produce significant impacts are allowed. \u201cProtect,\u201d in this context, means more than minimizing the adverse impacts of conflicting development through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>mitigation. It means inhibiting development that causes significant adverse impacts on the protected resource.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We conclude that LUBA did not err in remanding the decision to the county for further consideration of the consistency of the approvals with the standards in the protective policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\"> LWDUO 5.412 requires findings with respect to zone changes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201c(1) The proposed change is consistent with the policies of the Clatsop County Comprehensive Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201c(2) The proposed change is consistent with the statewide planning goals (ORS 197).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">\u201c(3) The property in the affected area will be provided with adequate public facilities and services * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">\u201c(4) The proposed change will insure that an adequate and safe transportation network exists to support the proposed zoning and will not cause undue traffic congestion or hazards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-12\">\u201c(5) The proposed change will not result in over-intensive use of the land, will give reasonable consideration to the character of the area, and will be compatible with the overall zoning pattern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">\u201c(6) The proposed change gives reasonable consideration to peculiar suitability of the property for particular uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-14\">\u201c(7) The proposed change will encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout Clatsop County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-15\">\u201c(8) The proposed change will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of Clatsop County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-16\"><em>See Bradwood I, </em>58 Or LUBA at 217 n 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-8\"> As relied on by the parties and LUBA, we refer to the NCP as incorporated into the version of the CCCP dated May 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> The county stated that, \u201c[although we find no conflict [with Policy 20.8(1)], if a conflict were found here, Clatsop County similarly seeks to balance development with protection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-5\"> Intervenors\u2019 contention that LUBA erred in making factual findings that were not supported by substantial evidence in the county record merits only summary adjudication.
