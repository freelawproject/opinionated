J.</author>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 201 P3d 267 <em>(Williams II), adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>228 Or App 254, 208 P3d 496 <em>(Williams III) </em>(2009), in light of <em>State v. Lennon, </em>348 Or 148, 229 P3d 589 (2010). <em>State v. Williams, </em>348 Or 461, 234 P3d 983 (2010). <em>Williams II </em>was also before us on remand from the Supreme Court <em>Williams III), </em>after that court had vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Williams, </em>207 Or App 645, 142 P3d 552, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 117 (2006) <em>Williams I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). In <em>Williams II, </em>we held that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a departure sentence based on judicial factfinding was plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct that error because we could not say, following <em>Ramirez, </em>that there was \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that defendant had been persistently involved in similar crimes or that he had failed to be deterred by his prior sanctions. <em>Williams II, </em>225 Or App at 331. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d standard). We adhered to that holding on reconsideration in <em>Williams III, </em>228 Or App at 258. Here, however, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s overriding analysis in <em>Lennon, </em>we conclude that the record before us establishes that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would have found that defendant had failed to be deterred by his prior sanctions. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery, and the trial court imposed a departure sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court imposed that sentence on the basis of its finding that defendant had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">\u201cpersistent involvement in similar offenses, in that that [defendant\u2019s prior conviction] was also a robbery. And also, you\u2019ve had persistent involvement in offenses involving weapons, because you have the ex-convict in possession of a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201c* * * j \u00bf0 gn(j substantial and compelling reasons to depart for the reason that you do have persistent involvement in similar offenses, although I clearly note that you have \u2014 prior sanctions have not been effective, and I find that either of those alone is significant and sufficient to provide the aggravator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">As noted, we held in <em>Williams II </em>that the evidence in the record failed to establish that there was \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury would have found the same departure factors identified by the trial court. With regard to the \u201cpersistent involvement\u201d factor, we applied the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007). There, the court held that \u201c \u2018[p]ersistent involvement in similar offenses\u2019 presents a factual issue that * * * a defendant may insist that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the record establishes \u2018[p]er-sistent involvement in similar offenses,\u2019 a sentencing court must do more than find that a defendant has two or more prior convictions for similar offenses. The trier of fact must infer from the number and frequency of those prior convictions whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in those offenses is \u2018persistent\u2019; that is, the trier of fact must determine whether the defendant\u2019s involvement in similar offenses is sufficiently continuous or recurring to say that it is \u2018persistent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\"><em>Id. See Williams II, </em>225 Or App at 328. Applying that analysis to the record in this case, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cAt the sentencing hearing in this case, the evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement in similar offenses consisted of a single prior conviction, in 1990, for second-degree robbery and a single conviction for felon in possession of a firearm that occurred while defendant was on probation for the 1990 offense. That evidence does not persuade us that there is \u2018no legitimate debate\u2019 that the jury would have drawn the inference, from the number and frequency of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">We reached a similar conclusion with regard to the second departure factor identified by the trial court, <em>viz., </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>failure of prior sanctions to deter defendant. In reaching that conclusion, we relied on a line of cases from this court establishing that a determination that a defendant has failed to be deterred \u201c \u2018requires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams II, </em>225 Or App at 330 (quoting <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006)). Following that analysis, we concluded that the evidence the state had presented, \u201calthough significant, was not so overwhelming as to eliminate all legitimate debate as to whether defendant was undeterred by prior sanctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. Although we did not specifically conclude that the trial court could not have drawn the inference that defendant had the \u201cmalevolent quality\u201d required by our case law as synthesized in <em>Allen, </em>our disposition of the case necessarily reflected our conclusion that the evidence in the record did not remove all \u201clegitimate debate\u201d regarding that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">In <em>Lennon, </em>the court rejected our reliance on the \u201cmalevolent quality\u201d factor in determining whether or not a defendant has failed to be deterred by his or her prior sanction and set forth the controlling analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cTo find a failure to deter, the factfinder must infer that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal sanctions should have deterred the defendant from committing the current offense. Whether that inference follows from the defendant\u2019s prior criminal sanctions will depend on such factors as the number of past convictions or sanctions, when they occurred, and the kind of crimes that the defendant committed. A finding that those past criminal sanctions have not deterred a defendant from committing further crimes thus requires something beyond a conclusion that a defendant <em>has </em>one or more criminal convictions in his past. But a finding of a \u2018separate malevolent quality\u2019 <em>is not necessary. </em>If the record supports the factual inference that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions or sanctions should have, but did not, deter the defendant from committing his new offense or offenses, that factual finding can, in a proper case, support a departure sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>348 Or at 157 (first emphasis in original; second emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Thus, under <em>Lennon, </em>the disposi-tive issue is whether a defendant\u2019s prior sanctions <em>should have </em>but <em>did not </em>deter the defendant from committing his or her new offense or offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The Supreme Court provided guidance in <em>Lennon </em>as to how the inquiry into whether a defendant should have been, but was not, deterred by his or her prior sanctions, should be conducted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u201c[T]he record of defendant\u2019s criminal history provides \u2018no legitimate debate\u2019 that prior criminal sanctions have failed to deter defendant from engaging in criminal activity. The presentence report, on which the sentencing court relied, shows that defendant\u2019s criminal history spans two decades, without a significant lapse of time between his criminal activities. He has been convicted of 37 criminal offenses; has received supervision terms in 22 cases, and has violated supervision at least 34 times. His parole and probation record includes over 1,500 entries that detail repeated instances of arrest and incarceration, illegal drug use, restraining order violations, failing to report or keep contact with parole and probation officers, and failing to undergo or complete court-ordered drug treatment. What is more, defendant committed the drug offense in this case while awaiting sentencing on a drug-related conviction for which he had been tried only about two weeks earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 158. Thus, <em>Lennon </em>teaches that, where the record before the trial court contains evidence of pervasive and long-term criminal behavior by the defendant \u2014 whether that behavior has taken the form of subsequent crimes, probation or supervision violations, or failures to comply with the terms of a sentence \u2014 there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would draw the inference that the defendant had failed to be deterred by the prior sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Here, defendant committed his present crimes in 2000. In addition to his prior convictions for robbery in 1990 and felon in possession of a firearm soon thereafter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> according to the prosecutor, the presentence investigation report\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the accuracy of which defendant did not contest \u2014 recited a drug arrest in 1992, an arrest for \u201cattempt to elude\u201d in 1999, a fight in 1999 that did not result in criminal charges, two probation violations following the conviction for \u201cex-convict in possession of a weapon,\u201d and a parole violation resulting in 120 days\u2019 incarceration in 1995, followed by a violation of the same parole later that same year resulting in seven months\u2019 incarceration in a work release center.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">On this record, we conclude that there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a trier of fact would have found that defendant had failed to be deterred by his prior sanctions and that those prior sanctions should have deterred him from committing subsequent crimes. Like the defendant in <em>Lennon, </em>defendant here engaged in a pattern of repeated violations, crimes, and criminal behavior over a lengthy period of time following his conviction for a serious offense \u2014 robbery\u2014in 1990. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> As we explained in <em>Williams II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201cThe record does not reveal the date of defendant\u2019s conviction for felon in possession of a firearm. However, at sentencing, the court stated, \u2018Below the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u201cEx-convict in possession\u201d \u2014 or ex-convict, possession of a weapon, I\u2019m assuming it is. It looks like there was a release date of November 4, 1994.\u2019 It is apparent from that statement that defendant\u2019s prior conviction for felon in possession of a firearm was of a similar vintage to his second-degree robbery conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">225 Or App at 329 n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
