The trial court permitted defendant to represent himself, but it did so without first determining whether defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. During the trial, the court limited defendant\u2019s cross-examination of witnesses because defendant made statements to the witnesses and did not ask them questions. Defendant was convicted and now appeals, assigning error to the court\u2019s decision to permit him to represent himself and to the court\u2019s imposition of limits on his cross-examination of witnesses. The state concedes that the court erred in permitting defendant to waive his right to counsel without first determining whether the waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent and that the error requires reversal. We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 132-33, 831 P2d 666 (1992). Because the error requires reversal, we need not address defendant\u2019s other contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
