In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence based on factors not alleged in the indictment. In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it must find that defendant had a culpable mental state with respect to the value of the stolen property. In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to give a unanimous jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As defendant acknowledges, this court has previously rejected the arguments he raises in his second and third assignments of error in <em>State v. Jones, </em>223 Or App 611, 619, 196 P3d 97 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009) (holding that the first-degree theft statute does not require a thief to know the value of the stolen property), and, in addition to other cases, <em>State v. Cobb, </em>224 Or App 594, 596-97, 198 P3d 978 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009) (holding that the trial court did not err in giving a nonunanimous jury instruction). Accordingly, we reject those assignments without further discussion. We also reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error for the reasons explained in <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>238 Or App 259, 267, 242 P3d 692 (2010) (holding that Article I, section 11, and Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution do not require that enhancement facts be alleged in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
