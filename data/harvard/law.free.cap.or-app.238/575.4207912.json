In his second assignment, defendant contends that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence to prove identity theft. In his third assignment, he contends that the court erred in imposing upward departure sentences based on factors not alleged in the indictments. In his fourth and fifth assignments, defendant basically contends that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury that all of the jurors must agree on the verdict. We write to address only the third assignment of error and reject all other assignments without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The thrust of defendant\u2019s argument concerning facts that enhance a sentence is that the Oregon Constitution requires the state to plead those facts in an indictment. However, contrary to defendant\u2019s contentions, Article I, section 11, and Article VII (Amended), section 5, of the Oregon Constitution do not impose that requirement. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>238 Or App 259, 267, 242 P3d 692 (2010). For the reasons set out in <em>Sanchez, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
