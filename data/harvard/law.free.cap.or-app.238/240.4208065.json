Collins, </em>213 Or App 451, 453, 162 P3d 998, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 223 (2007). Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that the revival statute was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed and dismissed the revived case. On appeal, we relied on the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McFadden v. Dryvit Systems, Inc., </em>338 Or 528, 535, 112 P3d 1191 (2005) that \u201cthe 2003 amendment to ORS 30.905, reviving certain product liability claims that earlier had been dismissed as untimely, does not violate Article VII (Amended), section 1, of the Oregon Constitution[,]\u201d to conclude that the trial court had erred and remanded the case. On remand, defendants again sought summary judgment, this time asserting that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations and did not meet the requirements of the revival statute. The trial court agreed and again dismissed plaintiffs claims against defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">To provide context, in our first opinion in this case, we reviewed the changes to ORS 30.905(2), the statute of limitations for product liability claims. That background information is also helpful here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u201cPrior to the changes made by the 2003 Legislative Assembly (discussed below), that statute provided, in part, that \u2018a product liability civil action shall be commenced not later than two years after the date on which the death, injury or damage complained of occurs.\u2019 ORS 30.905(2) (2001). On June 8, 2001, the Oregon Supreme Court held that the two-year limitation period contained in [that statute] began to run when the \u2018death, injury or damage complained of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>occurred, regardless of whether the plaintiff discovers the harm within that two-year period. <em>Gladhart v. Oregon Vineyard Supply Co., </em>332 Or 226, 234, 26 P3d 817 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, actions filed after <em>Gladhart </em>were time barred if they were not brought within two years of the date of injury, even if the plaintiff could not have discovered the injury within that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">\u201cIn 2003, in response to <em>Gladhart, </em>the legislature enacted HB 2080, which, among other things, established that the statute of limitations for a product liability civil action for personal injury or property damage begins to run when the plaintiff first discovers or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered that the injury or other damage complained of exists and was the result of a product defect. Or Laws 2003, ch 768, \u00a7 1. * * * Section 2 of the bill (the revival statute) addressed the effective date of the changes; it also revived claims that had been previously dismissed as untimely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Fox, </em>213 Or App at 453-54.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>We also set forth the undisputed underlying facts of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\u201cOn October 5, 2000, plaintiff brought a complaint for medical malpractice against Dr. Michael Collins and Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center for injuries that allegedly arose out of a laparoscopic surgery performed on October 5, 1998. On December 4, 2000, more than two years after the date of the alleged injury, plaintiff amended her complaint, adding product liability claims against defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cDefendants each subsequently moved for summary judgment, asserting that plaintiffs product liability claims were time barred under ORS 30.905(2) (2001). The court agreed and entered separate judgments for each defendant, dismissing with prejudice all of plaintiffs claims against them. Those judgments were entered on March 7,2002, and May 7, 2002, respectively. Plaintiff did not appeal either judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs claims against Collins and Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital were then voluntarily dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a \u2018Stipulated Judgment of Dismissal and Order of Dismissal,\u2019 filed by those parties and approved by the court on September 18, 2002. The judgment dismissed the case without prejudice and set forth plaintiffs agreement with those defendants that she would be allowed to refile her complaint against them within certain time limits connected to the 2003 legislative session. The parties expressly agreed that the stipulated judgment would have the effect of a judgment of dismissal with prejudice if plaintiff did not refile within the time limits specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201cPlaintiff refiled her complaint on October 14, 2003, within the time constraints of the stipulated judgment, but before HB 2080 took effect. The complaint included the identical product liability claims against defendants that had earlier been dismissed by summary judgment; however, she did not serve that complaint on defendants. On December 4, 2003, plaintiff filed a first amended complaint; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>she served defendants with that amended complaint on January 6, 2004.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 455-56 (footnotes omitted). Defendants did not file responsive pleadings. Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201c[o]n February 5, 2004, defendants moved for summary judgment against plaintiff, arguing that the legislature\u2019s attempt in 2003 to revive final judgments under ORS 30.905 violated the separation of powers doctrine of the Oregon Constitution and that claim preclusion therefore barred plaintiff from further litigating those claims. The trial court agreed that the revival statute was \u2018an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers under Oregon law\u2019 and entered a limited judgment dismissing plaintiffs revived product liability claims against defendants with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 456. As noted, in light of <em>McFadden, </em>which had been decided after the trial court granted summary judgment, we concluded that the court had erred in holding the revival statute unconstitutional. Defendants advanced three alternative bases for this court to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cThe first two implicate the statutory prerequisites for refiling claims. Specifically, defendants argue that plaintiffs claims do not qualify under the revival statute because (1) no \u2018final\u2019 judgment was entered in plaintiffs original action before January 1, 2004; and (2) plaintiff refiled her claims in 2003, thus they were not filed \u2018within one year after\u2019 January 1, 2004, as the statute requires. The final alternative reason defendants advance for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment is that the revival statute is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"><em>Fox, </em>213 Or App at 458. We declined to affirm based on any of the alternate grounds proposed by defendants and reversed and remanded the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Following that remand, defendants filed answers and affirmative defenses to plaintiffs complaint. Among other things, defendants asserted as affirmative defenses that plaintiffs refiled claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and were not saved by the revival statute because plaintiff had not complied with that law\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>requirements. Defendants sought summary judgment on the basis of those arguments. In response, plaintiff asserted that defendants had waived the defenses at issue and that, in any event, we had considered and rejected defendants\u2019 assertions in our first opinion and that defendant was bound by our earlier decision as the \u201claw of the case.\u201d The trial court agreed with defendants and granted the motions for summary judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201cI\u2019m granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. I don\u2019t believe the defendants are precluded by the appellate court\u2019s decision. I don\u2019t think the appellate court reached the issue of waiver specifically. It was just that [defendants] had not met the requisite Court of Appeals standard for the Court to consider the alternative argument; and therefore, I think it\u2019s properly before me now that an answer has been filed by each of the defendants and they have moved for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cI\u2019m granting the summary judgment because I don\u2019t think the plaintiffs have met the statutory requirement in terms of the timing of the filing of the so-called revived action. I think that\u2019s as much as been conceded by the plaintiff, and I would have reached that conclusion in any event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Accordingly, the trial court again entered a limited judgment dismissing plaintiffs product liability claims against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In her single assignment of error on appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. At oral argument, she conceded that the refiled claims do not comply with the requirements of the revival statute; however, she contends that defendants \u201cwaived entitlement to the procedural requirements of amended ORS 30.905\u201d and that \u201cthis court rejected defendants\u2019 statutory arguments\u201d in the first appeal and, therefore, the \u201claw of the case\u201d should preclude defendant from \u201cre-litigati[ng] * * * the issue.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Defendants, in turn, assert that plaintiffs complaint was time barred and was filed before the effective date of the amendments to ORS 30.905, that they did not waive that defense, and that this court did not decide the issue in its first opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>We turn first to plaintiffs \u201claw of the case\u201d argument. According to plaintiff, when we rejected defendants\u2019 alternate basis for affirmance in our first opinion, we established the \u201claw of the case\u201d as to that issue; therefore, defendants should not have prevailed on summary judgment. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court has described the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a general principle of law and one well recognized in this state that when a ruling or decision has been once made in a particular case by an appellate court, while it may be overruled in other cases, it is binding and conclusive both upon the inferior court in any further steps or proceedings in the same litigation and upon the appellate court itself in any subsequent appeal or other proceeding for review.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\"><em>State v. Pratt, </em>316 Or 561, 569, 853 P2d 827, <em>cert den, </em>510 US 969 (1993) (quoting <em>Simmons v. Wash. F. N. Ins. Co., </em>140 Or 164, 166, 13 P2d 366 (1932)). In other words, the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine gives \u201cpreclusive effect to legal rulings made or sustained in prior appeals in the same litigation[.]\u201d <em>Poet v. Thompson, </em>208 Or App 442, 450, 144 P3d 1067 (2006). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201c[t]he doctrine does not apply to every statement about the law or the facts that the court happens to venture in the course of rendering its decisions. Rather, the \u2018law of the case\u2019 doctrine applies to the portions of a prior appellate opinion that were necessary to the disposition of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201cThus, \u2018law of the case\u2019 is a doctrine that should be invoked to preclude parties from revisiting issues that already have been fully considered by an appellate court in the same proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\"><em>Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>199 Or App 43, 53-54, 110 P3d 615, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Here, as plaintiff correctly points out, in our first opinion in this case we declined defendants\u2019 invitation to affirm the trial court on the alternate ground \u201cthat plaintiffs claims do not qualify for revival under the statute, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>because no final judgment was entered previously, or because plaintiff refiled her claims too early[.]\u201d <em>Fox, </em>213 Or App at 459. We held that \u201cthe revival statute incorporates into ORS 30.905(2) the equivalent of a statute of limitations for the purpose of bringing a <em>revived </em>products liability claim[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 460 (emphasis in original), and observed that a statute of limitations defense \u201c \u2018is waived if it is neither made by motion under [ORCP 21] nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459 (quoting ORCP 21 G(2)). We then reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201c[Dlefendants could properly raise plaintiffs failure to satisfy the statute as an affirmative defense; however, they were required to do so by pleading it in their answer or by moving to dismiss on that basis. Because defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment sought dismissal solely on the basis of claim preclusion, <em>we decline to consider defendants\u2019 statute of limitations argument as a basis to affirm the trial court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cUnder <em>[Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 20 P3d 180 (2001)], we may \u2014 as a matter of discretion \u2014 affirm a trial court ruling on an alternate basis <em>when certain conditions are met. [Id. </em>at] 659-60. One of those conditions is that <em>\u2018the facts of record be sufficient </em>to support the alternative basis for affirmance.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 660. Here, because defendants did not assert a statute of limitations defense in their pleadings, the record before the trial court would not have supported a dismissal of plaintiff s claims on that basis. The court may not <em>sua sponte </em>consider a statute of limitations defense that is not pleaded. <em>See Francke v. Gable, </em>121 Or App 17, 20, 853 P2d 1366 (1993) (trial court\u2019s dismissal of action on its own motion on basis of unasserted, waivable defense is plain error); <em>Palmer v. State of Oregon, </em>121 Or App 377, 380, 854 P2d 955 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>318 Or 352, 867 P2d 1368 (1994) (declining to affirm post-conviction court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs petition for post-conviction relief on alternative basis that it was untimely where state waived statute of limitations by failing to raise it by answer or motion to dismiss the petition); <em>cf. Waddill v. Anchor Hocking, Inc., </em>330 Or 376, 384, 8 P3d 200 (2000) (because defense of failure to state a claim under ORCP 21 G(3) is waivable by party\u2019s failure to timely assert it, the appellate courts will not consider legal sufficiency of claim on appeal unless such a challenge was raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>at trial). We therefore reject defendants\u2019 statutory arguments <em>as an alternate ground for affirmance.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 460-61 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). In that discussion, we did not fully consider and reject defendants\u2019 arguments on their merits as plaintiff contends. Instead, we declined to consider them as an alternate basis to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling. As we stated, before we can affirm a trial court\u2019s decision on alternate grounds, the record must be sufficient to support such an affirmance. In the absence of a responsive pleading or motion to dismiss raising the statute of limitations, the trial court could not have dismissed the case based on such a defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, because neither such a motion nor a responsive pleading had been filed before the court granted summary judgment based on defendants\u2019 constitutional arguments, it remained to be seen whether the defense would actually be properly raised by defendants. Thus, we concluded that the record in the case, as it existed at that time, was not sufficient to support affirmance on that basis. We did not fully consider and resolve defendants\u2019 statutory arguments in the disposition of the prior appeal. Accordingly, plaintiffs reliance on the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As noted, plaintiff also contends, as she did in the first appeal, that \u201c[defendants waived entitlement to the procedural requirements of amended ORS 30.905.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Specifically, she states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201cdefendants pressed to obtain a ruling from [the trial court] on constitutional grounds, and <em>never </em>contended * * * that plaintiff did not meet the requirements of ORS 30.905 (2003), either on grounds that plaintiffs judgment was not \u2018final\u2019 -within the window of time permitted by the statute, or that plaintiff * * * re-filed her case too soon. In fact, they told her that plaintiffs claims met those requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Defendant responds first that \u201c[b]ecause plaintiffs complaint was untimely on its face, the burden was on her to show that her claims were nonetheless \u2018revived\u2019 by amended ORS 30.905, and not on defendant to establish that her claims were not revived.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Boldface omitted.) Second, according to defendants, \u201c[t]he record establishes as a matter of law that defendant did not waive the statute of limitations. The Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure specify the ways in which a statute of limitations may be waived.\u201d That is, pursuant to ORCP 21 G(2), such a defense is waived \u201cif it is neither made by motion under [that] rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof.\u201d Here, defendant \u201cfiled no motion to dismiss under ORCP 21 and it filed no responsive pleading which omitted the defense.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>As noted, according to plaintiff, by virtue of the original motion for summary judgment on the refiled claims (the original motion) in which it argued that the revival statute was unconstitutional, defendants waived the right to assert that plaintiffs claims failed to meet the requirements of the revival statute. In plaintiffs view, not only did defendants fail to raise the issue in the original motion, but they also <em>\u201caffirmatively </em>stated that plaintiffs claims were procedurally proper[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Under Oregon law, waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Swaim, </em>209 Or App 341, 346, 147 P3d 374 (2006), aff'd, 343 Or 423, 172 P3d 645 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such a waiver \u201cmust be plain and unequivocal, either in its terms or by conduct, clearly indicating an intention to renounce a known privilege or power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As noted, where a defendant files a motion to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 or a responsive pleading, and fails to include therein a statute of limitations defense, that defense is deemed waived as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORCP 21 G(2) (\u201cA defense * * * that the action has not been commenced within the time limited by statute, is waived if it is neither made by motion under this rule nor included in a responsive pleading or an amendment thereof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Here, defendants filed no responsive pleadings or motions to dismiss pursuant to ORCP 21 before filing the original motion for summary judgment and thus, did not trigger the waiver provision in ORCP 21 G(2). Instead, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>being served with the complaint, defendants immediately sought summary judgment asserting that the statute was unconstitutional. That procedure was permissible under the rules. <em>See </em>ORCP 15 A (\u201cA motion <em>or </em>answer to the compliant * * * shall be filed with the clerk by the time required by Rule 7 C(2) to appear and defend.\u201d (Emphasis added.)); ORCP 47 B (\u201cA party against whom a claim * * * is asserted * * * may, at any time, move, with or without supporting affidavits or declarations, for a summary judgment in that party\u2019s favor[.]\u201d). Nothing in the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure requires that, in general terms, every defense or basis for summary judgment be included in such a motion. Nor do the rules provide, specifically, that if a summary judgment motion does not include a statute of limitations defense, that defense is waived. Furthermore, plaintiff has not pointed to some other source creating such a requirement, nor are we aware of any. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs argument that defendants waived the defense at issue simply by virtue of failing to include it in the original motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We are likewise unconvinced that defendants ever \u201caffirmatively\u201d represented that plaintiffs claims were properly before the court pursuant to the revival statute. Indeed, plaintiff acknowledged as much at oral argument in this appeal, and took the position that defendants\u2019 assertions to the trial court nonetheless indicated that the claims were procedurally proper. In arguing that the revival statute was unconstitutional, defendants stated several times that a final judgment had previously been entered dismissing plaintiffs product liability claims with prejudice and observed that the revival statute \u201cappears to grant plaintiff legislative permission to re-litigate\u201d those claims. In our view, defendants\u2019 assertions in the original motion do not imply that plaintiffs refiled claims are procedurally proper under the revival statute. In fact, defendants stated only that the terms of the statute <em>appeared </em>to permit plaintiff the ability to relitigate claims that had already been resolved. Those arguments, in the context of defendants motion for summary judgment, do not amount to the intentional relinquishment of a known right; they were provided as context for the constitutional arguments that defendants were making and were not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>unequivocal renunciation of the ability to later raise the defense at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> Genzyme Corporation and Valleylab, Inc., are the only defendants who are parties to this appeal.
