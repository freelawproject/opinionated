On appeal, claimant argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the board\u2019s holding that he lacked good cause is not supported by substantial evidence. We agree and, therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The evidence before the board was as follows. Claimant began working for the Klamath County School District (employer) in November 1996. He was employed as a computer specialist and network supervisor. He was married and had a father-in-law, Oppelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In 2007, after claimant had worked for employer for 11 years, he began to use his accrued sick leave to care for Oppelt, who was 96 years old and had multiple medical problems that limited his ability to care for himself. Oppelt was blind in one eye and had progressive deafness and dementia. He suffered from congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe peripheral vascular disease, conditions that made breathing and walking difficult. Oppelt could not afford to hire a caregiver, nor could claimant and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Employer\u2019s payroll manager had told claimant that he could use his sick leave to care for Oppelt. Claimant and his wife lived in Klamath Falls and Oppelt lived in Brookings. In late 2007, claimant frequently traveled to Brookings to take Oppelt to doctor\u2019s appointments and to help him with day-to-day matters. Claimant testified that there were no family members or friends in the Brookings area who could care for Oppelt and that, when claimant was not with Oppelt, no one was.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">According to claimant, employer interfered with his use of sick leave. Claimant testified that, when he was in Brookings, employer would call him and he would have to sit outside Oppelt\u2019s house to get Internet access to work on employer\u2019s computer network. He testified, \u201cIt was actually like I wasn\u2019t even using the sick time, I was just working long distance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Claimant attempted to move Oppelt to Klamath Falls, but was unsuccessful. After two days in Klamath Falls, Oppelt \u201cgot to the point where he could not breathe and he had blue lips.\u201d Oppelt\u2019s doctor determined that Oppelt suffered hypoxia at higher elevations and recommended that claimant move Oppelt back to sea level in Brookings. Claimant did. Claimant attempted to find work in Brookings so he could be near Oppelt, but was unable to do so because of the economic recession.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">According to claimant, employer became upset with claimant\u2019s use of sick leave. In December 2007, claimant\u2019s supervisor came into claimant\u2019s office with a resignation letter and \u201cthrew it on [claimant\u2019s] desk\u201d and \u201ctold [claimant] to sign it.\u201d Claimant asked the supervisor when he wanted claimant to resign, and the supervisor took the letter and left. Three or four hours later, the supervisor returned with the letter dated March 14, 2008. Claimant signed the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Claimant testified that, after he signed the resignation letter, he tried to continue to use sick leave to care for Oppelt, but the amount of work employer gave him prevented him from doing so. He testified, \u201c[T]here was always some larger, huge project that they wanted done, four weeks\u2019 worth of work done in one week, and the pressure had gotten to the point to where I \u2014 nobody could have handled it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Claimant stopped working for employer on March 14, 2008. At that point, he had 539 hours of accrued sick leave. After claimant stopped working as an employee and lost his sick leave, employer hired claimant to do some work on a contract basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Claimant later applied for unemployment benefits. An employee is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if the employee has been \u201cdischarged for misconduct connected with work\u201d or has \u201c[v]oluntarily left work without good cause.\u201d ORS 657.176(2)(a), (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Department denied claimant\u2019s request for benefits on the ground that claimant had voluntarily left work without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Claimant sought review of the department\u2019s denial by requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). At the hearing, claimant was the only witness. Employer\u2019s representative was present, but declined to question claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Claimant testified that he did not leave work voluntarily. He explained that, when his supervisor threw the resignation letter at him, \u201c[i]t was pretty much my assumption that I pretty much was gone, whether I signed the resignation [letter] or not.\u201d The ALJ asked claimant what he thought would have happened had he not signed the letter, and claimant answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cI\u2019m sure that they would have made life very hard for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">^ * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201cOne of the favorite things that they would say, Judge, is \u2018we own you, you\u2019re salaried so you\u2019re here until the duration of the job is done.\u2019 And I was already putting in 60-hour weeks at the time and I just kind of thought, well, they\u2019re just going to pile it on until it\u2019s over, until I can\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m 54. I\u2019m sure they would have made my life miserable, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The ALJ held that claimant did not leave work voluntarily, he was discharged. The ALJ further held that claimant was discharged for using his sick leave, which was not misconduct. Based on those holdings, the ALJ concluded that defendant was entitled to unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Employer appealed to the board. The board reversed, concluding that claimant voluntarily left work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>without good cause. Regarding the nature of claimant\u2019s departure, the board found that claimant could have continued to work for employer and that his resignation was the product of a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\u201cWhen asked by the AL J what he thought would happen if he did not resign, claimant did not respond that he would have been discharged. Instead, he said that he was \u2018sure they would have made life very hard\u2019 for him by asking him to work long hours. * * * In fact, after his separation from employment, the employer continued to pay him as a contractor, suggesting that it still had need for his services. When the employer asked claimant to sign the resignation and claimant did so, the two parties, in effect, reached an agreement that claimant\u2019s employment would end on March 14, 2008. Such a mutual agreement is a voluntary leaving. * * * Claimant quit work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Regarding the reasons for claimant\u2019s departure, the board found that claimant quit without good cause. \u201cGood cause\u201d is defined by OAR 471-030-0038(4), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201cGood cause for voluntarily leaving work under ORS 657.176(2)(c) is such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work. * * * Except as provided in OAR 471-030-0038(5)(g), for all individuals, the reason must be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In turn, OAR 471-030-0038(5)(g) provides that \u201c[l]eaving work with good cause includes, but is not limited to, leaving work due to compelling family reasons.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(l)(e)(B) provides that, \u201ccompelling family reasons\u201d exist when \u201c[t]he illness or disability of a member of the individual\u2019s immediate family necessitates care by another and the individual\u2019s employer does not accommodate the employee\u2019s request for time off.\u201d And, OAR 471-030-0038(l)(f) provides that, \u201c \u2018a member of the individual\u2019s immediate family\u2019 includes spouses, domestic partners, parents, and minor children under the age of 18, including a foster child, stepchild or adopted child.\u201d Thus, a person has good cause for voluntarily leaving work if the person has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>reasonable alternative but to leave work or leaves for compelling family reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">Here, the board found that claimant had two reasonable alternatives to leaving work: (1) claimant\u2019s wife could have cared for Oppelt and claimant could have used his sick leave to assist her when necessary, and (2) claimant could have found work in Brookings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cClaimant failed to show that he faced a situation of such gravity that he had no reasonable alternative but to quit when he did. He had a home in Klamath Falls and had a substantial amount of sick leave. He had the reasonable alternative to allow his wife to go to Brookings to care for her father while he continued his employment in Klamath Falls and used sick leave as necessary to assist her. At a minimum, he could have done so for a period of time while he attempted to secure employment in the Brookings area rather than turning in his resignation and becoming unemployed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The board did not address whether claimant left work for compelling family reasons. This judicial review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On review, claimant makes two assignments of error. First, claimant argues that the board erred by bolding that he voluntarily left work. Second, claimant argues that, even if he voluntarily left work, the board erred in holding that he did so without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We review the board\u2019s order to determine if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d ORS 657.282; ORS 183.482(8)(c). A finding of fact is supported by substantial evidence if \u201cthe record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">We conclude that, even assuming claimant voluntarily left work, the board erred in holding that claimant lacked good cause. As set out above, good cause to leave work exists when \u201ca reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(4). The reason for leaving work \u201cmust be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also exists if an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>leaves for \u201ccompelling family reasons.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(l)(e)(B). As described, the board held that claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving work. That holding is erroneous because it is based on factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The board found that claimant\u2019s wife could care for Oppelt and that claimant could use his sick leave to assist her. The record does not support those findings. There was no evidence that claimant\u2019s wife was able or available to care for Oppelt. The evidence was that claimant was Oppelt\u2019s caregiver. In fact, claimant\u2019s uncontradicted testimony was that when he was not with Oppelt, no one was. Likewise, there was no evidence that claimant could have used his sick leave to care for Oppelt. To the contrary, the evidence was that employer had interfered with claimant\u2019s use of sick leave, first by calling him while he was in Brookings and then by giving him an amount of work that he could not complete as required if he used his sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The board\u2019s finding that claimant could have found work in Brookings is not supported by substantial evidence either. The only evidence regarding that alternative was claimant\u2019s testimony that he had tried to find work in Brookings, but had been unable to because of the recession. Employer did not rebut, or even question, claimant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Because the board\u2019s holding that claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving work is not supported by substantial evidence, the board erred in denying claimant benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> OAR 471-030-0038(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201cThe distinction between voluntary leaving and discharge is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201c(a) If the employee could have continued to work for the same employer for an additional period of time the separation is a voluntary leaving of work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\u201c(b) If the employee is willing to continue to work for the same employer for an additional period of time but is not allowed to do so by the employer the separation is a discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ORS 657.176(7) provides that, if an employer informs an employee that the employee will be discharged on a specific date and the discharge would be for reasons that would not constitute misconduct, the employee may voluntarily leave work within 15 days of the discharge date without being disqualified from receiving benefits for doing so. Under such circumstances, \u201cthe separation from work shall be adjudicated as if the voluntary leaving had not occurred and the discharge had occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> Because we conclude that the board erred in holding that claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving work, we do not address claimant\u2019s alternative argument that he had good cause for leaving work because he left for compelling family reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
