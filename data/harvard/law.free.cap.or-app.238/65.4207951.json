Defendants did not appeal the judgment. When the appraiser submitted his valuation, but before the court decided whether, or to what extent, it would rely on that valuation, defendants filed a \u201cMotion for Supplemental Relief and Clarification\u201d requesting the court to set a hearing where they could challenge the appraiser\u2019s valuation. The court denied the motion, and defendants argue that, in so doing, the court committed legal error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Marker Industries, Inc., a trucking business, was incorporated in 1982. Defendant Robert Marker owned 52 percent of the corporation\u2019s stock and his son, Kevin, owned the remaining 48 percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both Robert and Kevin were corporation employees. After several years, disputes arose between the two and, on July 31, 2006, Robert fired Kevin and stopped sharing any corporation information with him. Kevin brought this action against Robert for \u201cshareholder remedies\u201d based on oppressive conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robert and Marker Industries filed a counterclaim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">During the two-day trial, the parties presented extensive evidence concerning (among other things) the value of the corporation. At the close of the trial, the court made an oral ruling in favor of Kevin on his shareholder oppression claim and in favor of Robert and Marker Industries on the counterclaim for conversion. In the same ruling, the court announced that, as a remedy, it would require Robert to purchase all of Kevin\u2019s shares in the corporation at \u201cfair value\u201d and that it would \u201cdetermine the value with the assistance of [an appraiser].\u201d Robert\u2019s damages against Kevin for conversion, the court ordered, would be set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>off against the purchase of Kevin\u2019s stock. On July 2,2007, the oral ruling was reduced to a written order that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">\u201c1. All parties will cooperate in whatever manner required by the appraiser and members of his staff, including, without limitation, provide to the appraiser all information and documents requested; provide to the appraiser unrestricted access to the corporation\u2019s assets wherever located; and provide to the appraiser unrestricted access to information in the hands of the corporation\u2019s service providers such as accountants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201c2. The attorneys for the parties will not initiate communication or attempt to initiate communication with the appraiser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201c3. The appraiser will begin work immediately upon his appointment under this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201c4. The appraiser will provide this court with his opinion of the fair value of the stock held by plaintiff Kevin Marker in the corporation as of July 31, 2006[, the date Kevin was forced out of the corporation].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Neither party objected to the oral or written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Approximately two months later, on August 31, the court entered a general judgment that provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">\u201c1. Defendant Robert Marker shall purchase all of [Kevin\u2019s] shares in defendant Marker Industries, Inc., for their fair value and under the following terms:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">\u201c1.1 This court will determine the value with the assistance of [an appraiser], appointed by the court\u2019s order filed July 2, 2007, under the terms of that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">\u201c1.2 The purchase order shall be consummated within 20 days after the appraisal is complete, unless before that time Marker Industries, Inc., files with this court a notice of its intention to dissolve, and articles of dissolution are properly filed with the Secretary of State within 50 days after the filing of the notice with this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">\u201c1.3 This court will retain jurisdiction to enforce this purchase order by, among other remedies, ordering that Marker Industries, Inc., be dissolved if the purchase is not completed as this court sets out in this judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00ab\u2021 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201cIT IS FURTHER ADJUDGED that defendant Marker Industries, Inc., have judgment against plaintiff on its claim for conversion in the sum of $15,031, which amount shall be used as a set of [sic] against the purchase of plaintiffs shares of stock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">About eight months after the general judgment was entered, the appraiser submitted his report to the trial court. According to the appraiser, \u201cthe fair market value of a 48 percent ownership interest in Marker Industries, Inc., as of July 31, 2006, after applicable discounts, is $78,000.\u201d The appraiser went on to say that, based on his understanding of Oregon law, the \u201cfair value standard\u201d to be applied \u201cexcludes any discounts that may be applicable under the fair market value standard <em>(e.g. </em>minority interest discount, discount for lack of marketability).\u201d Based on that understanding, the appraiser believed the fair value of the shares was $134,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">After the appraiser\u2019s report was submitted to the court and the parties, but before the court acted on it, defendants filed a \u201cMotion for Supplemental Relief and Clarification.\u201d In that motion, defendants moved the court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201c1. Clarify that the 20-day period set forth in paragraph 1.2 of the general judgment entered herein will commence when the court makes its final determination of value pursuant to paragraph 1.1 of the general judgment, and that the appraisal is not \u2018complete\u2019 before entry of that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201c2. Set a date for hearing to afford the parties the opportunity to submit additional testimony, evidence and argument regarding the value of defendant Marker Industries, Inc., including an opportunity to argue which of the two value determinations made by the appraiser are appropriate for consideration by the court under the circumstances. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The sole reason that defendants cited in support of their motion was \u201cchanged market conditions which have arisen since the date of valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The court then held a hearing on defendants\u2019 motion. Robert argued that he wanted the court to set another hearing at a later date, where he could cross-examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>appraiser, argue that the court should have adopted the discounted value of the corporation, and present evidence of changed circumstances. Kevin responded that the court had correctly followed Oregon case law, in particular <em>Hayes v. Olmsted &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>173 Or App 259, 21 P3d 178, <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 73 (2001), in adopting the nondiscounted value. Robert had the last word, in which he did not respond to Kevin\u2019s argument regarding the valuation but, instead, reiterated his request for a future hearing on that issue. The court took the matter under advisement and shortly thereafter issued the order from which defendants now appeal. The order denied defendants\u2019 request for an additional hearing. It also stated that the court had \u201creviewed the appraisal and \u2018Fair Value\u2019 figure reached by the appraiser and concluded that such \u2018Fair Value\u2019 is consistent and appropriate.\u201d The court ordered defendants to pay $134,000 within 20 days of March 19, 2008, the date of the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion. The court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">\u201c[t]he court intended that the methodologies used by [the appraiser] would be the appropriate manner for determining \u2018fair value.\u2019 The court did not intend to provide or afford the parties an opportunity to submit additional testimony, evidence, and argument regarding the value of defendant Marker Industries, Inc., after the completion of the appraisal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On appeal, defendants assign error to the court\u2019s order on defendants\u2019 motion. Their assignment comprises several arguments. First, they appear to argue that the court erred by \u201cced[ing its] decision making authority\u201d to the appraiser, a \u201cnonjudicial third party.\u201d Second, they argue that the court erred in refusing their request to set and hold a hearing where they could present testimony, evidence, and argument challenging the appraiser\u2019s valuation. Third, they argue that the court erred in setting the deadline for the share purchase at 20 days from the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion instead of 20 days from the requested hearing to which they believed they were entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">We readily reject defendants\u2019 first argument. The court said orally at the close of the trial that it would \u201cdetermine the fair value <em>with the assistance </em>of an appraiser\u201d; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>court\u2019s written judgment stated, \u201cThis court will determine the value <em>with the assistance </em>of\u2019 the court-appointed appraiser; and the court\u2019s order denying defendants\u2019 motion stated that the court \u201cadopted\u201d the appraiser\u2019s valuation after having <em>\u201creviewed </em>the appraisal and \u2018Fair Value\u2019 figure reached by the appraiser and <em>concluded </em>that such \u2018Fair Value\u2019 is consistent and appropriate.\u201d (Emphases added.) In arguing that the court ceded decision-making authority to the appraiser, defendants are asking us, in effect, to find that the court failed to keep its promise to exercise independent judgment with the aid of the appraiser, and then (not to mince words) lied by asserting that it had done so. The only evidence that defendants cite in support of this startling and reckless contention is that the court found a value that was not as low as defendants would have liked. We reject defendants\u2019 first argument with no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Defendants\u2019 third argument \u2014 that the court should have ordered the share purchase to occur 20 days after the proposed hearing where defendants could present testimony, evidence, cross-examination, and argument challenging the appraiser\u2019s valuation \u2014 would merit discussion only if we were to agree with defendants\u2019 second argument, that is, that they were entitled to such a hearing. For the reasons set out below, we reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">At the outset, we emphasize the narrow scope of defendants\u2019 appeal. They do not appeal the court\u2019s determination that they acted in an oppressive manner; they do not appeal the court\u2019s order appointing an appraiser; they do not ask us to exercise <em>de novo </em>review of the valuation; and they do not appeal the part of the general judgment stating that the court \u201cwill determine the value with the assistance of\u2019 a court-appointed appraiser (although, as discussed, they allege that the appraiser and not the court made the ultimate decision). The appeal challenges only the court\u2019s decision not to hold a <em>second </em>post-trial hearing (the first being the hearing on their motion for a subsequent hearing) where defendants could provide additional evidence, testimony, cross-examination, and legal argument. Further, they do not argue that they had a right to the hearing by virtue of the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>They argue only that they had a statutory right to a hearing. That right, they contend, derives from ORS 60.952.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Under that statute, if a court determines that \u201cthose in control of [a close] corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is * * * oppressive,\u201d the court may order, among other remedies, \u201c[t]he purchase by the corporation or one or more shareholders of all of the shares of one or more other shareholders for their fair value and on the terms determined under subsection (5) of this section.\u201d ORS 60.952(1); ORS 60.952(l)(b); ORS 60.952(2)(k). The terms under which the court may determine fair value, then, are spelled out in ORS 60.952(5). The relevant subsections of that provision state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201c(5)(a) If the court orders a share purchase, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201c(A) Determine the fair value of the shares, <em>with or without the assistance of appraisers, </em>taking into account any impact on the value of the shares resulting from the actions giving rise to a proceeding under subsection (1) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201c(B) Consider any financial or legal constraints on the ability of the corporation or the purchasing shareholder to purchase the shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">* * H? \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u201c(c) <em>After the purchase order is entered and before the purchase price is fully paid, any party may petition the court to modify the terms of the purchase, and the court may do so if the court finds that the modifications are equitable.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">(Emphases added.) Defendants rely primarily on the second italicized provision, ORS 60.952(5)(c). They contend that the provision requires the court to afford them an opportunity to, among other things, cross-examine the appraiser so that the court may assess his credibility based on demeanor and to present evidence of changed circumstances since the date of the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">We conclude that defendants read too much into ORS 60.952(5)(c). That provision imposes no obligations on the court. It is subsection (5)(a) that imposes obligations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the court (\u201cthe court shall * * *\u201d), for example, the obligation to determine fair value (with or without an appraiser). Defendants conflate subsection (5)(a) with (5)(c) in concluding that the court must meet the obligations set out in (5)(a) by holding a formal hearing. However, subsection (5)(c) does not require or even suggest a hearing; it provides only that \u201cany party may <em>petition </em>the court to modify the terms of the purchase.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A petition is \u201c[a] formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1261 (9th ed 2009). A \u201chearing\u201d of the type requested by defendants is something entirely different, and one need not occur every time a petition is filed. Defendants cite no authority, nor are we aware of any, that would support the argument that, when the legislature permits a party to \u201cpetition\u201d the court, the court is automatically required to convene a hearing, complete with all of the formalities and procedures that the term implies. For example, in a protective proceeding, \u201c[a]ny person who is interested in the affairs or welfare of a respondent may file a petition for the appointment of a fiduciary or entry of other protective order.\u201d ORS 125.010(1). The respondent has a right to request a hearing, ORS 125.070(2)(e)(C), and under some circumstances, the court must hold one. ORS 125.080(2) (\u201cA hearing must be held on a petition * * * if an objection is filed to the petition * * *.\u201d). If those circumstances do not occur, however, no hearing is required: \u201cThe court <em>may </em>require that a hearing be held on any petition or motion in a protective proceeding.\u201d ORS 125.080(1) (emphasis added). Thus, either the legislature or the United States Constitution may require a hearing on a petition; defendants do not argue for a constitutional requirement, and the legislature has not imposed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Further, defendants filed their motion seeking a hearing to modify the terms of the purchase order on March 17, 2008. At that time, the court had received the appraisal, but it had not adopted it. ORS 60.952(5)(c) allows a petition to \u201cmodify the terms\u201d of a purchase. Thus, when defendants filed their motion for a hearing to modify the court\u2019s valuation, there was no valuation to modify. And finally, after defendants submitted their \u201cMotion for Supplemental Relief and Clarification,\u201d the court <em>did </em>hold a hearing, during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>defendants had the opportunity to present arguments in support of modifying the purchase order. Insofar as the court declined to order another hearing, it did not err.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> To avoid confusion, we refer to the two Markers hy their first names and to defendant Marker Industries, Inc., as Marker Industries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\"> Kevin also brought claims for breach of fiduciary duty, defamation, and conversion. The court ruled against him on the defamation and conversion claims and dismissed the breach of fiduciary duty claim as moot. Those claims and their outcomes are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\"> The court\u2019s order announcing its decision also states: \u201cThe court did not intend to provide or afford the parties an opportunity to submit additional testimony, evidence, and argument regarding the value of defendant Marker Industries, Inc., after completion of the appraisal.\u201d That statement, which is not part of the operative language of the order, appears inconsistent with ORS 60.952(5)(c) insofar as the statute affords the parties an opportunity to submit material to the court in an attempt to persuade it to modify the terms of the purchase (and, by implication, to have the court at least consider the material). If the record demonstrated, and defendants argued, that defendants presented such a petition to the court and that the court refused to consider it, then this appeal would be in a different posture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
