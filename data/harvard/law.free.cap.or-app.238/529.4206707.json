Wife contends that the court erred in its property division by (1) failing to credit her with post-separation payments that she made toward a mortgage on the family home; (2) assigning a loan in husband\u2019s name to her; (3) discounting a debt that she owed to her mother; (4) disallowing post-separation finance charges that she had incurred; and (5) awarding husband more than half of the marital estate. We write to address wife\u2019s first and fifth assignments of error and reject the remaining assignments without discussion. With respect to the first and fifth assignments of error, we agree with wife and, accordingly, reverse and remand the general judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We review the facts <em>de novo. </em>ORS 19.415(3) (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties had been married 16 years and had two minor children when they separated in January 2006. Shortly thereafter, wife filed for legal separation, eventually pursuing dissolution in September 2006. The court dissolved the marriage in late 2007. Between the parties\u2019 separation in January 2006 and the dissolution trial, wife paid $28,143.50 toward the mortgage on the family home, according to our calculations. During that period, husband moved to Oklahoma, eventually enrolling in an alcohol treatment program, and almost completely stopped supporting the family financially, including not making any mortgage payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Following the dissolution trial and consideration of the parties\u2019 proposed property division, the trial court concluded in the general judgment that, \u201c[w]hile it may seem overly simplistic to award Wife the house, its contentas], and the majority of the debts while awarding Husband his pension, * * * this division of debts and property is the most fair and equitable[.]\u201d In arriving at that conclusion, the court sought to allow \u201cHusband the opportunity to rebuild his life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>without the pressure of significant monthly debt[.]\u201d The court distributed the marital assets and debts to the parties according to the general scheme that it described, finding that an equal division of the parties\u2019 property and debts would leave husband with a surplus of $10,337. That amount reflects both the excess that husband received under the court\u2019s property division and the payments that wife had made on post-separation debts that husband had incurred on joint accounts. However, the trial court also found that \u201c[i]t is highly unlikely that Husband would or could pay the ever * * * equalizing judgment that the Court might otherwise consider entering against him to compensate Wife for the debt obligations she has paid.\u201d Accordingly, the court did not enter an equalizing judgment against husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In her first assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court should have credited her in the property division with post-separation payments that she had made toward the mortgage on the family home. Pursuant to ORS 107.105(l)(f), the property division in a dissolution judgment must be just and equitable. Although subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion, an equal division of marital assets generally is a just and equitable disposition under ORS 107.105(1)(f). <em>Gibbons and Gibbons, </em>194 Or App 257, 265, 94 P3d 879 (2004). Similarly, marital debt must be justly and equitably divided. <em>Shlitter and Shlitter, </em>188 Or App 277, 283, 71 P3d 154 (2003). In dividing property, the court may consider the treatment and payment of marital debt, including a mortgage, by the parties between their separation and the dissolution of their marriage. <em>Cf. Gilbert-Waiters and Walters, </em>177 Or App 133, 139, 142, 33 P3d 709 (2001) (affirming trial court\u2019s unequal property division after considering wife\u2019s argument that various factors supported that division, including \u201cthe benefit Husband received by Wife paying the monthly mortgage after separation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Here, the mortgage on the family home is a marital debt that must be accounted for in the property division. Husband did not pay toward the mortgage after the parties\u2019 separation, and, hence, wife paid both parties\u2019 share of that debt. To create a just and equitable property division, husband\u2019s lack of payment and the resulting burden on wife should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>addressed. <em>Cf. Gibbons, </em>194 Or App at 260-61 (property division reimbursed husband for post-separation mortgage payments on family home). Accordingly, the property division should be modified to credit wife with $14,071.75, which reflects her post-separation payment of husband\u2019s portion of the $28,143.50 that she paid on the joint debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In her fifth assignment of error, wife contends that the trial court erred by awarding husband more than half of the marital estate. Although an award of the long half of the estate to a spouse is not an inherently improper division of property, <em>see, e.g., Triperinas and Triperinas, </em>185 Or App 283, 288, 296-97, 59 P3d 586 (2002) (upholding a long-half award to a spouse who was responsible for significant marital debts under the property division), such an award is not just and equitable here. As noted above, the trial court justified the unequal result of its property division by pointing to husband\u2019s inability to pay an equalizing judgment. However, any expressed concern regarding the financial hardship imposed by the property division can likely be ameliorated through the use of a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) awarding a percentage of husband\u2019s Cascade Pension Trust Fund (trust), a marital asset, to wife, who is assuming the majority of the marital debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">To accomplish a just and equitable property division, wife is entitled to an award of $14,071.75 for the mortgage payments, plus an additional $5,168.50 for husband\u2019s excess, or $19,240.25 total. The trial court found that the trust was worth $49,435. Accordingly, wife is entitled to 38.92 percent of the trust to equalize the property division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We recognize that that percentage may have to be modified by the trial court on remand in light of any post-dissolution changes in the trust\u2019s value, such as post-dissolution disbursements made to husband, or, if the entry of a QDRO is not possible, that the court will then have to modify the judgment to give wife an equalizing judgment of $19,240.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">General judgment of dissolution reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a QDRO consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>this opinion or, if that is not possible, to modify the judgment to award wife an equalizing judgment of $19,240.25. Supplemental judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> ORS 19.415 was amended in 2009. Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 2.
