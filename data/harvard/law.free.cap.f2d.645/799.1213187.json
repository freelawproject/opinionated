The Secretary alleged that Chala had violated the record keeping and overtime<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provisions of the Act by failing to pay those employees a regular hourly rate for the first forty hours of work, and one and one-half times the regular rate for each hour in excess of forty per week. Chala admitted the record keeping violations, but denied that its compensation scheme violated the overtime provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Although the faulty record keeping made it rather difficult to determine the method by which the employees\u2019 compensation was calculated, the district court found that Chala had not violated the overtime provision. The court then declined to issue either a prospective or restitutionary injunction, partly for the reason that, in the court\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe compensation paid by the defendants to their employees was reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The dispute centers on ten employees of the defendant who worked as attendants at various gasoline service stations operated by Chala in the Los Angeles vicinity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These employees were paid a fixed lump sum amount for a sixty hour workweek. Chala\u2019s basic contention is that the lump sum salary figures were actually based on the requisite regular hourly rate, and reflected payment for forty hours at such rate and time and a half for hours in excess of forty. Chala thus contends that the hourly rate was predetermined, but that the method of computation was designed to produce a round figure, e. <em>g., </em>$800 or $1,000, for each month. This apparent anomaly was explained by testimony that the employees were more interested in knowing their monthly salary than the hourly rate upon which it was based. The Secretary claims that Chala simply computed hypothetical regular and overtime rates <em>post hoc, </em>by breaking down the predetermined fixed salary. He urges that the employer\u2019s payment scheme resulted in fixed lump sum salaries, without any breakdown into a regular rate for the first forty hours and one and one-half times the regular rate for the remaining twenty hours. In support of this contention, the Secretary notes several circumstances that, taken together, cast serious doubt on Chala\u2019s assertion that the employees were paid an hourly wage. For example, it appears that deductions for hours missed from the regular sixty-hour week were made on a straight time basis. If the employees were being paid time and a half for the twenty overtime hours, one would expect the deductions to mirror this up to twenty hours.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary also notes that increases in compensation came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>in the form of an increase from one round lump sum figure to another, rather than as an increase in the hourly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The district court accepted Chala\u2019s argument that the lump sum figure for a sixty-hour week consisted of predetermined regular and overtime components, although it noted that the company\u2019s records failed to reflect this computational scheme. In light of this finding, and in reliance on the \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201cnon-exploitive\u201d nature of the rate of compensation, the district court denied all relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">A. <em>The Section 7 Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We need not reach the issue whether the district court erroneously accepted Chala\u2019s computation of an hourly rate, arrived at after the fact by dividing the monthly salary into a regular hourly wage and a stepped-up overtime rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The decisive factor in this case is the failure of the defendant to carry its burden of showing an express agreement with its employees as to a regular rate of pay for the first forty hours of work per week. This court has held that when employees are compensated on a lump sum basis, <em>\u201c[ajbsent explicit proof of another mutually agreed upon rate of pay, </em>the court must infer that \u2018the regular rate actually paid was substantially that obtained by dividing the weekly wage payable for the working of the scheduled workweek by the number of hours in such scheduled workweek.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brennan v. Valley Towing Co., Inc., </em>515 F.2d 100, 106 (9th Cir. 1975) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>149 Madison Ave. Corp. v. Asselta, </em>331 U.S. 199, 204, 67 S.Ct. 1178, 1181, 91 L.Ed. 1432 (1947)). <em>See also Brennan v. Elmer\u2019s Disposal Service, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 84, 87 (9th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, when a weekly salary is paid, the employer is deemed to have paid the same rate for all hours worked, rather than the requisite overtime compensation, unless it can demonstrate the existence of a mutual agreement regarding the regular rate to be paid for the first forty hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">The burden of establishing an express agreement regarding the method of computation is on the employer. <em>See Brennan v. Elmer\u2019s Disposal Service, Inc., </em>510 F.2d at 86-87 n.1, 88. This serves to minimize the possibility that implementation of the important purposes of section 7 will be dependent upon the resolution of ambiguities as to what individual employees understood regarding the scheme of compensation. The record here is replete with such ambiguities, and they are directly reflected in the finding by the district judge on this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if we accept that finding, it falls far short of establishing an express agreement regarding the regular rate of pay and, thus, is insufficient as a matter of law to avoid the conclusion that Chala violated section 7 of the Act. For this reason, we reverse and remand to the district court for imposition of the proper remedy. To assist the district court upon remand, we add a discussion of the standards by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the relief to which the Secretary is entitled is to be determined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Although the record does not show that the employees were informed specifically that their compensation was fixed in the manner above stated, they were generally aware that their pay took into account the fact that they were regularly working twenty hours per week \u201covertime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>B. <em>Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The district court, quoting <em>Dunlop v. Sag-hatelian, </em>520 F.2d 788, 790 (9th Cir. 1975), denied injunctive relief, restitutionary or prospective, in light of its conclusions that the employees were compensated at a \u201creasonable\u201d rate, that they were not exploited by their employer, and that Chala \u201chad no gains accruing to [it] through [its] violation.\u201d These factors do not exhaust those relevant to a determination of the proper remedy, and we think the emphasis that they suggest is at odds with the policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act. We conclude that the district court incorrectly relied on <em>Saghatelian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The Supreme Court has stated, in an analogous context, that \u201csuch discretionary choices are not left to a court\u2019s 'inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Addressing the issue of a court\u2019s discretion to award reimbursement for lost wages following a discharge in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Court has noted that \u201c[w]hen Congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment, it must be taken to have acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in light of the statutory purposes.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Robert De Mario Jewelry, Inc., </em>361 U.S. 288, 291-92, 80 S.Ct. 332, 334-35, 4 L.Ed.2d 323 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>the Court set forth what we believe to be the basic framework for determining whether restitutionary relief should be afforded in cases involving violations of the minimum wage or overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. After examining the purposes of the Act, the Court stated, \u201cbecause of what we have found to be the statutory purposes there is doubtless little room for the exercise of discretion not to order reimbursement. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 80 S.Ct. at 337. We conclude that in the case before us the district court did not properly exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">We first address the restitutionary injunction sought by the Secretary. \u201cIt must be remembered that restraining appellees from withholding the . .. overtime compensation is meant to vindicate a public, rather than a private, right, and that the withholding of the money due is considered a 'continuing public offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wirtz v. Maithor, Inc., </em>391 F.2d 1, 3 (9th Cir. 1968); <em>Wirtz v. Jones, </em>340 F.2d 901 (5th Cir. 1965). The policies underlying the overtime provision (section 7) of the FLSA are distinct from those served by the minimum wage requirement (section 6), although there are some common purposes. Section 6 deals with the subject of \u201cwages,\u201d while section 7 deals with the regulation of \u201chours.\u201d Section 7 is intended to address the \u201cevil of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u2018overwork.\u2019 \u201d <em>Overnight Motor Transportation Co. v. Missel, </em>316 U.S. 572, 578, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 1220, 86 L.Ed. 1682 (1942). A principal purpose of section 7\u2019s guarantee of one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for overtime work is to accomplish a broader social goal, i. e., to spread employment more widely through the work force by discouraging employers from requiring more than forty hours per week from each employee. This purpose requires the payment of the premium overtime rate regardless of the level of the regular hourly rate. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 62 S.Ct. at 1220. <em>Bay Ridge Operating Co. v. Aaron, </em>334 U.S. 446, 460, 68 S.Ct. 1186, 1194, 92 L.Ed. 1502 (1948); <em>Brennan v. Elmer\u2019s Disposal Service, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 84, 87 (9th Cir. 1975). Thus, the fact that a given level of compensation may be \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cnon-exploitative\u201d is irrelevant when considering the propriety of a restitu-tionary injunction in a suit brought by the Secretary to remedy a violation of section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">A restitutionary injunction prevents unjust enrichment, and affords employees payments that Congress has determined they are entitled to receive. Denial of an injunction deprives them of the opportunity to recover these amounts. In addition, the prospect of a restitutionary injunction discourages future violations of the Act whether intentional or negligent in nature. Even if the total compensation Chala would have paid its employees would not have been different had the company complied with the Act, such an injunction will, both in this case and generally, encourage the careful record keeping the Act requires, and will assure that the employees are paid in the manner that the Act requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Dunlop v. Saghatelian, </em>520 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1975), as authority for denial of relief in this case was misplaced. The decision in <em>Saghatelian </em>rested, as this court has previously pointed out,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on an extreme set of facts. The court in <em>Saghatelian </em>recognized that \u201cthe back pay prospect is the effective \u2018spur\u2019 to compliance with the substantive requirements of .. . the Fair Labor Standards Act,\u201d 520 F.2d at 790, yet added that \u201cone does not \u2018spur\u2019 a horse until he dies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both the appellee in that case, and the business itself, were in serious jeopardy; both the district court and the court of appeals were motivated by the fact that imposing the burden of a restitutionary injunction would have had a serious deleterious effect on the ap-pellee\u2019s physical and mental health, 514 F.2d at 621 and n.2, and on the very existence of his business. <em>Id. </em>Appellees in the case before us make no such claim. Even if appellees were to urge economic hardship, the argument would fail. The general rule is set forth in <em>Wirtz v. Malthor, Inc., </em>391 F.2d at 3, where this court held that \u201cthe small size of appellees\u2019 business' and the possible hardship caused them by having to pay the withheld wages and compensation do not warrant refusing the restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">In short, restitutionary injunctions are an essential tool in effectuating the policy of the Act. The importance of this tool in assuring compliance with the Act and its policies has been recognized by Congress, S.Rep.No.145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 40, <em>reprinted in </em>[1961] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1620, 1659, and the courts. In <em>Wirtz v. Malthor, Inc., </em>391 F.2d at 3, this court noted that the public purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act \u201ccan be fulfilled in this case only by restraining the appellees from further withholding the unpaid compensation.\u201d <em>See also Wirtz v. Milton J. Wershow Co., </em>416 F.2d 1071, 1073 (9th Cir. 1969). We reach the same conclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">As to the prospective injunctive relief sought by the Secretary, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>refused to grant relief in light of Chala\u2019s assurances of present and future compliance with the Act, and because it regarded the cost of the present litigation as having taught the defendant an \u201cexpensive lesson.\u201d This is not a sufficient basis for denying the prospective relief. This court has noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-4\">[p]resent compliance is only one of the factors relevant to the exercise of an informed judicial discretion to determine whether an injunction against future violations is appropriate. A complaint for injunctive enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act does not lack equity merely because present compliance may be shown or admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-5\"><em>Wirtz v. Milton J. Wershow Co., </em>416 F.2d 1071, 1072 (9th Cir. 1969). The factors to be considered by the district court upon remand were well-stated by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Mitchell v. Pidcock, </em>299 F.2d 281,287 (5th Cir. 1962). After noting that \u201c[t]he injunctive processes are a means of effecting general compliance with national policy as expressed by Congress,\u201d the court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-6\">The injunction subjects the defendants to no penalty, to no hardship. It requires the defendants to do what the Act requires anyway \u2014 to comply with the law .... We do not say or imply that injunctions should be issued freely, without regard for the facts, simply because it is the Government asking for the injunction. We say that the manifest difficulty of the Government\u2019s inspecting, investigating, and litigating every complaint of a violation weighs heavily in favor of enforcement by <em>injunction </em>\u2014 after the court has found an unquestionable violation of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-7\"><em>Id. See also Wirtz v. Atlas Roofing Manufacturing Co., </em>377 F.2d 112, 116-18 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">In exercising its discretion, the district court must give substantial weight to the fact that the Secretary seeks to vindicate a public, and not a private, right. We reverse this part of the district court\u2019s decision, and remand to allow reconsideration of the Secretary\u2019s request for prospective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">We reverse the decision of the district court, with instructions to enter an order granting the restitutionary injunction, and to reconsider the denial of the prospective relief sought. The amount of overtime compensation to which the employees are entitled should be determined by dividing the weekly compensation by sixty in order to determine the regular rate, and multiplying such regular rate by a factor of one and one-half in order to determine the overtime rate, <em>Brennan v. Valley Towing Co., Inc., </em>515 F.2d at 106. The court should then determine the number of hours of overtime worked by each employee during the period at issue, and multiply that number by the amount by which the overtime rate exceeds the regular rate. Finally, the district court should consider appellees\u2019 argument that certain employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Act. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-10\">. Section 7(a)(1) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">\u00a7 207 Maximum Hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-15\">, Chala contends on appeal that several of the employees are properly classifiable as \u201cmanagers,\u201d apparently seeking to bring them within the exemption of \u00a7 13(a)(1) for \u201cexecutive, administrative, or professional\u201d employees. The district court did not address this contention. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-16\">. Chala asserted in its post-trial brief to the district court that the straight time deduction was a \u201cbenefit\u201d conferred on the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b861-9\">. The <em>post hoc </em>computation is foreclosed by prior decisions of this circuit. <em>Brennan v. Valley Towing Co., Inc., </em>515 F.2d 100, 106 (9th Cir. 1975) (\u201cIt is the \u2018actual fact\u2019 of a stepped-up rate for overtime which propagates the goals of the act, and not the hypothetical retrospective construction of such a rate structure.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b861-10\">. In <em>Elmer\u2019s Disposal </em>the court found that a district court\u2019s determination that an employer had violated \u00a7 7 was supported by the lack of an express agreement as to the hourly rate, and by the employer\u2019s practice of deducting one-sixth of the total weekly pay for each day missed out of a six day workweek, without regard to the total number of hours worked. 510 F.2d at 87. The second circumstance is similar to Chala\u2019s practice of deducting for hours missed at a rate of one-sixtieth the weekly total, instead of at the higher time and a half rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b861-15\">. Finding Number 2 of the district court reads as follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\"><em>. </em>Chala contends that several of the employees are managers. The district court did not fule on the issue whether these employees are exempt from \u00a7 7 under the provisions of \u00a7 13(a)(1). On remand, therefore, the court should consider that question, keeping in mind that the statutory exemption should be narrowly construed in light of the remedial purposes of the Act. The burden of showing that an employee is clearly within the exemption is on the employer. <em>Idaho Sheet Metal Works, Inc. v. Wirtz, </em>383 U.S. 190, 208, 86 S.Ct. 737, 748, 15 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In this case, special attention should be given to the amount of time, if any, each employee spent on nonadministrative tasks. <em>See Haber v.
