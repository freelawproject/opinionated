Two questions, however, might be considered as arising: 1) whether Lu-cey\u2019s lawyer had been guilty of ineffective assistance of counsel within our <em>Beasley v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 687 (6th Cir. 1974), rule and 2) whether the case should be remanded to the District Court to take testimony on the question of whether, as claimed by appellee Lucey, the dismissal of his appeal violated equal protection since no such action had been taken on any other case under similar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">Study of this record convinces this court that this case should be remanded to determine the equal protection issue set forth immediately above.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-27\">This case is ordered remanded for such purpose with power to take any needed testimony.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-28\">NATHANIEL R. JONES, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ahp-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-29\">It is an important duty of counsel to ensure that his client has an opportunity to present his claims at an appeal of right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Appellate counsel\u2019s failure to comply with Kentucky\u2019s Rule of Appellate Procedure 1.095(a)(1), causing the dismissal of the appeal without a consideration of the merits, is <em>ineffective </em>assistance of counsel violative of due process. <em>Gilbert v. Sowders, </em>646 F.2d 1146 (6th Cir. 1981) (per curiam) (Jones, concurring). <em>See also Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 745, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 1400, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967); <em>Benoit v. Wingo, </em>423 F.2d 880, 883 (6th Cir. 1970). Consequently, I would affirm the judgment of the district court granting Seabold\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
