In the hotly contested election for International President of the United Steelworkers of America in 1977, Edward Sadlowski, Jr., the defeated candidate, received substantial financial support from nonmembers and made a very substantial run against the candidate supported by the incumbent leadership. Shortly thereafter the Union amended its Constitution in Article Y, Section 27 to prohibit absolutely any outside financial contributions. Sadlowski and others then brought this action to invalidate the \u201coutsider\u201d rule, claiming that the rule violated their rights under the First Amendment, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-168, and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-531. On cross-motions for summary judgment the district court held the outsider rule violated rights of union members protected by the right to sue provision in the Bill of Rights for Union members included in the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(4), and declared Section 27 invalid in its entirety. The Union filed this appeal and, since the next election for international officers is scheduled for May 28,1981, the case has been given expedited consideration. We affirm, with one minor exception, the order declaring Article V, Section 27 invalid and enjoining the Union from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">In the 1977 election for International President of the United Steelworkers of America \u2014 which has some 1.3 million members \u2014 Edward Sadlowski, Jr., opposed Lloyd McBride in a heated campaign to succeed the retiring I. W. Abel. McBride enjoyed the support of the Union\u2019s incumbent leadership; Sadlowski was the insurgent chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>lenger.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sadlowski received substantial campaign contributions from sources outside the Union, and McBride received most of his financial support from the staff of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Sadlowski received 249,281 votes to McBride\u2019s 328,861 and the other members of his insurgent slate were also defeated. He contested the validity of the election, but the Secretary of Labor refused to initiate legal proceedings to overturn the announced result, and a legal challenge to the Secretary\u2019s refusal failed. <em>See Sadlowski v. Marshall, </em>464 F.Supp. 858 (D.D.C.), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>No. 79-1461 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 905, 100 S.Ct. 2987, 64 L.Ed.2d 854 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">The next biennial convention of the Union in 1978 enacted Article V, Section 27 (set forth as an Appendix to this opinion) as an amendment to the Union Constitution. In addition to imposing a blanket prohibition on campaign contributions by persons other than union members (with an exception for volunteered time), Section 27 empowered the International Executive Board to promulgate implementing regulations and created the Campaign Contribution Administrative Committee \u201cto administer and enforce\u201d the outsider rule. The rule represents the first attempt by an American labor union to so restrict financial support for candidates for union office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">Sadlowski and others<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> brought suit in late 1979 to challenge the validity of the outsider rule. The Union and the Secretary of Labor were named as defendants. Plaintiffs complained that the outsider rule violated the First Amendment rights of both members and nonmembers; the National Labor Relations Act since it must be read consonant with the First Amendment; the right to sue provision of the LMRDA; and section 401(g) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(g), which prohibits candidates for union office from receiving campaign contributions from employers or union funds. After various motions to dismiss and for summary judgment were filed and argued, the district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their right to sue claim and the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss the case as to him for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining motions were denied and the Union\u2019s remaining countermotions were granted. The Union and the plaintiffs have appealed those parts of the district court\u2019s order that were adverse to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">\n<em>A. The Right to Sue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">The district court held the outsider rule violated section 101(a)(4) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(4), the so-called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>right to sue provision. The outsider rule attempts to accomplish its purpose of outlawing outside campaign contributions in a single sentence, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-4\">No candidate (including a prospective candidate) for any position set forth in Article IV, Section 1,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and supporter of a candidate may solicit or accept financial support, or any other direct or indirect support of any kind (except an individual\u2019s own volunteered personal time) from any nonmember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The right to sue provision, found in the Bill of Rights for Union Members<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> section of the LMRDA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-6\">No labor organization shall limit the right of any member thereof to institute an action in any court, or in a proceeding before any administrative agency ... or the right of any member of a labor organization to appear as a witness in any judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding, or to petition any legislature or to communicate with any legislator ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayv-dedup-0\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">We have no difficulty in ruling that the outsider rule on its face violates this right to sue provision. The language of the rule prohibiting candidates from receiving any financial support is all-encompassing and absolute. It prohibits the solicitation or acceptance of \u201cfinancial support, or any other direct or indirect support of any kind\u201d from a nonmember, except for time volunteered by an individual. This blanket prohibition, <em>inter alia, </em>would stop a candidate from using outside money to pay for a lawyer\u2019s services, from accepting the services of a lawyer for a reduced rate, or from accepting the donated services of a lawyer if the lawyer\u2019s typist, secretary or other helper contributed to the product. One need look no further than the 1977 election for International President to see the crucial role that a lawyer\u2019s advice and other services play in an insurgent\u2019s quest for office against candidates supported by entrenched incumbents. Prior to the election Sadlowski filed several lawsuits and defended others. He also filed suits after the election. This background strongly indicates that restricting a member\u2019s right to sue was one of the Union\u2019s purposes in prohibiting outside financial support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">The Union claims that a construction of the outsider rule by the Campaign Contribution Administrative Committee (Administrative Committee) demonstrates the outsider rule does not affect the rights protected by section 101(a)(4). Shortly after plaintiffs filed this lawsuit the Union\u2019s lawyer requested the Administrative Committee to issue an advisory opinion concerning the impact of the outsider rule on the right to sue. The Committee cast the question before it as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-12\">whether direct or indirect support by nonmembers to finance a lawsuit asserting candidates\u2019 legal rights in connection with elections <em>constitutes support for the purpose of influencing an election.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-g\">Union\u2019s Brief at A-3 (emphasis added). The Committee concluded that the outsider rule did not prohibit contributions to finance litigation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-13\">This limitation on candidacy support cannot be interpreted so broadly. An intention to limit one\u2019s access to the judicial system, a province which is so fundamental to the structure of government, cannot be inferred. It would have to be established by clear and convincing ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>pressions of intent. This is not the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\"><em>Id. </em>at A-4. We have difficulty accepting this formulation of the issue or this construction of the expansive prohibition stated in the outsider rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We need not determine whether this construction saves the rule, however, because the Administrative Committee later confused the matter in an attempt to explain the limits of the opinion and in responding to a supplemental question. The opinion continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-5\">This opinion is, of course, confined to services which are in fact legal services customarily performed by lawyers. The Committee recognizes the possibility that any ruling which it makes in general terms and in response to a broad inquiry may be misconstrued or distorted in an attempt to rationalize political activities as \u201clegal services.\u201d It will deal with those questions whenever they arise on a case-by-case basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-6\">The union, in its request for an advisory opinion, has asked the Committee to rule on two supplemental questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-7\">The first is whether a different situation from that discussed above is presented \u201cwhere the lawsuit is not a <em>bon a fide </em>attempt to secure an adjudication of legal rights, but, rather, is motivated solely by a desire to promote a candidate\u2019s political campaign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">We make no ruling on this variation of the central question. Such hypothesis goes beyond what can be responsibly covered by generalization. The Committee would be exceedingly reluctant about putting its own interpretation on the quality of good or bad faith that attends an individual\u2019s asserting his or her legal rights in a court proceeding. We will, however, look at such a case on its facts if it arises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\"><em>Id. </em>at A-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">The district court was greatly concerned by the question, left open by the advisory opinion, of \u201cwhether member-candidates can be disqualified or disciplined for ... retaining counsel [with outside financial support] and bringing suit which the Committee or the union later determines was not <em>bona fide.\u201d </em>App. at 55. We are vexed as well, but a subsequent regulation promulgated by the International Executive Board and adopted by the Union at its 1980 convention as a part of the International Union Elections Manual causes us even greater concern. The relevant provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-13\">B. Contributions for Legal and Accounting Services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7b\">Section 27 does not prohibit the candidate\u2019s use of financial support or services from non-members to pay fees for legal or accounting services performed in assuring compliance with applicable election laws or in securing, defending, or clarifying legal rights of candidates. Contributions of this kind are permitted only to the extent that they are confined to these permissible objects. <em>Activities which are designed to extract political gain from legal proceedings are subject to the support limitations of Section 27.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akz\">Union Motion for Partial Stay at Appendix C-4 (Feb. 5, 1981) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">Under this construction a candidate for union office would apparently be allowed to receive volunteered or reduced-rate legal services and to accept and solicit from nonmembers contributions to finance \u201clegal ... services performed in assuring compliance with applicable election laws or in securing, defending, or clarifying legal rights of candidates.\u201d This categorization may or may not include all of the legitimate legal proceedings that a candidate for office may instigate or defend. Even if it does, the candidate cannot accept or solicit campaign contributions to be expended for \u201c[activities which are designed to extract political gain from legal proceedings.\u201d The Union suggested at oral argument that this statement restricts a candidate only from using outsider money to finance non-litigation activities that in some way refer to litigation, such as mailing a flyer announc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ing a victory in a lawsuit or some information learned during discovery or trial. We cannot accept this limited construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">As we read the last sentence of the regulation, \u201cactivities\u201d includes steps in the legal proceedings themselves, so that, for instance, if the filing of a complaint, the serving of interrogatories or the taking of a deposition is \u201cdesigned to extract political gain,\u201d it would be subject to the contribution limitations. This broad limitation on the right to sue subsumes whatever limit resulted from the Administrative Committee\u2019s hedging on the question whether a lawsuit \u201cmotivated solely by a desire to promote a candidate\u2019s political campaign,\u201d which is \u201cnot a <em>bona fide </em>attempt to secure an adjudication of legal rights,\u201d would be subject to the contribution restrictions. Under the regulation a candidate could not receive outside assistance to finance a lawsuit even if brought in good faith and not motivated solely by a desire to advance his campaign if it was designed to extract political gain. One would go a far distance to find <em>any </em>lawsuit brought during the heat of a campaign that was not designed to extract political gain. The regulation places a severe limitation on the right to sue. The right to sue guaranteed union members by the Bill of Rights of LMRDA is a grant of an absolute right which cannot be diminished by only permitting those suits that a union might find to be <em>bona fide </em>or not designed to extract political benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The outsider rule in Section 27 on its face clearly violates the rights of union members protected by the right to sue guarantee of the LMRDA. The Union\u2019s attempts to construe the rule against its plain meaning have been unpersuasive. We now turn to what is perhaps the core issue in this case\u2014 the proper scope of the remedy for the violation of the right to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">\n<em>B. The Appropriate Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">The Union argues that if we find, as we have, that the outsider rule violates the right to sue, then \u201c[a]t most, plaintiffs would be entitled to an injunction prohibiting application or enforcement of that provision to interfere with the solicitation or acceptance of contributions from nonmembers to finance litigation.\u201d Union\u2019s Brief at 40. The Union has suggested the form of an injunction that it believes would prevent the outsider rule from infringing on the rights protected by 101(a)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Much of the parties\u2019 arguments on the proper scope of the remedy have focused on whether or not we can \u201cseparate\u201d the application of the outsider rule that violates the right to sue from the remaining applications of the rule. Although we believe that the entire rule must fall, it is not because of our adherence to some formalistic nonseparability rule. Instead, we believe the remaining applications of that rule must fall because they violate the freedom of speech provision as guaranteed by section 101(a)(2) of the Bill of Rights of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">The Union contends that plaintiffs cannot now rely on section 101(a)(2) because they did not raise it in the district court. The general rule is that an appellate court does not consider issues not raised in the trial court. <em>E. g., Miller v. Avirom, </em>384 F.2d 319 (D.C.Cir.1967). This general rule, however, is not absolute \u2014 the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.\u201d <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2877, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). <em>See Hormel </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S.Ct. 719, 721, 85 L.Ed. 1037 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>(1947). An example of this discretion is incorporated in the widely acknowledged rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-4\">\u201c[a]n appellate court has discretion to uphold a summary judgment under a legal theory different from that applied by the trial court, and rest the affirmance \u2018on any ground that finds support in the record\u2019 ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\"><em>Winter v. Local 639, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>569 F.2d 146, 151 (D.C. Cir.1977) (quoting <em>United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>518 F.2d 420, 441 (D.C.Cir. 1975)). <em>Accord, e. g., </em>C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, 10 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2716, at 440 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Typically when summary judgments are upheld on grounds different from those relied on by the district court, the other grounds were urged at trial. We must decide whether a different rule should apply in this case when the alternate ground was not explicitly urged before the trial court in the context that it is now presented. <em>Cf. Merriam v. McConnell, </em>31 Ill.App.2d 241, 175 N.E.2d 293, 295 (1961) (decree of dismissal can be sustained \u201cby any argument and upon any basis, appearing in the record, which shows that the decree is right, even if [the party in whose favo, the dismissal was granted] had not previously advanced such argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">We believe that it is appropriate to now consider the impact of section 101(a)(2). The issue arising thereunder was argued in the briefs submitted to this court and the essential features of the contention were pleaded in connection with the two causes of action which charged violations of the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment. Our concern with now ruling on the effect of section 101(a)(2) revolves around the possibility that the Union might have been prejudiced by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to raise the issue in the trial court in this precise context. The only way we perceive the Union could possibly be prejudiced is that it might have constructed a different record for the purposes of summary judgment if a denial of free speech under section 101(a)(2) had been alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in addition to the denial of free speech under the First Amendment. The issue of the denial of free speech under section 101(a)(2) was implicit in the question whether plaintiffs had been denied free speech under the First Amendment, as alleged in their complaint. In other words the same argument with respect to the denial of free speech under the First Amendment would have been relevant to an allegation of denial under section 101(a)(2); and the opportunity to make such an argument was open to the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">Since we construe section 101(aX2) in this case to place essentially the same limits on labor unions with respect to outside campaign contributions that the First Amendment would if it applied to labor unions, we conclude the Union had ample opportunity to meet the substance of the 101(a)(2) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AF29\">\n<em>C. Freedom of Speech and Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">The free speech and assembly provision of Labor's Bill of Rights states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-12\">Every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and <em>to express any views, arguments, or opinions</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">This portion of the LMRDA is patterned after the essential features of the First Amendment, <em>Ostrowski v.

The right of <em>free association </em>is an inseparable aspect of freedom of speech. <em>NAACP v.

As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Griswold v.

[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Our analysis of section 101(a)(2) is guided by a recommendation made by Professor Cox shortly after the passage of the LMRDA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-9\">The legislation contains more than its share of problems for judicial interpretation because much of the bill was written on the floor of the Senate or House of Representatives and because many sections contain calculated ambiguities or political compromises essential to secure a majority.

Retail Clerks International Association, </em>299 F.Supp. 1012, 1020 (D.D.C.1969) (\u201cWhere a union policy and practice is promulgated in order, among other things, to place obstacles in the way of effective union democracy and appears to have this effect, ... the Court cannot give that policy any recognition as it offends both equity and the provisions of the LMRDA.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">. In our view the outsider rule\u2019s blanket prohibition on outside contributions for \u201ctraditional campaign purposes,\u201d Union\u2019s Brief at 41, violates the rights of the candidate and his supporters to free speech and association as guaranteed by section 101(a)(2) and flies squarely in the face of the intent of the LMRDA to \u201cinsure union democracy.\u201d We find support for this conclusion in the analogous context of contribution limitations in federal elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">In <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of, <em>inter alia, </em>the expenditure and contribution limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86 Stat. 3, as amended. The Court recognized the significant connection between money and political speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-6\">A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acq\">424 U.S. at 19, 96 S.Ct. at 634. With respect to contributions the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atq-dedup-0\">Given the important role of contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue if the limitations prevented candidates and political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AskR\"><em>Id. </em>at 21, 96 S.Ct. at 635. Finding \u201cno indication ... that the contribution limitations imposed by the Act would have any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns and political associations,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court upheld , a limitation of $1,000 on the amount an individual could contribute to a particular candidate in an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">In our view, the freedom of speech guarantee in the LMRDA serves to limit labor unions much as the First Amendment limits Congress in the restrictions that can validly be placed on campaign finance, but the Bill of Rights guarantees of the LMRDA are not limited to situations involving \u201cstate action.\u201d Accepting <em>Buckley </em>as persuasive authority and finding meaningful direction from the legislative history of the LMRDA, we conclude that the outsider rule in many instances could unquestionably operate to prevent candidates, at least those facing the electoral power of entrenched union staffs, from \u201camassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">The rule permits no outside campaign contributions whatsoever. A candidate for union office cannot receive or solicit contributions from friends, relatives, Union members not in good standing, retired Union members, or well-wishers. The Union restrictions would not permit a candidate to receive a loan from his nonmember father, or a close friend, even if the loan were fully secured and carried a reasonable rate of interest. The implementing regulations contain expansive definitions of \u201cfinancial support\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and \u201cindirect support.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They also state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>[W]hen prohibited support is contributed, there will be a presumption that it was accepted by the candidate or his or her supporters, unless they have taken affirmative steps in good faith to dissuade the nonmember from providing such support and have taken action to correct the effects of the prohibited support.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ag8-dedup-0\">The candidate who solicits outside support or who is unable to rebut the presumption that he has accepted support that has been contributed faces serious penalties. The Administrative Committee may \u201cdeclare such candidate <em>disqualified.\u201d </em>Union Const, art. V, \u00a7 27(d) (emphasis added). In addition the Union Constitution contains a general \u201cDiscipline\u201d provision (Article XII), which makes a violation of any provisions of the Constitution punishable by <em>fine, suspension, </em>or <em>expulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">Even if we assume that the Union\u2019s only purpose in passing the outsider rule was to keep undesirable outside influence out of internal union affairs, we could not accept the broad limitations placed on a candidate\u2019s ability to receive outside campaign contributions that are <em>not </em>prohibited by the statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Union no doubt has a legitimate interest in protecting its internal affairs from nefarious influences. But that interest cannot justify a rule that prohibits a candidate, particularly an insurgent candidate, for union office from receiving <em>any </em>contributions or loans (except from institutional lenders) from nonmembers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">The Union suggests that Section 27 might be held valid under the proviso in 101(a)(2) which authorizes \u201creasonable\u201d rules to protect unions as institutions. One of the prime purposes of Congress in enacting the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act was to \u201cinsure union democracy.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The issue is thus framed as to whether an absolute prohibition on outside contributions is a \u201creasonable\u201d protection of a union as an institution or a feature that would operate to deny \u201cunion democracy.\u201d We cannot conceive of anything that would do more to inhibit union democracy than to prohibit insurgent candidates from receiving financial support from those outside sources that are not prohibited by the statute. Such a rule in our opinion is unreasonable. Friends, relatives, spouses, Steelworkers who are not in good standing in the Union, and well wishers in the public could not make any contribution, or even a well-secured loan at reasonable interest rates to support any such candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">We therefore conclude that the complete prohibition on outside financial support as declared in Section 27 is not on its face a \u201creasonable\u201d rule governing the union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>member\u2019s responsibility to the union. There is thus no reason to deviate from the general rule against upholding a statute in part where the remainder trespasses on free speech rights. <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 97-98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 741-742, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Our view that the free speech guarantee of the Bill of Rights in the LMRDA prohibits a complete prohibition on outside financial contributions to Union candidates gains support from the intent implicit in section 401(g) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(g), and the legislative history of that provision. Congress dealt in a comprehensive manner with the subject of financial support, including outside support, of candidates in Union elections in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(g).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Following such consideration Congress limited its restrictions on financial support to prohibiting any candidate from using moneys collected as union \u201cdues, assessment, or similar [levies]\u201d and to providing that \u201cno moneys of an employer shall be contributed or applied to promote\u201d any candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Prior to the enactment of the LMRDA in 1959 the Select Senate Committee ferreted out widespread corruption, dictatorship and racketeering in a number of large international unions. The Committee found that the President of the Bakery and Confec-tionary Workers\u2019 International Union of America had \u201crailroaded through changes in the union constitution which destroyed any vestigial pretenses of union democracy.\u201d Select Committee Report, <em>supra, </em>at 129. It reported that Dave Beck, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \u201cshamefully enriched himself at [the] expense [of the union members] and that in the final instance he capitulated to the forces within the union who promoted the interests of racketeers and hoodlums.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. The Committee likewise found Teamster officials joining with others to take over illegal gambling operations with an \u201cunderworld combine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 38-39, and the top officers of the United Textile Workers of America avariciously misappropriating union funds, <em>id. </em>at 159. \u201cDemocracy [was] virtually nonexistent\u201d in the International Union of Operating Engineers because the union was ruthlessly dominated through \u201cviolence, intimidation and other dictatorial practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437. Practices in the Teamsters \u201cadvanced the cause of union dictatorship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. The Committee cited other similar instances of widespread abuses in its 462-page Report.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">With such highly objectionable conditions disclosed in the hearings of the Select Committee preceding enactment of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, it is likely that when Congress outlawed only union and employer campaign contributions, it intended to permit candidates for union office to obtain other outside financial support from legitimate sources. Obtaining some outside support would be a practical necessity in many cases if members were to have any realistic opportunity to oust such corrupt and dictatorial incumbents as the Select Committee found in some of the unions it examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-13\">Walter Reuther and James Hoffa have recognized that the <em>public </em>has a right to be concerned about unions. Reuther said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-14\">[I]n our rapidly changing and more closely interrelated and interdependent eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>nomic and political society, labor cannot be an island unto itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">Reuther, <em>Labor Leadership </em>\u2014 A <em>Public Service, </em>in E. Bakke, C. Kerr &amp; C. Anrod, Unions, Management and the Public 128 (2d ed. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">And Hoffa testified before the Select Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-7\">I recognize my responsibility to the general public. I think my record speaks for itself * * *. I believe that the more power there is concentrated into a labor organization, the more responsible and careful the unions must be not to lose the complete power of having the right to have a union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">Select Committee Report, <em>supra, </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">While it might be argued from the above Legislative history that Congress may not have intended to completely preempt the field by its provision prohibiting only the use of union and employer money, it is highly unreasonable to expect that Congress intended to leave the door open for as absolute a prohibition as is embodied in Section 27. Such construction would leave union members practically at the mercy of every entrenched group of incumbents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-17\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-18\">Having found that the critical sentence in Section 27 not only violates 101(a)(4), but also in prohibiting outside contributions for traditional campaign purposes unreasonably impinges on the right of free speech and association guaranteed by section 101(a)(2), we must find that the outsider rule as set forth in the first sentence of Section 27 is invalid in its entirety.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-19\">The question remains whether any of the other provisions of Section 27 can survive. We conclude that they cannot with one exception. The remaining provisions of Section 27, except one, all provide in some manner for the enforcement of the prohibitions on candidates receiving any outside financial support<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as prohibited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>the first sentence of Section 27, and since we find such sentence to be invalid there is nothing left to enforce. We thus rule that the Administrative Committee shall not retain any of the power or authority derived from Section 27, with the one noted exception. Section 27(f) provides: \u201cif the International Executive Board deems it advisable\u201d said Board may determine that the Committee \u201cmay have such other powers as the ... Board determines are necessary for the implementation of ... any <em>other </em>Section [Section 27 excluded] of Article V.\u201d Union Const, art. V, \u00a7 27(f) (emphasis added). Since this case does not involve any <em>other </em>section of the Constitution, if the International Board considers it necessary to exercise this authority in connection with some <em>other </em>section of the Constitution, this opinion does not prohibit such action. However, such <em>other </em>powers could not be used in any way to implement any of the prohibitions attempted by Section 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">We agree with the district court in its judgment that the outsider rule violates the right to sue provision of the LMRDA. Our belief that the rule seriously impinges on the rights of free speech and association protected by section 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA leads us to agree with the district court that the <em>entire </em>rule must fall.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court enjoining the Union from implementing or enforcing Article V, Section 27 of the United Steelworkers of America Constitution in its entirety, with the aforesaid exception, and requiring the Union to publish notice in <em>Steel Labor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">We also affirm the dismissal of the Secretary of Labor from the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Because of the nearness of the upcoming election the clerk of court is hereby ordered to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">Article V, Section 27 of the Constitution of the United Steelworkers of America, adopted September 21,1978, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-11\">Sec. 27.

The other plaintiffs were Joseph Samargia, a potential candidate for Director of District 33; Edward Sadlowski, Sr., a retired union member who supported his son\u2019s candidacies in prior elections; Leonard S.

It has also been suggested that Section 27 constitutes an unreasonable qualification on union candidacy in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(e). 55 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. 769, 790-91 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-10\">No moneys received by any labor organization by way of dues, assessment, or similar levy, and no moneys of an employer shall be contributed or applied to promote the candidacy of any person in an election subject to the provisions of this subchapter [29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 481 \u2014 483]. Such moneys of a labor organization may be utilized for notices, factual statements of issues not involving candidates, and other expenses necessary for the holding of an election.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1184-16\">. Current newspaper stories report the possibility that some of the same conditions still continue. A March 12, 1981 United Press International news story reports \u201cMob Said to Control 4 National Unions.\u201d The news story relied upon a confidential Justice Department Report and referred to the Teamsters, Laborers, Longshoremen and the Hotel, Restaurant and Bartenders International Unions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">. The Union also contends that the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Democratic Party v. LaFollette, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1010, 67 L.Ed.2d 82 (1981), supports the validity of Section 27. We disagree. That decision upheld a rule of the Democratic Party that only voters who publicly recorded their preference for the Democratic Party could vote in the selection process for delegates to the national convention, against a Wisconsin law that permitted <em>any </em>voter to vote in a state election which purported to bind delegates to the Democratic National Convention in their votes on presidential candidates. The decision in <em>Democratic Party </em>is inapposite here. It frees elected delegates from being required at the National Convention to vote the preference for president expressed in an election which was <em>not </em>limited to publicly recorded Democrats, but in no way restricts any candidate for delegate from receiving financial support from independents and even from members of other parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">. Our authority to invalidate part of the Union Constitution comes from section 101(b) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-14\">Any provision of the constitution and bylaws of any labor organization which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be of no force or effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-15\">We also note that plaintiffs were not required to exhaust an available administrative remedy. The Union has not raised that point, and as explained by the court in <em>Ostrowski v. Utility Workers, Local 1-2, </em>104 L.R.R.M. 2343, 2345-46 (S.D.N.Y.1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-21\">Section 411(a)(4) [of Title 29 U.S.C.] provides that a union member \u201cmay be required to exhaust reasonable hearing procedures (but not to exceed a four-month lapse of time) with [his union], before instituting legal or administrative proceedings.\u201d The limitations of Section 411(a)(4) are permissive; thus, whether or not a plaintiff will be required to utilize his internal union appeals is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, [citing cases].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-22\">It is well-established that \u201ca free speech violation generally justifies dispensing with administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Keeffe Bros. v. Teamsters Local Union No. 592, </em>[562 F.2d 298, 303 (4th Cir. 1977)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-23\">In addition, \u201cbeneficial and fair requirements of administrative exhaustion should not be imposed absent realistic possibility of a meaningful remedy.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Yale University, </em>459 F.Supp. 1, 6 (D.Conn.1977). It is evident from these rules that plaintiffs were under no obligation to exhaust any remedy within the Union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1185-24\">. The remaining provisions of Article V, Section 27 may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-25\">(1) The International Executive Board was empowered to adopt regulations for the Union\u2019s Election Manual to implement the prohibitory provision of the first sentence and require reporting not more frequently than weekly by candidates and their supporters, to insure compliance with said Section.</p>\n<p id=\"abh-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>(2) A Campaign Contribution Administrative Committee composed of three persons who are not members of the Union was created to administer and enforce Section 27. Such Committee was authorized (a) to promote compliance with the \u201cprohibited support provision\u201d of Section 27; (b) to issue cease and desist orders directing any candidate or supporter to cure any violation of Section 27; (c) to require candidates and supporters to report such information as the Committee \u201cdeems appropriate\u201d and to review such information; (d) to declare a \u201ccandidate disqualified\u201d for a violation of Section 27 by the \u201ccandidate, or a supporter of a candidate\u201d; (e) to institute \u201clegal proceedings\u201d that it determines \u201cin its sole discretion ... are necessary for the enforcement of Section 27\u201d; (f) to recommend amendments to the regulations to the International Board and to have \u201csuch other powers as the International Executive Board determines are necessary for the implementation of ... Section 27\u201d; and (g) to make decisions with respect to the administration of Section 27 that \u201cshall be final and binding, and not subject to review by any tribunal within the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-14\">See the Appendix to this opinion for the complete text of Section 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1186-15\">. It is thus unnecessary to decide whether there was sufficient \u201cstate action\u201d to raise First Amendment questions.
