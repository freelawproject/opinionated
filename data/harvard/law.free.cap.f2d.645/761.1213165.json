Gaines, the plaintiff-appellant herein, appeals from an order of dismissal and summary judgment for defendants (Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and a number of former and present directors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>officers of Lockheed) in a shareholder lawsuit alleging both derivative claims of breach of fiduciary duty/waste of corporate assets and class action claims of federal securities violations. Gaines assigns a variety of errors by the District Court and seeks partial summary judgment and/or remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">From as early as 1961 to as late as 1975, Lockheed engaged in the practice of hiring \u201cconsultants\u201d and \u201cforeign sales agents\u201d and paying them large fees and commissions in connection with foreign sales of Lockheed aircraft and equipment. Approximately $30-38 million was paid directly to foreign governments and officials during this period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly after the existence of these clandestine, \u201coff the books\u201d questionable payments was revealed by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and United States Senate proceedings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in July-August 1975, Gaines \u2014 an individual Lockheed shareholder \u2014 commenced his lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gaines\u2019 complaint, filed on February 24, 1976, asserts two derivative causes of action on behalf of the corporation and two class action counts on behalf of the shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">The derivative causes of action\u2014 based on California law since Lockheed is a California corporation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 allege that the individual defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> breached their fiduci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ary duty to the corporation and \u201cwasted\u201d corporate assets by authorizing, employing, and affirmatively concealing corrupt business practices (i. e., the practice of paying large \u201csales commission,\u201d \u201cconsulting fees,\u201d and outright bribes to foreign purchasers, foreign government officials, and their agents) which resulted in \u201cno use or benefit to Lockheed whatsoever\u201d (Complaint, 143(a), <em>see id. </em>1143(c), (e), 44) and tarnished Lockheed\u2019s image and goodwill. <em>See id. </em>1117, 30. The class action counts\u2014 based on federal securities law \u2014 allege that defendants-appellees (hereinafter \u201cappellees\u201d) violated the filing and proxy requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cthe 1934 Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78m <em>&amp; </em>78n, by (1) failing to disclose the existence and details of the questionable foreign payments to the shareholders in proxy solicitation materials each year from 1961-74, and (2) by filing materially false and misleading annual and other periodic financial reports on behalf of Lockheed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Gaines\u2019 federal class action claims seek a permanent injunction barring Lockheed from making further improper or undisclosed payments, filing materially false or misleading proxy materials or periodic financial reports, or maintaining any undisclosed accounts. Gaines also seeks a declaration invalidating past elections, removing certain directors, appointing a special master to investigate the payments made, approving new proxy materials, requiring amendment of prior filings, and requiring an accounting of payments made. Gaines does not seek any damages in his \u00a7 13(a) or \u00a7 14(a) claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The <em>derivative </em>causes of action seek restitution and money damages for \u201cany and all\u201d disbursements and expenditures in connection with the alleged corrupt business practices and improper foreign payments, including interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Apart from the commencement of Gaines\u2019 lawsuit, the revelation of Lockheed\u2019s foreign payments in July-August 1975 precipitated several other events.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On February 2, 1976, the Lockheed board of directors appointed a Special Review Committee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (SRC), whose investigation was assisted by the New York law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling and the accounting firm Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. and was directed by the SRC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>counsel, former United States District Judge Arnold Bauman. On April 13, 1976, and in response to an SEC complaint, <em>see SEC v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>[1975-1976 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. 195,509 (CCH) (D.D.C.1976), Lockheed entered into a consent decree and permanent injunction which enjoined future improper payments, improper accounting methods, and other forms of concealment; required amendment of prior SEC filings; provided for an internal corporate investigation and report procedures to be conducted under SEC supervision; and ordered other remedial actions. On June 23, 1978, Lockheed agreed to a consent order of the Federal Trade Commission containing even more sweeping prohibitions than those contained in the SEC permanent injunction. <em>See In re Lockheed Corp., </em>[1976-79 Transfer Binder] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) 1121,454 (FTC Dkt. C-2942, Aug. 17, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The SRC conducted a fourteen-month investigation, interviewed more than 250 witnesses, and issued a report (dated May 16, 1977) to the Lockheed board, the SEC, and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on May 26, 1977. The SRC report, which concluded that Lockheed had, with the approval and participation of several senior executives, made $30-38 million in questionable and \u201coff the books\u201d foreign payments, was distributed to all Lockheed shareholders on June 10, 1977. The SRC report contained a \u201csecret\u201d two-volume appendix prepared by Judge Bau-man, which the District Court placed under a protective order on June 10, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">On April 20, 1977, the Lockheed board appointed a Special Litigation Committee<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (SLC), and delegated to it the full power and authority of the board of directors with respect to the then-pending derivative lawsuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The SLC, composed of four non-defendant outside directors, retained independent outside counsel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, over a period of ten months, considered the factual and legal merit of Gaines\u2019 lawsuit. In its March 14, 1978 report, the SLC detailed the factual background of Gaines\u2019 lawsuit, enumerated and analyzed a series of factors it deemed definitive of Lockheed\u2019s interest in pursuing the suit,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and unanimously concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>that \u201csound business judgment as to the interests of Lockheed in light of the circumstances and legal considerations here present leads directly and clearly to the conclusion that the claims asserted in the derivative cases should not be pursued against any of the defendants.\u201d Special Litigation Committee Report at 41. Consistent with its decision that the pursuit of the derivative litigation was not in the best interests of the corporation or its shareholders, on March 14,1978, the SLC directed its counsel to seek dismissal of the derivative claims. Shortly thereafter, Lockheed authorized counsel to seek dismissal of the federal class action claims. These motions were filed in the District Court on April 17, 1978.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">THE DISTRICT COURT DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"apk-dedup-0\">Judge Whelan\u2019s order of summary judgment for appellees was entered on April 20, 1979. The District Court opinion, which contains findings of fact<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and conclusions of law, is entitled \u201cMemorandum of Grounds Supporting Decision Granting Summary Judgment\u201d [hereinafter \u201cDistrict Court Memorandum\u201d]. Judge Whelan granted summary judgment for appellees on the derivative state law claims because a Special Litigation Committee of disinterested directors, appointed by the full board, had unanimously determined in the exercise of its lawfully delegated<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> independent business judgment that pursuing legal claims against the individual appellees would not be in the best interests of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">The District Court determined that the decision of the SLC to terminate the derivative lawsuit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-13\">was made in good faith after consideration of relevant factors. There was no fraud, collusion, or other conduct of a breach of trust nature on the part of any member of the Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-14\">The Committee\u2019s business judgment is not grossly unsound. It cannot be concluded that it did not represent the Committee\u2019s honest and independent judgment. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-15\">The Court may not substitute its judgment for the good faith business judgment of the Committee which is charged with the conduct of the business of the corporation in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-16\">There are no genuine issues of material fact to be tried herein with regard to the Committee\u2019s exercise of its business judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">District Court Memorandum at 7. Judge Whelan based his holding on this issue on California law. <em>See Findley v. Garrett, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 166, 174, 240 P.2d 421, 426 (1952). His ruling presaged this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>615 F.2d 778 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>101 S.Ct. 206, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980), which is discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The District Court also dismissed Gaines\u2019 federal securities claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because Gaines did not allege in his complaint that he purchased or sold Lockheed stock in reliance on Lockheed\u2019s allegedly false and misleading proxy statements and did not allege that he actually granted a proxy based on the allegedly false and misleading proxy solicitation materials, the District Court held that Gaines did not have standing to assert a nonderivative \u00a7 14(a) cause of action. \u201cTo maintain an [individual, nonderivative] action under Section 14(a), plaintiffs must allege that they granted a proxy based on the alleged false and misleading proxy solicitations .... <em>Klaus v. Hi-Shear Corp., </em>528 F.2d 225 (9th Cir. 1975).\u201d District Court Memorandum at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Moreover, because Gaines had not alleged any direct relationship between the proxy materials distributed and the improper foreign payments, Judge Whelan dismissed Gaines\u2019 \u00a7 14(a) claim for lack of \u201ccasual connection\u201d between the alleged violation and the alleged injury. Alternatively, the District Court dismissed the \u00a7 14(a) claim because Gaines sought only declaratory and injunctive relief and Lockheed had already entered into a consent decree and permanent injunction with the SEC, which enjoined future foreign payments, corrupt and improper business practices, and other conduct that served as the gravamen of Gaines\u2019 federal claims. The consent decree also required Lockheed to implement certain reforms and to amend and correct its prior SEC filings. Judge Whelan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACB\">For a grant of injunctive or declaratory relief, the plaintiffs must show that irreparable harm will occur in the absence of such relief. Injunctive relief is not proper where a prior injunction restraining the same conduct has been obtained and is still in force ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">[I]njunctive and declaratory relief is improper as a matter of law under these facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">District Court Memorandum at 9.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A66\">The test to be applied in reviewing the grant or denial of a summary judgment motion is that summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue of any material fact or when viewing the evidence and the inferences which may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the adverse party, the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law. <em>Smith v. Gross, </em>604 F.2d 639, 641 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Great Western Bank &amp; Trust v. Kotz, </em>532 F.2d 1252, 1254 (9th Cir. 1976) (per curiam). Phrased differently, an appellate court reviewing a summary judgment \u201cneed decide only whether any genuine issue of material fact remains for trial and whether the substantive law was correctly applied.\u201d <em>Inland Cities Express, Inc. v. Diamond National Corp., </em>524 F.2d 753, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>754 (9th Cir. 1975). <em>See Dressier v. MV Sandpiper, </em>331 F.2d 130, 133-34 (2d Cir. 1964) (vague and conclusory allegations by party moved against will not prevent a court from screening out \u201csham issues of fact\u201d and determining whether \u201cone side has no real support for its version of the facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">As with motions for summary judgment, in reviewing a motion to dismiss, the appellate court should construe the allegations of the complaint favorably to the pleader. <em>De La Cruz v. Tormey, </em>582 F.2d 45, 48 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 965, 99 S.Ct. 2416, 60 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Ordinarily, an appellate court can freely review questions of law. <em>Miller v. United States, </em>587 F.2d 991, 994 (9th Cir. 1978). However, when a federal court is in the position of interpreting state law with no definitive guidance from the state\u2019s highest court, <em>see Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, </em>387 U.S. 456, 465, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 1782, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967), we accord \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the district judge\u2019s interpretation or construction of the law of the state in which he sits. <em>Kabatoff v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>627 F.2d 207, 209 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Associated General Contractors v. San Francisco Unified School District, </em>616 F.2d 1381, 1384 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 783, 66 L.Ed.2d 603 (1980); <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>615 F.2d 778, 781 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 206, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980); <em>Mesa Oil Co. v. Business Men\u2019s Assurance Co. of America, </em>476 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1003, 94 S.Ct. 358, 38 L.Ed.2d 239 (1973). The District Court\u2019s construction of state law will be accepted on review unless it is \u201cclearly wrong\u201d or \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Gee v. Tenneco, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 857, 861 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Owens v. White, </em>380 F.2d 310, 315 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">On appeal, Gaines challenges the order of summary judgment for appellees on the derivative state law claims and the dismissal of the \u00a7 14(a) cause of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Specifically, the issues in this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">1. Whether the District Court correctly applied the \u201cbusiness judgment rule\u201d to the SLC\u2019s decision to terminate Gaines\u2019 derivative state law claims alleging breach of fiduciary duties by the individual appellees and, if so, whether triable issues of fact exist regarding the special investigative and litigation committees\u2019 compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">2. Whether the District Court erred in dismissing the \u00a7 14(a) claim on the basis of its holdings that (a) only a shareholder who has himself given a proxy to management has legal \u201cstanding\u201d in a nonderivative shareholder action under \u00a7 14(a); and (b) \u201ccausal nexus\u201d ' between proxy materials and shareholder injury is lacking as a matter of law when an equitable \u00a7 14(a) claim is premised on failure to disclose director misconduct and/or mismanagement (other than self-dealing) in proxy solicitation materials for director elections.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the District Court\u2019s invocation of the business judgment rule and dismissal of Gaines\u2019 \u00a7 14(a) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">I. The Business Judgment Rule and Corporate Decisions to Terminate Derivative Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">In <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>615 F.2d 778 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 101 S.Ct. 206, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980), this court decided that, as a matter of California law, a corporation\u2019s board of directors may delegate to a disinterested \u201cspecial litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>committee\u201d the business judgment authority to dismiss a shareholder derivative lawsuit brought on behalf of the corporation against some of the directors. While <em>Lewis </em>is not identical to the instant <em>case </em>\u2014 Lewis determined only the legal <em>authority </em>of the delegation and exercise of the \u201cbusiness judgment rule\u201d; did not pass on the factual determination of whether the committee acted in good faith; and involved derivative <em>federal </em>securities claims \u2014 it lends strong support to the District Court\u2019s holding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Drawing on analogous decisions by intermediate appellate courts in California \u2014 for the California Supreme Court had not (and still has not) faced the precise issue <em>sub judice </em>\u2014 this court in <em>Lewis </em>amplified the general common law \u201cbusiness judgment rule\u201d in two important respects.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, <em>Lewis </em>held that a board of directors\u2019 general management responsibility and discretion \u2014 including the decision whether to pursue a cause of action \u2014 may be delegated to a committee of directors.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The committee\u2019s <em>good faith </em>decision that dismissing a derivative action would be in the best interests of the corporation, even if that decision is negligent, bars any further legal action by the shareholder. 615 F.2d at 780, 783-84. The second, and related, holding of <em>Lewis </em>is that even when \u201ca majority of the board is charged with wrongdoing in the very action sought to be dismissed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 782, they may appoint a committee of disinterested directors \u201cto make an independent determination of the merits of the [derivative] action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The application of the business judgment rule to boards of directors with \u201cinterested\u201d majorities is not improper because \u201cthe directors who are accused of wrongdoing have not decided to dismiss the case,\u201d <em>id., </em>a committee of disinterested directors has. <em>See Gall v. Exxon Corp., </em>418 F.Supp. 508, 517 (S.D.N.Y.1976).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">We noted in <em>Lewis </em>that the Eighth Circuit and the New York Court of Appeals have similarly extended the business judgment rule. <em>See Abbey v. Control Data Corp., </em>603 F.2d 724, 727-30 (8th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1017, 100 S.Ct. 670, 62 L.Ed.2d 647 (1980) (applying Delaware law); <em>Auerbach v. Bennett, </em>47 N.Y.2d 619, 629-36, 419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 926-30, 393 N.E.2d 994 (1979) (applying New York law). <em>\u201cAuerbach </em>and <em>Abbey </em>reflect a clear trend in corporate law, and we are confident that a California court would follow this trend.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>615 F.2d at 783. The role of a court in this situation is limited to determining the disinterested independence of the committee members and the appropriateness and sufficiency of the investigative procedures chosen and pursued by the committee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Gaines urges this court to distinguish or limit our holding in <em>Lewis, </em>and even to overrule it outright. We decline this invitation to retreat from <em>Lewis, </em>for Gaines has offered no persuasive authorities suggesting that this court\u2019s reading of California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>law is no longer tenable. In fact, the developing trend in corporate law we discerned in <em>Lewis </em>has become unmistakably clear. <em>See, e. g., Genzer v. Cunningham, </em>498 F.Supp. 682 (E.D.Mich.1980) (applying Michigan law). In addition to <em>Abbey </em>and <em>Auerbach, </em>many well-reasoned district court decisions have adopted the position that a board of directors may lawfully delegate to a disinterested minority committee the business judgment authority to terminate shareholder derivative litigation because it is either not meritorious or not in the best interests of the corporation. <em>See Maldonado v. Flynn, </em>485 F.Supp. 274 (S.D. N.Y.1980) (on remand) (applying Delaware law); <em>Rosengarten v. ITT Corp., </em>466 F.Supp. 817, 822-24 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>Gall v. Exxon Corp., </em>418 F.Supp. 508, 514-15 (S.D. N.Y.1976) (applying New Jersey law). The contrary holding of the Delaware Chancery Court, an inferior state court, does not counter this trend or impugn our interpretation of California law. <em>Maldonado v. Flynn, </em>413 A.2d 1251 (Del.Ch.1980). <em>Cf. Maher v. Zapata Corp., </em>490 F.Supp. 348 (S.D.Tex.1980) (following the Delaware Chancery Court\u2019s interpretation of Delaware law); <em>Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., </em>495 F.Supp. 713, 717-18 (E.D.Va. 1980) (applying Virginia law).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Therefore, we hold that <em>Lewis v. Anderson </em>controls in this case. The Special Litigation Committee\u2019s decision to terminate Gaines\u2019 derivative state law cause of action is, if made in good faith by a disinterested committee of directors, dispositive of Gaines\u2019 state law claims. The District Court\u2019s prescient anticipation of the <em>Lewis </em>interpretation is, in addition, entitled to \u201csubstantial deference\u201d and must be affirmed unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Gaines contends, however, that various factors require remand to the District Court for further findings of fact on the appropriateness and sufficiency of the investigative procedures chosen and pursued by the SLC. Specifically, Gaines argues that Lockheed\u2019s delay in establishing the SLC until a year after this suit was commenced is attributable to shopping around for a \u201cfriendly\u201d committee. Gaines also alleges that the participation of two \u201cdeeply involved\u201d directors in the formation and investigation of the SRC sufficiently tainted the investigative structure and procedures by the later SLC to preclude summary judgment on this issue. Gaines also asserts that the District Court applied an erroneous legal standard in determining the propriety of the SLC\u2019s exercise of business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">While we are mindful of the need to scrutinize carefully the mechanism by which directors delegate to a minority committee the business judgment authority to terminate derivative litigation,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> particularly when the lawsuit is directed against some or a majority of the directors, we find that Gaines has not raised a triable issue of fact on this issue. The record establishes beyond question that the SLC was composed of independent outside directors whose investigation and recommendations were not tainted by the attenuated involvement of \u201cinterested\u201d directors in the formation and preliminary investigation of the SRC. The record also establishes beyond question that the SLC\u2019s investigatory procedures were adequate. See <em>generally Radobenko v.

Gaines challenges both of the District Court\u2019s alternative bases for dismissal\u2014 that Gaines lacked \u201cstanding\u201d to bring a nonderivative action because he himself had not granted a proxy in reliance on the allegedly misleading solicitation materials and that Gaines\u2019 complaint failed to allege the requisite \u201ctransactional causation\u201d or \u201ccausal nexus.\u201d Resolution of these issues requires a brief overview of the \u00a7 14(a) cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person, by the use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of any facility of a national securities exchange or otherwise, <em>in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe </em>as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect to any security (other than an exempted security) registered pursuant to section 787 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">(Emphasis added.)

We hold that the policies of \u00a7 14(a) and established doctrine in analogous securities contexts support the <em>Klaus v. Hi-Shear </em>position: shareholders who do not rely on allegedly misleading or deceptive proxy solicitations lack standing to assert direct (as opposed to derivative) equitable actions under \u00a7 14(a). Therefore, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Gaines\u2019 \u00a7 14(a) claim for lack of standing is affirmed. We do not, however, rest our decision solely on this rationale. Even had Gaines granted a proxy to Lockheed\u2019s management on the basis of the allegedly defective proxy solicitations, his \u00a7 14(a) count would still have been properly dismissed for failure to state a claim. The causation and materiality elements of a \u00a7 14(a) cause of action are discussed next.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">B. <em>Transactional Causation and Materiality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Gaines\u2019 \u00a7 14(a) claim is ultimately premised on appellees\u2019 failure to disclose \u201ccorrupt and improper foreign payments\u201d and related corporate misconduct to the Lockheed shareholders in the proxy solicitation materials for director elections each year from 1961 to 1975. The real issue in this appeal is whether, and in what circumstances, management\u2019s failure to disclose particular conduct to the shareholders states a \u00a7 14(a) cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">The precise roles of \u201cmateriality,\u201d \u201ccausation-in-fact,\u201d and \u201cproximate cause\u201d in federal securities litigation are often unclear. <em>See, e. g., Piper v.

Electric Auto-Lite Co., </em>396 U.S. at 385, 90 S.Ct. at 622 (\u201cWhere there has been a finding of materiality, a shareholder has made a sufficient showing of causal relationship between the violation and the injury for which he seeks redress if, as here, he proves that the proxy solicitation itself, rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials, was an essential link in the accomplishment of the [corporate] transaction.\u201d), this rationale \u2014 the equation of causation to materiality \u2014 is logically limited to situations in which shareholder approval was sought (and fraudulently secured) for a transaction requiring such approval, typically so-called \u201cfundamental corporate changes.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In <em>Mills, </em>for instance, the Supreme Court made clear that \u00a7 14(a) was intended to ensure that proxies would be solicited with \u201c \u2018explanation to the stockholder of the real nature of the questions <em>for which authority to cast his vote is sought,\u2019 \u201d </em>396 U.S. at 381, 90 S.Ct. at 620 (emphasis added), <em>quoting </em>H.R.Rep.No.1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1934); S.Rep.No.792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1934). The purpose of \u00a7 14(a) was clearly to prohibit management from deceptively securing stockholder approval for transactions requiring such approval. <em>See </em>396 U.S. at 384-85, 90 S.Ct. at 621-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Thus, for <em>damages </em>claims relating to the directors\u2019 failure to disclose misconduct and/or mismanagement (other than self-dealing or fraud against the corporation), there is no \u201ccausal nexus\u201d or \u201ctransactional causation,\u201d without regard to the issue of materiality, so long as the underlying transaction did not require shareholder approval.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The directors\u2019 failure to disclose the questionable foreign payments (or other alleged misconduct) is not the legal cause of the pecuniary loss to the corporation, if any. As Judge Henley stated for the Eighth Circuit in <em>Abbey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">Any injury to CDC shareholders from the corporation\u2019s illegal foreign payments stems directly from the corporate waste and mismanagement involved in authorizing those payments and not from allegedly misleading proxy solicitations dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>with unrelated corporate business matters. Consequently, we determine that Abbey\u2019s \u00a7 14(a)'claim is ... at best marginally related to the federal policies underlying that section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">603 F.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In <em>In re Tenneco Securities Litigation, </em>449 F.Supp. 528 (S.D.Tex.1978), the district court employed similar reasoning in dismissing a \u00a7 14(a) claim predicated on the nondisclosure of questionable foreign payments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">The harm to the plaintiffs must have resulted from the corporate transaction they authorized as a result of the false or misleading proxy solicitation. This \u201ctransactional causation\u201d is an essential element of a [\u00a7] 14(a) action....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">In the instant case, the only \u201ccorporate transaction\u201d authorized by the shareholders was the election of directors. The [\u00a7] 14(a) violation alleged by the plaintiffs is the failure of the director-candidates to include in their proxy solicitation that they had made the allegedly illegal payments. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">In order to recover damages under [\u00a7] 14(a) the proxy violation must have caused the economic harm alleged. The economic loss alleged here is the amount of corporate funds allegedly expended for the payments.... Such acts of corporate waste and breach of fiduciary duty form the bases of state claims and do not state a claim under the federal securities laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 531 (citations omitted). We conclude that the \u201ccausal nexus\u201d or \u201ctransactional causation\u201d formulation is the preferable mode of analysis for \u00a7 14(a) causes of action pertaining to corporate wrongdoing that did not itself require shareholder approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">The \u201ctransactional causation\u201d approach, which we adopt, requires that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Gaines\u2019 equitable \u00a7 14(a) claim \u2014 to the extent that his claim or requested relief relates to the payments themselves \u2014 be affirmed. <em>See Rosengarten v. ITT Corp., </em>466 F.Supp. 817, 827-28 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>Herman v. Beretta, </em>[1978 Transfer Binder] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) \u00b696,574 (S.D.N.Y.1978); <em>Limmer v.

Brothers, </em>395 F.Supp. 773, 776-77 (N.D.Okla.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">For equitable and declaratory relief claims relating to the <em>election of directors, </em>alleged to have been facilitated by the nondisclosure of the underlying misconduct, the causation approach presents problems; as the Second Circuit noted in <em>Weisberg v. Coastal States Gas Corp.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-13\">In [\u00a7 14(a) suits for damages predicated on the directors\u2019 subsequent failure to disclose corporate misconduct to the shareholders in proxy solicitations], the plaintiff sought damages because of allegedly improper payments, which did not require shareholder approval. The causal link between the proxy solicitation for the election of directors and the injury complained of \u2014 the improper payments\u2014 was attenuated at best. In the instant case, however, the challenged \u201ctransaction\u201d is the election of the directors, and we have no doubt that the \u201cproxy solicitation itself ... was an essential link in the accomplishment\u201d of that transaction, within the meaning of <em>Mills.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">609 F.2d at 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">We agree with the <em>Weisberg </em>court that when the plaintiff-shareholder attacks only the election itself, instead of seeking money damages or other relief for the underlying misconduct, the proper analysis shifts from causation to materiality. We draw a sharp distinction, however, between allegations of director misconduct involving breach of trust or self-dealing \u2014 the nondisclosure of which is presumptively material \u2014 and allegations of simple breach of fiduciary duty/waste of corporate assets\u2014 the nondisclosure of which is never material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>for \u00a7 14(a) .purposes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See Bertoglio v. Texas International Co., </em>488 F.Supp. 630, 650 (D.Del.1980); <em>Lewis v. Valley, </em>476 F.Supp. 62, 65-66 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (plaintiffs \u00a7 14(a) claim based on nondisclosure of questionable foreign payments in proxy solicitations ordered dismissed because, without element of self-dealing, the undisclosed information was not material); <em>Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union v.

Stevens &amp; Co., </em>475 F.Supp. 328, 330-32 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 14(a) claim premised on nondisclosure in proxy solicitations of directors\u2019 asserted policy to thwart the federal labor laws ordered dismissed because, lacking self-dealing, such information is not material).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The Second Circuit in <em>Weisberg </em>discussed this distinction without resolving it. <em>See </em>609 F.2d at 654-55. To the extent that Weisberg-alters the self-dealing/simple mismanagement dichotomy explicitly enunciated in <em>Maldonado v. Flynn,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> Abbey v. Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>trol Data Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Galef v. Alexander, </em>615 F.2d 51, 65 (2d Cir. 1980),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we decline to follow it. The distinction between \u201cmere\u201d bribes and bribes coupled with kickbacks to the directors makes a great deal of sense, indeed, is fundamental to a meaningful concept of materiality under \u00a7 14(a) and the preservation of state corporate law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Weisberg, </em>609 F.2d at 654-55 (pretermitting the issue and concluding that \u201c[bjecause plaintiff\u2019s allegations of a coverup of massive bribes <em>and of kickbacks to the directors, if true, would be material to the shareholders in deciding whether to re-elect directors, </em>we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s complaint was prematurely dismissed\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Many corporate actions taken by directors in the interest of the corporation might offend and engender controversy among some stockholders. Investors share the same diversity of social and political views that characterizes the polity as a whole. The tenor of a company\u2019s labor relations policies,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> economic decisions to relocate or close established industrial plants, commercial dealings with foreign countries which are disdained in certain circles, decisions to develop (or not to develop) particular natural resources or forms of energy technology, and the promulgation of corporate personnel policies that reject (or embrace) the principle of affirmative action, are just a few examples of business judgments, soundly entrusted to the broad discretion of the directors, which may nonetheless cause shareholder dissent and provoke claims of \u201cwasteful,\u201d \u201cunethical,\u201d or even \u201cimmoral\u201d business dealings. Should corporate directors have a duty under \u00a7 14(a) to disclose all such corporate decisions in proxy solicitations for their re-election?<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We decline to extend the duty of disclosure under \u00a7 14(a) to these situations. While we neither condone nor condemn these and similar types of corporate conduct (including the now-illegal practice of questionable foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>payments), we believe that aggrieved shareholders have sufficient recourse to state law claims against the responsible directors and, if all else fails, can sell or trade their stock in the offending corporation in favor of an enterprise more compatible with their own personal goals and values.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Absent credible allegations of self-dealing by the directors or dishonesty or deceit which inures to the direct, personal benefit of the directors \u2014 a fact that demonstrates a betrayal of trust to the corporation and shareholders and the director\u2019s essential unfitness for corporate stewardship \u2014 we hold that director misconduct of the type traditionally regulated by state corporate law need not be disclosed in proxy solicitations for director elections. This type of mismanagement, unadorned by self-dealing, is simply not material or otherwise within the ambit of the federal securities laws. <em>Golub v. PPD Corp., </em>576 F.2d 759, 764-65 (8th Cir. 1978); see <em>Vaughn v. Tele-dyne, Inc., </em>628 F.2d 1214, 1221, 1222 (9th Cir. 1980). A contrary holding would place an unwarranted premium on the form rather than the substance of a shareholder\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and, moreover, would represent a move toward the federalization of corporate law that the Supreme Court has repeatedly and emphatically rejected.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Gaines\u2019 equitable \u00a7 14(a) claim relating to the election of Lockheed directors because the character of the alleged nondisclosures was immaterial as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">For the reasons adduced herein, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order of summary judgment on Gaines\u2019 derivative state law claims.

These directors, assuming Gaines\u2019 allegations are correct, were disqualified from serving as disinterested and independent board members for purposes of the business judgment decision whether to pursue Gaines\u2019 derivative lawsuit on behalf of Lockheed. Needless to say, these directors were also interested for purposes of excusing or rendering futile the Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.1 \u201cdemand\u201d requirement. Gaines contends further, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-15\">board members who are under the control or influence of the alleged wrongdoers (including current or former officers, employees, members.of outside counsel law firms, and others who have an economic or financial relationship to the alleged controlling wrongdoers) cannot be considered disinterested and independent directors under the business judgment doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">For this reason, Gaines argues, four additional Lockheed directors (J. Cross, C. Chappellet, W.M. Hawkins, and C.L. Johnson), making an 11/15 majority, were disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">We assume, without deciding, that in these circumstances Gaines\u2019 duty t\u00f3 \u201cdemand\u201d that the board of directors vindicate Lockheed\u2019s alleged injury in its own behalf would have been futile. <em>See </em>Complaint, j[ 41. We also assume, without deciding, that a majority of Lockheed\u2019s fifteen directors were \u201cinterested\u201d for purposes of the business judgment rule. It is uncertain whether allegations of \u201ccontrol or influence\u201d should suffice to divest a corporation\u2019s directors of their ability to make collective corporate decisions. <em>Compare Maldonado v.

Here, in contrast, the alleged \u2022 misleading statements and non-disclosures involve matters of direct and deep concern to shareholders in the exercise of their right to vote, which the Exchange Act expects to be fully disclosed in proxy solicitations for election of officers and directors. Indeed, the compensation of directors and key officers and transactions between them and their corporation are matters explicitly covered by SEC disclosure regulations.

We disagree. The federalizing effect of granting shareholders such an equitable \u00a7 14(a) cause of action would be <em>even greater </em>than in the damages context because no pecuniary injury to the corporation would be required to state a claim.

Green, </em>430 U.S. 462, 477-80, 97 S.Ct. 1292, 1302-05, 51 L.Ed. 480 (1977), the Supreme Court refused to find an implied cause of action under rule 10b-5 because the essence of the complaint was a breach of fiduciary duty of the type traditionally regulated by state law. Expanding implied causes of action under the federal securities law to encompass tangentially implicated instances of mismanagement would, the Court said, exceed Congress\u2019 intent, pose a danger of vexatious shareholder litigation, and create potentially insoluble conflicts between state and federal standards. \u201c[W]e are reluctant to federalize the substantial portion of the law of corporations that deals with transactions in securities, particularly where established state policies of corporate regulation would be overridden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 97 S.Ct. at 1304. <em>See Piper v.
