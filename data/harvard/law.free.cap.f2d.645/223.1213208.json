(the company) to bargain with Local 387, International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO (the union) upon the union\u2019s request, and to take other remedial action, for violating section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) and (1). We grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">The union was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the company\u2019s production employees after it prevailed by a vote of 47 to 22 in a Board conducted representation election held on April 27, 1979. The company and the union met several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>times prior to the election to discuss the election. Initially, the parties disagreed on the proper bargaining unit: the union felt that the sub-supervisors should be included, and the company contended that they should be excluded. On March 9, 1979, the union and the company stipulated that sub-supervisors should be excluded. The stipulation was approved by the Board\u2019s Regional Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The company filed a timely objection to the election, contending that it had been tainted by the pro-union activities of certain sub-supervisors. Among the challenged activities were the following: two out of the ten sub-supervisors distributed one union card each to an employee, four wore union buttons, three attended union meetings, one signed a union authorization card, one transmitted an employee\u2019s signed union card to another employee, and five made pro-union statements. The evidence shows that many of the sub-supervisors\u2019 pro-union statements were made in response to employee inquiries.' Furthermore, with the exception of one pro-union comment by a sub-supervisor, all the challenged activity took place prior to the March 9th stipulation which was made a full seven weeks prior to the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Regional Director found the company\u2019s objection to the election to be without merit and recommended in his written report that the Board certify the union as the exclusive bargaining agent. The company then filed exceptions to the report requesting either that a hearing be held on its objection or that the election be set aside or both. The Board denied the company\u2019s hearing request and adopted the recommendation of the Regional Director that the union be certified as the employees\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative. Shortly thereafter the union wrote the company requesting it to bargain with it, and the company refused.,</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The question we must resolve is whether the Board\u2019s conclusion that the election was not tainted by the sub-supervisors\u2019 union activities should be upheld. The burden is on the party objecting to an election to show that the challenged activity has prejudiced the outcome of the election. <em>NLRB v. Bata Shoe Co., </em>377 F.2d 821, 826 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 917, 88 S.Ct. 238, 19 L.Ed.2d 265 (1967). An election will not be set aside unless the conduct of one of the parties has prevented employees from making their collective desires effective. <em>Schneider Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>390 F.2d 375, 378 (4th Cir. 1968). The determination of a valid election is within the sound discretion of the Board, and the Board should be reversed only when it has abused its discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The Fourth Circuit has taken a strict approach to extensive supervisory participation in union campaigns. In <em>Turner\u2019s Express, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>456 F.2d 289 (4th Cir. 1972), for example, in which the employer petitioned the court to set aside a Board bargaining order, the employer contended that the election should be set aside because of the pro-union activities of two supervisors. Two shop foremen of a trucking outfit, who had significant input into hiring, firing, and wage decisions, had voiced strong support for the union. Their union activities were substantial. They were largely responsible for bringing in a union organizer. They both interrogated employees about whether they intended to sign union authorization cards and to vote for the union, and they warned the employees that if they voted against the union, \u201cthings were going to get tough, and they would start paying for it after the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292. They told employees that they would get higher wages and more benefits if they voted for the union. Both supervisors also threatened employees who did not support the union. In finding that the supervisors\u2019 activities warranted setting aside the election, the court noted that it is not necessary for the employer to prove that supervisor pressure and coercion actually affected the result of the voting. <em>Id. </em>at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">We do not read <em>Turner\u2019s Express, Inc. </em>as establishing a per se rule invalidat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ing a union election if there is any evidence of pro-union supervisory activity. Instead, whether pro-union supervisory activity is sufficient to overturn an election depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The critical inquiry is whether the supervisors\u2019 pro-union activities prevented employees from freely effectuating their collective choice. <em>Schneider Mills, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>390 F.2d 375, 378 (4th Cir. 1968). Employees\u2019 free choice is stifled and an election may be set aside if the supervisors\u2019 activities \u201ccontain the seeds of potential reprisal, punishment, or intimidation.\u201d <em>NLRB v. San Antonio Portland Cement Co., </em>611 F.2d 1148, 1151 (5th Cir. 1980), <em>citing NLRB v. WKRG-TV, Inc., </em>470 F.2d 1302, 1316 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>accord, Global Marine Development of California, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>528 F.2d 92, 95 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 821, 97 S.Ct. 70, 50 L.Ed.2d 83 (1976). The activities of the supervisors in <em>Turner\u2019s Express </em>were obviously egregious, and there is no doubt that they were pervasive, coercive, and upsetting to election conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In contrast, the sub-supervisors\u2019 pro-union activities in our case were minimal; most occurred more than seven weeks prior to the election and prior to the time that the sub-supervisors were excluded from the bargaining unit. Unlike the situation in <em>Turner\u2019s Express, </em>there is no evidence in our case that the sub-supervisors initiated or were significantly involved in an offensive strategy to get the company organized. In fact, much of the sub-supervisors\u2019 activities, particularly their pro-union comments, were not initiated by the sub-supervisors but were made in response to employee inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Board\u2019s conclusions, based upon inferences drawn from conduct, should not be.set aside unless the conclusions transgress the bounds of reasonableness. <em>See Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>620 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir. 1980). We hold that there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the sub-supervisors\u2019 pro-union activities did not taint the election.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Even if we were to adopt a per se rule, the record shows that the company knew of sub-supervisory union activity both prior and subsequent to the date when the sub-supervisors were specifically designated supervisors and made no attempt to disavow it. If an employer is aware of a supervisor\u2019s union activities and then stands idly by, the employer cannot subsequently rely on the supervisor\u2019s conduct for setting aside a representation election. <em>NLRB v. Decatur Transfer &amp; Storage, Inc., </em>430 F.2d 763, 764 (5th Cir. 1970). <em>See NLRB v. Lord Baltimore Press, Inc., </em>300 F.2d 671, 673 (4th Cir. 1962) (advocacy of union by supervisor <em>unbeknownst to employer </em>is cause for annulment of election). Because of the company\u2019s knowledge of the sub-supervisors\u2019 activity, we find it estopped to complain about an unfair election.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">We cannot conclude that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to overturn the election. We thus hold that the election was valid, that the company had a duty to bargain with the union, and that its refusal to bargain constituted an unfair labor practice. Accordingly, we grant enforcement of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. The company claims that it was entitled to a hearing on its election objections. A hearing is necessary if there are substantial and material issues of fact relating to the validity of the election. <em>NLRB v. Bata Shoe Co., </em>377 F.2d 821, 825 (4th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>389 U.S. 917, 88 S.Ct. 238, 19 L.Ed.2d 265 (1967). To be entitled to a hearing, the objecting party must make a proffer of evidence \u201cwhich <em>prima facie </em>would warrant setting aside an election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826, <em>quoting NLRB v. O.K. Van Storage, Inc., </em>297 F.2d 74, 75 (5th Cir. 1961). A hearing is unnecessary when, if all the facts supporting the position of the objecting party were credited, no ground is shown for setting aside the election. 377 F.2d at 826. In light of our conclusion that the supervisors\u2019 pro-union activities were minimal, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to accord the company a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
