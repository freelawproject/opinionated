It does not and should not send them to prison to be beaten, maimed, savaged, even killed, by their fellow inmates. Excessive failure on the part of prison officials to protect inmates from such assaults, leading to a virtual \u201creign[] .. . [of] terror,\u201d has been justifiably held to constitute its own form of cruel and unusual punishment, forbidden by the eighth amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, unfortunately, sporadic outbreaks of violence have historically been associated with prison settings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>have traditionally stepped in to afford protective relief only when the level of violence reached unreasonable proportions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or to grant redress when a plaintiff showed a direct relationship between his injury and the negligence of prison officials.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">This case arises from an assault by one (or more) inmates upon another inmate at Lorton Reformatory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff, Larry Cannon, was stabbed and beaten by an unknown assailant(s) while attending an unsupervised gathering in the prison gymnasium. Contending that the attack would not have taken place but for the prison officials\u2019 negligent failure to provide appropriate security, appellant sued the United States for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq. </em>The Government moved before trial to dismiss the case on the ground that Lorton Reformatory is not a federal agency as defined by the Act, and therefore that the United States cannot be found liable for any negligence on the part of Lorton\u2019s officials. This motion was denied by the judge initially assigned to the case. <em>Cannon v. United States, </em>No. 77-0841 (D.D.C., May 17, 1978) (order denying motion to dismiss); Record on Appeal (\u201cR.\u201d) 14. After a three day trial before a different judge the district court held for the United States on the merits, finding both that the prison officials had not been negligent and that Cannon had \u201cassumed the risk\u201d of his injuries. Cannon now appeals from this unfavorable judgment. The Government both defends the trial judge\u2019s findings and asserts that the initial denial of its motion to dismiss was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-12\">We hold for the Government on the second ground. The motion to dismiss should have been granted because the FTCA does not render the United States liable for the negligent actions of Lorton prison officials. Since we so hold, we need express no view on the correctness of the court\u2019s rulings on the negligence and \u201cassumption of risk\u201d issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-13\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-14\">Cannon was tried and convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1969 of two counts of robbery and one count of assault with intent to commit rape.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Initially incarcerated in federal penitentiaries located in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Atlanta, Georgia, Cannon was transferred to Lorton Reformatory in 1972.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-15\">On June 5, 1974, Cannon, along with approximately 75 other inmates, attended a meeting held in Lorton\u2019s gymnasium to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>cuss their grievances and the possibility of a prison strike.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The meeting had not been authorized by prison officials, but rather had been called by the leaders of two rival prisoners\u2019 groups.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No guards were posted inside the gymnasium during the meeting. Cannon, a leader of a third prisoners\u2019 group called the ALERTS, actively participated in this discussion. After one particularly vigorous exchange with another prisoner, an unknown assailant(s) hit Cannon on the head with a lead pipe and stabbed him in the chest. Cannon spent six days in the hospital and prison infirmary recuperating from this attack; he claims it left him with permanent lung damage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The gist of his negligence claim is that the prison officials knew or should have known of the meeting and provided guards to ensure the safety of its participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">II. THE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Cannon claims the United States is liable under the FTCA because his injuries were \u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an[] employee of the Government.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Section 2671 of Title 28 U.S.C. defines an \u201cemployee of the Government\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A33\">officers or employees of any federal agency, members of the military or naval forces of the United States, and <em>persons acting on behalf of a federal agency </em>in an official capacity[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">(Emphasis supplied.) The same provision defines \u201cfederal agencpes]\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOdR\">the executive departments and independent establishment of the United States, and corporations primarily acting as in-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1191-10\">strumentalities or agencies of the United States <em>but does not include any contractor with the United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-11\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-12\">Cannon contends both (1) that Lorton Reformatory is an agency of the United States, as well as of the District of Columbia, and (2) that its employees, in any case, are \u201cpersons acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity\u201d when they undertake to supervise federal prisoners who have been committed to the legal custody of the Attorney General. The Government argues that Lorton, like the Nueces County jail in <em>Logue v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 521, 93 S.Ct. 2215, 37 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973), is sufficiently outside the sphere of direct federal control that it must be considered an independent contractor with the United States for the purposes of the FTCA. The Government contends that the statutory delegation of day-to-day control of Lorton to District authorities in 24 D.C. Code \u00a7 442 renders Lorton an independent contractor (or its functional equivalent) with the federal government for the purpose of caring for federal prisoners housed there, and thus precludes federal liability for torts occasioned in the performance of that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-13\">In denying the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction, the district court found it \u201cirrelevant that the District of Columbia Department of Corrections has charge of the actual management and regulation of the Lorton Reformatory\u201d as the \u201cdefendant was committed to the custody of the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 24-425.\u201d <em>Cannon v. United States, </em>No. 77-0841 (D.D.C., May 17, 1978) (order denying motion to dismiss); R. 14. In doing so, it relied on a prior opinion of this court, <em>Close v. United States, </em>397 F.2d 686 (D.C.Cir.1968), which held that a federal prisoner temporarily lodged in the District of Columbia Jail could sue under the Act for injuries due to the negligence of his jailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">A. <em>The Contractor Exception to the FTCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"afc-dedup-0\">1. The Scope of the Exception</p>\n<p id=\"AsJ\">The alternate theories on which Cannon\u2019s FTCA suit depends are that Lorton is a federal agency or that its employees were acting, with respect to Cannon, on behalf of a federal agency. Both fall if we conclude Lorton was a contractor with the United States or its functional equivalent under the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">In <em>Logue v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 521, 93 S.Ct. 2215, 37 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973), the parents of a federal pretrial detainee who committed suicide while lodged in a county jail pursuant to a contract between the Bureau and the county sued the federal government for damages under the FTCA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Like Cannon, they alleged that either the Nueces County jail was an agency of the United States or that the employees of that jail were \u201cacting on behalf of\u201d the federal government. 412 U.S. at 526, 93 S.Ct. at 2218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">The Court rejected both claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It held first that the jail could not be an agency of the federal government because it fell within the \u201c \u2018contractor\u2019 exemption from the definition of \u2018Federal agency\u2019 in \u00a7 2671.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then considered the argument advanced by the judges of the Court of Appeals who had dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that \u201ceven though the sheriffs\u2019 employees might not be \u2018employees\u2019 of a federal agency, they might nonetheless be \u2018acting on behalf of a Federal agency in an official capacity[.]\u2019\u201d 412 U.S. at 530, 93 S.Ct. at 2220. Reasoning that \u201csince it would be a rare situation indeed\u201d in which an independent contractor would not be performing tasks that could be performed by a salaried federal employee, the Court found that reading the clause to render the government liable for the activities of any person assuming the statutory obligations of the United States would make the contractor exception \u201cmeaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531-32, 93 S.Ct. at 2221. Therefore, the Court concluded, after surveying the relevant committee hearings, that the language is \u201cdesigned to cover special situations such as the \u2018dollar-a-year\u2019 man ... or an employee of another employer who is placed under direct supervision of a federal agency[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 93 S.Ct. at 2221. In sum, <em>Logue </em>says that the federal government cannot be held liable for the torts of employees of an independent contractor jailer whether that liability is predicated on the \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cacting on behalf of\u201d language in the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">2. The Definition of a \u201cContractor\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aej-dedup-1\">The statute nowhere defines the term \u201ccontractor.\u201d The legislative history of the FTCA is also barren of any direct reference to this exception.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>throughout the tortuous history of the Act, one theme continuously echoes: \u201c[t]he liability of the United States will be the same as that of a private person under like circumstance, in accordance with local law, except that no punitive damages and no interest prior to judgment may be recovered.\u201d S.Rep.No.1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1946). <em>See also </em>S.Rep.No.1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1942); H.R.Rep.No.2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1942). The Supreme Court has read that statement to indicate that \u201cthe \u2018contractor\u2019 exemption from the definition of \u2018Federal agency\u2019 in \u00a7 2671 ... adopt[s] the common-law distinction between the liability of an employer for the negligent acts of his own employees and his liability for the employees of a party with whom he contracts for a specified performance.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Logue v. United States, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 526-27, 93 S.Ct. at 2218-19. Relying on both the modern common law as reflected in the Restatement of Agency<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the law of Texas,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Court concluded in <em>Logue </em>that \u201cthe distinction between the servant or agent relationship and that of independent contractor turn[s] on the absence of authority in the principal to control the physical conduct of the contractor in performance of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 93 S.Ct. at 2219. The law of the District, like the law of Texas, adopts the Restatement\u2019s control-of-physical-conduct test to distinguish between employees and independent contractors.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-9\">B. <em>Does Lorton Fall Within the Contractor Exception?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-10\">Applying this control test to the facts in <em>Logue, </em>the Court held that the. Nueces County jail was a contractor with the federal government within the exception to the FTCA. It cited to the fact that the Nueces County jail was a \u201ccontract\u201d jail; the Bu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>reau had entered into a contractual relationship with the county whereby the United States Treasury paid the county for housing federal prisoners. The contractual relationship was authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4002, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-4\">For the purpose of providing suitable quarters for the safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons held under authority of any enactment of Congress, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons may contract, for a period not exceeding three years, with the proper authorities of any State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof, for the imprisonment, subsistence, care, and proper employment of such persons.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">The contract incorporated by reference the various standards of care contained in the statute and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> 412 U.S. at 523 n.2, 93 S.Ct. at 2217 n.2. However, it did not give the United States the authority to physically supervise the conduct of the jail\u2019s employees; it merely reserved to the United States \u201c \u2018the right to enter the institution ... at reasonable hours for the purpose of inspecting the same and determining the conditions under which federal offenders are housed.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 530, 93 S.Ct. at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">The Court found on the basis of these facts that this contract reflected a \u201cdivision of responsibility\u201d which \u201cclearly contemplated that the day-to-day operations of the contractor\u2019s facilities were to be in the hands of the contractor with the Government\u2019s role limited to the payment of sufficiently high rates to induce the contractor to do a good job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 93 S.Ct. at 2220. This division of responsibility demonstrated that the Nueces County jail employees were employees of an independent contractor and not employees of the United States within the meaning of the FTCA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>Lorton, however, is not a state or local institution; it is an \u201cintegral part of the District of Columbia correctional system.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Two lines of inquiry must be pursued, therefore, before we conclude that Lorton, like the Nueces County jail, falls under the same reasoning the Court employed in construing the contractor exception in <em>Logue. </em>First, we will analyze the <em>legal </em>relationship between Lorton and the United States Government to insure that Lorton is not in fact acting as an agency of the United States or its employees acting \u201con behalf of\u201d the United States. Second, we will examine the <em>actual </em>\u201cdivision of responsibility\u201d between the Bureau and the Department as it affects the care and treatment of federal prisoners housed in Lorton to see if \u2014 apart from statute or regulation \u2014 there are practical accommodations that evidence federal control over the institution so as to make it appropriate that the United States be held liable under the FTCA for the negligence of Lorton employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">1. The Legal Relationship Between Lor-ton and the Federal Government</p>\n<p id=\"A_f\">In 1909, Congress passed a special act<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> ordering the construction of Lorton Reformatory on federally owned property in Virginia. However, in 1946, Congress enacted a statute granting the governing body of the District of Columbia effective control over the Reformatory. 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 442, the 1946 Act, gives the Major and Council of the District of Columbia</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALWB\">charge of the <em>management and regulation </em>of the Workhouse at Occoquan in the State of Virginia, the Reformatory at Lorton in the State of Virginia, and the Washington Asylum and Jail, and [the] ... <em>responsibility] for the safekeeping, care, protection, instruction and discipline of all persons committed to such institutions.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">(Emphasis supplied.) The same statute explicitly delegates to the District of Columbia Council the \u201cpower to promulgate rules and regulations for the government of such institutions,\u201d and to the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, \u201cthe power to establish and conduct industries, farms, and other activities, to classify the inmates, and to provide for their proper treatment, care, rehabilitation, and reformation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">More recent legislative events confirm Congress\u2019 continued intention to let the District control the operation of Lorton. In 1970 and 1973, while considering passage of the Court Reform Act<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the Home Rule Act,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Congress debated whether to reassert federal control over Lorton. On both occasions, efforts spearheaded by Senator Scott of Virginia<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> to transfer its operational control to the Bureau of Prisons failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>The Reformatory is currently, and was at the time of Cannon\u2019s injury, staffed exclusively by employees of the Department.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> These employees were hired, trained by and responsible to the officials of that Department, not the Bureau.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As the district court in <em>Curry-Bey v. Jackson, </em>422 F.Supp. 926 (D.D.C.1976),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> recognized, the officials of the Department have the power to formulate the regulations and policies under which their employees operate, and are not bound by those formulated by the Bureau.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Department officials, in turn, are responsible to the Council and Mayor of the District of Columbia. According to the undisputed affidavit of Clair Cripe, Acting Director of the Bureau, \u201cthe D.C. Department of Corrections is an independent entity of the D.C. Government subject only to the supervision and control of the Mayor and Council of the District of Columbia.\u201d R. 10 (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 9 at 2). He further stated that 24 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 441-42 \u201cprecludes this office or the Attorney General from exercising any management control over the actions of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections as it regards the operation, classification and treatment of offenders contained within the penal facilities of that entity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">As far as fiscal control over Lorton is concerned, the federal government exercises no greater leverage over it than over any other District of Columbia facility or agency. Although Congress must still approve the District budget,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> it is the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>government which proposes the allocations of money in that budget for the various departments and agencies and, conversely, decides which agencies must undergo reductions in personnel and funds. Thus in 1980, District officials proposed the personnel cuts in Lorton operations.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> When they testified in support of those cuts, they compared their situation specifically to that of state correctional administrators.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It bears remembering that levels of inmate supervision in correctional facilities like Lorton are largely dependent on ratios of guards to inmates and the budget authority to hire such guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">In sum, we have not been presented with, nor have we been able to find, any evidence that Lorton\u2019s statutory or legal relationship to the federal government differs from that of other District of Columbia agencies. In the absence of such a distinction, we would be hard-pressed to deviate from the general rule that the District of Columbia and its agencies are not federal agencies for the purposes of the FTCA.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-10\"><em>2. </em>The \u201cContractual\u201d Relationship Between Lorton and the Federal Bureau of Prisons</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">In <em>Logue, </em>a contract defined the division of responsibility between the state and federal jailers. By contrast, no contract between Lorton or the Department and the Bureau or other federal agency acting on behalf of the Attorney General exists regarding the care of federal prisoners housed at Lorton. The appellant argues that this difference forecloses a holding that Lorton, like the Nueces County jail, is an independent contractor with the United States for the purposes of the FTCA. We find this argument meritless because the statutory and regulatory restraints on federal control over Lorton are the functional equivalent of the contract in <em>Logue. </em>The statutory authority for sending prisoners to state or local-run and District-run institutions is identical;<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> financial arrangements for the care of the United States Code offenders housed there are similar;<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>federal requirements as to the care and treatment of federal prisoners at Lorton are, if anything, less intrusive.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Lorton houses three classes of prisoners: those sentenced by the District of Columbia courts for District of Columbia Code offenses, a group with which we are not concerned here; those sentenced by the United States District Court for District of Columbia Code offenses, such as Cannon;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and those sentenced by the United States District Court for general federal crimes. Although 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 425 \u201ccommit[s] ... to the custody of the Attorney General\u201d all three types of prisoners, and additionally gives him the power to transfer these prisoners to other \u201cavailable, suitable, and appropriate institutions,\u201d the federal government differentiates between the latter two groups of prisoners for fiscal purposes. Lorton receives a per diem allowance, based upon an allocation of the facility\u2019s actual operating costs,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> for each federal prisoner charged or convicted of a general federal offense that it houses. No difference appears to exist between this arrangement and those the Bureau makes for the care of federal prisoners in state-run institutions. The District is financially responsible for the upkeep of all District of Columbia Code offenders, including Cannon; a statute assesses the District in a similar fashion for costs incurred by the federal government in housing District of Columbia Code offenders in federal penal institutions.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>The same regulations govern the commitment of federal prisoners to Lorton as to \u201ccontract\u201d facilities. The applicable regulations require the Bureau to provide \u201csuitable quarters for, and safekeeping, care and subsistence of,\u201d as well as \u201cprotection, instruction, and discipline\u201d of <em>\u201call </em>persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Bureau conducts periodic examinations of state and local facilities to ensure that they meet the Bureau's standards for \u201csuitability,\u201d although neither their regulations, contracts, nor internal policies provide for Bureau monitoring of the day-to-day programs and activities of these non-federal facilities.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Bureau, on the other hand, does not conduct any inspections of Lorton, on the basis of its belief that even this minimal intrusion would interfere with the power of supervision delegated by statute to the Mayor of the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 and the Attorney General\u2019s control of Cannon\u2019s jailers is even more attenuated than that found insufficient to establish federal liability under the FTCA by the Court in <em>Logue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">That this division of responsibility is established by statute rather than contract is irrelevant, insofar as liability under the FTCA is concerned. It effectively ensures that Lorton is no more under the day-to-day control of the federal government than are contracting state and local facilities.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-11\">3. The Actual Relationship Between Lorton and Federal Authorities</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-12\">The affidavit of the Acting Director of the Bureau of Prisons stated unequivocally:<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-13\">As the agency acting on behalf of the authority of the Attorney General with regard to the confinement of prisoners in the custody of the Attorney General this office does not exercise supervisory, management or monitoring control over the operation of the District of Columbia\u2019s Lorton Reformatory. In order to exercise a degree of power commensurate with the Attorney General\u2019s responsibility for the safekeeping of federal prisoners, whether sentenced pursuant to the D.C. Code or the U.S.Code, this office would have to conduct periodic program and management audits, direct the actions of, appoint and terminate employees, issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>and monitor implementation of such regulations deemed necessary to manage such facilities, and require the submission of continuing reports regarding the progress of individual offenders and the management of these penal facilities. It is the understanding of this office that the provisions of 24 D.C.Code 441 and 442 precludes this office or the Attorney General from exercising any management control over the actions of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections as it regards the operation, classification and treatment of offenders contained within the penal facilities of that entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The District of Columbia Department of Corrections official in charge of Lorton was equally adamant as to the lack of federal interference in Lorton\u2019s affairs. He testified at trial that the Attorney General does not supervise the day-to-day treatment of any inmates incarcerated there, and that the federal government neither issues guidelines regarding the operational management or daily activities of that institution nor even provides \u201cminimum\u201d standards that must be met in caring for federal prisoners.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">In view of this record and the total lack of contrary evidence, we conclude that the actual relationship between the federal government and Lorton is as described in statute and case law: the functional equivalent of the \u201ccontractor\u201d relationship that exists between the federal government and a state or county facility in which it lodges prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">4. The <em>Close </em>Case and Other Precedents</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Finally, appellant relies on several statutes and prior cases dealing with various aspects of the District-federal relationship, acknowledgedly a <em>sui generis </em>one, to provide a basis for bringing Lorton prisoners sentenced in a federal court under the Act. The most important precedent he cites, and upon which the district court relied in denying the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, is this court\u2019s decision in <em>Close v. United States, </em>397 F.2d 686 (D.C.Cir.1968). That case held that a federal prisoner injured through the negligence of his custodians at the District of Columbia Jail could sue the United States under the FTCA. In <em>Close, </em>decided both before <em>Logue </em>and the advent of the Home Rule legislation,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the court \u201csurmised,\u201d despite an affidavit from a Bureau official attesting that the District of Columbia Jail was not under the jurisdiction of the federal government, that the Attorney General\u2019s acknowledged <em>legal </em>custody over the prisoner meant \u201cit must be true or at least it does not appear from the record to the contrary that, as to this federal prisoner, the Attorney General had some degree of power, commensurate with his continuing responsibility, to supervise the D.C. jailer in his handling of this particular prisoner.\u201d 397 F.2d at 687 &amp; n.2. However, the <em>Close </em>case was decided before the Supreme Court definitively held in <em>Logue </em>that the federal government must have actual control over the <em>physical </em>conduct of prison employees engaged in the supervision and treatment of a prisoner at the time the injury occurred, not merely the <em>legal </em>authority to designate the place of his confinement, in order to hold it liable under the FTCA. Logue, like Cannon, had been committed to the custody of the Attorney General; yet the Court found that legal control insufficient to invoke liability in light of the state jailer\u2019s control over the way in which the prisoner\u2019s day-to-day supervision and care were carried out. This court is no longer free, especially in view of the contrary evidence contained in this record,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> to surmise that the legal control existing in <em>Close </em>and in this case necessarily gives rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>to the physical control deemed essential in <em>Logue </em>to accrue liability under the FTCA. To the extent <em>Close </em>holds that an actual demonstration of federal control over day-to-day supervisory operations of the prison is unnecessary for FTCA liability for injuries to prisoners in the legal custody of the Attorney General, we believe it has been superseded by Logue.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"avt-dedup-1\">The other cases cited by the appellant, which hold that the Attorney General has the power to determine furlough regulations for Lorton,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and that Lorton prisoners sentenced in United States district court have federal habeas corpus rights<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> are also inapposite, as those holdings arise from the power of a federal court to ensure that the custodians of persons it sentences are not violating their constitutional rights and from the undisputed legal custody of the Attorney General over all District of Columbia prisoners and his statutory right to transfer them at his will.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> That legal custody, as we have said, no longer suffices as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>either an independent basis for jurisdiction under the FTCA or as a basis for inferring the kind of day-to-day custodial control that <em>Logue </em>demands for such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Thus we conclude that Cannon sued the wrong government here; it is the District of Columbia, his immediate jailer, from whom he should have sought redress for his injuries allegedly suffered as a result of his jailers\u2019 negligence while a prisoner at Lor-ton. The case is accordingly remanded to the district court for entrance of an order dismissing the action for failure to state a claim under the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1189-17\">. <em>See Leonardo v.

The main goal of the Act was to lift the veil of sovereign immunity so that the federal government could be sued as if it were a private person for ordinary torts, such as motor vehicle accidents. See text at note 15. The legislators were primarily concerned with giving a remedy to persons heretofore effectively without one. They were not concerned with providing plaintiffs with a choice of defendants. Thus, where alternate defendants exist (presumably, though not necessarily, independent contractors will not be shielded from suit by sovereign immunity), no special need exists to subject the federal government to liability. In fact, most federal prisoners housed in state and local facilities can sue the non-federal entity charged with the operation of the prison. Thirty-seven states have waived their sovereign immunity from such suits. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Physical Security in Prison: Rights Without Remedies? </em>12 New England L.Rev. 269, 274 (1976).

This court has uniformly held that the FTCA does not, as a general rule, render the United States liable for the torts of employees or agencies of the District of Columbia because the District of Columbia is an independent political entity. See, e. <em>g., Husovsky v. United States, </em>590 F.2d 944, 952 (D.C.Cir. 1978) (liability of United States under FTCA arose from extent of control and supervision exercised by its employees over land involved, not negligence of District employees exercising concurrent responsibilities); <em>Harbin v. District of Columbia, </em>336 F.2d 950, 952 (D.C.Cir.1964) (Congress \u201cconsciously excluded\u201d District of Columbia from the provisions of the FTCA); <em>Urow v. District of Columbia, </em>316 F.2d 351, 352 n.2 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 826, 84 S.Ct. 69, 11 L.Ed.2d 59 (1963) (same). <em>But see Goddard v.

The Bureau has established performance standards that nonfederal facilities must meet in order to qualify as boarding facilities for federal prisoners.

This failure to inspect was not cited as evidence of negligence on the part of FBOP officials; it may be partially explained by the fact that the FBOP does not place or transfer to Lorton United States Code offenders sentenced to more than one year in prison unless they specifically request such a placement. <em>See </em>Federal Prison System, Program Statement No. 5100.1 CN-2 \u00a7 12(M) (July 14, 1980). Nor did the appellant claim that appellee was negligent in designating Lorton as his place of confinement. Indeed, he requested such a placement. Thus, we do not have cause, as the Court did in <em>Logue, </em>to remand this case for further findings of fact on whether negligence was involved in the FBOP\u2019s transfer of Cannon to Lorton.

In fact, the statutory basis of the District-federal relationship probably makes it more immutable than the contractual basis of the state-federal relationship in this area.

There may be circumstances in which the federal government assumes physical as well as legal control over a federal prisoner incarcerated in a non-federal prison. The government may be responsible for making special arrangements for a prisoner, <em>see Logue v. United States, supra </em>(deputy marshal may be responsible for arranging special surveillance of a suicidal prisoner), or the government may place such detailed conditions and terms on the incarceration of federal prisoners in non-federal institutions that it can be said that the non-federal employees are acting \u201con behalf of a federal agency\u201d when fulfilling those terms and conditions. The court in <em>Close </em>may have been alluding to such a situation when it spoke of the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cpower ... to supervise the D.C. jailer in his handling of this particular prisoner.\u201d 397 F.2d at 687. However, no such special circumstances were presented to this court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b1201-17\">. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 2. This court upheld the Attorney General\u2019s power to issue the furlough regulations contained in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 0 (Appendix to Subpart Q) in <em>Milhouse v.

Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977) (holding that D.C. prisoners sentenced in local courts after the effective date of the Court Reform Act of 1970 do not have federal habeas corpus rights despite the fact that they are committed to the legal custody of the Attorney General).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1201-19\">. It is well established that legal custody is not co-extensive with physical control over the day-to-day supervision of the prisoner; the former \u201c \u2018 . . remains in the Attorney General even though the prisoner is assigned to an institution over which the Department of Justice has no control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Milhouse v. Levi, supra, </em>548 F.2d at 362 <em>(citing Frazier v. United States, </em>339 F.2d 745, 746 (1964)). Thus, a prisoner is considered to have escaped \u201cfrom the custody of the Attorney General\u201d within the meaning of the federal escape statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751, even if he in fact absconds from a state-operated facility into which he was placed at the order of the Attorney General. State officials are often considered \u201cofficers of the Federal government\u201d for some purposes when acting to fulfill the Attorney General\u2019s obligations arising from his assumption of <em>legal </em>custody. See, e. <em>g., Randolph v. Donaldson, </em>13 U.S. 76, 9 Cranch 76, 3 L.Ed. 662 (1815); <em>Reid v. Covert, </em>351 U.S. 487, 76 S.Ct. 880, 100 L.Ed. 1352 (1956) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds on rehearing, </em>354 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-23\">In <em>Milhouse, </em>this court upheld the authority of the Attorney General to set furlough guidelines for prisoners in Lorton Reformatory. It did so on the basis of his acknowledged statutory power to designate the place of confinement for all District prisoners, federal, and local, under 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 402, as well as his legal \u201ccustody\u201d over all such prisoners during their incarceration. In addition, it relied on his power to initiate furlough programs under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082(c)(1), interpreted since its enactment to cover furlough programs at Lorton as well as federal institutions. The <em>Milhouse </em>opinion, however, went out of its way to emphasize that it saw no inconsistency between furlough power in the Attorney General and local regulation of the \u201cfacility\u2019s rehabilitation programs,\u201d citing the several unsuccessful attempts in Congress to transfer management control of Lorton from District to federal control. <em>Milhouse\u2019s </em>reasoning, we believe, can and should be limited to control over furloughs or other changes .in places of confinement and should not cast any doubt on the District of Columbia Department of Corrections\u2019 continued and undisputed control over the programs and conditions of confinement in its institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-24\">Similarly, -in <em>McCall v. Swain, </em>510 F.2d 167 (D.C.Cir. 1975), this court decided that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia had jurisdiction over the habeas corpus petition of a petitioner convicted in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>court of local crimes and confined in Lorton Reformatory. In holding that state officials acting as custodians of prisoners sentenced in federal court would be considered \u201cFederal officers or employees\u201d within the meaning of 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 1901, <em>id. </em>at 180, for habeas corpus purposes, it \u201cemphasized\u201d that the mere fact that a federal prisoner is incarcerated in a prison \u201ccommitted to operation by local officials\u201d has no effect on his right to return to a federal court for consideration of constitutional rights. It also \u201cemphasized\u201d that it was \u201caddressing only those cases in which remedy by way of habeas corpus is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181 n.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-16\">As for the much quoted language in <em>Randolph v. Donaldson, supra, </em>that Lorton was a \u201cjail of the United States,\u201d 9 Cranch at 85-86, the Court there actually held that the federal marshal was <em>not </em>responsible \u201cfor the escape of a prisoner regularly committed to the custody of the keeper of a state jail[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on the \u201cdoctrine of the common law applicable to the case of principal and agent,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court concluded the Virginia \u201csheriff .. . has the supervision and control of all the prisoners within the jail; and, therefore, is justly made responsible by law for all escapes occasioned by the negligence or willful misconduct of his under-keeper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, long before either <em>Logue </em>or the enactment of the FTCA, the Court held that in actions bottomed on negligence, the federal government could not be considered responsible for the negligence of local prison officials if it lacks physical control over their activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
