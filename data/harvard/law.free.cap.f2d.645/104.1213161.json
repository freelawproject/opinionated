On March 4,1981, appellant Zuccaro was arrested on a complaint charging the hijacking of an armored car in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (1976). That same day he was presented before United States Magistrate A. Simon Chrein, who set bail at $150,000. The next day an Assistant United States Attorney presented a motion to the District Court, seeking to have bail set at $500,000. After hearing the prosecutor and counsel for the defendant, Judge Bramwell set bail at $350,000. From that order Zuccaro appealed, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147(b)(2) (1976). We affirmed Judge Bramwell\u2019s order after oral argument. This opinion sets 'forth our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-18\">The bail provisions of the Criminal Code explicitly set forth the authority of a district judge to modify the conditions of bail at the request of the person detained. Section 3146(d) permits a person detained after 24 hours to have the conditions reviewed by the judicial officer who imposed them; that officer is required to set forth the reasons for the conditions, if their imposition results in confinement. A person detained after reconsideration by the judicial officer pursuant to \u00a7 3146(d) is authorized by \u00a7 3147(a) to \u201cmove the court having original jurisdiction over the offense with which he is charged to amend the order\u201d specifying the conditions of release. <em>See Grimes v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 933 (D.C.Cir.1967) (requiring prior resort to procedure of \u00a7 3146(d); <em>Shackleford v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 212 (D.C.Cir.1967) (same). However, no explicit authority is spelled out for modifications of conditions of bail at the request of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">Nevertheless, we find such authority implicitly contemplated by the provisions of \u00a7 3147(b), which authorizes appellate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of the conditions of bail. Under subsection (b), appellate review is permitted under two circumstances. The first is where a court has denied a motion under subsection (a), <em>i. </em>e., a motion made by the person detained. The second is where conditions of release have been \u201cimposed <em>or amended </em>by a judge of the court having original jurisdiction over the offense charged.\u201d (Emphasis added). By contemplating amendment of the conditions of release by the trial judge, the statute could mean amendment only upon motion of the defendant or also upon motion of the Government. If the conditions were initially set by the trial judge, as might occur if the judge was the judicial officer before whom the accused was first presented pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 5, there would be no question that amendment could be sought by the Government, since \u00a7 3146(e) explicitly authorizes the judicial officer who originally set the conditions of bail to amend his order by imposing additional conditions. We see no reason to doubt that the authority of the trial judge to amend conditions of bail can also be exercised, upon motion of the Government, when the conditions were previously set by some other judicial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Several considerations lead us to this interpretation. First, conditions of bail are set to govern release \u201cpending trial,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a). Since the time period for which the conditions are set extends into a period in which the judge with jurisdiction over the offense will be exercising his jurisdiction, he should have authority to make such orders as he deems necessary to assure the presence of the defendant, and the Government should have the opportunity to seek the exercise of that authority. Second, situations frequently arise where a person is arrested in a distant district and then removed to the district of prosecution. Fed.R.Crim.P. 40. When this occurs, it would not make sense to. insist that the Government\u2019s only recourse in seeking additional conditions of bail is to apply to the judicial officer who originally set the conditions of bail and ask him to amend them under \u00a7 3146(e). Third, it must be appreciated that the category of judicial officers authorized to set the initial conditions of bail covers a broad range of officials including local justices of the peace. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3041, 3141. Congress would not likely have accorded these officers authority to set conditions of release immune from revision by a district judge upon the Government\u2019s application. We conclude that Judge Bramwell had jurisdiction to entertain the Government\u2019s application to alter the conditions of bail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since we find authority for the District Judge\u2019s action in the provisions concerning bail, we need not consider the significance of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), authorizing a judge to reconsider a pretrial matter determined by a magistrate \u201cwhere it has been shown that the magistrate\u2019s order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u201d In our view the trial judge may amend the conditions of bail subject only to the statutory standards applicable to the setting of bail, without any prior determination that the magistrate\u2019s order was clearly erroneous or contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We also reject appellant\u2019s procedural claim that the proceedings before Judge Bramwell required Zuccaro\u2019s presence in addition to that of his counsel. The setting of additional conditions of bail is neither a stage of the trial nor any of the other proceedings at which Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 requires the presence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">On the merits, we see no basis to disturb Judge Bramwell\u2019s order. Zuccaro had previously been convicted of robbery in New York, and has since then been arrested twelve times. The Government presented evidence that he has close ties with organ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ized crime, has no current employment or employment history, is known to possess a sawed-off shotgun, and has been implicated in a number of attempted murders. The hijacking in which Zuccaro is charged involves the theft of $750,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\">. Having set additional conditions of bail. Judge Bramwell will be obliged to set forth his reasons in the event an appropriate challenge is made pursuant to \u00a7 3146(d). Normally such application should be made to the district judge prior to seeking review in this Court. We have entertained this appeal despite appellant\u2019s failure to seek reconsideration before Judge Bram-well and a statement of reasons, since the essential issue raised is whether the District Judge had jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\">. Five days after Judge Bramwell\u2019s order, Zuc-caro was indicted for the armored car hijacking and also for the previous hijacking of another armored car from which $310,000 was taken.-</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
