RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b550-29\">The question before us is a narrow one: may an administrative law judge [AU] ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>prove the settlement of a claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [LHWCA], 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>that involves possible future medical benefits? Bound by a precise statute, we conclude that Congress has ordained that only the Secretary of Labor or his designate may approve such a settlement, and we, therefore affirm the decision of the Benefits Review Board [BRB].</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Even thin rules may reflect onto other areas. To avoid implications that might be drawn if we wrote in broad terms, we confine our decision to the issue before us. It is purely a matter of statutory construction, for the facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Richard Ladner is thirty-one years old. He has ten years of schooling. On July 13, 1977, he was working for Marine Concrete as a night watchman. He alleges that during the course of his duty he jumped from a barge to a lugger and suffered an injury to his back that later required kidney surgery. He filed a claim under the LHWCA. The case was assigned to an AU for hearing. Ladner was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The employer was prepared to present the testimony of a fellow employee who had worked with Ladner on the night when Ladner was allegedly injured. He would have testified that he never saw Ladner fall and that Ladner made no complaint to him regarding such a mishap. Marine Concrete was also prepared to present testimony that Ladner had a criminal record and was on parole at the time. Ladner\u2019s parole officer was ready to testify that, after the alleged injury, Ladner had done heavy work. Lad-ner\u2019s landlady-neighbor was prepared to testify that he was able to perform full physical activity subsequent to the date on which he claimed he had fallen. The employer elicited Ladner\u2019s admission that he had made claims against former employers for a similar condition. Examining physicians had expressed the opinion in medical reports that he was able fully to perform the duties of his former occupation and had suffered no permanent disability, even partial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Confronted with the array of evidence against his client, Ladner\u2019s counsel, with Ladner\u2019s approval, agreed to a settlement of his claim for payment of $2500 plus compensation benefits of $1328.82 in addition to $1635 in medical expenses incurred, $736.55 in medical benefits previously paid and $1000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The settlement included a release of all future claims for medical benefits. Ladner stated that he was satisfied with the agreement. His lawyer concurred. Ladner and his employer presented a petition to approve their compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">After making a thorough inquiry into the facts, the AU found that the medical evidence did not establish a causal connection between any July 1977 injury and Ladner\u2019s kidney problems and that there was no objective medical evidence that the employee-claimant suffered any residual back impairment. He also found that it was doubtful that the accident related by Ladner actually occurred. He said he was \u201cconvinced\u201d that the settlement proposal was in Ladner\u2019s best interest. However, he thought he had no authority to approve it and, therefore, denied the petition. He did not make any determination of the merits of the claim. Ladner and his employer appealed, but the BRB, with one dissent, affirmed. Ladner and his employer now petition this court to set aside the BRB\u2019s order. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The LHWCA permits the settlement of claims under the Act in certain circumstances. The statute deals with the settlement of claims involving compensation payments and medical payments in separate subsections. Section 8(i)(A) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(i)(A), which we will now refer to only as Subsection A, permits the deputy commissioner to approve agreed settlements discharging the liability of the employer for compensation. Section 19(d) of the Act provides that, in hearings held under the LWHCA, \u201c[a]ll powers, duties, and responsibilities vested ... in the deputy commissioners with respect to such hearings shall be vested in such administrative law judges.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(d). The BRB has held that an AU, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>therefore, has authority to approve settlements that release the employer from liability for future compensation. <em>Clefstad v. Perini North River Associates, </em>[1978] BRBS 217 (MB).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Subsection A does not mention settlements that provide for discharge of liability for medical benefits. Subsection B, Section 8(iXB) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(i)(B), expressly addresses the approval of settlements of claims for medical benefits. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Whenever the <em>Secretary determines </em>that it is for the best interests of the injured employee entitled to medical benefits, <em>he may approve agreed settlements </em>of the interested parties, discharging the liability of the employer for such medical benefits. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">LHWCA Section 8(i)(B), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908 (i)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Thus, the statute by its terms permits the deputy commissioner to approve settlements discharging liability for compensation benefits while approval of compromise agreements involving medical benefits is expressly reserved to the Secretary. The difference was not inadvertent. Before 1972, settlement of liability for compensation benefits required the approval of the Secretary. <em>See S.H. Du Puy v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>519 F.2d 536, 538 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 965, 96 S.Ct. 1459, 47 L.Ed.2d 732 (1976) (neither the deputy commissioner nor the ALJ is authorized to approve settlement of a <em>death claim </em>under the LHWCA). The Act contained no provision for compromise of liability for medical benefits. In 1972, Subsection A was amended to give the deputy commissioner authority to approve compensation benefits compromises. Subsection B was added to permit settlement of medical benefits, but, as we have noted, it does not in terms extend this authority to the deputy commissioner, nor does Section 19(d) of the Act, dealing with AUs, extend such authority to them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">The Secretary is given authority to promulgate regulations for purposes of administering the Act, LHWCA Section 39(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 939(a), and may designate someone to act for him, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.-301(aX2). However, he has delegated the Subsection B authority only to the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs [OWCP], not to the deputy commissioners or AUs. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 701.201, 701.202, 701.301(a)(6), 702.242.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The statute is both precise and clear in the distinction it draws between the authority to approve a settlement discharging the employer of liability for compensation payments and the power to sanction a settlement that releases the employer from liability for medical benefits. Given the clarity of the statutory language, we are not free to weigh the policy considerations advanced by the employer. Direct statutory provisions must be applied as written. They neither permit nor require resort to judicial notions of policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The employer contends that, because the AU may reject a claim, he should in the interest of the employee have the authority to approve a settlement providing for partial payment. We need not supply the answer to the employer\u2019s contention but we may conjecture that Congress took into account the fact that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of a claim may be appealed by the aggrieved employee while his approval of a compromise would be irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">There is, the Director urges, method in the statutory scheme of settlement authorization. According to the Director, the Secretary has the investigative power and the administrative expertise to extend the inquiry into the advisability of the settlement beyond the adjudicatory record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, both the logic and the humanitarian impact of Congress\u2019 considered decisions are for its evaluation. \u201cIt is not our province ... to write legislation that Congress either overlooked or designedly chose not to write.... \u201d <em>S.H. Du Puy v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>519 F.2d at 541. \u201cCongress has put down its pen, and [the Court] can neither rewrite Congress\u2019 words nor call it back \u2018to cancel half a line.\u2019 \u201d <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Rasmussen, </em>440 U.S. 29, 47, 99 S.Ct. 903, 913, 59 L.Ed.2d 122, 135 (1979). Our course is particularly straight when we consider a statute only recently enacted, not one weathered by years and dulled by changes in circumstance. The general provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 <em>et seq., </em>relied upon by Chief Administrative Appeals Judge Smith in his dissent from the opinion of the BRB, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 554(a), 554(c)(1) and 556(c)(6), do not alter the later-enacted and more specific provisions of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Therefore, we hold that the ALJ correctly determined that he is not empowered by the statute to approve settlements involving medical benefits. This does not mean, as the employer urges, that compromise is impossible. It simply means that the AU has no authority to sanction the agreement. The petition for approval of the settlement must be directed instead to the Director of the OWCP as the Secretary\u2019s designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">In <em>Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Joyner, </em>587 F.2d 649 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>on petition for rehearing, </em>587 F.2d 650 (5th Cir. 1979), we considered a related problem: whether this court has power to approve a compromise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>settlement and dismiss an appeal from a BRB decision. Because the employer\u2019s settlement offer was conditioned on its being approved by the court and provided that the offer would be withdrawn if it were necessary to remand the case to the Director for approval, we thought it infeasible to confront the problem of our jurisdiction to approve the settlement. Instead, we elected to follow our action in an unreported case, <em>Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Spi-cer, </em>No. 74-3465 (5th Cir. April 18, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">As the dissent in <em>Joyner </em>pointed out, the order granting the motion to approve a compromise settlement in <em>Spicer </em>was entered despite the pendency of a motion to remand filed by the Secretary. The motion to remand, which was not mentioned in the court\u2019s <em>Spicer </em>order, urged that this court lacked authority to pass on proposed compromise settlements. It was not possible to determine from the <em>Spicer </em>opinion or record whether the question of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to approve the settlement was in fact considered. Apparently, no motion to reconsider the order was filed in the <em>Spicer </em>case. <em>Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Joyner, </em>587 F.2d at 650-51 (Rubin, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We have carefully reviewed both the <em>Spi-cer </em>record and the <em>Joyner </em>opinion. The majority opinion in <em>Joyner </em>concluded, \u201c[w]hat we have decided, and all that we have decided, is that in this context and for this day the court follows Spicer.\u201d We do not think that this circumscribed disposition creates a precedential rule that has become the law of the circuit. In any event the <em>Joyner </em>decision, which dealt with court approval of a settlement agreement that did not involve medical benefits, is not binding in this case which involves the authority of an ALJ, whose actions would be reviewable by the BRB, to approve a settlement discharging liability for medical benefits under the Act. We once again leave for the day it is squarely presented the issue of our compromise-approval authority as an appellate court, whether implicit or derived from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">For these reasons, the order of the BRB is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">. The Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs [OWCP] disagrees with the holding of <em>Clefstad. </em>We express no view concerning this controversy, referring to the BRB\u2019s <em>Clefstad </em>decision only to trace the pattern that may distinguish settlements that involve only compensation payments from those that involve medical benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\">. The legislative history supports the proposition that the ALJ has authority to approve settlements under Subsection A but does not have such authority in regard to settlements involving medical benefits under Subsection B. The congressional reports state that \u201cSubsection 8(i)(A) provides that the <em>deputy commissioner, Board, or Court may approve </em>a settlement discharging an employer from liability for compensation if he deems it to be in the best interests of the employee .... Subsection 8(i)(B) provides that the <em>Secretary of Labor </em>may approve a settlement covering payment of medical benefits.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.92-1441, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 23, <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4698, 4720 (emphasis added); S.Rep.No.92-1125, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 26 (1972) (emphasis added). Thus, nothing in the legislative history indicates that the reference to the Secretary in Subsection B was to have other than its plain meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-14\">. Applications for approval of an agreed settlement of future medical benefits are first submitted to the deputy commissioner, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.242(b), who, after consultation with the parties, forwards the application together with his recommendations to the Director, OWCP, \u201cfor such action as the Director considers appropriate ....\u2019\u2019 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.242(c). The language of the regulations governing the procedure for settlement approval explicitly states that the deputy commissioner can make only a \u201crecommendation\u201d and that final approval can only come from the Director, OWCP, as desig-nee of the Secretary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.242(c). Although the regulations permit the Director of OWCP \u201cor his designee\u201d to make the determination that the settlement involving medical benefits is in the employee\u2019s best interests, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.242(a), we know of no delegation of that authority by the Director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-6\">. The Director urges that the authority to approve agreed settlements in workers\u2019 compensation cases involving medical benefits is not merely the familiar function of reviewing the proposed settlement to ensure that it does not result from the injured person\u2019s ignorance of his rights or from some overreaching by the insurer. Rather, the Director contends that the power to sanction settlement agreements carries with it the responsibility to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the claimant, even when he is represented and advised by counsel of unquestioned competence and general good judgment, on the question whether the short-term gain of the settlement serves the best interests of the claimant more than the long-term security and potential gain of the continuing entitlement provided by the Act. According to the Director, this authority cannot properly be discharged by acceptance of the parties\u2019 representations. The very nature of the approval responsibility necessitates an inquiry beyond the joint presentation of the claimant and the employer or insurer. The Director interprets the Section 8(i)(B) requirement that approval can be granted only if it is <em>\u201cdetermine[d],\u201d </em>as opposed to merely-represented by the claimant or his attorney, to be in the claimant\u2019s best interests to mandate an extended examination into the desirability of the agreement. A significant error by the claimant in the evaluation of the advisability of the settlement will, according to the Director, be directly damaging to the public interest in the long run, as well as to the interests of the claimant. <em>See </em>the Report of the National Commission on State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws, 109-110 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
