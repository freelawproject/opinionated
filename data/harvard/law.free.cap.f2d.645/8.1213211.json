The Tax Court\u2019s decision in <em>Meeske </em>is reported at 72 T.C. 73 (1979), and <em>Laurin </em>is reported at 38 T.C.M. 644 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">The facts in the two cases are stipulated, and the operative facts are the same. Vilda Laurin established a revocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust on October 9,1969, and died on July 2, 1973. Fritz Meeske established a revocable <em>inter vivos </em>trust on July 22, 1970, and died on August 22, 1970. Each trust provided that upon the settlor\u2019s death the trust corpus should be divided into a marital portion and a residual portion. The marital portion was designed to qualify for the marital deduction granted in I.R.C. \u00a7 2056, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">Each trust contained an \u201cequalization clause.\u201d The equalization clause allocated to the marital portion sufficient, assets to equalize the value of the estates of the deceased and his spouse, in order to minimize the aggregate estate taxes a couple must pay under the graduated rate tax structure. The decedent\u2019s and survivor\u2019s estates were appraised both at the date of the decedent\u2019s death and at the alternate valuation date that was in force at decedent\u2019s death under I.R.C. \u00a7 2032, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2032. For purposes of the valuations the character of the assets that comprised the survivor\u2019s estate was fixed as of the date of decedent\u2019s death. The marital portion was then funded in accordance with the valuation that resulted in the lowest aggregate estate taxes for the decedent and his spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">Thus, the estates of Laurin and his wife were appraised as of the date of Laurin\u2019s death and again six months later, on January 2,1974. The estate determined that the minimum aggregate tax would result if the marital portion was funded in accordance with the alternate valuation, and on this basis the estate claimed a marital deduction of $153,186.28. The estates of Meeske and his wife were appraised as of his death, and again one year later. The date-of-death valuation resulted in the lowest aggregate estate tax, on the basis of which the estate claimed a marital deduction of $258,855.26.</p>\n<p id=\"AB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The Commissioner determined that under the equalization clause the marital interest was \u201cterminable\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2056(bXl), and hence did not qualify for the marital deduction. The Tax Court upheld the marital deduction claimed by the taxpayer in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The Commissioner observes that in certain circumstances the amount allocated to the marital portion under the equalization clause could be zero; for instance, where the survivor\u2019s estate is of greater value than the decedent\u2019s on both valuation dates, or the combined value of the two estates on one valuation date is less than the value of the survivor\u2019s on the other. He argues that because it cannot be determined at the date of decedent\u2019s death whether the surviving spouse will tak\u00e9 anything, and because this. uncertainty is not due solely to changes in the value of the <em>survivor\u2019s </em>estate, the-survivor\u2019s interest in the marital portion is \u201cterminable.\u201d The taxpayer responds that although the <em>value </em>of the survivor\u2019s interest might turn out to be zero, the interest in the marital portion itself vested as of the date of decedent\u2019s death. Thus, that interest is not terminable.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">This identical issue was decided contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s position in <em>Estate of Smith v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>66 T.C. 415 (1976), <em>aff\u2019d </em>565 F.2d 455 (7th Cir. 1977). We find persuasive the opinions of the Seventh Circuit and the Tax Court in <em>Smith. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Tax Court on the basis of the reasoning contained therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
