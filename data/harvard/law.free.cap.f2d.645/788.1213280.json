G. Saperstein appeal from the district court\u2019s rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of their action alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-28\">I. GODZILLA AND BAGZILLA</p>\n<p id=\"b849-29\">Toho Company is a Japanese limited corporation. Since the 1950\u2019s, Toho and its licensees have produced and distributed movies and a television cartoon series featuring Godzilla, a fictitious, gigantic, green, lizard-like monster. Pictorial representations of the monster are used to promote the movies and series, as is the slogan \u201cKing of the Monsters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-30\">Saperstein is Toho\u2019s exclusive merchandising representative of the Godzilla name and character for the United States and Canada.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Toho, through Saperstein, has licensed others to produce Godzilla merchandise, including comic books, coloring books, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>sheet vinyl toys, a game, and slide transparencies. Toho alleges that it has licensed others to use the term Godzilla, depictions of the monster, and the \u201cKing of the Monsters\u201d phrase for use in promoting merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Toho sued Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief for what Toho alleged was improper use by Sears of a likeness of Toho\u2019s movie character, Godzilla. Sears, a New York corporation, sells garbage bags in boxes which designate the bags as a Sears product, but which also display the word \u201cBagzilla,\u201d depict a \u201ccomic, helpful, personified reptilian creature,\u201d and carry the legend \u201cMonstrously Strong Bags.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Toho\u2019s complaint alleges five causes of action:</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">(1) false designation of origin, or false description or representation, under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976);</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">(2) infringement of common law trademark;</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">(3) federal unfair competition under section 44(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(b) (1976);</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">(4) state unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 14330 (dilution) and 17500 (false or misleading statements) (West Supp.1980) and under former California Civil Code \u00a7 3369 (West 1970) (present version codified at Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200-17208 (West Supp.1980)) (unfair competition generally);</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">(5) misappropriation and unjust enrichment under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">II. FALSE DESIGNATION OF ORIGIN</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976), a claimant may prove the validity of an unregistered mark without the benefit of the presumption of validity that registration confers. In addition to showing that the mark has become identified with the manufacturer by acquiring a \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d <em>see Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200, 203 &amp; n.5 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Frederick Warne &amp; Co. v. Book Sales Inc., </em>481 F.Supp. 1191, 1195 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <em>see generally </em>1 J. T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 15:10 (1973), the claimant must show that the defendant has created a likelihood of confusion as to the origin' of its products, <em>International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg &amp; Co., </em>633 F.2d 912, 917 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>New West Corp. </em>v. <em>NYM Co., </em>595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Boston Professional Hockey Association v. Dallas Cap &amp; Emblem Manufacturing, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 1004, 1010 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 868, 96 S.Ct. 132, 46 L.Ed.2d 98 (1975); <em>Frederick Warne &amp; Co. v. Book Sales Inc., </em>481 F.Supp. 1191, 1195-96 (S.D.N.Y.1979). Thus, Toho\u2019s section 43(a) claim must fail if Sears\u2019 use of the Bagzilla name, figure, or slogan poses no likelihood of confusing consumers by suggesting that the Sears trash bags were made, sponsored or endorsed by Toho.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">In <em>AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, </em>599 F.2d 341, 348 (9th Cir. 1979), we set forth eight factors that are relevant to the likelihood of confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-15\">1. strength of the plaintiff\u2019s mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-16\">2. relatedness of the goods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-17\">3. similarity of the marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-18\">4. evidence of actual confusion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-19\">5. marketing channels used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-20\">6. likely degree of purchaser care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-21\">7. defendant\u2019s intent in selecting the mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-23\">8. likelihood of expansion of the product lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-25\">Because Toho\u2019s complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, we have no evidence to help us in assessing these factors. The complaint\u2019s allegations must be accepted as true. Nonetheless, this much is not disputed: Sears sells garbage bags. Toho produces or sponsors only literary works and toys. Sears uses \u201cBAGZILLA\u201d instead of \u201cGODZILLA\u201d and puts the Sears name prominently on the package. The representation of the creature is a humorous caricature rather than an exact copy. The marketing channels are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-26\">The goods are unrelated as a matter of law. <em>Cf. J.B. Williams Co. v. Le Cont\u00e9 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Cosmetics, Inc., </em>523 F.2d 187, 190-93 (9th Cir. 1975) (where nature of goods undisputed, relatedness of goods is a matter of law), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 1110, 47 L.Ed.2d 317 (1976). Moreover, the contention that Sears intends to confuse consumers is implausible: Sears means only to make a pun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our examination of the <em>Sleekcraft </em>factors leads us to conclude that Toho has not alleged facts that would permit a conclusion that consumers are likely to be confused as to source or sponsorship of the garbage bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">III. CALIFORNIA TRADEMARK LAW</p>\n<p id=\"AGI\">Appellants also assert a claim based on the California common law of trademarks. The complaint alleges \u201cinfringement of common law trademark rights.\u201d Because there is no federal common law of trademark infringement, <em>see International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg &amp; Co., </em>633 F.2d 912, 915 (9th Cir. 1980), California law governs this allegation. This body of law focuses on the likelihood of confusion as to source or sponsorship. <em>See </em>7 B. Witkin, <em>Summary of California Law, Equity </em>\u00a7\u00a7 70, 74 (8th ed. 1974). Without likelihood of confusion there is no infringement under the California common law of trademarks. Because the products at issue are unrelated, the complaint states no cause of action under California trademark law.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">IV. FEDERAL UNFAIR COMPETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Toho asserts a claim against Sears based upon a federal law of unfair competition. It grounds this claim on subsections 44(b), (h), and (i) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(b), (h), (i) (1976), as interpreted by our decisions in <em>Stauffer v. Exley, </em>184 F.2d 962 (9th Cir. 1950), and <em>Pagliero v. Wallace China Co., </em>198 F.2d 339 (9th Cir. 1952). Subsection 44(b) of the Lanham Act provides that citizens of foreign nations with which the United States has trademark, trade name, or unfair competition treaties shall be entitled to the benefits of section 44 to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of the treaty. Subsection (h) provides that persons described in subsection (b) \u201cshall be entitled to effective protection against unfair competition, and the remedies provided in this chapter for infringement of marks shall be available so far as they may be appropriate in repressing acts of unfair competition.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(h) (1976). Finally, subsection (i) grants citizens or residents of the United States the same benefits that section 44 confers upon foreigners described by subsection (b). In <em>Stauffer </em>and <em>Pagliero </em>we construed these provisions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to create a federal law of unfair competition that prohibited false designation of the origin of goods. Both Toho and some commentators have read language in those cases to grant to all persons a federal right to effective protection from unfair competition by use of appropriate trademark remedies. <em>E. g., </em>2 J. T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks &amp; Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 32:212 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">We recently considered the <em>Stauf-fer/Pagliero </em>language in <em>International Order of Job\u2019s Daughters v. Lindeburg &amp; Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>633 F.2d 912 (9th Cir. 1980). There we stated that the Lanham Act\u2019s protections extend to only two species of the generic tort of unfair competition: infringement of registered trademarks, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (1976), and false designation of the origin of goods, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976). 633 F.2d at 915. Thus, federal law does not prohibit a broad range of acts defined as unfair competition by the law of many states. <em>Id. </em>at 916. <em>Job\u2019s Daughters </em>limited the federal tort of unfair competition created by <em>Stauf-fer </em>and <em>Pagliero </em>to the type of conduct actually involved in those cases: false designation of the origin of goods. <em>Id. </em>at 915 n.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Unlike <em>Job\u2019s Daughters, Stauffer, </em>and <em>Pagliero, </em>however, this ease involves a plaintiff who is a national of a country with which the United States has a trademark treaty. <em>See </em>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, Apr. 2, 1953, United States \u2014 Japan, art. X, 4 U.S.T. 2063, 2071, T.I.A.S. No. 2863. We therefore must decide what protection section 44 provides to nationals of countries having trademark treaties with the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Section 45 of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1127 (1976), states that one intent of the Lanham Act is \u201cto provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trade-marks, trade names, and unfair competition entered into between the United States and foreign nations.\u201d Section 44 carries out this intent. The grant in subsection (h) of effective protection against unfair competition is tailored to the provisions of the unfair competition treaties by subsection (b), which extends the benefits of section 44 only to the extent necessary to give effect to the treaties. The federal right created by subsection 44(h) is coextensive with the substantive provisions of the treaty involved. <em>L\u2019Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, Inc., </em>214 F.2d 649, 654 (3d Cir. 1954); <em>cf. Paglie-ro, </em>198 F.2d at 342 (\u201cWe do not think that the rights created by \u00a7 44(h) go further than the treaties in this respect.\u201d). In this way, subsections (b) and (h) work together to provide federal rights and remedies implementing federal unfair competition treaties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See generally SCM Corp. v. Langis Foods Ltd., </em>539 F.2d 196, 199-200 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <em>L\u2019Aiglon, </em>214 F.2d at 651-54; <em>American Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Spiegel, </em>205 F.2d 771, 774-75 (2d Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, Apr. 2, 1953, United States \u2014 Japan, art. X, 4 U.S.T. 2063, 2071, T.I.A.S. No. 2863,' requires the United States to accord Japanese nationals and companies treatment \u201cwith respect to rights in trade marks, trade names, trade labels and industrial property of ever kind\u201d that is at least as favorable as (1) the treatment accorded nationals and companies of the United States and (2) that accorded to the nationals and companies of most favored nations. <em>See also id. </em>art. XXII (1), (2), (4). The treaty\u2019s requirement that Japanese companies be treated at least as favorably as the companies of \u201cmost favored nations\u201d does not require treatment as favorable as that accorded to companies with which the United States has special arrangements. <em>See Bartram v. Robertson, </em>122 U.S. 116, 119-21, 7 S.Ct. 1115, 1117-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>1118, 30 L.Ed. 1118 (1887). The treaty at issue here therefore requires only that Japanese companies be treated as favorably as domestic companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Domestic companies are entitled to federal protection against trademark infringement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (1976), and passing off, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1976). They are also entitled to the protection accorded them by any applicable state law of unfair competition. Subsection 44(h) requires only that Toho be granted these same protections because it extends only as far as is necessary to give effect to the treaty. Thus, the practical effect of section 44 and this treaty is to provide a federal forum in which Toho can pursue its state claims. We therefore consider Toho\u2019s state and federal unfair competition claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">V. CALIFORNIA UNFAIR COMPETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Toho\u2019s fourth and fifth causes of action alleged that Sears had violated various aspects of the California law of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\n<em>A. Anti-Dilution Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Toho argues that it has a cause of action under the California anti-dilution statute, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark registered under this chapter, or a mark valid at common law, or a trade name valid at common law, shall be a ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Cal-Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 14330 (West Supp. 1980). The dilution doctrine has been described as granting protection \u201cto strong, well recognized marks even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion, if defendant\u2019s use is such as to tarnish, degrade or dilute the distinctive quality of the mark.\u201d 2 J. T. McCarthy, <em>Trademarks &amp; Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 24.13, at 155 (1973). The focus is on damage to the mark\u2019s inherent value as a symbol, rather than on whether consumers have been misled as to origin or sponsorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">We have regarded the antidilution doctrine with some concern \u201c \u2018lest it swallow up all competition in the claim of protection against trade name infringement,\u2019 \u201d <em>Garter-Wall ace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>434 F.2d 794, 803 n.3 (9th Cir. 1970) (quoting <em>Coffee Dan\u2019s, Inc. v. Coffee Don\u2019s Charcoal Broiler, </em>305 F.Supp. 1210, 1217 n.13 (N.D. Cal.1969)); <em>HMH Publishing Co. v. Lambert, </em>482 F.2d 595, 599 &amp; n.8 (9th Cir. 1973) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">Sears\u2019 use of \u201cBagzilla\u201d has not impaired the effectiveness of the name and image of Godzilla. <em>Cf. Tiffany &amp; Co. v. Boston Club, Inc., </em>231 F.Supp. 836, 844 (D.Mass.1964) (appropriation of the name \u201cTiffany\u201d for a Boston restaurant). Neither does Sears\u2019 use of the reptilian monster character on its garbage bag packages link Godzilla with something unsavory or degrading, as occurred in <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Gemini Rising, Inc., </em>346 F.Supp. 1183, 1191-92 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) (court found dilution under a similar statute in defendant\u2019s sale of \u201cEnjoy Cocaine\u201d posters in a script and color similar to that of the Coco-Cola mark). <em>See also Dallas Cowboys, </em>604 F.2d at 202-03 (2d Cir. 1979). We therefore reject Toho\u2019s allegation of dilution.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">\n<em>B. General Unfair Competition Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">California Business and Professions Code sections 17200-17208 (West Supp.1980) establish a remedy for the broad tort of unfair competition. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>Former Civil Code Section 3369: A Study in Judicial Interpretation, </em>30 Hastings L. J. 705 (1979). Toho argues that Sears\u2019 conduct is actionable under three branches of this tort: (1) passing off, (2) misleading advertising, and (3) misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Our previous conclusion that Sears\u2019 actions pose no likelihood of confusion disposes of Toho\u2019s passing off claim. California courts have construed the tort of passing off to require likelihood of consumer confusion as to source or sponsorship. <em>Walt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number><em>Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, </em>581 F.2d 751, 760 (9th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1132, 99 S.Ct. 1054, 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979). Under California law, unfair competition also includes misleading advertising. <em>See </em>Cal.Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17500 (West Supp.1980). The absence of likelihood of confusion, however, precludes acceptance of Toho\u2019s assertion that Sears\u2019 use of \u201cBagzilla\u201d is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Toho\u2019s attempt to bring its case under the misappropriation branch of California unfair competition law also fails. The California law of misappropriation draws from the <em>pre-Erie </em>doctrine of federal common law formulated in <em>International News Service v. Associated Press, </em>248 U.S. 215, 39 S.Ct. 68, 63 L.Ed.2d 211 (1918). There, the Court held that the International News Service behaved tortiously when it copied the substance of AP\u2019s uncopyrightable news stories from AP\u2019s newspaper-subscribers on the East Coast and wired the stories to International\u2019s West Coast subscribers. The California doctrine of misappropriation prohibits the substantial copying of another\u2019s commercial labors even when there is no likelihood of confusion. It has been applied to record and tape piracy. <em>E. g., A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Heilman, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 554, 564, 142 Cal.Rptr. 390, 396 (1977), <em>appeal dismissed and cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 952, 98 S.Ct. 3063, 57 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1978); <em>Capitol Records, Inc. v. Erickson, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 526, 536-38, 82 Cal.Rptr. 798, 805-06 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 2176, 26 L.Ed.2d 545 (1970). There is no similar substantial taking by Sears in this case. The only \u201ctaking\u201d Toho alleges relates to Sears\u2019 use of its trademark, and Toho cites no cases extending the misappropriation theory to trademark infringement. We believe that California courts would refuse to make such an extension. <em>See Pagliero v. Wallace China Co., </em>198 F.2d 339, 341-43 (9th Cir. 1952) (refusing to extend misappropriation doctrine to prohibit copying of design).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Toho has failed to allege that Sears has violated any aspect of California unfair competition law. This failure also disposes of Toho\u2019s unfair competition claims under federal law, which in this case incorporates state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-16\">. Although the complaint alleges that Saper-stein is. a resident of California, it makes no allegation regarding Saperstein\u2019s citizenship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">. In <em>Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>207 U.S.P.Q. 852 (N.D.Ill.1980), the maker of the movies \u201cJAWS\u201d and \u201cJAWS 2\u201d brought a trademark and unfair competition suit against Montgomery Ward. The suit challenged Ward\u2019s use of the names \u201cJaws One,\u201d \u201cJaws Two,\u201d and \u201cJaws Power\u201d to identify its trash compactors. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, finding a likelihood of confusion as to source, approval, or sponsorship. The court stated that Ward\u2019s adoption of the \u201cJaws\u201d name \u201cwith an intent to capitalize on the plaintiff[\u2019s] mark permits the Court to draw the strong inference of likelihood of confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857 (conclusion 13). In our view, the <em>Jaws </em>court erred when it assumed that an intent to \u201ccapitalize\u201d was enough. In order to raise the inference of a likelihood of confusion, a plaintiff must show that the defendant intended to profit <em>by confusing consumers. See HMH Publishing Co. v. Brincat, </em>504 F.2d 713, 720 &amp; n.12 (9th Cir. 1974) (inference raised by showing of \u201cthe intent to confuse\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-11\">. <em>Stauffer </em>and <em>Pagliero </em>also purported to construe subsection 44(g), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(g) (1976), which protects trade names and commercial names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">.

Accordingly, Saperstein is not entitled to the protections of section 44 here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b852-13\">. The Second and Third Circuits have read subsection 44(i), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126(i) (1976), to grant United States residents a reciprocal right to protection against unfair competition by foreigners where section 44 protects foreigners against unfair competition by United States residents. <em>See L\u2019Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, Inc., </em>214 F.2d 649, 651-54 (3d Cir. 1954); <em>American Auto. </em>Ass\u2019n <em>v. Spiegel, </em>205 F.2d 771, 774-75 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 887, 74 S.Ct. 138, 98 L.Ed. 391 (1953). This interpretation is not inconsistent with the present law of this circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
