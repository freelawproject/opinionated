The Commission found that DeTrae had allowed its employees to work near unguarded floor openings and open sided floors, had failed to provide standard handrails at two stairways, and had neglected to fill the hollow pan treads of one stairway with concrete, in violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926.500(b)(1), 1926.-500(d)(1), 1926.500(e)(1)(iv) and 1926.501(f). DeTrae contests these findings on the primary ground that it had no control over creating or correcting the safety violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The petition for review is denied and the Commission\u2019s decision is affirmed in all respects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commission that the petitioner committed the violations charged by permitting its employees to use the unguarded areas on the construction site. Petitioner neither provided alternative means of protection for its employees, warned its employees, nor prevented them from using the hazardous areas. Even though DeTrae, as a subcontractor, neither created nor controlled the hazardous conditions, it had the primary responsibility for the safety of its own employees and was obligated to take realistic steps to protect them. <em>Bratton Corp. v. OSHRC, </em>590 F.2d 273, 276-78 (8th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\">. An administrative law judge found that De-Trae would be liable for the violations, and assessed penalties totalling $550.00 against De-Trae on May 27, 1980. DeTrae\u2019s petition for discretionary review by the Commission was denied, and the administrative law judge\u2019s report became the final order of the Commission on June 26, 1980. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(i); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.90(b)(3). Our jurisdiction over DeTrae\u2019s petition to this court is conferred by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-21\">. The petition for review was denied by order filed December 2, 1980. The Secretary of Labor moved that the order be published; we accordingly issue this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
