We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">On September 6, 1977, Integon issued a mortgage life insurance policy for $27,000 on the life of Decedent. The policy, intended to pay off Decedent\u2019s indebtedness on a home mortgage at his death, names the mortgagee, American Federal Savings and Loan Association (American) as beneficiary. The policy incorporates a contract, an application and a medical history questionnaire. Questions pertinent to Decedent\u2019s medical history appear on the application and on the questionnaire. Both documents were completed by agents of Integon who read questions to Decedent and recorded his responses. It was stipulated that Decedent had less than a fourth grade education, was illiterate, and unable to read except that which he had written.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">The application was completed on August 15, 1977, by Integon\u2019s agent, Clements. It lists Dr. Johnson, an orthopedic surgeon, as Decedent\u2019s personal physician. Decedent\u2019s last consultation with Dr. Johnson is listed as a physical in 1974 at which time the application states he was in \u201cExcellent Health.\u201d A \u201cno\u201d response is listed to a question inquiring whether Decedent had ever had certain ailments, including heart, back, or spinal disorder and to a question inquiring whether Decedent had within the preceding five years consulted any other physician for any other illness or disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">On August 30,1977, Decedent was examined by Integon\u2019s medical examiner, Janice Carter (Carter), an employee of Physical Measurements, Inc., a company under contract with Integon to provide such examinations. The medical history questionnaire completed by Carter shows a \u201cno\u201d response to questions 2 and 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">2. Have you EVER been treated for or EVER had any known indication of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-17\">(d) chest pain, palpitation, high blood pressure, rheumatic fever, heart murmer, heart attack or other disorder of the heart or blood vessels?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-18\">5. Other than above, have you within the past five years:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-19\">(a) had a checkup, consultation, illness, injury, surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-20\">(b) been a patient in a hospital, clinic, sanitorium, or other medical facility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>(c) had electrocardiogram, x-ray, other diagnostic tests?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Decedent\u2019s responses on the questionnaire show a June, 1977 treatment by Dr. Robert Sears for injuries sustained in an automobile accident, and hospitalizations for a tonsillectomy in 1959 and for a spinal fusion in 1976. The questionnaire shows Dr. Sears as Decedent\u2019s personal physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Decedent was in an automobile accident in March, 1977 and as a result suffered injuries to his cervical spine. In May, 1977, Decedent complained of chest pains and was hospitalized for three days. He was examined by Dr. Milledge Newton, a heart specialist. At least four electrocardiograms were administered during the hospitalization. Dr. Newton determined that the chest pains were referred from Decedent\u2019s cervical spine and muscular in origin. Decedent was told that he had no heart trouble or heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Decedent died on June 14,1978. Because Decedent\u2019s death occurred within the two year period of contestability of the policy, Integon instituted an investigation into Decedent\u2019s medical history. Learning of the May, 1977 hospitalization, Integon denied Davis\u2019 claim for benefits under the policy, saying the policy was void ab initio under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-2409 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by reason of material and/or fraudulent misrepresentations in the responses to questions 2 and 5 and Decedent\u2019s concealment of the May, 1977 hospitalization which Integon says was material to the risk it assumed. Integon tendered a refund of the $260.85 premium to the policy beneficiary, American, which tender was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Davis then filed this action against Integ-on for recovery of the balance owing American at the time of Decedent\u2019s death plus penalties and attorney\u2019s fees (Count I) and for punitive damages in the amount of $500,000 arising out of Integon\u2019s bad faith refusal to pay the benefits (Count II), which caused Decedent\u2019s estate to lose the equity in the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Integon moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Integon offered the deposition of Dr. Charles Burkhart, In-tegon\u2019s Senior Medical Director who, after reviewing Decedent\u2019s hospitalization records, concluded that the company would not have issued the policy had it been aware of the May, 1977 hospitalization. He based his opinion on statistics showing that individuals with chest pains resembling heart disease have a mortality rate double that of any other group, even where the electrocardiogram is normal, and on his view that the four electrocardiograms disclosed abnormal changes in the electrical output of Decedent\u2019s heart. In opposition to the motion, Davis offered the affidavit of Dr. Newton who stated that the chest pains for which he examined Decedent in May, 1977 were not indicative of heart disease and would not have increased Decedent\u2019s mortality rate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">The district court granted Integon\u2019s motion on both counts. It found that Dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>dent\u2019s statements were material misrepresentations as a matter of law. It further found those misrepresentations fraudulent as a matter of law. The statements were thus considered grounds under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-2409 for voiding the policy. Although not required to reach the merits of Davis\u2019 Count II claim for punitive damages, because of its finding with respect to Count I, the district court went on to deny that claim as without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Count I, based on a determination that certain statements made in Decedent\u2019s application were fraudulent misrepresentations as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The purpose of the summary judgment procedure is not to deny litigants a right of trial where there is a bona fide dispute of material fact. Its purpose is to avoid trial where no factual dispute exists and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The courts\u2019 task is made unwelcome in this case by the unavailability of Decedent as a witness and by the hardship visited upon his estate as a result of the responses he gave in obtaining the mortgage life insurance policy involved. The courts may not, however, shirk the duty of applying the law, and must grant summary judgment, and affirm that grant, when the record so requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Integon\u2019s principal witnesses (Burkhart and Carter) testified by deposition and were subject to examination at their depositions. Dr. Newton, Davis\u2019 principal witness, testified by affidavit. However, that testimony may be evaluated, the facts material to the questions on the policy documents are undisputed, and Decedent\u2019s responses to those questions are forever fixed and inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Construing the evidence, as we must, in a light most favorable to to Davis,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we must conclude, as did the district court, that there are no material issues of fact to be resolved and that Integon is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Davis says that Decedent, being illiterate, might well have construed the medical history questions in such a manner that his responses, given his construction, were truthful or at least not knowingly false. Mere conjecture, however, cannot create an issue of fact barring summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">Davis says Decedent did not conceal his May, 1977 hospitalization, because in reporting that he had consulted Dr. Sears in June, 1977 in connection with an automobile accident, Decedent was in fact informing Carter of the hospitalization. The argument has no basis in the evidence of record. The hospitalization occurred some three months after the March, 1977 automobile accident. Dr. Newton, not Dr. Sears, was the only examining physician during the hospitalization, yet his name is nowhere listed by Decedent. The discharge summaries prepared by Dr. Newton show that Decedent was admitted to the hospital for chest pains he had been experiencing for approximately three days. The only mention of an automobile accident in the hospital records is under the heading \u201cPAST HISTORY\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">In asserting that Decedent might have truthfully answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 2 and 5, or altem\u00e1tively that Decedent\u2019s responses, if incorrect, were not made fraudulently, Davis says Question 2 might reasonably have been interpreted by Decedent as inquiring whether he had experienced chest pains associated with or denominated as a \u201cdisorder of the heart\u201d, a question, according to Davis, to which decedent would truthfully respond \u201cno\u201d because he had been told by Dr. Newton that his chest pains were muscular in origin and not the result of heart trouble or heart disease, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>is, any \u201cdisorder of the heart\u201d. Respecting Question 5, Davis points to the clause, \u201cother than above\u201d, and says that' Decedent might reasonably have responded \u201cno\u201d because he considered all pertinent information to have been disclosed \u201cabove\u201d, that is, elsewhere on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Questions 2 and 5 required disclosure of the hospitalization for chest pains and that Decedent\u2019s \u201cno\u201d responses were misrepresentations of the true state of his health and medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Davis\u2019 argument respecting Question 2 is unpersuasive. Decedent, acting in good faith, would have disclosed his chest pains, a symptom specifically mentioned in the question, whatever the origin of those pains.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Davis\u2019 contention that Decedent\u2019s \u201cno\u201d response to Question 5 was based on his view that the hospitalization had been disclosed \u201cabove\u201d is equally unpersuasive, there being no specific mention of the May, 1977 hospitalization, \u201cabove\u201d or anywhere else, on the application. Question 5 inquired whether Decedent had been hospitalized within the preceding five years. As stated by the district court \u201c[i]t is inconceivable that a person acting in good faith, even if illiterate, could have failed to disclose a hospitalization occurring only three months before the interrogation\u201d in response to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Thus the district court properly determined that Decedent knowingly gave false answers to some or all of the questions. Though the district court did not apply the label \u201cfraudulent\u201d to Decedent\u2019s representations, its reference to \u201cknowingly false\u201d is an adequate synonym.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">We conclude that no genuine issue of fact is present and that the district court proper? ly awarded summary judgment on Count I to Integon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. Though those statements are inconsistent with the application, wherein Decedent listed Dr. Johnson as his personal physician, and said he had never experienced spinal disorder and had not consulted any other physician for any other illness or disorder within the preceding five years, Integon does not charge them as misrepresentations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. \u00a7 56-2409 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">All statements and descriptions in any application for an insurance policy ... by or on behalf of the insured ... shall be deemed to be representations and not warranties. Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of fact, and incorrect statements shall not prevent a recovery under the policy or contract unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">(1) fraudulent, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-15\">(2) material either to the acceptance of the risk, or to the hazard assumed by the insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-16\">(3) the insurer, in' good faith, would either not have issued the policy or contract, or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount, or at the premium rate as applied for, or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss, if the true facts had been known to the insurer, as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-17\">. Neither the examination by Dr. Newton nor the hospitalization for chest pains is mentioned in the application or in the questionnaire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-11\">. Because we uphold the district court\u2019s determination that Integon\u2019s refusal to pay was justified, we need not and do not reach the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b563-16\">. <em>Heyward v. Public Housing Administration, </em>238 F.2d 689 (5th Cir. 1956); <em>National Screen Service Corp. v. Poster Exchange, Inc., </em>305 F.2d 647, 651 (5th Cir. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. There is no evidence that either of Integon\u2019s agents incorrectly recorded Decedent\u2019s answers. Carter did not recall Decedent, but testified that she recorded all answers on questionnaires correctly and that she routinely answers any inquiry of applicants concerning the questions on the questionnaire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. Because the district court correctly found Decedent\u2019s representations fraudulent, we need not and do not reach an issue of whether those representations were material as a matter of law to the risk assumed by Integon as an insurer. Nor do we reach Davis\u2019 contentions: (1) that materiality of any misrepresentation is irrelevant here, where the contract language allegedly makes fraud the only ground for voiding the policy; and (2) that Dr. Burkhart\u2019s testimony was conclusory and should be evaluated in light of his relationship to Integon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
