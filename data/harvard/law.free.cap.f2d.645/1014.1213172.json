Our unanimous opinion in this case, filed on March 28,1979, involved concurrent sentences of five years and two years respectively imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u00a7 924(a) and 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) for substantially the same single offense. We held that the rule of lenity and the statutory arrangement required that the judgment of conviction resting on \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u00a7 924(a), should be vacated because it called for more severe punishment than \u00a7 1202(a)(1) permitted for the identical offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-21\">The United States Attorney thereafter filed a Petition for Rehearing because of the pendency in the Supreme Court of <em>U. S. v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 from the Seventh Circuit. We accordingly held action on the petition in abeyance awaiting the Supreme Court decision. <em>U. S. v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755, 1979 was decided shortly after we received subject petition and we thereafter received supplemental memoranda from the parties that address the petition for rehearing. They analyze the decision in <em>Batchelder </em>and suggest the effect of that decision on the disposition we must make of this case. We begin by granting the Petition for Rehearing and then consider the effect of <em>Batchelder </em>upon our disposition of <em>Girst.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>In <em>Batchelder, </em>the accused, a previously convicted felon, was convicted on a single count charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) for \u201creceiving a firearm that had travelled in interstate commerce\u201d and was sentenced under \u00a7 924(a) to <em>five years </em>imprisonment. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found an ambiguity between the statute authorizing that sentence and \u00a7 1202(a) which provided for a maximum term of <em>two years </em>for substantially identical offenses. The Seventh Circuit then proceeded to direct the replacement of the five year sentence with a two year sentence. 581 F.2d at 636. On review in the Supreme Court, a unanimous opinion failed to find any ambiguity in the two statutes, or any constitutional issue, and upheld the validity of all the statutes involved and ordered reinstatement of the five year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">In reaching its ultimate conclusion in <em>Batchelder </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant convicted of a violation of \u00a7 922(h) is properly sentenced under \u00a7 924(a) even though he also violated \u00a7 1202(a) but was not charged thereunder; that the statutes were not ambiguous, there was no implied repeal and no alternative interpretation was fairly presented; that the substantive statutes operate independently of each other; that no rule of law requires that a defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(h) cannot be sentenced to a term in excess of the maximum term provided by \u00a7 1202(a); that the statutes unambiguously specify the offenses and the penalties and are not void for vagueness; that the statutes do not impermissibly delegate legislative responsibility to fix criminal penalties to the Executive Branch; and that the prosecutorial discretion which the statutes place in the United States Attorney is not sufficiently unfettered to violate the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses because such choices generally rest in prosecutorial discretion and a defendant has no constitutional right to choose between which of two applicable statutes he will be prosecuted or sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In <em>Batchelder </em>the Supreme Court analyzed the two statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">While \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 1202(a) both prohibit convicted felons such as petitioner from receiving firearms, [] each Title unambiguously specifies the penalties available to enforce its substantive proscriptions. Section 924(a) applies without exception to \u201c[wjhoever violates any provision\u201d of Title IV, and \u00a7 922(h) is patently such a provision. See 18 U.S.C., ch. 44; 82 Stat. 226, 234; S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 20-25, 117 (1968). Similarly, because Title VII\u2019s substantive prohibitions and penalties are both enumerated in \u00a7 1202, its penalty scheme encompasses only criminal prosecutions brought under that provision. On their face, these statutes thus establish that \u00a7 924(a) alone delimits the appropriate punishment for violations of \u00a7 922(h).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-8\">That Congress intended to enact two independent gun control statutes, each fully enforceable on its own terms, is confirmed by the legislative history of the Omnibus Act. Section 922(h) derived from \u00a7 2(f) of the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1251, and \u00a7 5 of that Act authorized the same maximum prison term as \u00a7 924(a). 52 Stat. 1252. Title IV of the Omnibus Act merely recodified with some modification this \u201ccarefully constructed package of gun control legislation,\u201d which had been in existence for many years. <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 570 [97 S.Ct. 1963, 1966, 52 L.Ed.2d 582] (1977); see <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S., at 343 n. 10 [92 S.Ct. 515, at 520 n. 10]; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902, 905 (1964 ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">442 U.S. 119, 99 S.Ct. 2201; Footnote omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">The Court also pointed to the wide range of prosecutorial discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-11\">This Court has long recognized that when an act violates more than one criminal statute, the Government may prosecute under either so long as it does not discriminate against any class of defendants ... [Cases omitted]. Whether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury are decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>that generally rest in the prosecutor\u2019s discretion ... [Cases omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-4\">More importantly, there is no appreciable difference between the discretion a prosecutor exercises when deciding whether to charge under one of two statutes with different elements and the discretion he exercises when choosing one of two statutes with identical elements. In the former situation, once he determines that the proof will support conviction under either statute, his decision is indistinguishable from the one he faces in the latter context. The prosecutor may be influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, but this fact standing alone does not give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses. Cf. <em>Rosenberg v. United States, </em>346 U.S., at 294 [73 S.Ct. 1152, at 1163] (Clark, J., concurring); <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S., at 456 [82 S.Ct. 501, at 505]. Just as a defendant has no constitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecution, neither is he entitled to choose the penalty scheme under which he will be sentenced. See U.S.Const, Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 515, 516; <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S., at 694 [94 S.Ct. 3090, at 3100].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">442 U.S. 125, 99 S.Ct. 2204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">It is obvious from the above extracts from <em>Batchelder </em>that such decision requires a modification of our prior opinion. Since the Supreme Court has held that there is no ambiguity in the two statutes and no implied repeal of \u00a7 922(h), \u00a7 924 by \u00a7 1202(a)(1), and that the Government may prosecute under either statute, we cannot strike down the judgment of conviction based on \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u00a7 924 because a harsher sentence was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-15\">On the other hand <em>Batchelder </em>was not charged with, and convicted on, two counts, as here. He was only charged with one count, that arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibiting certain persons from receiving any firearm which has been transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-16\"><em>Girst </em>is thus not a carbon copy of <em>Bat-chelder </em>since Girst was charged with violations of both \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 1202(a) and was convicted and sentenced on <em>both </em>counts which involved offenses embodying essentially the same elements. Our original opinion, <em>supra, </em>applied the rule of lenity and vacated the judgment on count one based on \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u00a7 924(a) because the statute there permitted a more severe sentence than \u00a7 1202. This left standing among Counts One and Two only the judgment on Count Two based on \u00a7 1202(a) with its lesser sentence of two years. As to these two statutes <em>Batchelder </em>ruled with respect to the offenses arising under \u00a7 922(h) and \u00a7 1202(a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which overlap each other in much the same manner as the offenses here involving \u00a7 922(g)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>\u00a7 1202(a)(1), that \u201cthe Government may prosecute under <em>either </em>[criminal statute] . .. [the choice] generally rest[s] in the prosecutor\u2019s discretion. . . . \u201d <em>U. S. v. Bat-chelder, supra. Batchelder </em>thus prohibits us from applying the rule of lenity to vacate the judgment of conviction carrying the five year sentence under \u00a7 924. Accordingly, to the extent that our earlier decision of 1979 may have partially vacated the judgment, we reinstate the judgment of the trial court on Count One involving the conviction and sentence under \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u00a7 924(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">However, since <em>Batchelder </em>further states that the Government may prosecute under \u201ceither\u201d \u00a7 922 or \u00a7 1202, that indicates that convictions under <em>both </em>sentences cannot stand. Thus one of the convictions under \u00a7 924 or \u00a7 1202 must be vacated. The United States Attorney had the prosecu-tional discretion to choose to proceed under <em>either </em>statute but he did not exercise such election. Instead he proceeded and obtained convictions under <em>both </em>statutes. We therefore follow the procedure outlined in <em>U. S. v. Dorsey, </em>591 F.2d 922 (D.C.Cir.1978) and <em>U. S. v. Shepard, </em>515 F.2d 1324, 1336 (D.C.Cir.1975), and remand Counts One and Two to the District Court with instructions \u201cto vacate in its discretion one or the other\u201d of the two gun related federal convictions. 591 F,2d at 937. In exercising its discretion to vacate the judgment of conviction on one of those counts, an Eighth Circuit opinion by Judge Stephenson, in a substantially similar case held that the court is not required to vacate the judgment carrying the most severe punishment. 591 F.2d 1076 (8th Cir. 1979). Which conviction will be vacated is within the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Girst also attacks his conviction on Count Three which charges a violation of D.C. Code \u00a7 22-3204. We fully discussed and disposed of his contentions with respect to this count in part III of our opinion of March 28, 1979 in this case which appears above. We affirm the judgment of conviction on Count Three for the reasons set forth in part III and incorporate said part III herein by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">The judgments on Counts One and Two are remanded to the district court for disposition in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-8\">(h) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014 (1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-10\">(2) who is a fugitive from justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-11\">(3) who is an unlawful user of or addicted to marihuana or any depressant or stimulant drug (as defined in section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) or narcotic drug (as defined in section 4731(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-12\">(4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to any mental institution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-13\">to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-17\">. 18 U.S.C.
