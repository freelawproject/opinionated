His widow, Methel Walker,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a workmen\u2019s compensation claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979). An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the claim, finding that Walker\u2019s death was caused solely by intoxication. The Benefits Review Board (BRB) reversed on the ground that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Following a remand to the ALJ for computation of the amount of compensation and a subsequent affirmance by the BRB, the decedent\u2019s employer, Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedoring Corp., and its insurance carrier, Midland Insurance Co., petitioned this court for review. We grant the petition and, concluding that the decision of the ALJ was amply supported by substantial evidence, reverse the decision of the BRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">On August 20,1971, Walker, a longshoreman employed by Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedoring Corp., was assigned to work on the vessel AMERICAN LEGEND at Port Newark, New Jersey. He began work at approximately 1 p. m. on the deck of the ship with a fellow longshoreman, Lindo Pugh. Their sole task was attaching hooks from the large overhead crane to the top of hatch covers so that the hatch covers could be removed making the cargo below accessible. In carrying out their assignment that afternoon, Walker and Pugh climbed on top of a hatch, an elevation of five to six feet above the deck. They reached the top by climbing short ladders along the sides of the hatch. After they had assisted in attaching the cable from the crane to the hatch cover, each man prepared to descend from the cover. Pugh grabbed an adjacent cable and slid the short distance down it to the deck. Walker was observed crouching as if to jump to the deck. No one saw him actually alight from the hatch cover. Several minutes later, Pugh went looking for him and found Walker lying unconscious on the deck beside the hatch. Nearby, permanently attached to the deck, was a 2V2 or 3 inch pipe. This pipe ran parallel to the deck a few inches above the surface. Pugh saw no indication, however, that Walker had struck the pipe or the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">Pugh obtained assistance and with the aid of the crane, operated throughout that afternoon by Edward Muse, Walker was removed from the ship on a stretcher. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The specific physiological cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>death is not at issue: Walker, in a semi-conscious state, had vomited, aspirated the vomit, and asphyxiated. In dispute is what triggered these events. The claimant argues that either falling or jumping from the hatch cover, Walker struck his head and was rendered partially unconscious. The employer and insurance carrier contend that Walker became partially unconscious solely as a result of the intoxication. As is often the case, each side presented medical testimony in support of its position at the hearing on the workmen\u2019s compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Relying on the evidence produced at the administrative hearing, the AU concluded that Walker\u2019s death was caused solely by his intoxication. To reach this conclusion he specifically credited the testimony of Dr. Milton Halpern and rejected, on one point, the testimony of Dr. Thomas Santoro. On appeal of the claimant, the Benefits Review Board of the United States Department of Labor reversed, holding that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">This court previously has considered the initial and review procedures appropriate in cases involving claims for compensation under the LHWCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">A disputed claim for compensation is first heard before an AU. The ALJ makes findings of fact and determines the validity of the claim. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919. The losing party may appeal to the BRB which reviews the AU\u2019s decision but it does not make any independent findings of fact. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921. The statute provides for the BRB\u2019s scope of review: \u201cThe findings of fact in the decision under review by the Board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">A dissatisfied litigant may then file a petition for review of the BRB decision in the United States court of appeals. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). The statute does not set forth the standard of review to be applied in the court of appeals. Case law has established, however, that this court is to review the decisions of the Benefits Review Board for errors of law, and to make certain that the BRB adhered to its scope of review provision. <em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Walker, </em>590 F.2d 73, 76 n.12 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>Director, OWCP v. Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedor-ing Corp., </em>575 F.2d 452,454 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maintenance Service, </em>529 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A00\">It is true that this court does not determine if the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence; we review the Board\u2019s determination of whether the AU\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. In order to determine whether the Board has properly adhered to its scope of review, the court of appeals must make an independent review of the record and decide whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-12\"><em>Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. McCabe, </em>593 F.2d 234, 237 (3d Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This approach \u2014 reviewing the Board\u2019s determination of whether the <em>ALJ\u2019s decision </em>was supported by substantial evidence, rather than determining whether the <em>BRB\u2019s decision </em>was supported by substantial evidence \u2014 is followed in other circuits. <em>Bumble Bee Sea-foods v.

Galen, </em>605 F.2d 583, 585 (1st Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see no reason to reconsider the standard of review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The Act provides that \u201c[n]o compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned solely by the intoxication of the employee or by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself or another.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(b) (1976). The statute also recognizes a presumption against a finding of intoxication. \u201cIn any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary .. . (c) That the injury was not occasioned solely by the intoxication of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 920. This presumption has weight, however, only in the absence of substantial evidence negating the presumption. Once evidence has been presented sufficient to justify a finding contrary to the presumption, \u201cthe presumption falls out of the case.\u201d <em>Del Vecchio v. Bowers, </em>296 U.S. 280, 286, 56 S.Ct. 190, 193, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935). The presumption does not have the quality of affirmative evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 285, 56 S.Ct. at 192. Once rebutted the presumption has no effeet on the case. <em>St. Louis Shipbuilding Co. v. Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>551 F.2d 1119, 1124 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>John W. McGrath Corp. v. Hughes, </em>264 F.2d 314, 317 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>360 U.S. 931, 79 S.Ct. 1451, 3 L.Ed.2d 1545 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">In cases involving LHWCA statutory presumptions, the court must use a two-part test. <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. Be-lair, </em>412 F.2d 297, 301 n.6 (1st Cir. 1969). Specifically, in this case, we must first determine if the employer has presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption against a finding that Walker\u2019s death was caused solely by intoxication. If we conclude the presumption has been rebutted, then we must employ the familiar substantial evidence test to determine if the ALJ\u2019s decision is properly supported. <em>See </em>part II <em>supra. </em>We now apply this test to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">At the hearing before the ALJ, the claimant and the deceased\u2019s employer did not dispute the immediate cause of death: Jessie Walker became only partially conscious, vomited, and subsequently asphyxiated. The claimant, however, maintained the partial unconsciousness was caused when Walker struck his head in the course of jumping or falling from the hatch cover. Universal Terminal contended that the reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>able evidence provided no indication of trauma, creating the inference that intoxication was the sole cause of the partial unconsciousness and resulting death.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Two doctors testified in behalf of the claimant: Dr. Thomas A. Santoro, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Jessie Walker, and Dr. Roland Goodman, who based his opinion solely on the reports of Dr. Santoro. Dr. Santoro found <em>no </em>evidence of trauma in his external examination of the body. Nor did he find any such evidence in his gross examination of the internal organs and tissues. Based on these observations, he then concluded that the cause of death was \u201casphyxiation, due to aspiration of gastric content.\u201d This aspiration, the doctor stated, came after Walker had vomited.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Dr. Santoro also had performed a toxicological examination for alcohol. The deceased\u2019s brain was found to have an ethyl alcohol content of 0.273 percent. Dr. Santo-ro concluded that, at the time of his death, Walker \u201cwas markedly under the influence of alcohol.\u201d In the doctor\u2019s opinion, \u201c[a]n individual with an alcoholic content such as I have stated may be unconscious.. .. [S]ome individuals may vomit with an alcohol content of 0.273.\u201d The doctor concluded that such intoxication, unconsciousness and vomiting could lead to asphyxiation and death. This was the limit of Dr. Santoro\u2019s conclusion when he first made out the autopsy report. At that time <em>all </em>evidence indicated to him that intoxication was the sole cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Dr. Santoro subsequently changed his opinion and amended the autopsy report after (1) learning that Walker had a \u201c[f]all on hatch while at work on ship,\u201d Request for Correction or Addition to Original Record of Birth, Marriage or Death, and (2) observing, in one of seventeen slides made with tissues from Walker\u2019s body, what he believed to be a concussion hemorrhage. Dr. Santoro admittedly did not personally witness Walker on the ship the day of his death. In fact, no one saw Walker drop from that hatch, so it is impossible to conclude that he fell accidentally or intentionally jumped as was normal. Thus, the only acceptable evidence on which Dr. Santoro could base his conclusion that Walker\u2019s death was caused by accidental trauma was the single slide. But Dr. Santoro could not remember if it was he who had cut the tissue visible on that slide. Further, he admitted that he did not know and no records indicated from what section of the brain the specimen was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Dr. Goodman relied solely on Dr. Santo-ro\u2019s autopsy reports and earlier depositions of Dr. Santoro and Walker\u2019s two co-workers, Muse and Pugh, for his opinion that \u201cthere is no evidence that this patient from the clinical or medical point of view was intoxicated.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, Dr. Santoro\u2019s own testimony contradicts that opinion. Further, to reach the conclusion, Dr. Goodman admitted that he \u201cwas given as a fact to assume that [Walker] had been performing his duties in a normal competent manner.\u201d Finally, Dr. Goodman\u2019s conclusion that Walker suffered a head trauma was based solely on the autopsy report of Dr. Santoro. Universal Terminal presented two doctors on its behalf, Dr. Milton Hal-pern, retired Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York, and Dr. Jacob D. Matis.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Dr. Halpern based his testimony on the report of Dr. Santoro and on <em>his own examination </em>of the slides of tissue taken from the body of Jessie Walker. Dr. Halpern\u2019s testimony squarely contradicted that of Dr. Santoro as to the presence in any of the slides of indications of hemorrhages or trauma.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">Well, I found no evidence of hemorrhage, hemorrhages, gross or microscopic in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of the brain sections. There is congestion of the small blood vessels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">Concussion hemorrhages when present are not only visible to the naked eye, but would be found on microscopic examination. There does not seem to be any basis in the autopsy for a conclusion of accidental concussion. Now, this is my opinion that I am giving here, of the brain with hemorrhages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">I would therefore consider this a case of acute alchoholism [sic] with terminal regurgitation and aspiration of regurgitated material from the stomach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Dr. Halpern amplified his conclusion, stating that \u201cthere were no hemorrhages noted in the brain and no indication here from the appearance of the brain that you could say this man suffered a concussion.\u201d The congestion of the blood vessels that Dr. Hal-pern found he attributed to alcoholism.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">I think everyone who is acutely alcho-holic [sic] develops a congestion of the tissues and organs *of the body. If a person dies during an acute alchoholic [sic] episode, then this congestion will be evident. In fact, it is the most common finding in a person dying of alchoholism [sic], to find his organs congested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The doctor not only disputed the only evidence of trauma, but provided a reasonable explanation of the condition that Dr. Santo-ro concluded was a hemorrhage.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Dr. Halpern also opined that had Walker suffered a head trauma of a type likely to have been caused by striking a pipe or the deck evidence other than that visible microscopically would have been observed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGG\">[W]hen you get concussion of the brain due to a blunt-force injury of a diffuse or jarring type \u2014 you may not see anything on the outside of the scalp, but when you turn the scalp around or lay it back so that you can see the inside, you do find bruising of the scalp, on the inside. There was no injury of the scalp on the outside in this case. There was no bruising of the scalp on the inside and no hemorrhages to warrant a conclusion that there was a concussion effect in this man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">This injury to the scalp, Dr. Halpern stated, would appear immediately after the trauma and in all cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">When you bump your head for example, sometimes like going through a door, you may not see anything on the outside. You feel discomfort. Now, on occasions where you have an opportunity of turning the scalp back, <em>you always find it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">(Emphasis added). This bruising, Dr. Hal-pern testified, would appear even if the injury occurred <em>after </em>death.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Thus, Dr. Halpern\u2019s opinion contradicted that of Dr. Santoro in two significant ways. First, he found nothing on the slides \u2014 the only source, for Dr. Santoro\u2019s conclusion that Walker suffered a blow to his head\u2014 indicating hemorrhages or trauma. Second, relying on Dr. Santoro\u2019s observations that there was no other internal or external evidence of trauma, Dr. Halpern concluded that no trauma could have occurred, because it would have shown up on the inside of the scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Dr. Halpern agreed with Dr. Santoro that Walker was intoxicated, both contradicting the testimony of Dr. Goodman. Dr. Hal-pern stated that the 0.273 percent level of alcohol \u201cis a very large amount and that amount would indicate intoxication.\u201d According to Dr. Halpern, this level of alcohol would have been built up only by drinking approximately eight ounces of hard liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">Although accepting the testimony of Muse and Pugh that Walker did not exhibit by his conduct indications of intoxication and recognizing that Walker was found on the deck near a pipe, Dr. Halpern concluded that intoxication was the sole cause of Walker\u2019s death.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">I can only find one explanation, one primary explanation or cause of this man\u2019s death and that is astute [sic] alchoholism [sic] with loss of consciousness, with aspiration of regurgitated material. If he hadn\u2019t regurgitated, he might have gotten over that acute attack of alchoholism [sic], but the fact is that he did regurgitate and he did aspirate. That is not an uncommon termination for a person who is under the influence of alchohol [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>I see nothing in this man\u2019s activity that is a factor in his death. I found no evidence of any traumatic injury, either grossly or microscopically. The only thing the autopsy revealed was a large amount of alchohol [sic] in the brain and so he had a case of acute alchoholism [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">The primary cause of death here is acute alchoholism [sic] and the complication that might have hastened his death was the regurgitation and aspiration of vomit, which happens very often in alcho-holics [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">I find no indication of any injury here and no external injuries and no internal injuries, no anything in the way of traumas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Dr. Halpern specifically discounted testimony of Walker\u2019s co-workers that Walker did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol \u201c[b]ecause many persons who are under the influence of alchohol [sic] are not recognized as being in that state.\u201d Dr. Halpern found no other cause of Walker\u2019s death than alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Dr. Jacob D. Matis based his testimony on the reports of Drs. Santoro and Halpern. Not surprisingly, his statements added little. However, it is important to note that Dr. Matis agreed with Dr. Halpern that concussion hemorrhages would have been discernable not only in the single slide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAz\">You don\u2019t get concussion hemorrhages without concommitent [sic] changes in the surrounding tissue. In other words, you can\u2019t traumatize the skull or the scalp or the meninges . .. and not show it. If you show only what is called concussion hemorrhages, something is wrong somewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">This was the extent of the medical testimony on which the AU had to base his decision whether intoxication was the sole cause of Jessie Walker\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">We hold that the administrative law judge was correct in concluding that the presumption against a finding that intoxication was the sole cause of death was rebutted. Only Dr. Goodman testified that Walker was not intoxicated. Both Dr. San-toro, claimant\u2019s witness, and Dr. Halpern gave opinions that, on the basis of the undisputed test showing 0.273 percent alcohol in Walker\u2019s brain, the deceased was intoxicated. Further, the sole evidence of another cause, trauma, was the testimony of Dr. Santoro based on a single slide, and was refuted by the testimony of Dr. Halpern, who viewed the same slide. Finally, the testimony of both Drs. Halpern and Matis was clear that there was no evidence of another cause and that all the evidence indicated that trauma, the cause asserted by claimant, could not have been a cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">We hold further that, with the presumption out of the case, the AU was amply supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole for his conclusion that intoxication was the sole cause of Walker\u2019s death. Again the testimony of Dr. Halpern directly supports that conclusion. The employer need not introduce evidence refuting every imaginable theory of death. In this case there are only two plausible theories as to what triggered Walker\u2019s vomiting: The first, advanced by the claimant, is trauma \u2014 a blow to the head \u2014 that resulted in semi-consciousness and the vomiting in a man with a considerable amount of alcohol in his system. The second, urged by the employer, is the intoxication alone. Dr. Santoro\u2019s testimony that a slide showed a concussion hemorrhage is evidence, the only evidence, in support of the first. Dr. Halpern\u2019s testimony that the slide shows congestion from alcoholism, not hemorrhages, and that the requisite evidence of head trauma, bruises on the interior of the scalp, was missing, directly contradicts the testimony of Dr. Santoro and is evidence in support of the second theory. The administrative law judge was thus forced to make a choice based on the credibility of the two doctors. Had the ALJ decided to accept the version of Dr. Santoro, we could not say that there was not substantial evidence in support of that theory. <em>See C. F. Lytle Co. v. Whipple, </em>156 F.2d 155, 156 (9th Cir. 1946). But the AU did not accept his testimony. He specifically gave the testimony of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Halpern \u201cthe greatest weight in evaluating the conflicting evidence of the autopsy.\u201d He thus accepted Dr. Halpern\u2019s opinion (1) that the slide showed alcohol-induced congestion, not hemorrhages, and (2) that if there had been even a gentle bump to Walker\u2019s head there would have been bruising on the inside of the scalp that would have been visible when the scalp was turned back. The ALJ therefore accepted the conclusion of the doctor that \u201cthe deceased did not strike his head either before or after death.\u201d In sum, the administrative law judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Therefore, it is found that Jessie Walker died on August 20, 1971, of asphyxia due to the aspiration of stomach contents as a result of loss of consciousness due to acute alchoholism [sic]. In other words the death was occasioned solely by the intoxiation [sic] of the employee and not due to an injury arising .out of or in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">(Footnote omitted). We cannot say that the ALJ was not supported by substantial evidence in crediting the testimony of Dr. Halpern, accepting the employer\u2019s theory of the cause of Walker\u2019s death and holding that the longshoreman\u2019s death was caused solely by intoxication. Because we believe the ALJ\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence, we hold that the Benefits Review Board exceeded its scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Therefore, the decision of the Benefits Review Board will be reversed with directions to reinstate the original decision of the administrative law judge denying the claim of Methel Walker for death benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\">. During the initial proceedings, Mrs. Walker\u2019s first name was identified as \u201cMethal.\u201d She subsequently has been identified as \u201cMethel,\u201d the spelling we shall use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\">. The scope of BRB review of the decision of the ALJ is also limited by regulation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">The Benefits Review Board is not empowered to engage in a de novo proceeding or unrestricted review of a case brought before it. The Board is authorized to review the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the decision or order appealed from was based. Such findings of fact and conclusions of law may be set aside only if they are not, in the judgment of the Board, supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole or in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFc\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.301 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\">. Although the standard of review is not disputed by the parties in this case, we note that other circuits have stated that the decision of the <em>BRB </em>should be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>618 F.2d 1082, 1084-85 (4th Cir. 1980); <em>Strand v. Hansen Seaway Serv., Ltd., </em>614 F.2d 572, 574 (7th Cir. 1980). We believe the statements in these cases are not sound. <em>Maryland Shipbuilding </em>bases its deference to the BRB on <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951), a case decided when review of the decision of the ALJ or \u201cdeputy commissioner\u201d was obtained first from a United States District Court, not a BRB. The <em>Maryland Shipbuilding </em>court does not specifically consider whether the ALJ\u2019s rather than the BRB\u2019s decision is entitled to deference, and, in reversing the BRB and reinstating the ALJ\u2019s decision, does not <em>show </em>much deference for the BRB. The <em>Strand </em>court apparently did consciously defer to the BRB instead of the ALJ. However, its support for that deference, two Ninth Circuit decisions, is weak: <em>National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. v. Bonner, </em>600 F.2d 1288, 1292 (9th Cir. 1979), without analysis relied on <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>distinguished above; <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>545 F.2d 1176, 1178-79 (9th Cir. 1976), involved a BRB affirmance of an ALJ and could as easily be read as requiring deference to the ALJ, not the BRB. Further, the Ninth Circuit has since clarified its position, adopting the view held in this circuit. <em>Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>629 F.2d 1327, 1329 &amp; nn.1 &amp; 2 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">. The Benefits Review Board, in its initial Walker decision overturning the decision of the ALJ, BRB No. 77-102 (Feb. 28, 1978), stated that <em>\u201c[t]hree </em>eye-witnesses [sic] testified that between 1:00 p. m. and 1:45 p. m. decedent was in full control of his body motion up to the time of the injury.\u201d In fact, only two co-workers testified to Walker\u2019s pre-injury activities, and no other witnesses were even suggested. Such error indicates the minimal scrutiny the BRB gave the record before deciding to overturn the decision of the ALJ as not being supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
