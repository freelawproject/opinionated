Appellants also seek reversal of the District Court\u2019s award of $2,100.00 in attorney\u2019s fees as excessive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-29\">In total the three actions, consolidated by agreement of the parties, alleged thirteen copyright infringements of appellees\u2019 musical compositions by public performance for profit at the Juwan Knight Club, Columbus, Georgia in 1977 and 1978. The appellants are the owner and manager of the Club at which these musical compositions were performed as part of the entertainment regularly provided. Some of the musical compositions which are the subject of this action were performed by a live orchestra, others by recordings played on a jukebox. Patrons of the Club were required to pay an admission charge for entrance to the Club and for the entertainment provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Appellants demanded trial by jury. Ap-pellees moved to strike the jury demands and simultaneously filed stipulations waiving any claim for damages above the statutory minimum and for injunctive relief. The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion, and found that their copyrights had been infringed. The Court issued a permanent injunction against further infringement, awarded the minimum statutory damages of $250 for each infringement and attorneys\u2019 fees totaling $2,100.00, noting that only one hearing had been required to dispose of the cases. It is not suggested that the Court lacked adequate evidential support for its determination. The only question raised is the propriety of the Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This appeal seems to present very simple questions. Appellant argues that this appeal is governed by the principles of <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959) and <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962). We find their arguments unpersuasive in light of <em>Ross v. Bernhard, </em>396 U.S. 531, 90 S.Ct. 733, 24 L.Ed.2d 729 (1970). <em>See BMI v. Papa John\u2019s Inc., </em>201 U.S.P.Q. 302 (N.D.Ind.1979); <em>Cayman Music Ltd. v. Reichenberger, </em>403 F.Supp. 794 (W.D.Wis.1975). The whole case before the Court was equitable in nature as to which the appellant had no constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial. <em>See Chappell &amp; Co. v. Palermo Cafe Co., </em>249 F.2d 77, 78 (1st Cir. 1957); <em>BMI v. Dici Naz Velleggia, </em>490 F.Supp. 1342 (D.Md.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the award of attorney\u2019s fees was excessive appears frivolous. The Court, in its order, clearly indicated a consideration of the circumstances had been made and its award of $2,100.00 does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
