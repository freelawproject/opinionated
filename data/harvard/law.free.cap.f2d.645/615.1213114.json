LaGrange, Jr., appeal an order of the district court dismissing their constitutional claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-23\">Appellants are Assistant City Attorneys \u201cI\u201d for the City of Minneapolis who unsuccessfully sought promotion to Assistant City Attorney \u201c\u00cdI\u201d positions. Appellants allege that defects in the promotional exam violated their right to due process and equal protection of the law under the fourteenth amendment. These defects allegedly violated appellants\u2019 protected property interest in a competitive and impartial examination procedure as prescribed under the Minneapolis City Charter and Civil Service Commission rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">The district court found that the procedures and standards for civil service employment did not create a property interest protected under the fourteenth amendment. The district court decision was based on <em>Vruno v. Schwarzwalder, </em>600 F.2d 124 (8th Cir. 1979). In <em>Vruno </em>this court held that a Minnesota statute which granted an applicant for public employment a right to be free from disqualification on the basis of criminal conviction unless the crime related to the job sought did not create a protected liberty or property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-25\">We have carefully studied the record, including the district court\u2019s opinion and the briefs of the parties. We find no merit to appellants\u2019 arguments, and accordingly affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-15\">. The district court also dismissed appellant Tumulty\u2019s claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985(3) and 1986. However, Mr. Tumulty has not argued on appeal that dismissal of those claims constituted error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
