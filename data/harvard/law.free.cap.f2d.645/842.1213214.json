Hanson, Senior United States District Judge of the Southern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b902-20\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">Following jury trial, appellant was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), distribution of a controlled substance, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. On appeal to this court the conviction was affirmed. <em>United States v. Bryan, </em>567 F.2d 924 (9th Cir. 1978). The Supreme Court denied certiora-ri <em>sab nom. United States v. Baker, </em>439 U.S. 818, 99 S.Ct. 80, 58 L.Ed.2d 109 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">On December 10, 1979, appellant moved to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He alleged that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel had been violated by the existence of a conflict of interest on the part of his counsel. The district court denied the motion without evidentiary hearing on the ground that the record failed to indicate an actual conflict of interest or any prejudice to appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-23\">Appellant\u2019s trial had been preceded by a motion to suppress evidence on the ground that it was fruit of an unlawful search. The law firm that represented appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>had, on a previous occasion in an unrelated matter, represented one Romero, who appeared at the suppression hearing as witness for the government. Prior to the hearing, counsel for appellant conferred with Romero respecting his forthcoming testimony. When counsel, on cross-examination of Romero, attempted to reconstruct this conversation, Romero denied making the statements counsel attributed to him. Counsel pressed Romero, reminding him that he was under oath and subject to a perjury charge. Romero stood firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Counsel then took the stand and testified to the substance of the conversation. He sought by his testimony to challenge the government\u2019s justification for a warrantless search of appellant\u2019s car and to suppress the evidence found therein. The government had justified the search on the ground that exigent circumstances were created by the presence of an unidentified green van in the vicinity of appellant\u2019s car which suggested that accomplices were nearby. Appellant\u2019s counsel testified that Romero had told him that he had been in the police station when a report came in over the police radio to the effect that government agents in a green van had appellant\u2019s car under surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Appellant contends that his counsel\u2019s pri- or representation of Romero constituted a conflict of interest adversely affecting his ability to cross-examine Romero. Appellant suggests that counsel might have had privileged information regarding Romero and that this might have hampered his efforts. He suggests also that counsel might have been reluctant to antagonize Romero, since Romero still owed money for legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718 (1980), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n order to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d A potential conflict of interest does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The court below, on this record, ruled that no\u2018 actual conflict existed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Romero was not called as a witness at trial. The only claim that conflict of interest could have adversely affected the performance of \u25a0 appellant\u2019s counsel concerns what Romero had heard over the police radio about the green van. However, counsel\u2019s vigorous examination of Romero on this issue, to the point of suggesting perjury, and then taking the extraordinary step of testifying himself in direct contradiction of Romero, in our view demonstrates as conclusively as anything can that there was nothing in the past representation of Romero that conflicted, or was felt by counsel to conflict, with his desire to get Romero\u2019s statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The recent case of <em>Wood v. </em>Georgia,U.S. -, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981), does not require a contrary result. There, the record strongly suggested that actual conflict existed at the time of trial and that the trial judge should have inquired more forcefully. <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>638 F.2d 1190 (9th Cir. 1980), is also distinguishable. In that case not only was a strong showing made of conflict of interest, but appellant charged that in three specific respects such conflict had an adverse effect on her counsel\u2019s performance. Here, appellant makes no showing as to how his counsel\u2019s examination of Romero might have been improved, or what further testimony might have been elicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">We are satisfied that it was not error to deny appellant an evidentiary hearing on this issue. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 requires a hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d The bases for conflict of interest that appellant does offer are conclusionary and wholly without merit. <em>See United States v. Hearst, id. </em>at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b903-15\">FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Acj\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">I dissent. I do not believe that the record before us is sufficient to show whether counsel\u2019s former representation of Romero created a conflict of interest. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>I would reverse and remand for an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">I agree with the majority that no actual conflict of interest is shown bn the present record. However, I think it impossible to conclude from this record that counsel\u2019s former representation of Romero did <em>not </em>create a conflict. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, an evidentiary hearing is required \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d In <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>638 F.2d 1190 (9th Cir. 1980), we stated that this standard \u201cis essentially whether the movant has \u2018stated a claim on which relief could be granted\u2019 ... or, where affidavits have been submitted, whether summary judgment for the government is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1194 (quoting <em>Moore v. United States, </em>571 F.2d 179, 184 (3d Cir. 1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Here, it is certainly possible that counsel possessed privileged information which affected his examination of Romero and his conduct of the case generally. Perhaps Romero would have been called as an adverse witness at trial, or perhaps different questions would have been asked at the preliminary hearing. It is true that appellant\u2019s allegations are not as specific as those in <em>Hearst, </em>but such a lack of specificity is to be expected from someone in appellant\u2019s position. Until and unless appellant is given an evidentiary hearing, the details of counsel\u2019s relationship with Romero will necessarily remain a mystery. We should not deny him a hearing simply because his allegations regarding counsel\u2019s conflict of interest are somewhat general.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed \u201cthe duty of the court[s] to recognize the possibility of a disqualifying conflict of interest,\u201d <em>Wood v. </em>Georgia,-U.S. -,-, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1104, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981). <em>Wood </em>involved an attorney who had been hired and paid by the defendants\u2019 employer, whose interests might not have been identical to those of the defendants. The Court remanded for an evidentiary hearing, stating that \u201c[o]n the record before us, we cannot be sure whether counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interests of the employer who hired him.\u201d -U.S. at-, 101 S.Ct. at 1103. We cannot be sure here that counsel\u2019s strategic decisions were not influenced by his prior representation of Romero. I would therefore reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
