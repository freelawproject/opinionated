The district court sentenced appellant to twenty years imprisonment on count I and three years on count II, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-11\">For reversal appellant argues that the district court erred in (1) failing to dismiss the indictment for violation of the Speedy Trial Act and local speedy trial plan, (2) refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, (3) refusing to subpoena appellant\u2019s former wife as a defense witness, (4) giving certain instructions to the jury, and (5) sentencing appellant to a term of imprisonment in excess of twenty years and without specifying that he would be eligible for parole consideration after three years. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the convictions, vacate the sentence imposed on court I, and remanded to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-16\">Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of a gambling problem, appellant faced a financial crisis in early 1978. The police wanted him on a variety of outstanding warrants in several states for writing bad checks, larceny and embezzlement. In April, 1978, he was in Louisville, Kentucky, looking for a car. On April 8, 1978, at about 3 p. m., appellant approached George Hunter, Jr., as Hunter was getting into his car. Appellant told Hunter that he had a gun, displayed the handle of the gun, and directed appellant to move over to the passenger seat. Hunter testified that he asked appellant if he could leave the car and that appellant refused to let him go. Appellant placed the gun in his lap and told Hunter to give him directions to Nashville, Tennessee. For the next fifteen hours, appellant drove from Kentucky to Tennessee, back to Kentucky, through Illinois, and then to Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-17\">At about 6 a. m. on April 9, 1978, a St. Louis County police officer stopped the car because of appellant\u2019s erratic driving. While appellant showed identification to the police officer, Hunter waved his hands in a suspicious manner. The officer radioed for assistance. When the officer asked appellant if anything was wrong with his passenger, appellant jumped in the car and drove off. Hunter in some way managed to roll out of the passenger side. Hunter explained the situation to the police. Another police car chased appellant and forced him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>off the highway. The police arrested appellant and found the gun about ten feet from the car. The gun was loaded but the cylinder next to the hammer was empty. The police found one round of ammunition in appellant\u2019s pocket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Appellant was originally charged on May 11, 1978, in a two-count indictment with kidnapping and interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty on June 2, 1978. On the first day of trial, June 17, appellant withdrew his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to kidnapping.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Count II was dismissed. Appellant was originally sentenced to life imprisonment pending a psychiatric evaluation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(c). The district court thereafter reduced the sentence to twenty years imprisonment. The district court subsequently amended the sentence to provide for parole consideration after three years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">In April, 1979, appellant filed a \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court (Judge Filippine) granted this motion, finding that the record of the guilty plea proceedings failed to disclose a factual basis for the guilty plea as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f). <em>Gilliss v. United States, </em>No. 79-494-Ch(3) (E.D.Mo. Sept. 27, 1979) (order vacating judgment). The government reindicted appellant on the original two counts. Appellant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The second trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> began April 7, 1980. Appellant was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on count I and three years on count II, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-12\">I. <em>Speedy Trial </em>Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8ZQ\">Appellant filed several pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment for failure to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>ply with the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174 (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979), as implemented by the Eastern Missouri District Court Rules app. (Speedy Trial Plan) (approved by the Eighth Circuit Judicial Council on June 13, 1978). The district court found that the government had complied with the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act because the 60-day time limit from arraignment to trial began to run with the filing of the superseding indictment in October 1979 and because twenty-seven days counted as excludable delay for psychiatric examinations. <em>United States v. Gilliss, </em>No. 78-101-CR-(4) (E.D.Mo. Nov. 19,1979) (Hungate, J.) (order denying pretrial motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Appellant argues that the time limit for commencement of trial with respect to count II (interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle) should be calculated under \u00a7 5(d)(3) of the 1978 local speedy trial plan which refers to superseding charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the time limit began to run on June 2, 1978 (first arraignment), was tolled by the holding in abeyance and dismissal of count II on the motion of the United States Attorney on June 17,1978, and began to run again on October 19, 1979 (second arraignment upon superseding indictment filed October 18, 1979). Excluding time chargeable to pretrial defense motions and psychiatric examinations, appellant argues that trial should have begun on January 28, 1980, under the 1978 local speedy trial plan\u2019s 60-day limit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant also applies this timetable to count I, arguing that, because the district court erred in accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea, any delay attributable to the guilty plea should be \u201cconstructively chargeable to the government,\u201d citing <em>United States v. Carini, </em>562 F.2d 144, 152 (2d Cir. 1977). Because the second trial did not begin until April 7,1980, appellant argues that his statutory right to a speedy trial was clearly violated and the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-16\">We note preliminarily that, assuming the Speedy Trial Act, as implemented by the local speedy trial plan, had been violated, appellant was not necessarily entitled to dismissal of the indictment in the present case. Section 10(b) of the 1978 local speedy trial plan provides only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ayz-dedup-1\">Failure to comply with the requirements of Title I of the Speedy Trial Act <em>may </em>entitle the defendant to dismissal of the charges against him. Nothing in this plan shall be construed to require that a case be dismissed in circumstances in which dismissal would not be required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A67\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Mandatory dismissal<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of an indictment as a sanction for noncompliance with the Speedy Trial Act was not available until July 1, 1980. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3162, 3163(c) (1976 &amp; Supp. III 1979); e. <em>g., United States v. New Buffalo Amusement Corp., </em>600 F.2d 368, 376-77 (2d Cir. 1979). During the transition period from January 3, 1975 (the date the Speedy Trial Act became effective, Speedy Trial Act of 1974, Pub.L.No.93-619, 88 Stat. 2076) until July 1, 1980 (the date the sanctions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162 became effective, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3163(c) (Supp. Ill 1979), <em>as amended by </em>Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, Pub.L.No.96-43, \u00a7 6, 93 Stat. 328), violation of the Speedy Trial Act was not <em>per se </em>grounds for dismissal of an indictment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>E. g., United States v. Peters, </em>190 U.S.App. D.C. 370, 587 F.2d 1267, 1270 n.6 (1978); <em>United States v. Carini, supra, </em>562 F.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-12\">Like the district court, we find no violation of the Speedy Trial Act or the 1978 local speedy trial plan. While there may be presented a question whether the applicable section of the Speedy Trial Act is \u00a7 3161(e)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (trial following appeal or collateral attack)' or \u00a7 3161(i)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (trial following withdrawal of a guilty plea), the day the time limit begins to run is the same under either section, that is, the day the order occasioning the retrial or trial becomes final.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, under the 1978 local speedy trial plan whether the present case falls under \u00a7 5(b) (retrial following appeal or collateral attack)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or \u00a7 5(c) (withdrawal of guilty plea),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the operative date remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>the sume as under the Speedy Trial Act, that is, the day the order occasioning the retrial or trial becomes final.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cthe date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final\u201d is not wholly clear. The Speedy Trial Act Guidelines suggest that if a successful collateral attack is not appealed, then the action occasioning the retrial \u201cbecomes final\u201d whenever the time for post-judgment motions expires (ten days after entry of order or judgment) or when the district court\u2019s ruling on such motions is entered, but if an appeal or a petition for certiorari is filed, the action occasioning the retrial should not be considered final until the appeal or petition has been disposed of and the district court receives the mandate of the court of appeals or the Supreme Court. Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law, Judicial Conference of the United States, Guidelines to the Administration of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, as Amended 17-18 (rev. Dec. 1979) (hereinafter Guidelines). In the present case no appeal was filed. The order granting appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on September 27, 1979, and became final, at least for Speedy Trial Act purposes, ten days later on October 8, 1979. Thus, the time limit (60 days under the 1978 local speedy trial plan) began running on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">Moreover, even though the government filed a superseding indictment,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we think that the applicable section of the Speedy Trial Act should be the same for both counts I and II. Such a unified treatment of the counts is provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(i) (1976). \u201cIf the defendant pleads guilty to only some counts of an indictment or information pursuant to a plea agreement under which the other counts are to be dismissed, this provision makes it clear that withdrawal of the plea will establish a new time period with respect to all counts.\u201d Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s docket sheets and conclude that most of the days from October 8, 1979 (the date the 60-day time limit began running) to April 7, 1980 (the first day of trial) were chargeable as excludable delay under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h) (1976 &amp; Supp. III 1979), which is expressly incorporated by reference in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(e) (Supp. III 1979). <em>See </em>appendix A. The government had approximately 30 days left of the 60-day time limit and thus was not in violation of either the Speedy Trial Act or the 1978 local speedy trial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">II. <em>Judgment of Acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in failing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Appellant argues that the government failed to sustain its burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-12\">Each of the three expert witnesses who testified at the trial agreed that appellant was a compulsive or pathological gambler and that pathological gambling was an impulse disorder under the classification of disorders in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3d ed. 1980) (hereinafter DSM-III). The expert witnesses disagreed about whether pathological gambling was a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>used in the ALI (American Law Institute) Model Penal Code test adopted by this circuit in <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>458 F.2d 911 (8th Cir. 1972), and whether appellant lacked \u201csubstantial capacity ... to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918, <em>citing </em>ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01 (Final Draft 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">Dr. Robert L. Custer, Chief of Treatment Services, Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Division, Veterans Administration, is a psychiatrist who specializes in pathological gambling. Dr. Custer testified on behalf of the defense that he had examined appellant and had diagnosed him as a pathological gambler. Dr. Custer then explained the symptoms and characteristics of a pathological gambler. Dr. Custer concluded that in his opinion appellant could appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct but that he could not conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. On cross-examination, Dr. Custer indicated that the term \u201cdisorder\u201d was the only term used by the American Psychiatric Association and probably included \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Dr. David Reuterfors, a staff psychologist at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, and Dr. Robert B. Sheldon, Chief of Psychiatry and Forensic Psychiatry at the federal Medical Center, testified on behalf of the government. They had examined appellant and agreed with Dr. Custer\u2019s pathological gambling diagnosis. They also agreed that pathological gambling is an impulse disorder, but testified that in their opinion pathological gambling is not a mental disease or defect and, therefore, appellant did not suffer from any mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">\u201cA criminal defendant is presumed sane, but the introduction of evidence of insanity dispels the presumption and subjects the prosecution to the burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Dresser, </em>542 F.2d 737, 742 (8th Cir. 1976) (citations omitted), <em>citing Davis v. United States, </em>160 U.S. 469, 486-88, 16 S.Ct. 353, 357-58, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895). Assuming the evidence of insanity offered by the defense was sufficient to shift the burden of proving appellant\u2019s sanity to the government,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we conclude without hesitation that the government produced sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that appellant was sane beyond a reasonable doubt and that, therefore, the submission of the insanity question to the jury was proper.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Dresser, supra, </em>542 F.2d at 742; <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>536 F.2d 274, 276 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1077, 98 S.Ct. 1270, 55 L.Ed.2d 784 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">As part of his attack on the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence of sanity, appellant challenges the qualifications of both of the government\u2019s expert witnesses. Appellant argues that the district court erred in permitting Dr. Reuterfors to testify as an expert because he had not received his doctorate degree during most of the time he examined appellant and because he had had no prior clinical experience with pathological gamblers. Appellant similarly challenges the admissibility of Dr. Sheldon\u2019s testimony on the grounds that Dr. Sheldon had limited clinical experience with pathological gamblers and no specialized knowledge about pathological gambling. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">Appellant seeks to apply a too demanding and too narrow test for qualification as an expert witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-12\">The broad and generally stated test for determining the qualifications of a given witness to testify as an expert is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>his knowledge of the subject matter is such that his opinion will most likely assist the trier of fact in arriving at the truth. The determination of this preliminary question is left to the broad discretion of the trial court and while its resolution will not ordinarily be disturbed, it is not inviolate and may be reversed if this court is convinced that it was \u201cmanifestly erroneous\u201d and a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-4\">Acceptance of an expert\u2019s qualifications cannot depend on his precise skill or background in a particular profession or industry. If the subject matter ... falls within a person\u2019s experience in or overall knowledge of a specialized skill ..., this is sufficient to qualify the witness as an expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\"><em>Holmgren v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 856, 857-58 (8th Cir. 1975) (citations omitted). In <em>Holmgren </em>this court held that a proposed expert witness need not have actually manufactured or previously designed machinery to understand principles of safe design; it was sufficient that the subject of safe design was within the proposed expert\u2019s experience in or overall knowledge of engineering. <em>Id. </em>at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">Here, Dr. Reuterfors satisfied all the requirements of his doctorate degree program in September 1979, before he examined appellant, but had not yet received his diploma. He received his diploma during the fall commencement exercises in December 1979. Under these circumstances, the lack of a doctorate degree should not in itself disqualify Dr. Reuterfors as an expert witness. <em>Cf. Tank v. Commissioner, </em>270 F.2d 477, 486 (6th Cir. 1959) (absence of certificates or memberships); <em>see also Jenkins v. United States, </em>113 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 307 F.2d 637, 642-46 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">Nor do we agree that a lack of clinical experience with pathological gamblers or a lack of specialized knowledge about pathological gambling should necessarily disqualify either Dr. Reuterfors or Dr. Sheldon as expert witnesses. Appellant would apply a test for qualification as an expert witness that is too specialized. According to the trial testimony, the incidence of pathological gambling is relatively rare and the classification of pathological gambling as a distinct mental disorder is relatively recent. It is sufficient that the subject of pathological gambling is within the witnesses\u2019 specialized knowledge of psychology or psychiatry. <em>See Holmgren v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., supra, </em>516 F.2d at 858. In any case, we note that Dr. Reuterfors and Dr. Sheldon did not testify as experts on pathological gambling but as psychological or psychiatric experts. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s admitting their testimony in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">Appellant further argues that Dr. Sheldon incorrectly stated the requirements of the ALI test for legal responsibility, as adopted by this circuit in <em>United States v. Frazier, supra, </em>458 F.2d at 918. Dr. Sheldon incorrectly stated that, under the ALI test, an individual must lack the substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The correct formulation of the ALI test is in the disjunctive. <em>Id. </em>We find no reversible error in the present circumstances. Defense counsel objected to Dr. Sheldon\u2019s testimony on the grounds that his opinion improperly invaded the province of the jury, not because Dr. Sheldon incorrectly stated that ALI test. Defense counsel did explore the fact that Dr. Sheldon misstated the ALI test, but made no specific objection or request for a correct statement of the ALI test. The district court in the instructions to the jury correctly stated the ALI test. We note that Dr. Sheldon specifically testified that, in his opinion, appellant was suffering from no mental disease or defect at the time of the alleged offense and that appellant had the substantial mental capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Dr. Sheldon\u2019s testimony thus addressed each part of the ALI test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Moreover, the fact that Dr. Sheldon misunderstood (or at least misstated) the requirements of the ALI test really affects his credibility as an expert witness rather than his qualifications as such. Any \u201cweakness in the underpinnings of such [expert] opinions may be developed upon cross-examination and such weakness goes to the weight and credibility of the testimony.\u201d <em>Polk v. Ford Motor Co., </em>529 F.2d 259, 271 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 907,96 S.Ct. 2229, 48 L.Ed.2d 832 (1976). Similarly, \u201c[c]omparisons between [the] professional stature [of the government\u2019s expert witnesses] and the stature of witnesses for an \u00abopposing party may be made by the jury, if it becomes necessary to decide which of two conflicting opinions to believe.\u201d <em>United States v. Barker, </em>553 F.2d 1013, 1024 (6th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\">III. <em>Refusal to Subpoena a Defense Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in refusing to subpoena his former wife Sharon Barry as a defense witness pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 17(b).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellant argues that Ms. Barry would have testified that appellant\u2019s gambling severely disrupted their married life. A \u201cdisrupted family or spouse relationship\u201d caused by gambling is one of the diagnostic criteria of pathological gambling. DSM-III, <em>supra, </em>at 292-93. Appellant thus argues that the presence of Ms. Barry was necessary to adequately present his insanity defense. We disagree.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">Compulsory process under Fed.R. Crim.P. 17(b) is not an absolute right but, like many other trial decisions, is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>E. g., United States v. Morris, </em>451 F.2d 969, 971 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Slawek v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 957, 960 (8th Cir. 1969); <em>Terlikowski v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 501, 508 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1008, 88 S.Ct. 569, 19 L.Ed.2d 604 (1967). We find no abuse of discretion here. Appellant testified without contradiction and at some length about his personal and employment history, specifically his unsatisfactory marital relationships and three divorces. Moreover, it was undisputed that gambling had severely disrupted appellant\u2019s married life and that appellant was a pathological gambler. Under these circumstances, we agree with the district court that Ms. Barry\u2019s testimony about her married life with appellant would have been repetitive and cumulative and therefore was not necessary to the presentation of an adequate defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">IV. <em>Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-12\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred in giving certain instructions to the jury. First, appellant argues that instructions # 9 and # 13 as given were confusing, misleading and contradictory. Instructions # 9 and # 13<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> contained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>elements of each offense and are based upon those set forth in 2 E. Devitt &amp; C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice &amp; Instructions \u00a7\u00a7 43.06, 45.05 (3d ed. 1977) (hereinafter Devitt &amp; Blackmar). Appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing to include in these instructions the burden of proof \u201ctail\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and a statement of the insanity defense.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">\u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of the case if there is evidence to support it and a proper request is entered.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>540 F.2d 364, 380 (8th Cir. 1976). A defendant, however, is not entitled to an instruction in a particular form. \u201cEven if the requested instruction is proper and in form suitable for use by the court, the court retains discretion in framing the instruction; it is therefore sufficient that the charge to the jury adequately and correctly covers the substance of the requested instruction.\u201d Id. We are satisfied, upon an examination of the instructions taken as a whole, that the instructions given by the district court adequately advised the jury of the essential elements of the offenses charged and the burden of the government to prove each element of the offenses charged, including the sanity of the defendant at the time of the commission of the offenses charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead of incorporating the burden of proof and insanity defense instructions in the instructions on the elements of the offenses <em>(see </em>note 25 <em>supra), </em>the district court gave the burden of proof and insanity defense instructions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">Second, appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing to modify the insanity defense instruction to include the term \u201cdisorder\u201d in addition to \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d Appellant contends that contemporary psychiatric practice uses the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d rather than \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d Appellant stresses that Dr. Custer, the expert witness for the defense, repeatedly characterized pathological gambling as a \u201cdisorder,\u201d while the government\u2019s expert witnesses expressly testified that pathological gambling was not a \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d Appellant argues that the insanity instruction as given to the jury was confusing, misleading and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to evaluate the implications of an apparent lack of congruity between the terminology presently used by the American Psychiatric Association and that used in the ALI Model Penal Code, as adopted by this circuit in <em>United States v. Frazier, supra, </em>458 F.2d at 918. The instruction as given here substantially follows the instruction specifically approved in <em>Frazier </em>and set forth in 1 Devitt &amp; Blackmar, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.17. While not a model of drafting, we find no error in the instruction as given. <em>See Government of Virgin Islands v. Fredericks, 578 </em>F.2d 927, 930-33 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Gay, </em>522 F.2d 429, 433 (6th Cir. 1975). <em>But see United States v. Brawner, </em>153 U.S.App.D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>1, 471 F.2d 969, 983-84 (1972) (banc) (holding that the <em>McDonald </em>definition should be retained to cure the \u201cinherent ambiguity\u201d of the terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d), <em>citing McDonald v. United States, </em>114 U.S. App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847, 851 (1962) (banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">The terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d are used inclusively in the instruction. Any mental disease or defect which deprives the defendant of the substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law will relieve him of legal responsibility. The only exception is that any abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct is not a mental disease or defect. <em>See United States v. Thomas, supra, </em>536 F.2d at 277 (approving ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01(2) (Final Draft 1962)); see <em>also United States v. Austin, </em>533 F.2d 879, 885 (3d Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1043, 97 S.Ct. 746, 50 L.Ed.2d 756 (1977); <em>Blake v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 908, 915-16 (5th Cir. 1969). <em>But see Wade v. United States, </em>426 F.2d 64, 73 (9th Cir. 1970) (banc), <em>citing United States v. Smith, </em>404 F.2d 720, 727 &amp; n.8 (6th Cir. 1968) (disapproving \u00a7 4.01(2)). Here, the expert witnesses agreed that appellant had a mental disorder, but disagreed sharply over whether appellant was suffering from a mental disease or defect. Resolution of this question was properly left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">V. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">Appellant lastly argues that the district court violated due process in sentencing him after the second trial to a term of imprisonment greater than twenty years and without specifying that he would be eligible for parole consideration after three years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1). <em>See Black-ledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 27, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2102, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974); <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); <em>United States v. Stacey, </em>571 F.2d 440, 444 (8th Cir. 1978). We agree in part and vacate the sentence imposed for count I and remand for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">As noted above, in the first sentence following the guilty plea the district court imposed a sentence of twenty years, modified to provide for consideration for parole after three years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1) for kidnapping (count I); count II was dismissed. Following the successful collateral attack, the government reinstated the original two-count indictment, appellant was tried and found guilty on both counts, and the district court<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> sentenced appellant to twenty years on count I and three years on count II, to be served consecutively, without specifying the particular statute under which parole was to be available.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">In <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>the Supreme Court held that the imposition of a more severe sentence upon reconviction following a successful appeal or collateral attack may violate due process. 395 U.S. at 723-24, 89 S.Ct. at 2079-80. The Court emphasized that due process requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsL\">that vindictiveness [<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>] against a defendant for having successfully attacked his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 725, 89 S.Ct. at 2080. In <em>Blackledge v. Perry, </em>the Supreme Court extended the due process principles set forth in <em>Pearce </em>to prosecutorial conduct as well. 417 U.S. at 27-29, 94 S.Ct. at 2102.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">We find no due process violation in appellant\u2019s reindictment for count II. \u201c[A] prosecutor may, without explanation, refile charges against a defendant whose bargained-for guilty plea to a lesser charge [or to a reduced number of charges] has been withdrawn or overturned on appeal [or collateral attack], provided that an increase in the [severity or number of the] charges is within the limits set by the original indictment.\u201d <em>Hardwick v. Doolittle, </em>558 F.2d 292, 301 &amp; n.8 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1049, 98 S.Ct. 897, 54 L.Ed.2d 801 (1978). Here, count II was charged in the original indictment but was later dismissed by the government following appellant\u2019s plea of guilty to count I (the more serious kidnapping charge), evidently as a result of plea negotiations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1342-8\">After that plea was vacated the situation reverted to the pre-plea stage. The fact that the [additional] charge was foregone as part of the plea arrangement does not mean that the Government would have prosecuted only the [kidnapping] charge originally if not guilty pleas had been entered as to both. Here we have a situation where there has been a major change other than just an appeal [or collateral attack] \u2014 the defendant had now pleaded not guilty to both charges. The decision to prosecute him for the [additional] offense can on its face be explained in terms other than vindictiveness because of a successful appeal [or collateral attack]. There is no appearance of retaliation when a defendant is placed in the same position as he was in before he accepted the plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\"><em>United States v. Anderson, </em>514 F.2d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cited with approval in United States v. Williams, </em>534 F.2d 119, 122-23 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 894, 97 S.Ct. 255, 50 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">We find no due process<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> violation in the imposition of a three-year <em>consecutive </em>sentence for count II. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>present, circumstances, appellant cannot complain that this sentence was a retaliatory penalty because count II was not part of the first trial and no sentence on count II was imposed. We distinguish <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>579 F.2d 415, 419-20 (7th Cir. 1978), in which the court found that the imposition of consecutive sentences of six years for robbery of government property (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112 (count II)) and three years probation for unarmed assault or interference with a federal agent (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (count I)) upon reconviction following a successful appeal violated due process. After entering a guilty plea, the defendant had received concurrent sentences of eight years imprisonment on the robbery count and three years on the assault count. The defendant on appeal argued that \u201cthe change in sentence from concurrent to consecutive imposed upon him \u2018the possibility of a longer period of incarceration than he faced under his previous sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419. Unlike the defendant in <em>Mathis, </em>appellant herein did not receive co seeutive sentences, instead of concurrent sentences, on the same counts upon reconviction. Appellant\u2019s consecutive sentence was imposed for an additional count, which was properly reinstated and prosecuted. <em>See </em>text <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">Appellant also argues that the district court\u2019s failure to specify parole eligibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in its sentence on count I following appellant\u2019s reconviction made that sentence more severe than the sentence imposed following the guilty plea. Appellant contends that because the record of the sentencing proceeding following his reconviction discloses that the district judge had no \u201cobjective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original proceeding,\u201d as required by <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081, the more severe sentence violates due process. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">We conclude that appellant\u2019s resentencing to twenty years with parole eligibility controlled by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(a) <em>(see </em>note 29 supra) was a harsher sentence than his previous sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(1). This question was expressly addressed in <em>United States v. Hawthorne, </em>532 F.2d 318, 322-25 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 894, 97 S.Ct. 254, 50 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Mathis, supra, </em>579 F.2d at 419; <em>United States v. Barash, </em>428 F.2d 328, 331 (2d Cir. 1970) (absent justification, <em>Pearce </em>prohibits an increase in the punishment imposed after a conviction on retrial regardless of the form of punishment, whether it is imprisonment, suspended sentence with probation or fine), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 938, 91 S.Ct. 928, 28 L.Ed.2d 217 (1971). Appellant\u2019s first sentence provided that he would be eligible for parole consideration after serving three years. <em>United States v. Gilliss, </em>No. 78-101\u2014 CR-(4) (E.D.Mo. Feb. 22, 1979) (modification of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 motion). Appellant\u2019s second sentence made no similar provision and as a consequence appellant would have been eligible for parole consideration only after serving one-third of his total sentence (or after 7% years, <em>see </em>note 29 <em>supra) </em>pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(a). Thus, the district court\u2019s failure to resentence appellant to parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>eligibility after three years deprived him of the possibility of earlier parole eligibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-4\"><em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>requires that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ade-dedup-0\">395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">Here the district court articulated the following reasons for imposing a more severe sentence: the twenty-year sentence was the same sentence imposed originally, count II was not part of the first trial, the four days of trial testimony, and the benefit of expert testimony. We conclude that these reasons do not meet the requirements set forth in <em>Pearce </em>to justify the imposition of a more severe sentence. None of these reasons are based upon \u201cobjective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In particular, we note that additional testimony<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that \u201cmerely describes in further detail the crime in which the defendant participated and the extent of this involvement .. . does not meet the <em>Pearce </em>standards for the reason that only \u2018intervening detrimental deportment\u2019, on the part of the defendant may justify a harsher sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>581 F.2d 602, 606 (7th Cir. 1978) (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Cunningham, </em>529 F.2d 884, 888 (6th Cir. 1976) <em>(Pearce </em>does not allow increased sentences on retrial based upon \u201camplified knowledge\u201d about a defendant\u2019s criminal activity which occurred before the first trial). <em>Cf.

In his \u00a7 2255 motion appellant argued that he believed he was pleading guilty to abduction (of the car ostensibly) only, that kidnapping for ransom was denied throughout the criminal proceedings, and that he had not transported Hunter against his will.

We note that the offense of kidnapping does not require any evidence of pecuniary motive. <em>E. g., United States v. Ca-valiaro, </em>553 F.2d 300, 304 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>citing United States </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>376 U.S. 75, 81-82, 84 S.Ct. 553, 557, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">. Appellant\u2019s 1980 trial will be referred to as his <em>second </em>trial for purposes of clarity. Appellant pleaded guilty on the first day of his 1978 trial (see note 4 <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">. We also find no violation of appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right to a speedy trial. Under the <em>ad hoc </em>balancing test set forth in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530-32, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2191-93, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), we must consider at least the following four factors: length of delay, the reason for the delay, the promptness of the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to a speedy trial, and the prejudice to the defendant from such delay. The two-year delay from arrest to trial in the present case was substantial and thus a sufficient \u201ctriggering mechanism\u201d to require further inquiry, <em>id. </em>at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2191. However, the reasons for the delay weigh strongly in favor of the government. Approximately 15\u2018/2 months delay is attributable to the time between appellant\u2019s guilty plea and the successful collateral attack and thus not chargeable to the government. See <em>United States v. Mills, </em>434 F.2d 266, 270 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 908, 27 L.Ed.2d 828 (1971), <em>citing United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 121, 86 S.Ct. 773, 777, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966); <em>cf. United States v. Herman, </em>576 F.2d 1139, 1145 &amp; n.5 (5th Cir. 1978) (withdrawal of guilty plea). As discussed in the text, most of the six months between the time the first conviction was vacated and trial was consumed by various defense motions and psychiatric examinations. See <em>Hodgdon v. United States, </em>365 F.2d 679, 686 (8th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 1029, 87 S.Ct. 759, 17 L.Ed.2d 676 (1967). Appellant promptly and vigorously asserted his right to a speedy trial, but the prejudice claimed by appellant is based upon the increased difficulty of accurate psychiatric evaluation of his mental state due to the lapse of time between the incident and the examinations. Such an allegation of prejudice is highly speculative. <em>Cf. United States v. Manetta, </em>551 F.2d 1352, 1354 (5th Cir. 1977) (using test in <em>Marion [U. S. v.
