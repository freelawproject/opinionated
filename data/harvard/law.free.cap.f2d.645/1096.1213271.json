Co. v. OSHRC,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the laudable and sweeping mandate of the general duty clause must be focused through clear notice of any specific hazard, in order to ensure fairness to employers and open, reasoned decisionmaking by OSHRC [the \u201cCommission\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">As the Commission acknowledges, the Secretary of Labor\u2019s [the \u201cSecretary\u201d] citation here provided Whirlpool Corp. [the \u201cpetitioner\u201d] with inadequate written notice of the alleged general duty violation, and the evidence presented at the administrative hearing was not a \u201cmodel of precision.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The predictable result of these haphazard procedures was a poorly developed record which fails to support OSHRC\u2019s findings. Because we cannot discern whether this lack of evidence reflects the confusion caused by the Secretary\u2019s procedures rather than an unmeritorious charge, we must remand this record for further development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">I. THE GENERAL DUTY CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"Arqi\">A. <em>Substantive Elements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Section 654(a)(1) of OSHA, the general duty clause, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Lc\">(a) Each employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-7\">(1) Shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">As OSHA\u2019s legislative history makes clear,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this subsection does <em>not </em>impose strict liability on employers, but instead limits their liability to \u201cpreventable hazards.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The three elements of a general duty violation are: (1) a hazard likely to cause death or serious bodily harm; (2) recognition of the hazard either by the specific employer or generally within the industry; and (3) existence of a feasible method of abatement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-14\">The Secretary has the burden of coming forward with evidence on the feasibility issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This procedural burden is closely related to the broad sweep of the clause,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for proof of the specific method of abatement, perhaps more than the other substantive elements, helps provide the employer with notice of the precise hazard at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-15\">B. <em>Notice requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-16\">Section 658 of OSHA provides that an employer charged under the general duty clause must be given notice in the form of a citation which \u201cshall be in writing and shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation ... [and] shall fix a reasonable time for the abatement of the violation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-17\">Ideally, the citation should provide the employer with notice of the Secretary\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>contentions pertinent to each of the three elements underlying a general duty violation. Where detailed prehearing notice has been lacking, the reviewing court must carefully scrutinize the Secretary\u2019s presentation of evidence to ensure that the cited employer has been afforded a fair opportunity to address the specific violation charged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As this court found in <em>National Realty, </em>the virtues of adequate notice extend even beyond due process: \u201cTo assure that citations issue only upon careful deliberation, the Secretary must be constrained to specify the particular steps a cited employer should have taken to avoid citation, and to demonstrate the feasibility and likely utility of those measures.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE INSTANT VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4c\">Petitioner manufactures appliances at its Marion, Ohio plant. Overhead conveyors move parts through the manufacturing process. To protect employees working beneath the conveyors from falling parts, petitioner maintains a huge protective guard screen, which consists of multiple steel mesh panels secured by metal clips to angle iron frames, which are joined together by bolts. Maintenance personnel routinely traverse the guard screen to retrieve fallen parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">In years prior to the instant violation, maintenance personnel fell partially through the guard screen. In 1974, an employee fell to his death when the bolts joining two frames failed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After an OSHA compliance officer\u2019s inspection, petitioner was cited for: \u201cfailure to provide a safe walking and working surface on the screens under the conveyor.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The citation further required \u201cimmediate\u201d abatement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Petitioner contested the citation,</p>\n<p id=\"aax-dedup-0\">At the hearing, the Secretary offered the testimony of employees who described occasions on which workers had fallen partially through the screen. The Secretary\u2019s compliance officer refused to specify whether the source of the hazard was the bolts linking the panel frames or the tensile strength of the screen mesh.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A civil engineer testified for the Secretary, and suggested a third theory of the hazard: the absence of a heavy steel catwalk.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s engineer testified on cross-examination that one-third of the screen\u2019s panels had been replaced by heavier gauge mesh, but he added that complete replacement was architecturally infeasible.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-12\">The Administrative Law Judge [\u201cALJ\u201d] vacated the citation without deciding whether the Secretary had proven a general duty clause violation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> OSHRC remanded the matter to the ALJ for findings under the general duty clause. One Commissioner dissented from the remand order, however, on the grounds that the Secretary had failed to specify or prove a feasible abatement method.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-13\">On remand, the ALJ again dismissed the citation, this time on the grounds <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that the record did not reveal a feasible abatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>method.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The ALJ assumed<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that the hazard contemplated by the Secretary was the tensile strength of the screen panels. However, the ALJ accepted the unrefuted testimony of petitioner\u2019s expert, who stated that <em>complete </em>screen panel replacement was infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">OSHRC again overruled the ALJ. The Commission was admirably candid in acknowledging the substantial deficiencies in the notice provided petitioner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-5\">[T]he citation failed to specify [what condition rendered the screen unsafe] and accordingly facially lacked particularity. [In addition] a foundation had been laid in the citation for [the Secretary\u2019s] own confusion of focus and for [petitioner\u2019s] possible misconception of the case, not only by the absence of reference to the [tensile strength of the mesh] as the hazard, but by the requirement of immediate abatement, which most likely suggested abatement by replacing the bolts rather than by replacing a substantial part of the guard screen panels.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACPp\">The Commission concluded that, notwithstanding the confusion precipitated by its citation, the \u201cpurposes of the particularity requirement [were] fulfilled in subsequent stages of the proceeding.\u201d Although the \u201cSecretary\u2019s evidence at the hearing was not a model of precision in identifying the hazard,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the Commission found that repeated reference to the strength of the steel mesh gave petitioner constructive notice of the hazard. Moreover, according to the Commission, petitioner apparently perceived that the tensile strength of the screens was the hazard, for it introduced rebuttal evidence on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-14\">The Commission also rejected the AU\u2019s findings regarding the lack of evidence on the feasibility issue.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Commission relied on the \u201crecord as a whole,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and specifically: (1) the testimony of petitioner\u2019s engineer that heavier gauge screens were safer;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and, the testimony of petitioner\u2019s employees, who acknowledged that heavier screen panels were typically deployed to replace screens that had torn. The Commission concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-15\">Because Whirlpool systematically was replacing the mesh panels with heavy duty wire throughout the plant, the feasibility of the heavy duty wire to eliminate the hazard and its likely utility in Whirlpool\u2019s plant <em>is apparent.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-16\">The Commission reversed the findings of the AU, and amended the citation to provide an abatement period of six months.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>III. NOTICE AND EVIDENCE OF A FEASIBLE ABATEMENT METHOD</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">A. <em>Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">OSHRC points to employees\u2019 references to the guard screen panels and to rebuttal testimony on the tensile strength of the screen as evidence that petitioner had adequate notice of the hazard. In so doing, the Commission ignores the importance of detailed notice to the fair administration of the general duty clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that petitioner\u2019s rebuttal suggests a general awareness of the hazardous condition,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it hardly follows that the Secretary ever gave petitioner a fair opportunity to address a necessary and independent issue: how the hazard could have been feasibly abated. The Commission acknowledges that there was no written notice. Nor was there constructive notice, for no witness outlined \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s own theory of what steps the [petitioner] should have taken to abate the hazard.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s compliance officer addressed the subject of abatement only on cross-examination, and he pointedly refused to reveal the Secretary\u2019s abatement plan.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s engineer did not even address abatement. Of course, the Commission\u2019s post-hearing alteration of the citation clarified the hazard charged, but came far too late to provide petitioner with a fair opportunity to meet the Secretary\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-18\">B. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-19\">The substantial evidence rule requires a court reviewing an administrative adjudication to accept findings of fact supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As tolerant as this standard is, the vague notice and unfocused evidence offered by the Secretary at the hearing has resulted in a record devoid of support for OSHRC\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-20\">Although some witnesses called by the Secretary testified to the <em>efficacy </em>of the heavier gauge screen, none addressed the <em>feasibility </em>of complete screen panel replacement.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> On cross-examination, petitioner\u2019s engineer, after noting that one-third of the panels had been replaced before the fatality, stated that <em>complete </em>panel replacement was architecturally infeasible. In view of his unrefuted testimony, it is by no means \u201capparent\u201d that complete replacement was a feasible means of abating the hazard.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the OSHRC is vacated and the record remanded for further development on the issue of a feasible abatement method.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1157-11\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 et seq.
