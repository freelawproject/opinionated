App.P. 34(a); Tenth Cir.R. 10(e). This cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">This appeal attacks the trial court\u2019s determination that the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture may lawfully enforce his regulation set out at 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(l)(iii) in the form in which it was promulgated on July 15, 1974. 39 Fed.Reg. 26003. The challenged regulation deals with which educational expenses may be deducted from gross income in determining the net income of Food Stamp Program<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applicants. An individual\u2019s level of participation in the Food Stamp Program is dependent largely upon his net income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant contends that the regulation was promulgated in violation of applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, and must be held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">The challenged regulation was preceded by a regulation properly promulgated in 1971 which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-19\">Deductions for the following household expenses shall be made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-20\">(f) Educational expenses which are for tuition and mandatory school fees, including such expenses which are covered by scholarships, educational grants, loans, fellowships, and veterans\u2019 educational benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(l)(iii)(f) (1972 ed.), 36 Fed.Reg. 14107 (July 29, 1971). This version of the regulation constituted the center of the controversy in <em>Hein v. Burns, </em>371 F.Supp. 1091 (S.D.Iowa), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>419 U.S. 989, 95 S.Ct. 297, 42 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974) <em>[Hein </em>I]. The plaintiff in that case argued, and the three-judge district court agreed, that the regulation allowed a deduction for expenses incurred in travelling to and from school. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>a more reasonable interpretation of [the regulation], and the one adopted by this Court, is that the phrase \u201csuch expenses\u201d refers not to \u201ctuition and mandatory school fees,\u201d but to the general classification \u201ceducational expenses.\u201d So construed, the subsection may be read as allowing deduction of educational expenses including educational expenses which are covered by scholarships, educational grants, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">371 F.Supp. at 1094-95. The United States Supreme Court vacated this decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the intervening regulation which is challenged here. The current regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-5\">Deductions for the following household expenses shall be made (this list is inclusive and no other deductions from income shall be allowed):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-6\">(f) Tuition and mandatory fees assessed by educational institutions (no deductions shall be made for any other education expenses such as, but not limited to, the expense of books, school supplies, meals at school, and transportation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(iii), 39 Fed.Reg. 26003 (July 15, 1974). As the clear language of the current regulation mandates, the three-judge district court determined on remand that <em>only </em>expenses attributable to tuition or mandatory school fees were deductible. <em>Hein v. Burns, </em>402 F.Supp. 398 (S.D.Iowa 1975), <em>reversed sub nom. Knebel v. Hein, </em>429 U.S. 288, 97 S.Ct. 549, 50 L.Ed.2d 485 (1977) <em>[Hein II].</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">There is a third version of the challenged regulation that must also be considered. The current regulation was preceded by a proposed regulation which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-9\">Deductions for the following household expenses shall be made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-10\">(e) Educational expenses which are for tuition and mandatory school fees. This includes those tuition and mandatory school fees which are covered by scholarships, educational grants, loans, fellowships, and veterans\u2019 educational benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ6\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.3(c)(l)(iii)(e), 39 Fed.Reg. 3644 (January 28, 1974). Appellant concedes that had the rule <em>proposed </em>in January 1974 been <em>promulgated </em>as written, it would be valid as properly promulgated in accordance with APA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the original regulation and the proposed regulation are virtually identical and that the only real change is accomplished in the wording of the final regulation. However, it is apparent that the proposed regulation does, in fact, differ from the original regulation insofar as it precludes the reading given the original regulation by the three-judge court in <em>Hein I. </em>By explicitly tying \u201cincludes\u201d to \u201ctuition and mandatory school fees,\u201d and deleting the term \u201csuch expenses,\u201d the proposed regulation makes it significantly clearer that <em>only </em>tuition and mandatory school fees are to be deducted from a food stamp applicant\u2019s gross income. This comparison of the proposed regulation to the original regulation also makes clear that the regulation finally promulgated in July 1974 is only another, perhaps clearer, way of saying what was explicit in the proposed regulation. This grammatic excursion may border on the academic, but it effectively rebuts appellant\u2019s claim that the proposed regulation did not provide her or other interested parties with the kind of notice that would have prompted them to comment on the proposed change as was their right under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">Section 553 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFT\">(b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register, unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. The notice shall include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>(3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Assuming that the original rule was correctly interpreted by the three-judge court in <em>Hein I, </em>it is clear that the proposed regulation effectively set out the \u201cterms\u201d and \u201csubstance\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s intention to preclude such an interpretation. The bare words of the proposal were adequate to alert those interested and they should have submitted their comments if they opposed the change. We reject the argument that the rule finally promulgated changed either the effect of or the intent behind the proposed rule. A mere change in wording does not require an agency to enter into a new round of rule making procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">It is a well settled and sound rule which permits administrative agencies to make changes in the proposed rule after the comment period without a new round of hearings. <em>American Iron &amp; Steel Inst. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>568 F.2d 284 (3d Cir. 1977). To hold otherwise would \u201clead to the absurdity that in rule making under the APA the agency can learn from the comments on its proposals only at the peril of starting a new procedural round of commentary.\u201d <em>International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>478 F.2d 615, 632 n.51 (D.C. Cir. 1973). A limitation on this principle is that the changes be in \u201ccharacter with the original scheme and [be] foreshadowed in proposals and comments advanced during the rulemaking.\u201d <em>South Terminal Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>504 F.2d 646, 658 (1st Cir. 1974). The changes in the instant case were for clarity only and therefore insubstantial and certainly foreshadowed by the proposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The Rule issued in July 1974 was lawfully promulgated and the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-15\">. <em>See </em>Food Stamp Act of 1964, \u00a7 2, 78 Stat. 703 (current version at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2027).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b923-16\">.
