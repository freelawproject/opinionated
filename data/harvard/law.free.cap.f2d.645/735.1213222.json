For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">Chase owns and operates the Night Moves Tavern in Pierce County, which had featured topless dancing before May 8, 1979. On that date the county\u2019s Board of Commissioners enacted Resolution 21436, which prohibited topless entertainment in all non-theatrical establishments selling food or beverages (\u201cincluding, but not limited to, alcoholic beverages\u201d) for consumption on the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chase stopped presenting topless dancing, but commenced this lawsuit on June 12, 1979, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In addition, he moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent appellants from enforcing Resolution 21436 against him during the pendency of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">On July 13, 1979, the district court ordered the trial on the merits advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the preliminary injunction, as authorized by Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). The trial was held four days later, and on July 19 the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>and a judgment holding Resolution 21436 \u201cunconstitutionally overbroad on its face, under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Appellee based his challenge to Resolution 21436 on the doctrine of over-breadth, under which \u201ca litigant whose own activities are unprotected may nevertheless challenge a statute by showing that it substantially abridges the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court.\u201d <em>Village of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620, 634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 835, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980). Appellee assumed for the sake of argument that the county could constitutionally have banned topless dancing in establishments, like his, where liquor was sold.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But he argued that the resolution on its face applied to other kinds of establishments in which topless dancing could not constitutionally be prohibited and thus violated the principle that statutes punishing expressive conduct \u201cmust be carefully drawn or be authoritatively construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible of application to protected expression.\u201d <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 522, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1106, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972). A statute that violates this principle by substantially abridging protected expression is invalid on its face and cannot be enforced against anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">There can be no doubt that Resolution 21436 is overbroad. It bans the display of breasts in any place that serves food or beverages, alcoholic or not, that is not a \u201ctheater, concert hall or other similar establishment ... primarily devoted to theatrical performances\u201d as defined in the resolution. This ban would apply not only to bars and taverns but to restaurants, cabarets, supper clubs, and to \u201ca discotheque serving only soft drinks,\u201d as the Minnesota Supreme Court said of a city ordinance it struck down as overbroad. <em>Koppinger v. City of Fairmont, </em>311 Minn. 186, 248 N.W.2d 708, 716 (1976). Moreover, the resolution would prevent the affected establishments from offering entertainment that is not obscene under current law, since nudity alone is not sufficient to make material legally obscene. <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 161, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 2755, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974). Such non-obscene entertainment is protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, a cabaret would be prohibited from presenting the musical \u201cHair,\u201d which contains a nude scene, although federal courts have held that show to be non-obscene. <em>See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. City of Mobile, </em>457 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. City of Atlanta, </em>334 F.Supp. 634 (N.D.Ga. 1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Thus it seems clear that Resolution 21436 would prohibit instances of communicative activity protected by the First Amendment; therefore, the resolution is overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Appellants contend that it was error to apply the overbreadth doctrine in this case because the topless dancing at the Night Moves Tavern was \u201ccommercial speech,\u201d to which that doctrine does not apply. <em>Bates v. State Bar, </em>433 U.S. 350, 380, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2707, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977). Appellants are mistaken, however, in characteriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ing the topless dancing as \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d The Supreme Court has described commercial speech as \u201cspeech which \u2018does no more than propose a commercial transaction,\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U.S. 748, 762, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1825, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976), or an \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience,\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 557, 561, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). These descriptions do not apply to topless barroom dancing. Whatever may be the attitude or emotion conveyed to the audience \u2014 whether an esthetic appreciation of the human body or a \u201cprurient interest\u201d \u2014 it is not one \u201crelated solely to the economic interests of the . . . audience,\u201d nor does topless dancing propose a commercial transaction to the viewers. Of course, topless dancing is a form of expression presented for pecuniary gain. But the same is true of books, newspapers, and motion pictures, which are not on that account classified as \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Simply because Resolution 21436 is overbroad does not mean that it must automatically be held invalid. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cparticularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, . .. the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d to justify invalidating the statute. <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2918, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). We believe that the overbreadth of Resolution 21436 is sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to warrant the statute\u2019s invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Had Resolution 21436 applied only to establishments that sell alcoholic beverages, it would apparently have been constitutional, as mentioned earlier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the rationale that appellants have advanced for the resolution suggests no reason why the scope of the resolution was not so limited. According to appellants, the resolution was intended not as an anti-obscenity measure<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but as a means of alleviating the disproportionate drain on county law enforcement that stemmed from the increased prostitution, gambling, and other criminal conduct associated with topless dancing establishments. Yet all of the problems appellants discuss arose exclusively at <em>bars </em>featuring topless dancing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus it appears that the interests that motivated the passage of Resolution 21436 could have been served just as well by a more narrowly drawn statute applicable only to liquor-selling establishments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Because the resolution encompasses so many more establishments than the topless bars that allegedly generated the need for the statute, a finding of substantial overbreadth is warranted, especially in view of the frequency with which the Supreme Court has emphasized the need for \u201cnarrow specificity\u201d in regulations trenching on First Amendment freedoms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the Second Circuit has invalidated, on over-breadth grounds, an ordinance banning topless dancing whose scope was essentially identical to that of Resolution 21436. <em>Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, </em>522 F.2d 1045 (2d Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given these factors, the mere fact that the resolution arguably applies to \u201cconduct\u201d rather than \u201cspeech\u201d is not sufficient to persuade us that the overbreadth problem is insubstantial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Appellants argue that Resolution 21436 should be held constitutional because it satisfies the four-part test of <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Brien </em>is of doubtful relevance here, however. The four-part test it enunciated was devised to deal with O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument that the statute penalizing draft-card burning was \u201cunconstitutional as applied to him because his act of burning his registration certificate was protected \u2018symbolic speech\u2019 within the First Amendment.\u201d 391 U.S. at 376, 88 S.Ct. at 1678. The case at bar is quite different. First, appellee is not challenging Resolution 21436 as applied to him, but contends it is drafted so broadly that it will strike at the protected speech of <em>other </em>persons. Second, the kind of \u201csymbolic speech\u201d issue present in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>is absent here. Unlike the statute challenged in <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>Resolution 21436 is not attacked for implicating conduct, generally considered non-expressive, which the actor asserts to be communicative. Rather, the infirmity of the resolution arises because its overbreadth would prevent the establishments it covers from presenting various plays, musicals, ballets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740-746\">*740-746</page-number>and other items ordinarily regarded as expressive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Moreover, even if it is proper to apply the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test here, our result would be unchanged. As already shown, the county\u2019s professed law enforcement interest could have been served by a regulation applying only to places where liquor is sold. Resolution 21436 therefore restricts first amendment freedoms to a greater degree than is essential to further the county\u2019s constitutionally permissible goals. It thus fails to meet the final requirement of the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Because we find that Resolution 21436 is substantially overbroad, we affirm the judgment of the district court that the resolution is unconstitutional on its face. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\">. The resolution exempted any \u201ctheater, concert hall or other similar establishment which is primarily devoted to theatrical performances.\u201d This phrase was defined to apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azl-dedup-0\">a building, playhouse, room, hall or other place having seats so arranged that a body of spectators can have an unobstructed view of the stage, upon which theatrical or vaudeville performances or similar forms of artistic expression are presented, and where such performances are not incidental to the promoting of the sale of food, drink or other merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-22\">The resolution made it a misdemeanor for any waiter, waitress or entertainer in a covered establishment to expose \u201cany portion of the breast at or below the areola thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. This indeed seems to follow from <em>California v. LaRue, </em>409 U.S. 109, 93 S.Ct. 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972), which held that regulations of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control banning explicitly sexual live entertainment and films in bars were constitutional by virtue of the Twenty-First Amendment\u2019s grant to the states of plenary power to regulate liquor sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. The Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201cmere entertainment\u201d is protected speech. <em>Stanley v.

Judicial opinions treating statutes similar to Resolution 21436 enumerate other protected activities that could be prohibited by such a statute, including operas, educational exhibitions, and African and other ethnic dances. <em>See People v.

Resolution 21436 would have been patently overbroad if intended as an obscenity statute, since mere nudity is not per se obscene, <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 161, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 2755, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974), even for juveniles. <em>Erznoznick v.

Thus a letter from Undersheriff Roy Durham to the county commissioners supporting enactment of Resolution 21436 indicated that all four of the establishments in unincorporated county areas that featured topless dancing also served liquor. Commissioner Stortini, in remarks advocating the resolution, spoke of \u201ctopless dancing bars\u201d as the target. And appellants themselves dwell on comparisons between the criminal conduct associated with topless establishments and that characterizing \u201cordinary taverns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\">. We note that the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions stated that regulations infringing constitutional rights must fall if less restrictive alternatives are available. <em>See, e. g., Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U.S. 173, 185, 99 S.Ct. 983, 991, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979); <em>Kusper v.

The ordinance in <em>Frank </em>banned topless dancing in cabarets, bars, dance halls, discotheques, restaurants, and coffee shops. The Second Circuit faulted this ordinance in part because it applied \u201cto places <em>not </em>serving alcoholic beverages such as coffee shops, restaurants, dance halls and discotheques.\u201d 522 F.2d at 1047 (footnote omitted). The same criticism applies to Resolution 21436.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">. We are hesitant to rely uncritically on the speech/conduct dichotomy. In part, our hesitancy arises from the conceptual weakness of the distinction. \u201cSpeech\u201d \u2014 communication of ideas or attitudes \u2014 is itself a form of \u201cconduct.\u201d <em>See </em>Ely, <em>Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, </em>88 Harv. L.Rev. 1482, 1495 (1975) In part, we are hesitant because what would ordinarily be called \u201cspeech\u201d may not be \u201cspeech\u201d for First Amendment purposes \u2014 e. g., obscenity, <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 23, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) \u2014 whereas what would ordinarily be classified as \u201cconduct\u201d may well be treated as protected \u201cspeech\u201d \u2014 e. g., wearing a protest armband, <em>Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). Finally, we are troubled by the special dangers involved in applying the speech/conduct distinction to theatrical productions or stage performances. <em>See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. City of Atlanta, </em>334 F.Supp. 634, 639 (N.D.Ga.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\">.

[W]e think it clear that a government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">391 U.S. at 376-77, 88 S.Ct. at 1678-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. A narrow reading of <em>O\u2019Brien </em>is particularly appropriate given the Supreme Court\u2019s own reluctance to employ the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test since it was first stated. In no subsequent opinion did the Court base its decision on that test. Indeed, the Court refrained from' applying the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test even when confronted with genuine \u201csymbolic speech\u201d claims. <em>See Spence v.
