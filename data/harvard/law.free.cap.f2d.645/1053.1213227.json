Delinski (Delinski), now deceased,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was a sheet metal worker hired by Brandt Airflex Corporation (Brandt) in September 1974 to assist in the construction of an office building in Washington, D.C. On December 13, 1974, Delinski arrived at the job site and proceeded to climb the stairs leading to the ninth floor where he was working. The elevators had not yet been installed. After climbing about seven flights of stairs, he suffered what was later diagnosed as congestive heart failure. He was hospitalized for one week and was thereupon advised by his doctors not to resume his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Subsequently, Delinski filed a claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1976) (the Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brandt and its insurance carrier, U.S. Fire Insurance Company, stipulated that Delin-ski suffered an injury on December 13, 1974, and that the parties were subject to the Act, but claimed that the injury was not related to Delinski\u2019s employment and that, in any event, liability was limited to 104 weeks of compensation pursuant to section 8(f) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found against the employer and its insurance carrier on both of these defenses. On appeal to the Benefits Review Board of the Department of Labor, the ALJ was reversed on the issue of the applicability of section 8(f). The Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor (Director), who has responsibility for administering the Special Fund from which payments must be made when section 8(f) applies, and Delinski himself petitioned for review of this portion of the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brandt and its insurance carrier petitioned for review of the finding that Delin-ski suffered a compensable injury. We affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">I. THE WORK-RELATED NATURE OF THE INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">The Act authorizes payment of compensation for \u201caccidental injury or death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(2) (1976). After a formal hearing, the ALJ found that Delin-ski had suffered such a work-related injury. In keeping with section 21(b)(3) of the Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact since they were supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. We agree with the Board\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The building under construction included four underground parking levels. The top three levels were already open to the public for parking at $2.50 or $3.00 per day, and the bottom level was available for use by the construction workers at $1.00 per day. Delinski parked his car on the bottom level at the commencement of his work day and was on his way to his workplace in the building when the injury occurred. Brandt argues that the injury preceded Delinski\u2019s arrival at his place of employment and therefore did not occur \u201cin the course of\u201d his employment or \u201caris[e] out of\u201d it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is an attempt to invoke the so-called \u201cgoing and coming rule,\u201d which generally bars compensation for injuries sustained off work premises by employees going to or coming from work. <em>See Foster v. Massey, </em>407 F.2d 343, 345 (D.C.Cir. 1968), and cases cited therein. In support of its argument, Brandt cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951). However, we read <em>O\u2019Leary </em>as demonstrating that the going and coming rule is inapposite to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">In <em>O'Leary, </em>the Court found coverage under the Act when an employee drowned while attempting to rescue someone by swimming through a dangerous channel which was marked as forbidden for swimming. The employee had spent the afternoon at a recreational center maintained by his employer which was located near the shoreline. The Court held that coverage under the Act \u201cis not confined by common-law conceptions of scope of employment. ... All that is required is that the \u2018obligations or conditions\u2019 of employment create the \u2018zone of special danger\u2019 out of which the injury arose.\u201d 340 U.S. at 506-07, 71 S.Ct. at 471-72 (citations omitted); <em>accord, Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Electric Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Adler, </em>340 F.2d 799, 801 (D.C.Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">In the instant case, Delinski was \u201cobligated\u201d to work on the ninth floor on the day of the injury and, because the elevators were not yet functional, had to climb the stairs to the ninth floor in order to get to work. Nine flights of stairs (plus four flights from the discount parking level) in the elevator-less building constituted the \u201czone of special danger\u201d out of which Delinski\u2019s heart attack arose. It defies reason and the remedial nature of the Act to suggest that the employment premises here were limited to the discrete job site on the ninth floor and that the employer\u2019s liability was limited accordingly. <em>See </em>A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 15.41 (1978). <em>See also O\u2019Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Assocs., </em>380 U.S. 359, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965). Therefore, we are fully satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Delinski was on the employer\u2019s premises at the time of the heart attack and that the attack occurred \u201cin the course of\u201d Delinski\u2019s employment \u201chas substantial roots in the evidence and is not forbidden by law.\u201d <em>Cardillo v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 U.S. 469, 478, 67 S.Ct. 801, 806, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947); <em>accord, Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Kemp, </em>533 F.2d 1224, 1226 (D.C.Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Brandt also argues that Delinski\u2019s heart condition was preexisting and that it did not change permanently as a result of the episode in <em>question </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>Delinski\u2019s permanent, total disability did not \u201caris[e] out of\u201d his employment with Brandt on December 13, 1974. The record before the ALJ weighs heavily against such a claim. The ALJ found that Delinski was only partially disabled before the 1974 incident in question. Although physicians detected Delin-ski\u2019s coronary artery disease as far back as 1971, he continued working thereafter in an extremely strenuous occupation. He was referred to as one of the better workers during this period and the record shows that he performed his duties fully until his heart attack. While it is true that his doctor originally suggested Delinski\u2019s retirement back in 1973, the same doctor approved his return to work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">Although there was some conflicting testimony concerning the temporal effect of the December 13, 1974 trauma, there was ample evidence for the ALJ to conclude that Delinski became totally and permanently disabled on that date. It is the AIJ\u2019s province, as the trier of fact, to weigh contradictory evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and reach an ultimate conclusion as to the facts. <em>Nardella v. Campbell Machine, Inc., </em>525 F.2d 46, 48-49 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Donovan, </em>300 F.2d 741 (5th Cir. 1962). And it is well settled that an employer is liable for the consequences of a work-related injury which aggravates a preexisting condition. <em>E. g., J.V. Vozzolo, Inc. v. Britton, </em>377 F.2d 144, 147-48 (D.C.Cir. 1967) (preexisting coronary arteriosclerosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">Moreover, the history of this statute makes clear its remedial purpose, and its implementation has always presumed that doubts would be resolved in favor of the claim and coverage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Swinton v. J. Frank Kelly, Inc., </em>554 F.2d 1075, 1081 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 67, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976); <em>Evening Star Newspaper Co. v. Kemp, </em>533 F.2d 1224, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 1976). This court most recently reaffirmed the breadth of that presumption in <em>Riley v. U.S. Industries, </em>627 F.2d 455 (D.C. Cir. 1980), noting that the strength of the presumption that an injury \u201caris[es] out of\u201d employment is enhanced where it has been established that the injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u201d employment. <em>Id. </em>at 458; <em>accord, Wheatley v. Adler, </em>407 F.2d 307, 312 (D.C. Cir. 1968) <em>(en banc). </em>In any event, the standard of judicial review precludes any serious dispute of the ALJ\u2019s findings, entrenched as they are by the Board\u2019s affirmance. <em>Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 459, 467, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 1145, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 504, 508, 71 S.Ct. 470, 472, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951). We are convinced that substantial evidence supports the findings that Delinski\u2019s injury arose out of and occurred in the course of his employment with Brandt and resulted in his permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">II. THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTION 8(F)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">The remaining issue is whether the Board\u2019s determination that Brandt\u2019s liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>ty is limited by section 8(f) <em>of the </em>Act should be upheld. Section 8(f), set out in the margin below,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> reflects an effort by Congress \u201cto encourage the employment and retention of handicapped workers \u2014 individuals having a previous impairment.\u201d <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>564 F.2d 503, 512 (D.C.Cir. 1977). Congress recognized that workers compensation laws may increase employers\u2019 reluctance to hire such individuals because of fears that a partially disabled person is likely to suffer an injury on the job, compounding his previous disability and saddling his employer with burdensome compensation costs. <em>See id. </em>at 511 (quoting legislative history). So Congress decided to limit the burden on employers by restricting their liability in these so-called \u201csecond injury\u201d cases to a maximum of 104 weeks\u2019 compensation, with the remainder of the employee\u2019s coverage to be paid out of a special fund created under the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">As the case law has developed under section 8(f), a distinction has been drawn between \u201clatent\u201d injuries and those \u201cmanifest\u201d to the employer; an employer is only eligible for section 8(f) relief if the employee\u2019s preexisting disability was \u201cmanifest\u201d to him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See American Mutual Insurance Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>v. <em>Jones, </em>426 F.2d 1263, 1267-68 (D.C.Cir. 1970). It is true that section 8(f) contains no language even suggesting that the employee\u2019s previous impairment must be known or manifest to the employer before the 104-week limitation can apply. But this exclusion of \u201clatent\u201d injuries in previous court decisions has been considered appropriate because the congressional intent was to prevent discrimination, and \u201cif the previous disability had not been manifest, the employer would have had no reason to discriminate against the handicapped person in hiring or firing.\u201d <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>564 F.2d 503, 514 n. 10 (D.C.Cir. 1977). Courts have noted that too liberal an application of section 8(f) might give undeserving employers a windfall at the expense of the special fund. <em>See, e. g., American Mutual Insurance Co. v. Jones, </em>426 F.2d 1263, 1267 (D.C.Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">Although some jurists have questioned the statutory basis for the manifestness doctrine, <em>see Ridgely v. Ceres, Inc., </em>594 F.2d 1175, 1178-79 (8th Cir. 1979) (Ross, J., concurring), the doctrine is established by clear precedent in this circuit, and Congress has not acted to erase the judicial gloss.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In locating the proper place of the present factual situation within the framework of our precedents, however, we must remember that manifestness is a matter of degree, and we must not guard so zealously against windfalls that the explicit congressional intent to protect the handicapped worker is sacrificed to an auxiliary purpose elaborated by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">The \u201cmanifest\u201d injury standard does not require actual knowledge on the part of the employer. <em>See Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>542 F.2d 602, 609 (3rd Cir. 1976); <em>American Mutual Insurance Co. v. Jones, </em>426 F.2d 1263, 1267-28 (D.C.Cir. 1970). Potential for discrimination exists where information demonstrating the employee\u2019s prior injury is \u201cavailable to [the employer] when the hiring occurs, should he decide to take notice of it.\u201d <em>Dillingham Corp. v. Massey, </em>505 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir. 1974). The employee\u2019s disability need not be superficially apparent. Internal pathologies may be eligible for section 8(f) treatment, although \u201c[w]hat is manifest to a physician is not necessarily manifest to a lay employer,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">The Third Circuit recently reviewed the applicability of section 8(f) under circumstances similar to those present here, and concluded that sufficiently explicit medical records may make an employee\u2019s disability manifest, even if the employer does not make the effort to examine those records. <em>See Director, Officer of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedoring Corp., </em>575 F.2d 452 (3d Cir. 1978). The claimant in that case, De Nichi-lo, suffered a similar heart episode while operating a forklift. As here, De Nichilo had a history of arteriosclerotic heart disease unknown to the employer. In ruling that section 8(f) applied to limit the employer\u2019s liability, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-10\">Heart disease is not as obviously manifest a disability as is the loss of a limb or an eye. Nevertheless, in many instances heart disease is objectively determinable and objectively determined. The record before the administrative law judge contains the evidence of De Nichilo\u2019s prior hospitalization for a possible myocardial infarction and the testimony of Dr. Ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>ward S. Wally that De Nichilo suffered from a coronary heart disease. The administrative law judge relied upon this evidence of De Nichilo\u2019s abnormal heart condition to conclude that the degree of stress De Nichilo underwent on December 28, 1974, produced the attack he suffered on that date. Although the administrative law judge did not use the word manifest, he found that De Nichilo had pre-ex-isting physical infirmities of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. <em>These were readily discoverable by any employer who looked at De Nichilo\u2019s record. That record makes the disability manifest. </em>No more is required for the purpose of assuring that only eligible employers receive the insurance coverage provided by \u00a7 8(f) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">575 F.2d at 456-57 (emphasis added). The court reversed the Benefits Review Board\u2019s denial of section 8(f) relief to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">The Board relied heavily on the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis in considering Delinski\u2019s case. The ALJ had found that Delinski\u2019s disability was not manifest to Brandt, but the Board reversed, observing that the facts were \u201calmost identical to those of <em>DeNichilo\u201d:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-6\">Claimant was hired under a union hiring hall arrangement, and no physical examination was performed. He has a long history of high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and arteriosclerotic heart disease, as well as residuals of pneumonia, bronchitis and pleuritis. Records concerning diagnosis and treatment of these conditions were kept by claimant\u2019s union Pension Fund and Health and Welfare Fund, by the hospitals at which he was treated, and by at least one doctor. These records were introduced before the administrative law judge, and were relied upon by him in determining that the existing disability contributed to the permanent total disability caused by the congestive heart failure. Under <em>DeNichilo, </em>claimant\u2019s medical history was discoverable had employer \u201cdecide[d] to take notice of it.\u201d <em>Dillingham.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">9 B.R.B.S. at 211. Delinski\u2019s medical records could not be more explicit. Indeed, both the union\u2019s files and the files of Delin-ski\u2019s physician Dr. Pellegrini contain copies of a letter Dr. Pellegrini wrote in support of Delinski\u2019s application for a total disability pension in 1973. That letter states a \u201cconfirmed diagnosis of Diverticulitis, coronary artery disease, peptic ulcer and hypertension, essential,\u201d with blood pressure ranging \u201cfrom 200/110 to 150/90 \u2014 with medication.\u201d App. 292, 415. Certainly any employer inspecting these records would be immediately put on notice that future injuries would be likely to compound a preexisting disability if Delinski continued to labor as a sheet metal worker. If these records were available to Brandt, then the Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Universal Terminal </em>compels the conclusion that Delinski\u2019s disability was manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">A substantial argument has been waged throughout this litigation, therefore, concerning the availability of Delinski\u2019s pre-hire medical records to Brandt. Testimony indicated that the union pension fund would be hesitant to permit an employer to inspect its files without a written release from the employee, and that industry practice did not involve medical examinations or requests that employees submit non-union medical records. But nothing in the collective bargaining agreement <em>required </em>that industry practice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>The ALJ viewed it as \u201cpositively established that medical records relating to the Claimant\u2019s prior disability were not available to the Employer.\u201d App. 554. If the ALJ\u2019s statement is to be read as confirming an obstacle to the employer\u2019s access to, for example, the records of Dr. Pellegrini, then that finding is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the ALJ\u2019s statement refers only to the unavailability of the union\u2019s copies of Delinski\u2019s records, then the ALJ erred in viewing those particular copies as determinative on the question of manifestness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Although we consider Brandt\u2019s unimpeded access to Delinski\u2019s records through De-linski\u2019s consent dispositive, we observe that the Board\u2019s opinion properly indicates that the key is the availability of the information or knowledge that those records reflect, namely that Delinski had a serious heart condition when he was hired by Brandt. Acknowledging that the availability of the medical records themselves is a \u201cfactor to be weighed in determining the manifest-latent issue,\u201d the Board went on to reiterate that \u201cthe test requires only that information be available to the employer \u2018should he decide to take notice of it.\u2019 \u201d 9 B.R.B.S. at 210. There were other ways in which Brandt could have discovered that Delinski was suffering from heart disease, though Brandt did not choose to pursue them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-22\">In any event, the point is not that Brandt failed to find out about the preexisting disability, but rather that the medical records provided unambiguous, objective evidence that there was such a disability, and that that information would have been immediately discovered by Brandt had Brandt made an attempt to find it. That is sufficient to demonstrate that the information was \u201cavailable to the employer \u2018should he decide to take notice of it.\u2019 \u201d Brandt is not receiving a windfall by sloughing off part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>of its liability onto the special fund where there was no potential for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">Section 8(f) does not require us to penalize Brandt for the fact that it did not actually request Delinski\u2019s records or conduct a physical examination. Congress\u2019 purpose, to prevent a paradoxical worsening of the plight of handicapped workers by the compensation laws, is best served if an employer is not forced to conduct physical examinations and private investigations to acquaint himself with the existing disabilities of prospective or current employees. Even small employers, who cannot afford the expense of examining every applicant, would be encouraged to discriminate, perhaps by relying on vague suspicions raised by older or less robust workers. The question is not whether the employer has earned section 8(f) relief, but whether the probable impact on employees justifies granting it. We feel it would undermine the congressional purpose if we disqualified Brandt from section 8(f)\u2019s coverage because of its failure to inquire into Delinski\u2019s profusely documented physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Nothing we have said is inconsistent with prior holdings of this court. In <em>American Mutual Insurance Co. v. Jones, </em>426 F.2d 1263 (D.C.Cir. 1970), injuries to claimant\u2019s arm disqualified him for manual labor, and subsequent investigation revealed that his intelligence (which had not been affected by the accident) was too limited to enable him to obtain any other kind of employment. Recognizing that \u201cthe degree of mental retardation cannot be adequately gauged by intelligence quotient alone,\u201d the court denied section 8(f) coverage to the employer on the ground that \u201cnothing in the record gives any indication that [the claimant], up to the time of his injuries, showed a sufficient degree of social mala-daptation due to limited intelligence that his disability could be fairly classed as \u2018manifest.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268 (footnote omitted). Here, in contrast, there is no dispute as to the existence or the unequivocal nature of the medical records evidencing Delinski\u2019s history of heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">In <em>Maurice P. Foley Co. v. Balderson, </em>569 F.2d 132 (D.C.Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 818, 99 S.Ct. 80, 58 L.Ed.2d 109 (1978), the AU had found that section 8(f) did not apply and the Board had affirmed, concluding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that the claimant's chronic pulmonary condition was not \u201cmanifest\u201d when he was hired. The court agreed that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s identification of factors \u201cwhich would tend to conceal the nature of Balder-son\u2019s condition from his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136. Baiderson always put in a full day\u2019s work; his periods of absence from prior jobs were not glaring; and his medical records stated that he was \u201cable to continue his occupation of a steamfitter\u201d after a spell of hospitalization. <em>Id. </em>Here, the ALJ\u2019s decision that Delinski\u2019s impairment was not manifest was based solely on the \u201cstrenuous nature\u201d of the work he was willing to perform and the supposed unavailability of the medical records. Those records were in no way misleading as Balderson\u2019s were; the Board reversed the ALJ because the medical records plainly stated Delinski\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">We uphold the Board\u2019s decision. The evidence in this case clearly indicates that Delinski\u2019s ill health would have been immediately apparent to any employer who chose to take notice of it. Requesting medical records or information may require some slight effort, but the purpose of section 8(f) is not to reward employer diligence. Under the circumstances of this case, Delinski\u2019s disability was manifest enough to create a potential for the discrimination that the statute seeks to avoid. The decision of the Board is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">. Mr. Delinski died of a heart attack on April 19, 1979.
