Instead, they attach to the aggregate sentence irrespective of whether that sentence is pronounced for multiple convictions in the same case or in multiple cases. Here, the trial court pronounced an aggregate sentence for multiple felony convictions in three separately brought cases, including the present case. The trial court \"dismissed\" six prior prison term enhancements in the present case because it had already imposed them in one of the other two cases. Such enhancements can be imposed only once on the aggregate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The purported dismissals of the six prior prison term enhancements in the present case were of no significance because the enhancements attached to the aggregate sentence and had been imposed to increase that sentence. Thus, when the felony convictions in the two other cases were later reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to Proposition 47, there was no impediment to the reimposition of the six prior prison term enhancements upon resentencing in the present case unless the reimposition was barred by Proposition 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Juan Gabriel Acosta appeals from the judgment entered following Proposition 47 resentencing on the sole remaining felony conviction in the present case. The trial court originally sentenced him to a consecutive term of\n   eight months (one-third the middle term of two years) and, as discussed above, dismissed six prior prison term enhancements. After the other felony convictions comprising the aggregate sentence had been reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to Proposition 47, on the remaining felony conviction the court resentenced him to prison for eight years: the middle term of two years plus six years for the six previously dismissed prior prison term enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant contends that, although the trial court properly increased the sentence on the remaining felony conviction from eight months to two years (\n   <em>\n    People v. Sellner\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052772\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/240/699/\">\n    240 Cal.App.4th 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20836\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), it exceeded its jurisdiction by enhancing that sentence with the six previously dismissed prior prison term enhancements. In our original opinion filed on May 31, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    People v. Acosta\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451475,12513187\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/247/1072/\">\n    247 Cal.App.4th 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513187\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/202/614/\">\n    202 Cal.Rptr.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), we decided that all six prior prison term enhancements had been properly imposed even though the convictions underlying three of the prior prison terms were reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to Proposition 47. The California Supreme Court granted appellant's petition for review. On September 26, 2018, the Supreme Court\n   transferred the matter back to us with directions to \"vacate [our] decision and ... reconsider the cause in light of\n   <em>\n    People v.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Buycks\n   </em>\n   , we remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing with directions to strike the three prior prison term enhancements based on felony convictions that were reduced to misdemeanors under Proposition 47. We follow the law as declared by our Supreme Court. (See\n   <em>\n    Myers v. Carini\n   </em>\n   (1968)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202714\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/262/614/#p620\">\n    262 Cal.App.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20800\">\n    68 Cal.Rptr. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In all other respects, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to a negotiated disposition in the present case, in April 2014, appellant pleaded guilty to two felonies: second degree commercial burglary (count 1; Pen. Code, \u00a7 459 )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and resisting an executive officer (count 3; \u00a7 69). He also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor: disobeying a court order (count 4; \u00a7 166, subd. (a)(4) ). He admitted six prior prison term enhancements (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ) and one prior \"strike\" within the meaning of California's \"Three strikes\" law. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) It was agreed that a felony charge of petty theft with a prior (count 2; \u00a7 666, subd. (b) ) would be dismissed at the time of sentencing. In a felony disposition statement, appellant acknowledged that he could be sentenced to state prison for 13 years four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 15, 2014, appellant was sentenced on the convictions in the present case and two other cases: case No. 2014001248 (hereafter case 2) and case No. 2013039248 (hereafter case 3). In case 2, appellant was sentenced to prison for 11 years: three years for possession of a controlled substance ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a) ), plus six years for six prior prison terms enhancements (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ), plus two years for an out-on-bail enhancement. (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b).) In case 3 he was sentenced to a consecutive term of eight months for petty theft with a prior. (\u00a7 666.) In the present case he was sentenced to a consecutive term of 16 months: eight months for each of the two felony convictions. The court dismissed the strike prior. The court dismissed the strike prior. It purported to dismiss the six prior prison term enhancements because in case 2 the same enhancements had been used to add six years to appellant's prison sentence. The parties informed the court that the prior prison term enhancements could \"only [be] imposed once.\" The aggregate sentence in all three cases was 13 years. However, the trial court suspended the execution of the sentence and placed appellant on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2014 the trial court found that appellant had violated the terms of his probation. It terminated probation and ordered into effect the previously suspended 13-year prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result of the passage of Proposition 47 in November 2014, the felony offenses in the three cases were reclassified as misdemeanors with one exception: resisting an executive officer in the present case. (\u00a7 69.) In April 2015 appellant filed a petition for the recall of his felony sentence for second degree commercial burglary ( \u00a7 459 ) in the present case. Appellant requested that he be resentenced to misdemeanor shoplifting (\u00a7 459.5) pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (a) and (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing on his petition, appellant orally modified the petition to include case 2 and case 3. The court resentenced appellant to misdemeanors in both of these cases. It did not impose any jail time for the misdemeanor convictions. In addition, the court granted an application to designate as misdemeanors three prior felony convictions (case nos. 2001028823,\n   2006032094, and 2010008753) underlying three of the six prior prison term enhancements. The designation was pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the present case, the court reduced appellant's felony burglary conviction to misdemeanor shoplifting. On the remaining felony conviction (\u00a7 69), the court resentenced appellant to prison for the middle term of two years plus six years for the six previously dismissed prior prison term enhancements. Thus, the aggregate prison sentence in the present case was eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Subject to Proposition 47, the Trial Court Had the Authority to Reimpose the Previously Dismissed Prior Prison Term Enhancements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When appellant was originally sentenced, the trial court purportedly dismissed the six prior prison term enhancements in the present case only because the same enhancements had been imposed in case 2 and, therefore, could not be imposed again. (\n   <em>\n    People v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   (2011)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233714\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/195/1051/#p1060\">\n    195 Cal.App.4th 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1060,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20321\">\n    125 Cal.Rptr.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Prior prison term enhancements are status enhancements which can be imposed only once, on the aggregate sentence. [Citation.] Here, the sentence in [the present case] was made consecutive to the sentence in case [2], creating a single aggregate term\"].) When appellant was resentenced in the present case the trial court imposed a one-year term for each of the six previously dismissed prior prison term enhancements. Appellant contends that the trial court \"did not have the authority to resurrect [any of the] dismissed prison priors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The purported dismissal of the six prior prison term enhancements in the present case was not a \"true\" dismissal because it did not insulate appellant from the enhancements' additional punishment. The same enhancements were imposed in case 2 as part of the aggregate sentence for all three cases. The sole reason for the purported dismissal in the present case was that they had already been imposed in case 2 and therefore could not be imposed again to increase the aggregate sentence. When the trial court resentenced appellant to a misdemeanor in case 2, the prior prison term enhancements in that case became inapplicable because they can be imposed only where the new offense is a felony. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) But the enhancements\n   did not\n   simply vanish by legal legerdemain. Subject to Proposition 47, they remained available for sentencing purposes because they had been imposed on the aggregate sentence and were not attached to a particular count or case. The trial court did not need to \"resurrect\" them. \"Enhancements for prior convictions ... have nothing to do with particular counts but, since they are related to the offender, are added only once as a step in arriving at the aggregate sentence.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.
