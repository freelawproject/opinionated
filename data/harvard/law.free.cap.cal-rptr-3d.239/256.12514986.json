Smith filed a petition for writ of mandate, seeking review of the lower court's denial of his non-statutory motion to return property, to wit 21.8 grams of recreational marijuana. After considering the evidence, arguments and applicable law, we hereby GRANT the petition for writ of mandate. We hereby order the lower court to vacate its previous order denying the motion for return of property, and enter a new order consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 9, 2018, SFPD Officer MacMahon responded to 923 Market Street to investigate a report of a man making threats with a possible gun. Officer MacMahon ultimately arrested petitioner. Officer MacMahon performed an inventory search of petitioner's backpack, seizing 21.8 grams of marijuana and $574.21 in cash. On January 11, 2018, petitioner was charged by misdemeanor complaint with two counts of criminal threats ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 422 ) and one count of disturbing the peace ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 415, subd. (3) ). These charges were dismissed pursuant to Penal Code section 1385 on March 7, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2018, the lower court heard and denied petitioner's motion to return the marijuana. Petitioner timely filed the instant petition for writ, seeking the return of his 21.8 grams of recreational marijuana. On May 16,\n   2018, we ordered the San Francisco Police Department to show cause why it should not be ordered to return petitioner's property under\n   <em>\n    City of Garden Grove v.

The CSA's \"Distribution\" Provisions Do Not Apply to Officers Acting Pursuant to Their Professional Duties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   California Law requires law enforcement officers to return \"lawfully possessed\" marijuana to its owner.

The San Francisco Police Department would be returning the instant marijuana pursuant to a court order, and not acting as drug \"pushers\" the CSA was designed to combat. Accordingly, there is no \"positive conflict\" between California Law and the CSA such that the two could not consistently stand together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The CSA's Law Enforcement Immunity Provision Further Eliminates Any Potential Positive Conflict.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under the CSA, \"no civil or criminal liability shall be imposed by virtue of this subchapter ... upon any duly authorized officer of any State ... who shall be lawfully engaged in the enforcement of any law or municipal ordinance relating to controlled substances.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20885\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).)

The CSA's law enforcement immunity provision further eliminates any positive conflict between California's return law and the CSA's prohibition on distribution of marijuana. Accordingly, the San Francisco Police Department is immune from federal prosecution under the CSA when complying with California's return provisions. (See\n   <em>\n    People v.
