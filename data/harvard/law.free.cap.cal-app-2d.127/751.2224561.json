Tabah, Deputy Attorney General, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b770-6\">DORAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6tS\">This is an appeal from the judgment following a verdict of guilty by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The record reveals that the officers entered appellant\u2019s home and found narcotics on the person of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">It is contended on appeal that, \u201cThe verdict is contrary to law\u201d and, that the \u201ctrial court committed error by advising the jury that the district attorney and counsel for appellant could stipulate to the admission of hearsay testimony, the content of which was highly prejudicial to appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The contention relates to the action of the trial judge which as recited in appellant\u2019s brief, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cA Juror: Your Honor, may I ask a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-12\">\u201cA Juror: \u201cOfficer, what information did you have that led you to this particular house to look for narcotics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-13\">\u201cThe Court: That is\u2014just a moment. I think it is incumbent, Mrs. Collins, upon the Court to protect the record in this respect and I think that that might be calling for hearsay testimony. It is a perfectly logical question to be in a juror\u2019s mind, but I don\u2019t think\u2014unless Counsel have no objection to it-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-14\">\u201cMr. Crail: I have no objection to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\">\u201cThe Court : What is your feeling, Mr. Solomon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Your Honor has left it up to me. Your Honor has indicated-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-17\">\u201cThe Court: No, I indicated that it calls for hearsay. It is a question that might logically be in the juror\u2019s mind but the answer is hearsay. If Counsel has no objection, the Court will permit it to be answered. If Counsel does object, the Court necessarily will have to rule against it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-18\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Well, Your Honor, I feel that the statement by Mr. Crail is\u2014I didn\u2019t think to ask that this morning. Counsel shouldn\u2019t have made any statement. Mr. Crail has made a statement, so under those circumstances, I will say if he has agreed to it, I have to agree to it. I will agree to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-19\">\u201cThe Court: All right. You may answer the question, Mr. Horstkotte.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201cThe Witness: I received information from a user on the street that this was the location where this party went to score for narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe Coubt: That answers the question. That is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">\u201cMb. Ceail : Pardon me just a moment. What is the term \u2018score\u2019? What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">' \u2018 The Witness : That is when they go to a place to buy narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\u201cMe. Ceail: In other words, if they make a purchase they call that \u2018scoring\u2019? \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">In the light of the record it cannot be assumed the incident resulted in prejudicial error. \u201cDuring the course of his cross-examination, in explaining why appellant had an idea what the officer was searching him for, appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">\u201c \u2018Well, I had been arrested for narcotics before that is the reason why I thought so.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, the inference that appellant was a known narcotic user came as no sudden shock to the jury. They were already aware of that fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">No objection was made by defendant to the introduction of the evidence which defendant now contends was inadmissible nor was there a motion to strike. And, as argued by respondent, \u201cIt is just possible the officer might have answered the juror\u2019s question as follows: \u2018I was ordered by my superiors to investigate this particular house.\u2019 It could be argued, therefore, that one could not tell for sure from this question that the answer would contain prejudicial hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">\u201cIt is the general rule that when an unexpected answer of a witness, which could not be anticipated by objection to the question, contains inadmissible and prejudicial matter, a motion to strike it out is the proper remedy. <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>127 Cal. 212 [59 P. 581] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1907), 151 Cal. 619, 624 [91 P. 511],</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">\u201cHaving failed to so move, the introduction of such evidence is not grounds for appeal. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ahsbahs </em>(1946), 77 Cal. App.2d 244 [175 P.2d 33] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1903), 141 Cal. 88 [74 P.547].</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">\u201cThe failure to move to strike in the lower court is deemed a waiver of the point on appeal. <em>People </em>v. <em>Strider </em>(1929), 96 Cal.App. 632 [274 P. 601],</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">\u201cHere, assuming, arguendo, that appellant could have reasonably expected an unobjectionable answer of the form suggested, <em>supra, </em>and that the hearsay answer of the officer caught appellant by surprise, appellant should have moved to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>strike. \u2019 \u2019 Incidentally, section 4% of article VI of the Constitution is applicable as in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 18, 1954, and appellant's petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 3, 1954.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
