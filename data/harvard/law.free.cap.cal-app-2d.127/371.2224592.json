Thereafter plaintiffs made a motion for a new trial, stating in their motion: \u201cSaid motion will not be made upon affidavits, but will be made upon the pleadings, files and all proceedings had in the above entitled action resulting in the above verdict and judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">The trial court granted the motion on the issue of damages only, for the reason that in its opinion the evidence did not sustain the amount awarded in the verdict. The defendants claim that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the motion for a new trial for the reason that the motion was defective in that it did not allege that the motion would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>be made upon \u201cthe minutes of the Court\u201d but merely upon \u201cthe pleadings, files and all proceedings had\u201d in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendants\u2019 contention is without merit. In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Farnham, </em>39 Cal.App. 17, 19 [179 P. 423], a notice stating that the motion would be made on a <em>\u201ctranscript of the proceedings\u201d </em>was held to mean the same thing as on the <em>\u201cminutes of the court.\u201d </em>In <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>52 Cal.App. 184, 185 [198 P. 427], (hearing denied by the Supreme Court) the court determined that a notice of intention to move for a new trial stating that the motion would be made upon certain stated grounds and <em>\u201cupon the records, papers and files in said action\u201d </em>constituted a substantial compliance with the requirements of section 659 of the Code of Civil Procedure and would be construed as giving notice that the motion would be made <em>\u201cupon the minutes of the court,\u201d </em>inasmuch as the minutes of the court are a part of the records in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Clearly the foregoing authorities are here controlling since the <em>\u201cminutes of the court\u201d </em>are a part of <em>\u201call the proceedings had in the action.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Moore, P. J., and Pox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 10, 1954.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
