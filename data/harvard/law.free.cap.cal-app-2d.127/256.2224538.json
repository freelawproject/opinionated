He had formerly been a Pullman porter but had not worked at that or any occupation for more than twenty years. Por more than twenty-five years prior to his death he had continuously lived at 1011 S. Mariposa Avenue in the City of Los Angeles in a small house owned by him consisting of six rooms and two baths. He also owned 168 acres of uncultivated land in the Antelope Valley. He rented five of the rooms in his house to various tenants for a total of $40.00 per month and lived in the other himself; all of the tenants used the common kitchen. The room occupied by decedent was directly between two of the other rooms and the tenants continually passed back and forth through his bedroom to the kitchen. The proponent of the will had lived in decedent\u2019s house on three occasions between 1927 and 1941. During the years from 1947 to 1950 he received old age assistance of $40.00 per month, which was increased to $75.00 per month in 1950. During the years 1946-1952 he was suffering from palsy and kidney ailments, arteriosclerosis and general effects of old age, and gradually declined in strength of body and mind to the date of his death.\u201d There was evidence that deceased as pointed out by appellant, \u201cwas in a confused state of mind on many occasions\u201d and was afflicted with other manifestations of old age; \u201che was placed in a sanitarium about May, 1950.\u201d With relation to the contentions of appellant, it should be noted that the will was executed February 28, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The case was tried before \u00e1 jury and a review of the record shows, as is usual in such situations, that the evidence was conflicting. The record reveals, as argued by respondent, that, \u201cThe attorney who drew the will, as much as the other attesting witness, testified as to the conversations and circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, leaving it for the jury to determine whether or not the decedent was of sound mind at the time of the execution of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">It appears somewhat, unusual that the witnesses for the proponent of the will were not cross-examined on the subject that appellant argues on appeal amounts to a suppression of evidence. As a matter of law no presumption, in the circumstances, results from such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">With regard to the subject of undue influence appellant argues that, \u201cwhere there are prior testamentary documents or declarations by which the decedent made a radically dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ferent disposition of his property, unless the proponents offer some reasonable explanation for the change, a presumption arises of undue influence and that this circumstance standing alone is sufficient to support a finding of undue influence.\u201d The argument presupposes that the \u201ccircumstance\u201d stands alone. The record reveals the evidence on this subject, as on all issues, was conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A review of the instruction discloses no prejudicial errors and the evidence, as a matter of law, was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Drapeau, J., and Mosk, J., pro tern.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
