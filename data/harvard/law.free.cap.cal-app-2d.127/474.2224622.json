The action is one for the alleged wrongful death of the husband and father of the respective plaintiffs who was struck and killed by a train at a railroad crossing. The charging portion of the complaint insofar as it relates to the defendant city recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cThat 25th Street at the site of the accident is now and at all times herein mentioned has been public property of the City of San Mateo; that under the circumstances existing at the time of the accident the warning signal provided at the aforementioned site was inadequate to give warning to persons lawfully using the said 25th Street of the approach of a train; that by reason of such inadequacy the aforementioned public street was dangerous or defective, so far as its use by motorists traveling thereupon is concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">We must agree with respondent that the allegation that \u201cthe warning provided at the aforementioned site was inadequate to give warning to persons lawfully using\u201d the street is the mere conclusion of law of the pleader. The general demurrer to the complaint was therefore properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Appellant argues that the complaint could be amended to cure this defect and hence the portion of the court\u2019s order refusing leave to amend was an abuse of discretion. <em>(Plaza </em>v. <em>City of San </em>Mateo, 123 Cal.App.2d 103, 112 [266 P.2d 523].) On the oral argument the attorney for appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>stated that the crossing is protected with automatic wigwag signals on each side of the track and that the gist of his complaint is that the crossing should be protected by automatic gates. He made no claim that the wigwag signals were not operating properly at the time of defendant\u2019s death nor that they were not visible and audible to an approaching motorist. In this respect he stated substantially that they were somewhat above the eye-level of a motorist and that if gates were supplied they would be at the level of the motorist\u2019s eyes. Accepting this statement of counsel and if such facts were alleged we cannot hold that the complaint would state facts showing a \u201cdangerous or defective condition of public property,\u201d which is the statutory requisite for imposing liability on the respondent city. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
