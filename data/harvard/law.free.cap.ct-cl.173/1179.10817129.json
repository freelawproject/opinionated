(Sec. 608 of the National Housing Act, 56 Stat. 301, 303, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1743 (1958)). They sue to recover prepayment charges required of them by FHA when they refinanced their properties under conventional mortgages, plaintiffs claiming that the charges were exacted in violation of law. The cases came before the court on plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment, or defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings. Upon consideration thereof and without oral argument, the court determined that defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss the petition should be granted on the authority of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Camella Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 Ct. Cl. 224, 334 F. 2d 667 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 963 (1965), in which the court held that the FHA regulation covering prepayment charges was valid and properly enforced in a case similar to those here involved. On October 29, 1965, the petitions in the above cases were dismissed. Petition fon writ of certiorari filed by Forrest Village Apartments, Inc. <em>denied </em>March 21, 1966, 383 U.S. 943.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
