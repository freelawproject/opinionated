State, Opinion No. 21,138, this day delivered. (Page 139 of this volume). There we reversed the judgment after holding the following charge to be erroneous: \u201cThe instrument must purport to be the act of another and you are instructed that within the meaning of the word \u2018another\u2019 as herein used, are included any other person except N. S. Wittman.\u201d The act involved in the forgery of the check appellant is alleged to have passed purportedly was the act of N. S. Wittman. The same charge appears in the record herein. It was timely and properly excepted to. We deem it unnecessary to do more than refer to the opinion in Cormier\u2019s Case in making dispostion of the appeal herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
