This charge was based on the prima facie evidence statute relative to the possession of intoxicating liquor. In the court\u2019s charge he embodied the statute making the possession of one quart of liquor in a dry area prima facie evidence of possession for the purpose of sale. See Art. 666-23a, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C., which seems to deal with \u201cliquor,\u201d such being defined by statute as \u201cAny alcoholic beverage containing alcohol in excess of four per centum by weight, unless otherwise indicated.\u201d See Art. 666-3a, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C. In the present case the pleadings allege the possession of \u201cchock\u201d for the purpose of sale, a beverage containing more than one-half of one per cent of alcohol by volume. It is our opinion that the prima facie evidence statute governing such liquor thus designated as \u201cchock\u201d is found in Art. 667-25b of Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C. and reads as follows: \u201cPossession by any person in any dry area of beer in any quantity exceeding twenty-four (24) bottles having a capacity of twelve (12) ounces each shall be prima facie evidence of possession for the purpose of sale in a dry area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Of course, if the liquid was not contained in bottles, then the possession of more than the equivalent of twenty-four bottles of twelve ounces each could be used as prima facie evidence of possession for the purpose of sale in a dry area. This matter was called to the trial court\u2019s attention in a special requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We further observe that the State should introduce in evidence, and there should be incorporated in the record, the different orders of the commissioners\u2019 court relative to the local option election where in the county became a dry area.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">For the errors discussed this judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
