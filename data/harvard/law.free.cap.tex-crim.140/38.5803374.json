State, 104 S. W. (2d) 866, in which a complaint in language as follows was held to be fundamentally defective: \u201cDid then and there unlawfully maintain a common nuisance at Gladewater, Gregg County, Texas, the same being a building and structure and place where intoxicating liquor is sold, kept and bartered in violation of the law of this State against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In holding the complaint defective in Carr\u2019s Case, this court, speaking through Judge Lattimore, said: \u201cWe are constrained to believe said complaint and the information based thereon fundamentally defective, and that the same do not charge an offense so as to apprise the accused of what he shall be expected to meet. To merely charge that accused maintained a common nuisance is not sufficient when there seem some sixteen or eighteen ways laid down in article 1, chap. 467, Acts Second Called Session of 44th Legislature (Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C. art. 666-1 et seq.) in which intoxicating liquor may be kept, sold, and bartered in violation of law, and the information and complaint in this case do not specify or name any one of these ways. In other words, this appellant could not tell from an inspection of the State\u2019s pleadings whether he might expect to be tried for keeping intoxicating liquor in broken and unsealed containers for sale for human consumption, or whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the offense was selling such liquor without having obtained a permit, or for not having a distiller\u2019s permit and selling to some one other than the holder of a wholesaler\u2019s permit, or for selling intoxicating liquor between 12 o\u2019clock p. m. and 7 o\u2019clock a. m., or for selling on election day, or on Sunday, or to a person under twenty-one years old, or to an habitual drunkard, or to one visibly intoxicated, etc.\u201d The statute under which the complaint and information were drawn in Carr\u2019s Case was substantially the same as that involved in the present prosecution. We quote the pertinent part of the present statute (Article 666-29, Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C.) as follows: \u201cAny room, building, boat, structure, or place of any kind where liquor is sold, manufactured, bartered, or given away in violation of this Act, * * * or any place where such beverages are kept for sale, barter, or gift in violation of law, and all liquor and property kept and used in said place, hereby are declared to be a common nuisance * *</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\">When statewide prohibition prevailed in Texas Article 688, P. C., 1925, provided- as follows: \u201cAny room, house, building, boat, structure or place of any kind similar or dissimilar to those named, where intoxicating liquor is kept, possessed, sold, manufactured, bartered or given away, or to be transported to or transported from in violation of law, and all intoxicating liquors and all property kept in and used in maintaining such place are hereby declared to be a common nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In Davis v. State, 292 S. W. 1109, this court had before it the question whether an indictment charging the offense denounced in the last quoted statute was sufficient against exceptions, as follows: \u201c (a) It was not alleged that accused kept the intoxicating liquor in the building; (b) it was not alleged that accused himself sold said intoxicating liquor; and (c) it failed to allege that accused \u2018knowingly\u2019 kept intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In upholding the sufficiency of the indictment, this court, speaking through Judge Hawkins, used language as follows: \u201cIt is believed the absence of none of the averments mentioned affects the validity of the indictment. The offense denounced in article 688, supra, is not the sale of liquor, nor the keeping of it for the purpose of sale, but maintaining a nuisance by keeping or maintaining a building in which intoxicating liquors are kept, possessed, or sold in -violation of law. For one to be guilty of the offense so denounced it is not thought to be requisite that accused himself sell or keep for sale the intoxicating liquor in the building, hence no necessity for so averring; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>it therefore follows that it would likewise be unnecessary to allege that accused \u2018knowingly\u2019 kept the liquor for purpose of sale. Neither would it be required to allege that accused \u2018knowingly\u2019 kept or maintained the building, etc. The word \u2018knowingly\u2019 is not used in the statute under consideration. Article 688. It is used in article 687, in defining a kindred offense, and by reason of its use there this court held in Morris v. State, 93 Tex. Cr. R. 99, 245 S. W. 915, that its omission by the pleader in attempting to charge an offense under said article 687 would be fatal to the validity of the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It is observed that in upholding the sufficiency of the indictment in the Davis Case the court considered and discussed its sufficiency only in the light of the exceptions embraced in the motion to quash. Stated in another way, the court held it was not necessary to allege that the accused kept the intoxicating liquor in the building; and that it was not necessary to allege the accused himself sold intoxicating liquor, etc.; and again that it was not necessary to allege that the accused knowingly kept such liquor for the purpose of sale. Whether an indictment merely following the language of the statute was sufficient was not decided. Hence we are of opinion that the Davis Case \u2014 cited by the state \u2014 is not authority for holding the complaint and information in the present case sufficient. On the contrary, the opinion is expressed that when we look to the questions decided in the Carr and Davis Cases there is an absence of conflict and that the holding in Carr\u2019s Case is controlling in determining the sufficiency of the state\u2019s pleadings in the instant case. It follows that in giving application to the holding in Carr\u2019s Case we must hold the complaint and information defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We are of opinion that the complaint and information are not subject to appellant\u2019s complaint that they are duplicitous. We quote from 33 C. J., page 734, as follows: \u201cSince maintaining a nuisance is a continuing offense, it may be alleged to have been kept and maintained on a day named \u2018and on divers other days and times\u2019 prior to the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The proof fails to support the allegations in the state\u2019s pleadings relative to the description of the premises where it was alleged the nuisance was maintained. Proof supporting such averment was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
