E. Thornton by, \u201cwillfully and with negligence,\u201d operating a motor vehicle upon Highway No. 1-B. The jury assessed a penalty of 365 days in the county jail of Dallas County. The evidence properly admitted before the jury amply sustains the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">A motion to quash the complaint and information was overruled by the court and this action seems to be the chief ground upon which this court is asked to reverse the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The motion sets out that the complaint and information are ambiguous and uncertain in that they allege the defendant did, \u201cunlawfully and with negligence,\u201d collide with the person involved. The form of this complaint has been approved in Young v. State, 47 S. W. (2d) 320; Carlton v. State, 48 S. W. (2d) 273; Huff v. State, 58 S. W. (2d) 113, and Clifton v. State, 135 S. W. (2d) 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">It is further argued in appellant\u2019s brief that there is a variance between the allegation and the proof in that the proof shows that appellant\u2019s car struck another car in which the injured party was riding, instead of striking the person. This contention will not be sustained, as it is permissible to show under the form of the allegation in this case that the defendant struck another car causing the injury to the party alleged. Schultz v. State, 128 S. W. (2d) 36; Guajardo v. State, 139 S. W. (2d) 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Further argument is made on bills of exception, complaining of the admissibility of testimony, which we consider thoroughly settled questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
