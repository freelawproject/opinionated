In fact, a memoranda on the margin of the transcript \u2014 presumably made by the Clerk of the County Court\u2014 shows affirmatively that no judgment is of record. A memoranda on the trial docket recites that a verdict was returned by the jury finding appellant $100.00 and \u201cjudgment entered in accordance with said verdict.\u201d Such entry on the trial docket does not meet the requirement of Art. 766, C. C. P., which contemplates the entry of the judgment in the minutes of a court of record. Walling v. State, 90 Tex. Cr. R. 463, 235 S. W. 888. Without a -final judgment the jurisdiction of this court does not attach. Hellman v. State, 87 Tex. Cr. R. 460; 222 S.
