It is conditioned, however, that he must make a personal appearance in open court; that it must be with the approval of the court and of the attorney representing the State, entered of record. If he has no attorney the court must appoint one to represent him. Art. 12 of the code further provides that it shall be necessary for the \u201cState to introduce evidence into the record showing the guilt of the defendant * * * * *, and in no event shall the person charged be'convicted upon his plea of guilty without sufficient evidence to support the same.\u201d This provision is susceptible of no other construction than that herein given.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Upon a plea of guilty before the court in such cases the State must produce evidence sufficient to support the finding of guilt and the punishment assessed. The confession may be used to aid the proof of the corpus delicti, but not to establish it. An extrajudicial confession, alone, without proof of the corpus delicti is insufficient to sustain a conviction. The corpus delicti consists of two things \u2014 first, a criminal act, and, second, the defendant\u2019s agency in the commission of such act. (Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, Sec. 1890, page 1049, and authorities there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">It will be observed that in this case there is.no proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the burglary was committed other than that which is embraced in the confession itself. While a jury would be given the power to find him guilty under such confession and plea, the act of the legislature permitting a defendant to waive a jury specifically did not delegate to the court such power, but provided, to the contrary, that evidence must be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">Appellant\u2019s contention must be sustained. The judgment \"of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
