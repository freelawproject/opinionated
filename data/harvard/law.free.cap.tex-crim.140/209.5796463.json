This proposition might have given us concern, were.it not for the fact that after having received a proper warning, the appellant \u201cpersisted in pleading guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">The trial court was not vitally concerned with the quantum of proof herein; the main proposition presented to it was, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to determine appellant\u2019s guilt, \u2014 he had confessed that in open court, \u2014 but such testimony was only for the purpose of enabling the jury to determine the amount of punishment, and the matter relative to a suspension of sentence, which was asked for herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">We quote from the case of Anderson v. State, 42 S. W. (2d) 1012: \u201cUnder the statute (articles 501, 502, C. C. P.) governing the entry of a plea of guilty, the entry of the plea, after due admonition, is conclusive of guilt, unless the evidence introduced upon the trial makes manifest the innocence of the accused. Harris v. State, 76 Tex. Cr. R. 126, 172 S. W. 975. Upon a plea of guilty, the hearing is, not to determine the guilt of the accused, but to enable the jury to assess the-punishment. Garcia v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 9, 237 S. W. 279; Bennett v. State, 98 Tex. Cr. R. 661, 267 S. W. 987.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Also see Bunch v. State, 123 Tex. Cr. R. 546, 59 S. W. (2d) 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
