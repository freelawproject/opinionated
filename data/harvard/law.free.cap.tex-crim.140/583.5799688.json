The jury declined to accept the defensive theory presented by appellant, and assessed the very heavy penalty. The circumstances surrounding the taking of the cattle and the transporting of them to Houston for Sale, with which appellant was intimately connected, justifies the jury in reaching the conclusion which they did. It is not for this court to say that they exceeded their authority. The court overlooked giving effect to the indeterminate sentence law as provided by Art. 775 C. C. P. The sentence is amended to direct that the punishment be confinement in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than ten years. Otherwise the record appears to be in every way regular, and the judgment of the trial court as amended is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\">ON STATE\u2019S MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b608-11\">BEAUCHAMP, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">On November 6, 1940, during the present term, the judgment in this case was reformed and affirmed. Subsequently the State has filed a motion to set aside that order on the ground that there-was-no-notice of appeal- in the record and that this court is without jurisdiction to enter such order. .</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Upon further examination of the record the motion is granted, the judgment of affirmance set aside and the mandate of this Court reflecting such judgment is recalled and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
