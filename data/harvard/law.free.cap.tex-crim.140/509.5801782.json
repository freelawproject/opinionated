Testifying in his own behalf, appellant declared that he did not know he had the cigarettes in his pocket until they were discovered by the officers. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>introduced a witness who testified that he saw another party place the cigarettes in appellant\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">It appears from bill of exception No. 1 that Dallas Thrash, one of the searching officers, testified, over appellant\u2019s objection to the effect that the search was made without a warrant and without a warrant of arrest, that he found several cigarettes in appellant\u2019s pocket. It is observed that A. L. Plucker, one of the officers who participated in the arrest and search of appellant, testified without objection on the part of appellant, in part, as follows: \u201cWe searched him (appellant) and found a package in his. shirt pocket. It was wrapped in a little piece of Sunday funny paper. We taken it out and looked at it. It was cigarettes wrapped in brown paper. This was taken off the defendant. I did not see any Camel cigarettes on the person of the defendant. There was not anything else in his shirt. Marihuana is all there was.\u201d Obviously the testimony of Mr. Plucker was substantially the same as that of Officer Thrash. Moreover, appellant admitted that the officers found the cigarettes in his possession. Under the circumstances, reversible error is not presented. We quote from 4 Texas Jurisprudence, 587, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u201cIt is a general rule also that the admission of improper evidence does not constitute reversible error if the same facts were proved by other and proper testimony or by evidence which was not objected to, as where the accused voluntarily gave testimony substantially the same as that erroneously received over objection. For example, a judgment will not be reversed because of the admission of testimony of officers respecting facts ascertained upon an illegal search where the same facts were testified to by other witnesses or by the appellant himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In support of the text many authorities are cited, among them being Machado v. State, 17 S. W. (2d) 1060; Spain v. State, 15 S. W. (2d) 646; Stockton v. State, 15 S. W. (2d) 640; and Shuffield v. State, 18 S. W. (2d) 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"ADo\">GRAVES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Appellant insists that the indictment in this cause is defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>in that it therein charges him with the possession of marijuana, when the statute, Art. 725b, P. C., denounces the possession of marihuana; and we gather therefrom that the point herein involved is the fact that the statute spells the narcotic with an \u201ch\u201d while the indictment spells the narcotic with the letter \u201cj.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">It is true that the statute employs the letter \u201ch\u201d in the spelling of the drug, and it is further true that the indictment herein employs the letter \u201cj\u201d in place of the letter \u201ch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Webster\u2019s International Dictionary gives the following spelling- of this drug: \u201cMarijuana, also marihuana.\u201d We gather therefrom that this drug is spelled either way, and we are also of the opinion that these two methods of spelling this drug sound the same, and are idem sonans.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We think the further matters urged by appellant were properly disposed of in our original opinion, and the motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
