The parties are Petitioners/Cross-Respondents Elvaton Towne Condominiums in Glen Burnie, its condominium association, and its management firm (collectively, \u201cElvaton\u201d) and Respondents/Cross-Petitioners William and Dawn Rose (\u201cthe Roses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Elvaton\u2019s parking areas and the pool are general common elements, which, according to \u00b6 7(C) of Elvaton\u2019s governing declaration, \u201cshall be exclusively owned in common by all of the Unit Owners.\u201d Under the Maryland Condominium Act, Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. \u00a7\u00a7 ll-101(c), 11-107, a \u201cgeneral common element\u201d is one over which every unit owner enjoys ownership rights. Unit owners are assessed an annual condominium fee, to be paid on a monthly basis, to cover, among other things, the maintenance of the common elements of the property, which include the parking lot and pool. As a means of enforcing collection of such debts, Elvaton\u2019s governing Board of Directors passed a \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d rule that prohibits unit owners who are delinquent in their payment of condominium fees from parking overnight within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>complex and from using the pool, until such time as the delinquency is cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The dispute at issue here has its genesis in Elvaton\u2019s claim that the Roses were delinquent in paying their condominium fees. In addition to recording a statement of lien against the Roses\u2019 condominium unit and filing suit in the District Court sitting in Anne Arundel County to recover the alleged debt, Elvaton notified the Roses that, pursuant to the \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d rule, they were prohibited from parking in the parking lot overnight or using the pool until such time as they paid their allegedly delinquent condominium fees. During the pendency of the District Court action, the Roses filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a complaint seeking, among other relief, a declaratory judgment that (1) Elvaton did not possess the authority to prohibit them, on the basis of an alleged delinquency, from using the common elements of the Elvaton complex; and (2) the Roses did not owe a debt to Elvaton. The Roses also obtained a stay of the District Court proceedings during the pendency of the case in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Before trial, the circuit court ruled in favor of Elvaton that the Roses were not entitled to have the court issue a declaratory judgment on the validity of the alleged debt given that the issue was pending review in the District Court. Later, following a trial on the merits of the remaining counts of the Roses\u2019 complaint, the circuit court found in favor of the Roses on the validity of the rule. The court explained that Elvaton did not have the authority to restrict the Roses\u2019 use of the parking lots and the pool as a means of collecting on the debt, because Elvaton was not authorized by the condominium\u2019s governing documents to do so for the alleged failure to pay association assessments. Both Elvaton and the Roses appealed their respective adverse judgments, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed both judgments of the circuit court. <em>Elvaton Towne Condo. Regime II, Inc. v. Rose, </em>No. 1033, Sept. Term, 2014, slip op. at 25, 32-33 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. filed Apr. 21, 2016). Both parties sought, and we granted, further review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Maryland Condominium Act, Md. Code Ann., Real Property \u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>(1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> allows access to communally-held property, that is, the \u201cgeneral common elements\u201d of the condominium, to be restricted as a means to enforce payment of condominium fees. Such restrictions, however, must first be authorized by the unit owners through agreement in the condominium\u2019s declaration. In the present case, Elvaton did not include such a restriction in its declaration. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals that came to the same conclusion. We likewise affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment that the Roses were not entitled to have the validity of the debt resolved in the circuit court, given its pendency in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\n<em>Condominium Law, in a Nutshell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\u201cA condominium is a \u2018communal form of estate in property consisting of individually owned units which are supported by collectively held facilities and areas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ridgely Condo.

We have recognized that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">inherent in the condominium concept is the principle that to promote the health, happiness, and peace of mind of the majority of the unit owners since they are living in such close proximity and using facilities in common, each unit owner must give up a certain degree of freedom of choice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>which he might otherwise enjoy in separate, privately owned property.

New Phoenix Atlantic Condo. Council of Unit Owners, </em>380 Md. 106, 115, 843 A.2d 865 (2004). Under the Act, a condominium is established by recording a declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat among the land records of the county in which the property is located. \u00a7 11-102(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The declaration, among other provisions, names the condominium, defines the common elements of the condominium, and assigns the percentage interests in the common elements appurtenant to each unit and the number of votes appurtenant to each unit at any council of unit owners. \u00a7 11-103. Declarations may be amended only by the written consent of eighty percent of the unit owners listed on the current roster. \u00a7 11\u2014 103(c)(1). The percentage interest in common elements appurtenant to each unit, however, \u201cshall have a permanent character and ... may not be changed without the written consent of <em>all </em>of the unit owners and their mortgagees.\u201d \u00a7 ll-107(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The Act further provides for the enactment of bylaws, which address the foundational aspects of the community\u2019s general management and operations. \u00a7 ll-104(a) (\u201cThe administration of every condominium shall be governed by bylaws which shall be recorded with the declaration.\u201d). The bylaws describe the council of unit owners\u2014the governing body of a condominium\u2014and its authority and the extent to which it may delegate its tasks to a board of directors or managers. \u00a7 ll-104(b)(l). The bylaws also establish the method of voting by unit owners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>including matters such as quorum and the method of calling for a gathering of unit owners. \u00a7 ll-104(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Of particular relevance here, the bylaws describe the \u201cmanner of assessing against and collecting from unit owners their respective shares of the common expenses\u201d and \u201calso may contain any other provision regarding the management and operation of the condominium including any restriction on or requirement respecting the use and maintenance of the units and the common elements.\u201d \u00a7 11\u2014104(b)(4), (c).

Such rules are passed or amended, after notice and the opportunity for public comment, by simple majority vote of the council of unit owners or its delegated management entity. \u00a7 ll-lll(a)(l).

The Rule promulgated by Elvaton provided that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a2u-dedup-0\">the right to park within the Council\u2019s Property shall automatically be suspended for any unit owner ... that is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>than forty-five (45) days past due in the payment of condominium assessments and other charges for a condominium unit in the community. The suspension of the parking permit shall remain in effect until the unit\u2019s account is brought current.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Elvaton further notified the Roses that, pursuant to a rale that apparently had existed for many years, they were likewise precluded from using the condominium \u201ccommunity\u201d pool during the summers of 2012 and 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Roses responded to Elvaton\u2019s action in the District Court by filing a six-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against Elvaton, its management company (Wentworth Property Management, LLC), and Elvaton\u2019s debt collection attorney, John Oliveri, and his firm, Oliveri <em>&amp; </em>Associates, LLC. In this appeal, we are concerned only with Count One.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Count One was an action for declaratory judgment, in which the Roses requested the court to make four declarations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">(1) that this Court determine and adjudicate the property rights of the Roses and all Unit Owners as to the unhindered use of general common areas including parking areas and the community recreational areas; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">(2) that this Court determine and adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the assessments and other fees allegedly due from the Roses to Elvaton; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>(3) that this Court determine and adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the Statement of Lien; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">(4) that this Court declare the Statement of Lien recorded in the land records of Anne Arundel County at book 23888 page 0474 to be void <em>ab initio </em>or, in the alternative, released[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In addition to their complaint in circuit court, the Roses filed a request for stay of the delinquency action in District Court during the pendency of the circuit court proceedings. That request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Elvaton filed a motion for summary judgment in the circuit court action. After a hearing on the motion, the court granted summary judgment in Elvaton\u2019s favor on Declarations 2, 3, and 4 of Count One, ruling that these issues would be addressed in the District Court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Trial followed on the remaining counts of the Roses\u2019 complaint. It is unnecessary for present purposes to summarize all the evidence presented. It is enough to note that Elvaton provided evidence that, at some point before June 1, 2012, the Roses had fallen behind on their monthly assessments. Mrs. Rose testified that a member of Elvaton\u2019s Board of Directors gave her a letter informing her that, because Elvaton considered the Roses to be delinquent on their assessments, effective June 1, 2012, the Roses would be prohibited from parking in either of their two assigned parking spaces. Mrs. Rose further testified about email reminders to the community, on or about June 4, concerning a \u201cnew towing policy\u201d that would be taking effect that week advising that any resident who is delinquent on the assessment would be prohibited from parking and, if parked, would be towed at the unit owner\u2019s expense. The Roses, therefore, parked on a county road outside the community. Mrs. Rose testified that the Roses were also barred from using the community pool for the summers of 2012 and 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Following trial, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order detailing the court\u2019s findings and conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sions. The court found in favor of the Roses on Declaration 1 of Count I. The circuit court applied the Act and <em>Ridgely, supra, </em>in reasoning that Elvaton\u2019s action was an unauthorized taking of the Roses\u2019 property. The court determined that, because the Roses own a percentage share of the common elements of the condominium complex, Elvaton could not deprive the Roses of their property right to those common elements, even temporarily, without proper authority. The court recognized that the Act would allow for such debt collection practices had they been authorized by the Declaration; the Declaration, however, did not authorize that practice. Instead, Elvaton established that practice through a rule, which, pursuant to the governance structure of the condominium, is passed by majority vote of the governing Board of Directors. The court ruled that, given the absence in the Declaration of a provision authorizing Elvaton to employ such a debt collection practice, Elvaton could not deprive the Roses of their property interest in the common elements of the condominium complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Elvaton appealed the court\u2019s decision on the debt collection practices issue, and the Roses cross-appealed on their right to seek in the circuit court a declaratory judgment on the alleged debt. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court on both claims, prompting both Elvaton and the Roses to seek further review in this Court. We granted certiorari to review the parties\u2019 respective claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Elvaton Towne Condo. v.

State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (citation omitted). It is the general rule, moreover, that \u201cthe construction or interpretation of all written instruments is a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>Olde Severna Park Improvement Ass\u2019n v. Gunby, </em>402 Md. 317, 329, 936 A.2d 365 (2007) (quoting <em>Gordy v. Ocean Park, Inc., </em>218 Md. 52, 60, 145 A.2d 273 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Elvaton\u2019s primary argument is that the debt collection practices it instituted through its \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d Rule are not a taking of property because they are not permanent. Elvaton further argues, in the alternative, that the Rule is a reasonable use restriction authorized by the Declaration and By-Laws. Neither argument carries the day for Elvaton.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\n<em>Does application of the Rule constitute an impermissible taking?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The decisions of the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals on this argument were grounded in the facts of <em>Ridgely. </em>We therefore begin our discussion with a summary of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\"><em>Ridgely </em>involved a dispute concerning certain unit owners\u2019 use of the lobby area of the building, a condominium composed of 232 residential units and seven ground floor units authorized for use as businesses. Each of the seven units were accessible from both the lobby and an exterior entrance. Some of those businesses allowed their customers to enter through the building\u2019s well-appointed lobby, a general common element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>of the condominium. 343 Md. at 363, 681 A.2d 494. Citing security concerns, the condominium association amended its bylaws to impose a permanent requirement that customers' were to use only exterior entrances to access the businesses, not the lobby. <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 681 A.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Several of the commercial unit owners challenged the validity of this bylaw amendment as an unauthorized taking of their property. In our review of the relevant law of a number of our sister states, we noted that the cases \u201cfall generally into two categories, ... \u2018exclusive use cases\u2019 ... [and] \u2018equality\u2019 cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 681 A.2d 494; <em>see also id. </em>at 367-69, 681 A.2d 494 (collecting cases). We quoted, with apparent approval, a decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, <em>Jarvis v. Stage Neck Owners Ass\u2019n, </em>464 A.2d 952 (Me. 1983), that drew a clear distinction between the two classes of eases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">There is a distinct difference between these cases, in which exclusive use, control and/or ownership of the common areas is taken from some or all of the unit owners and cases in which some reasonable restrictions or regulation of the common areas is imposed on all owners. In the first instance, each owner\u2019s percentage interest in the common area is altered. In the second instance, the percentage ownership interest is unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 369, 681 A.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The <em>Ridgely </em>court held that the amendment of the bylaws constituted an unacceptable revocation of the business owners\u2019 percentage interest in the lobby because, for instance, the business owners could no longer convey to a subsequent purchaser the property right for visitors to use the lobby. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 681 A.2d 494. We explained that the lobby was held as a tenancy-in-common by all unit owners together and the right that the bylaws amendment revoked, that is, \u201cthe right to have their clients use the lobby,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 369, 681 A.2d 494, was not \u201ca mere personal privilege,\u201d but rather was appurtenant to the condominium units and subject to conveyance with the units, <em>id. </em>at 370, 681 A.2d 494 (quoting <em>Griffith v. Montgomery Cty., </em>57 Md.App. 472, 485, 470 A.2d 840 (1984)). The <em>Ridgely </em>court reasoned that this right \u201cresembles an easement, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>is an interest in property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 681 A.2d 494. Revoking this right through the bylaw amendment \u201cwas beyond the power of the [condominium] Association,\u201d and was therefore invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 681 A.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Elvaton argues that <em>Ridgely </em>does not control the outcome here because, in that case, the use restriction imposed was permanent, whereas here the restriction lasts only so long as the Roses remain delinquent in their fee payments. From that premise, Elvaton argues that enforcement of the suspension-of-privileges Rule does not constitute an unlawful taking.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Elvaton argues that the Roses may, for instance, convey the right to park and use the pool to a subsequent buyer, a right which is accessible immediately upon payment of the delinquent fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We disagree. We explained in <em>Ridgely </em>that many courts discern no cognizable taking where the rule is of equal application to all unit owners. This is because where a rule is applied equally\u2014for instance, closing an outdoor swimming pool during the cold winter months\u2014the rule does not change any of the owners\u2019 relative percentage interest in the common elements. <em>See id. </em>at 369, 681 A.2d 494. Rather, such a rule is considered a reasonable use restriction. Every unit owners\u2019 use is restricted equally, and no unit owner gains at the expense of another. Where, however, a rule \u201cdisparately affects] a portion of unit owners by revoking a property interest they acquired when they purchased their units, without affecting the rights of the other unit owners,\u201d such as occurred here, there is a taking. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 681 A.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The Roses \u201cown an undivided percentage interest in the common elements\u201d as provided by both the Declaration and \u00a7 ll-107(a). The restriction imposed upon them adversely affected their property interests in two of the common elements of Elvaton that other residents of Elvaton continued to enjoy: the parking lot and the pool, which percentage interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>as provided by \u00a7 11-107(c), \u201cshall have a permanent character and ... may not be changed without the written consent of all of the unit owners and their mortgagees.\u201d Just as the bylaw amendment adversely affected the percentage property interest the commercial unit owners had in the <em>Ridgely </em>condominium\u2019s lobby, the \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d Rule adversely affected the Roses\u2019 percentage property interest in access to the parking lot and the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We know, too, that \u201ctransfer of an interest that is smaller than an ownership interest would suffice to alter the percentage interest held by each owner.\u201d <em>Ridgely, </em>343 Md. at 367, 681 A.2d 494 (internal alterations and quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Kaplan v. Boudreaux, </em>410 Mass. 435, 573 N.E.2d 495, 499 (1991)). The removal of the Roses\u2019 interest in the common elements of the parking lot and pool was sufficient to alter the percentage of the condominium held by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We further disagree with Elvaton that the restriction imposed upon the Roses is not a taking of their property interest in use of the parking lot and pool because the restriction is lifted once the Roses pay the debt owed. Elvaton points out that, unlike in <em>Ridgely </em>where the percentage interest in the common elements was altered permanently, here the effect is temporary\u2014it is a property interference that lasts only until unit owners pay the debt. Elvaton raises this distinction to argue that, therefore, the condominium association may do whatever it likes in terms of property interference. But this argument goes too far. Section ll-107(c) provides that the percentage interest in common elements appurtenant to each unit \u201cmay not be changed without the written consent of all of the unit owners and their mortgagees.\u201d Elvaton is correct that the Rule here does not impose the sort of permanent change to percentage interests in a common element for which \u00a7 11-107(c) requires unanimous unit owner and mortgage lender agreement, but it does not follow that any and every rule imposing only temporary effects on access to common elements is therefore allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Instead, the governing provision here is \u00a7 ll-108(a). That provision states that the \u201ccommon elements may be used only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>for the purposes for which they were intended and, <em>except as provided in the declaration, </em>the common elements shall be subject to mutual rights of support, access, use, and enjoyment by all unit owners.\u201d Thus, the law envisions that the declaration of a particular community may restrict access, through the agreement of the unit owners in their declaration, to various common elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Assuming that the restriction imposed here was \u201ctemporary\u201d, for the reason asserted by Elvaton, we are not persuaded that the restriction is any less a \u201ctaking\u201d. We have found, for example, temporary takings to be actionable in other contexts, such as inverse condemnation law. <em>See Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n of the State Highway Admin., </em>388 Md. 500, 511, 880 A.2d 307 (2005) (citing <em>Kimball Laundry Co. v. United Stales, </em>338 U.S. 1, 7, 69 S.Ct. 1434, 93 L.Ed. 1765 (1949) (discussing proper compensation for temporary takings under federal law)).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Moreover, and in any event, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals in this case that \u201c[t]here is no temporary-infringement exception from complying with the collection procedures in ... the Act. If there were, a condominium association could collect disputed debts by \u2018temporarily\u2019 blocking a hallway or lobby to prevent a unit owner\u2019s accessing the unit.\u201d <em>Elvaton Towne Condo. Regime II, Inc. v. Rose, </em>No. 1033, Sept. Term, 2014, slip op. at 24, 2016 WL 1597156 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. filed Apr. 21, 2016) (quoting Brief of Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland as Amicus supporting the Roses on the suspension-of-privileges issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Restricting a condominium unit owner\u2019s access to communally-held property is a significant infringement of the owner\u2019s property rights\u2014so significant that the General Assembly found it appropriate to require that such a restriction may be authorized only through a provision in the declaration, as evinced by the text of \u00a7 ll-108(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find it telling that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>General Assembly previously allowed a community\u2019s bylaws to permit such a taking, but in 1976 revised the statute to permit these takings only through agreement in a community\u2019s declaration. <em>Compare </em>Maryland Condominium Act, 1974 Md. Laws 2163 <em>with </em>Maryland Condominium Act, 1976 Md. Laws 929. Here, as discussed below, Elvaton\u2019s Declaration does not include authority to restrict access to common elements temporarily, in order to enforce payment of fees, and Elvaton cannot accomplish this restriction through a mere rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>Is the Rule authorized by the Declaration?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Elvaton makes the additional argument that the \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d Rule is authorized by the existing Declaration and By-Laws In support of this argument, Elvaton asserts that all unit owners have already agreed to allow suspension-of-privileges rules through the broad language of the Declaration and By-Laws; therefore, there is no unauthorized taking of property here.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Reasonable use restrictions through rules are common and necessary in condominium management. As discussed above, such rules might, for example, close a pool overnight or during the cold winter months for reasons of safety and common sense regarding seasonal use patterns, and be applied equally to every unit owner. Standard regulation of common elements in the case of condominiums encompasses reasonable restrictions put in place under the authority of the governing documents for the good of all members, tied to some pragmatic general need, such as safe and secure facilities or to avoid wear and tear of communal facilities. These common-good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>regulations are clearly allowed by Maryland law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11-104(c) (\u201c[Bylaws] also may contain any other provision regarding the management and operation of the condominium including any restriction on or requirement respecting the use and maintenance of the units and the common elements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the validity of a rule, a court must determine whether the Board of Directors or Council of Unit Owners had the authority to promulgate the rule at issue under the Act, declaration, and bylaws.\u201d <em>Ridgely, </em>343 Md. at 366, 681 A.2d 494. Elvaton\u2019s existing Declaration and By-Laws grant it broad powers to impose reasonable rules and enforce payment of delinquent fees. The Declaration, at \u00b6 7(F), states that each unit owner \u201cshall contribute toward payment of the Common Expenses,\u201d and the \u201ccontribution of each Unit Owner toward Common Expenses shall be determined, levied and assessed as a lien, all in the manner set forth in the ByLaws.\u201d We outlined earlier in this opinion that the By-Laws anticipate and authorize the Board of Directors \u201cto establish and provide for the collection of assessments from the Unit Owners and for the assessment and/or enforcement of liens therefor in a manner consistent with law and the provisions of these By-Laws and the Declaration\u201d; and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auh-dedup-1\">to promulgate and enforce such rules and regulations, and such restrictions on, or requirements, as may be deemed proper respecting the use, occupancy and maintenance of the project, and the use of the general and limited common elements, as are designated, to prevent unreasonable interference with the use and occupancy of the Condominium and of the general and limited common elements by the Unit Owners, all of which shall be consistent with laws and the provisions of these By-Laws and the Declaration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ar--dedup-0\">By-Laws Article V, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The condominium\u2019s governing body is authorized to enforce payment of fees through the imposition of a lien, <em>id. </em>at Article IX, \u00a7 7, which \u201cmay be enforced and foreclosed\u201d by the governing body \u201csubject to the same requirements, as the foreclosure of mortgages or deeds of trusts on real property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the state containing a power of sale.\u201d The By-Laws anticipate the need for rules on parking, stating that \u201c[v]ehicular parking upon general common elements may be regulated by the Board of Directors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Article X, \u00a7 3(b). And last, violation of any rules by a Unit Owner is prohibited: \u201cThere shall be no violation of any rules for the use of the general or limited common elements ... adopted by the Board of Directors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at Article X, \u00a7 3(r).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">We have explained that, should a declaration allow it,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a suspension-of-privileges use restriction on common elements may be permissible under the Act, so long as the restriction is authorized by the declaration. Elvaton contends that the existing Declaration is broad enough to embrace the suspension-of-privileges debt collection practice, and thus the Rule establishing that practice is valid. Elvaton points out, for instance, that the Declaration states that all unit owners are subject to the provisions of the By-Laws and rules that Elvaton\u2019s Board of Directors passes. Declaration, \u00b6 11. The By-Laws provide authority for Elvaton to implement use restrictions of general common elements (explicitly including parking), to establish and provide for the collection of fees from unit owners, and to prohibit violation of the association\u2019s rules. By-Laws, Article X, \u00a7 3; Article V, \u00a7 3. Elvaton argues the circuit court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Court of Special Appeals failed to engage in a proper analysis of these broad provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The Declaration here does not allow for such restrictions on communal property access, therefore Elvaton\u2019s Rule is invalid no matter how reasonable. No provision of the Declaration contemplates suspension-of-privileges rules, the parking areas are identified as common elements, and the Declaration provides that \u201ccommon elements shall be exclusively owned in common by all of the Unit Owners.\u201d Declaration, \u00b6 7(C). The pool is also a common element, a recreational facility that each Unit Owner acquired rights over when buying property in the condominium. \u201c[E]ach Unit Owner ... shall have the right to use all of the recreational facilities ... including swimming pool and bath house .... This right shall be a right appurtenant to each condominium unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15. Elvaton\u2019s reading of the existing Declaration and By-Laws is radically over-broad. While Elvaton cites to provisions that allow the Council to reasonably regulate parking and to create necessary rules for the complex, these are general grants of power to administer the condominium on day-to-day issues, not the sort of clear, unambiguous release of property rights that would be required to take the Roses\u2019 property interest, even temporarily, in general common elements. In fact, the By-Laws state precisely which methods are allowed for enforcing payment of past-due assessments, and those methods do not include restriction of parking and pool access: \u201cAll assessments, until paid, together with interest on them and actual cost of collection, constitute a lien on the units ... [which] may be enforced and foreclosed by the Council of Unit Owners.\u201d By-Laws, Article IX, \u00a7\u00a7 4(b), 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In sum, \u00a7 ll-108(a) states that, \u201cexcept as provided in the declaration, the common elements shall be subject to mutual rights of support, access, use, and enjoyment by all unit owners.\u201d Elvaton\u2019s Declaration does not provide for an exception that would restrict access to the common elements due to an alleged failure to pay fees. Thus, the \u201csuspension-of-privileges\u201d Rule is invalid as beyond the Council\u2019s power.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">We turn now to the Roses\u2019 contention that the circuit court should have issued a declaratory judgment on the validity of their debt, even though that issue was pending review in the District Court. Relying on the rules governing declaratory judgment expressed in <em>Vargas-Aguila v. State, Office of Chief Medical Examiner, </em>202 Md.App. 875, 382, 32 A.3d 496 (2011), and Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 3-409 of the Maryland Code, the circuit court ruled that here, where the precise issue at hand was already within the jurisdiction of the District Court but was stayed, and there were no unusual and compelling circumstances, the circuit court would not grant declaratory judgment. The Roses challenge that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 3-409(a) provides that a court <em>\u201cmay </em>grant a declaratory judgment or decree in a civil case\u201d (emphasis added). This Court has concluded that, therefore, \u201cdeclaratory judgment generally is a discretionary type of relief.\u201d <em>Converge Servs. Group, LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 477, 860 A.2d 871 (2004). Consequently, the trial judge\u2019s decision not to grant declaratory judgment is reviewed under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Sprenger v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The courts of this State \u201cwill refuse [to issue declaratory judgment] where another court has jurisdiction of the issue, where a proceeding involving identical issues is already pending in another tribunal, where a special statutory remedy has been provided, or where another remedy will be more effective or appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Haynie v. Gold Bond Bldg. Prods., </em>306 Md. 644, 651, 511 A.2d 40 (1986) (citation omitted). \u201cIn these cases it is neither useful nor proper to issue the declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ordering declaratory relief \u201cto decide an issue, even though the issue is presented in another pending case between the parties\u201d is reserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cvery unusual and compelling circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 511 A.2d 40 (citation omitted). This rule is applicable in both civil and criminal cases. <em>See A.S. Abell Co. v. Sweeney, </em>274 Md. 715, 720, 337 A.2d 77 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We agree with the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals that, because the validity of the Roses\u2019 alleged debt was already pending before the District Court, the circuit court, guided by our caselaw, was well within its discretion to dismiss Declarations (2), (3), and (4) in the absence of unusual and compelling circumstances, and no such circumstances are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Roses attempt to dissuade us by arguing that a compelling circumstance exists in that the District Court is a court of limited jurisdiction\u2014it is not empowered to determine ownership interests in real property. <em>See </em>Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 4-402(b). The Roses claim that, therefore, the District Court may not make determinations related to the lien imposed by Elvaton on their unit. Yet it is plain, and undisputed by the parties, that the issue of the validity of the debt is properly before the District Court. The validity of the lien flows directly from that question, and thus the elimination of the lien is not an independent issue but instead only a remedy\u2014one that the Roses may pursue should they be successful in winning the issue of the alleged debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Last, while it is true, as the Roses point out, that the District Court case could have been consolidated with the circuit court case if Elvaton requested that this be done, Elvaton was not required to do so. <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 6-104(b)(1) (when related actions between same parties are filed in the District Court and a circuit court, the party who filed in the District Court may move to consolidate with the action pending in circuit court). We also note that the Roses enjoyed the right to challenge Elvaton\u2019s imposition of a lien in circuit court at an earlier time, but neglected to make this challenge. Elvaton filed its lien against the Roses pursuant to \u00a7 11-110(d), which grants condominiums the power to enforce delinquent condominium fees through \u201cthe imposition of a lien on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>unit in accordance with the provisions of the Maryland Contract Lien Act.\u201d In turn, the Maryland Contract Lien Act empowers unit owners to oppose that lien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">A party to whom notice is given under subsection (a) of this section may, within 30 days after the notice is served on the party, file a complaint in the <em>circuit court </em>for the county in which any part of the property is located to determine whether probable cause exists for the establishment of a lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u00a7 14-203(c)(l) (emphasis added). The Roses possessed this right to litigate the lien in circuit court, but did not invoke it at the time Elvaton filed its Statement of Lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The District Court had proper jurisdiction over the delinquent fee dispute, and we discern no unusual or compelling circumstances in this case that would entitle the Roses to have the dispute resolved in circuit court. Therefore, the circuit court\u2019s decision not to grant declaratory relief was reasonable and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">.

Elvaton presented the following question in its petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">Whether Maryland law permits, and Elvaton's Declaration and Bylaws provide, the authority to implement rules that temporarily suspend unit owners who are delinquent in their condominium assessments from using the community parking lot and pool?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The Roses\u2019 cross-petition posed this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err by finding that the Roses were precluded from pursuing a declaratory judgment related to Elvaton\u2019s Statement of Lien, which established an interest in the Roses\u2019 real property, and that the Roses\u2019 only procedural remedy was to pursue a defense in a money damages consumer collection action pending in the District Court?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. For purposes of examining Elvaton\u2019s arguments, we phrase the question as if the Roses' debt is proven, but we note again here that the debt is contested and has not been established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">. This is not to say that every temporary restraint on access to property rights made through a community\u2019s declaration will always be allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>able. It is, for instance, conceivable that a restriction on access to a condominium's elevator which prevents a disabled person from accessing that person\u2019s privately-owned unit at all, or a restriction on access to the hallway leading to one\u2019s privately-owned unit, may not be permissible. Such circumstances are not before the Court in this case and we refrain from speculating further on these applications of the Maryland Condominium Act and laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\">. Elvaton makes an argument that, because the condominium association was established before the effective date of the 1976 reauthorization of the law, which requires the grant of authority for a taking of common elements be laid out in the declaration, the current law does not apply to Elvaton. Instead, the earlier version of the law, which allows authority for a taking of common elements to be established in the declaration <em>or the bylaws, </em>should apply. This argument fails because neither Elvaton\u2019s Declaration nor its By-Laws provides express authority for such a taking. In addition, this case does not involve a question of retroactivity'\u2014the taking occurred in 2012. Elvaton\u2019s actions are judged under the then-current version of the law. The 1976 reauthorization says only that existing condominiums need not amend their \"declaration or master deed, bylaws, or condominium plat ... to comply with the requirements of this title.\u201d \u00a7 ll-128(a) (1976 Supp.). It does not follow that this savings clause (seemingly designed to prevent existing governing documents from becoming invalid where elements of the document conflict with the revised law) requires that a forty-year-old version of the law applies to Elvaton and any other condominium established in 1975 or earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
