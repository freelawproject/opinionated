Here, the settlor established an irrevocable trust for the benefit of his four adult children. Included in the trust instrument is a modification provision that provides authority for the beneficiaries to alter, amend, or revoke the terms of the trust if 75% of the beneficiaries vote in favor of such action. The modification provision did not specifically grant authority to remove a beneficiary, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>allowed 75% of the beneficiaries to alter, amend, or revoke the terms of the trust pursuant to the terms of the modification provision. Thirty years after the trust was created, three of the four beneficiaries executed an amendment under the modification provision purporting to remove the fourth beneficiary as a beneficiary of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Considering the language of the entire trust instrument, we hold that the plain language of the modification provision does not grant authority for three beneficiaries of the trust to remove the fourth beneficiary, and that the irrevocable trust clearly evinces the settlor\u2019s intent for the trust to benefit his four children\u2014the four beneficiaries\u2014equally. An interpretation of the trust instrument that would permit three of the settlor\u2019s children to divest the fourth would contravene the settlor\u2019s intent and be inconsistent with the plain language of the irrevocable trust. We conclude that the amendment at issue\u2014in which three of the four beneficiaries purported to divest the fourth beneficiary\u2014was impermissible under the terms of the irrevocable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">On September 16, 1983, James Vito (\u201cVito\u201d) established an irrevocable trust, entitled the \u201cJames B. Vito Family Trust\u201d (\u201cthe irrevocable trust\u201d), naming his four children, Michael Vito (\u201cMichael\u201d), Judith Vito Seal (\u201cJudith\u201d), John Timothy Vito (\u201cTimothy\u201d), and Candace Vito Grueff (\u201cCandace\u201d) (together, \u201cthe beneficiaries\u201d), as beneficiaries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time, Vito owned a contract to purchase property improved by a building in Rochester, New York. The preamble of the irrevocable trust states that Vito intended to give the contract to purchase property to the trust as a gift \u201cfor the immediate benefit of [Vito\u2019s] children, namely, CANDACE VITO GRUEFF, JUDITH A. VITO, MICHAEL A. VITO, and JOHN T. VITO (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018Beneficial Owners\u2019 or \u2018Beneficiaries\u2019) of the fee interest in said property in which [Vito was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the owner of all buildings and improvements thereon[.]\u201d The preamble further provides that Vito granted \u201call [Vito\u2019s] right, title and interest in and to the fee interest in said property .,. in equal shares, for [Vito\u2019s] children, CANDACE VITO GRUEFF, JUDITH A. VITO, MICHAEL A. VITO, and JOHN T. VITO,\u201d thereby establishing \u201ca Trust Fund subject to the terms and conditions [therein] under which the Trustee agree[d] to hold said fund ... for the benefit of and in behalf of [Vito]\u2019s said children[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Following the preamble, the irrevocable trust sets forth fifteen individually numbered items, including, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">SECOND: The Settlor shall pay all transfer or recordation taxes and costs of settlement and title insurance on the purchase of the subject property and thereafter the Trustee shall hold the legal title to Trust Property subject to the Bill of Sale, Lease and Memorandum of Gift between the parties and shall collect and receive all payments coming due on account thereof, whether rents, dividends, interest and/or principal in behalf of and for the benefit of the beneficiaries and the Trustee shall pay out of sums collected on such assets, first out of income, and to the extent necessary from principal, all taxes and other proper charges of the administration thereof. In addition, the Trustee shall at least once each year distribute all the net income and any capital gains of the trust to the beneficial owners in the shares set forth in Item SIXTH below in such partial or periodic distributions as he deems appropriate within his discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u215c \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">FOURTH: This Trust shall terminate sixteen (16) years from the date hereof unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided (unless the Settlor-Tenant exercises his option to renew the Lease for ten (10) years, in which case the term of the Trust shall also be extended). Upon the termination of this Trust, whether at the end of said sixteen (16) years or prior thereto (or after expiration of the option period) the Trust Estate then held by the Trustee shall be paid over, transferred and delivered to the beneficiaries in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the shares set forth in Item SIXTH below, free of all Trusts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">SIXTH: If at any time the assets comprising the Trust estate shall have been liquidated and all of the aforesaid assumed obligations or liens or encumbrances on the Trust property have been satisfied, the Trustee shall, after setting aside an amount which in his judgment will be sufficient to provide for the payment of any taxes and/or costs of administration, pay over and distribute the remaining assets, exclusive of the reserve for taxes and/or costs, to the beneficiaries free of all Trust, in the shares listed below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">CANDACE VITO GRUEFF 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1l\">JUDITH A.

VITO 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcX\">100%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAjG\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">EIGHTH: In the event of the death of any of the issue of Settlor, prior to the termination of this Trust, the beneficial interest herein of such deceased person shall pass to his or her estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">TENTH: This Agreement may be revoked, altered or amended from time to time by an instrument in writing, signed by the holders of not less than seventy-five (75%) interest herein and delivered to the Trustee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Prior to the amendment at issue in the instant case, the irrevocable trust had been amended four times, pursuant to the protocol set forth in Item Tenth requiring consent of 75% of the beneficiaries to alter, amend, or revoke the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>irrevocable trust. Specifically, in 1995, Judith, Michael, and Timothy first amended the irrevocable trust to appoint John F. Brennan, Esquire (\u201cBrennan\u201d) as the successor to the original trustee, Paul Vito (\u201cAmendment I\u201d). In 1999, all of the beneficiaries\u2014Judith, Michael, Timothy, and Candace\u2014 amended the irrevocable trust to extend its duration until Vito\u2019s death or December 31, 2019, whichever occurred first (\u201cAmendment II\u201d); pursuant to Item Fourth, the irrevocable trust was originally intended to expire after sixteen years. In 2003, all of the beneficiaries extended the trust termination date to December 31, 2024 (\u201cAmendment III\u201d), In Amendment III, the beneficiaries empowered the trustee to enter into certain indemnification agreements on behalf of the trust. In 2012, Judith, Michael, and Timothy amended the irrevocable trust to appoint Judith and Michael as successor trustees to Brennan (\u201cAmendment IV\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In the midst of the amendments, the beneficiaries became embroiled in litigation. In 1999, Vito created a separate, revocable trust (\u201cthe revocable trust\u201d), identifying himself, his wife, Mary Vito (\u201cMary\u201d), and Brennan as the trustees. The revocable trust was funded by Vito\u2019s commercial real estate holdings and other property. On December 15, 2004, Vito executed an amendment to the revocable trust restating its terms. The amended revocable trust established a residuary trust, separate from a marital trust, under which Vito\u2019s four children had an interest. In April 2011, Vito amended the revocable trust as the settlor, and Vito, Mary, and Brennan amended the revocable trust as trustees, specifying that Candace\u2019s 25% interest in an entity known as James Properties II, LLC would be reduced by a 10% interest that had been previously granted to Candace\u2019s son. Each of Judith, Timothy, and Michael retained a 25% interest in James Properties II, LLC. Candace subsequently filed a guardianship proceeding, alleging that Vito had dementia, that Michael and Judith had taken advantage of Vito, and that Michael and Judith had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>convinced Brennan to draft the amendment without informing Vito and Mary of its implications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties settled the guardianship matter with the appointment of Paul H. Eth-ridge, Esquire (\u201cEthridge\u201d) and Mary as co-guardians of Vito\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On August 9, 2013, with respect to both the irrevocable trust and the revocable trust, Candace, Respondent, filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) a \u201cComplaint to Remove Trustees, For Breach of Fiduciary Duty, to Appoint Successor Trustees, For Negligence, For Monies Had and Received, To Set Aside Improper Conveyances and For an Accounting and Other Relief, Including Money Damages\u201d against Mary in her capacity as a co-guardian of Vito\u2019s property, Ethridge in his capacity as a co-guardian of Vito\u2019s property, Michael, Judith, Timothy, Brennan, and MFV Annuity Fund, LLC. In the complaint, Candace alleged that Michael and Judith, Petitioners, were misallocat-ing funds from both trusts. Candace requested that the circuit court remove Michael and Judith as trustees of the irrevocable trust and appoint a successor trustee. Candace also sought, among other things, to require Michael and Judith to provide a full accounting of any funds taken from the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">On October 21, 2013, subsequent to the filing of Candace\u2019s complaint, pursuant to the modification provision of the irrevocable trust\u2014Item Tenth\u2014Judith, Michael, and Timothy executed the amendment to the irrevocable trust purporting to remove Candace as a beneficiary under the irrevocable trust. This was the fifth amendment (\u201cAmendment V\u201d) to the irrevocable trust, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">Pursuant to Article [ (Item) ] Tenth[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] of the JAMES B. VITO FAMILY TRUST, dated September 16, 1983, as amended by Amendment I to the James B. Vito Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Trust dated March 8, 1995, and as further amended by Amendment II to the James B. Vito Family Trust dated September 1, 1999, Amendment III to the James B. Vito Family Trust dated June 16, 2008, and a fourth amendment incorrectly identified as Amendment III to the James B. Vito Family Trust dated May 21, 2012 (collectively, the \u201cTrust\u201d), the undersigned, being seventy-five percent (75%) of the beneficial owners of the Trust, hereby amend the Trust as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">1. [Item] Sixth is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">SIXTH: If at any time the assets comprising the Trust estate shall have been liquidated and all of the aforesaid assumed obligations or liens or encumbrances on the Trust property have been satisfied, the Trustee shall, after setting aside an amount which in his judgment will be sufficient to provide for the payment of any taxes and/or costs of administration, pay over and distribute the remaining assets, exclusive of the reserve for taxes and/or costs, to the beneficiaries free of all Trust, in the shares listed below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">JUDITH VITO SEAL 33 1/3%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3e\">MICHAEL A. VITO 33 1/3%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">JOHN T. VITO 33 1/3%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">All other terms and conditions of the Trust shall remain unchanged and continue in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which, when so executed, will be deemed an original, and all of which, taken together, shall constitute one instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Less than two weeks later, on November 1, 2013, Judith and Michael filed in the circuit court a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and/or For Summary Judgment\u201d as to Counts I and V, which pertained to removal of Michael and Judith as trustees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>irrevocable trust and the request for an accounting of their dealings with regard to the irrevocable trust. In the motion, Michael and Judith claimed that Candace lacked standing to challenge their appointment as trustees because she was no longer a beneficiary of the irrevocable trust, contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Finally, pursuant to Amendment V to the James B. Vito Family Trust (\u201cAmendment\u201d), attached hereto as Exhibit 1, [Candace] is no longer a beneficiary, income or otherwise, of the [irrevocable] Trust. The Amendment amended [Item] Sixth of the Family Trust, which controls the disbursement of current income and proceeds upon the termination of the [irrevocable] Trust. Although when suit was filed, [Candace] was an income beneficiary and a one-fourth (1/4) remainder beneficiary, on October 21, 2013, pursuant to [Item] Tenth of the [irrevocable] Trust, three-fourths (3/4) of the beneficial owners agreed to modify [Item] Sixth, replacing it with a new [Item] Sixth. [Candace] is not an income beneficiary under the new [Item] Sixth as of October 21, 2013. Thus, since she is no longer a current income beneficiary of the [irrevocable] Trust nor a residual beneficiary, she lacks standing to bring her request for removal of Michael and Judith as Trustees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">(Bolding in original). Similarly, Michael and Judith argued that Candace lacked standing to request an accounting of any transaction involving the irrevocable trust that occurred after October 21, 2013, the date on which Amendment V was executed. In addition to the motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment that Michael and Judith filed, there were two other motions to dismiss Candace\u2019s complaint filed: one by Timothy and MFV Annuity Fund, LLC, and a second by Mary and Brennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On December 19, 2013, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motions. On January 27, 2014, the circuit court issued an opinion and order granting all of the motions to dismiss, including Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. In ruling on Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s motion, the circuit court found that Candace lacked standing to bring her claims. Specifically, the circuit court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Item Tenth could be used to remove a beneficiary from the irrevocable trust; thus, by virtue of Amendment V, Candace was no longer a beneficiary with standing to seek removal of Michael and Judith as trustees of the irrevocable trust, and to seek an accounting for transactions that occurred after October 21, 2013. The circuit court also found Item Tenth \u201cto be a valid and enforceable contractual provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On February 5, 2014, Candace filed a motion to alter or amend the circuit court\u2019s judgment. On May 8, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion to alter or amend. During the hearing, the circuit court clarified that its order granting Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment was partial. On the same day as the hearing, the circuit court issued an Order Amending Opinion and Order docketed on January 29, 2014, in which the circuit court explained \u201cthat only partial summary judgment has been entered in favor of the defendants, Michael [ ] and Judith [ ], on Count V of [Candacej\u2019s complaint, and [Candacej\u2019s claim for an accounting for the period of time up to October 21, 2013, shall remain pending.\u201d On November 3, 2014, the parties filed a line of dismissal, asking that the remaining pending counts of the complaint be dismissed with prejudice. Two days later, on November 5,2014, Vito died.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On November 7, 2014, Candace noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On August 31, 2016, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, in part, the circuit court\u2019s judgment, by reversing the dismissal of Counts I and V, which pertained to removal of Michael and Judith as trustees of the irrevocable trust and the request for an accounting of their dealings with regard to the irrevocable trust, and otherwise affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment. See Grueff v. Vito, 229 Md.App. 353, 385, 145 A.3d 86, 104 (2016). The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat a broadly worded power to amend in an irrevocable trust instrument cannot be used by a majority of beneficiaries to divest a minority beneficiary of her interest in the trust when doing so would be contrary to the settlor\u2019s intent in creating the trust.\u201d Id. at 356, 145 A.3d at 87. Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>observed that interpreting the irrevocable trust to allow three of four siblings to divest the fourth would contravene Vito\u2019s clearly stated intent, which was to benefit his four children equally. See id. at 373, 145 A.3d at 98. The Court of Special Appeals stated: \u201cWhen the [irrevocable] trust instrument is considered as a whole, a reading of [the 75% rule] to allow the holders of a 75% interest, <em>ie., </em>three children, to divest the holder of the remaining 25% interest, <em>ie., </em>one child, of that interest is inconsistent with [Vito]\u2019s clear intention to benefit all four of his children, and to do so equally.\u201d Id. at 373, 145 A.3d at 98. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgment as to Counts I and V with respect to Michael and Judith. See id. at 385, 145 A.3d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">On October 14, 2016, Michael and Judith filed in this Court a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>posing the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u25a0Whether the [Court of Special Appeals] erred in reversing the Circuit Court and ignored the intent of the settlor, as expressed in the plain and unambiguous language of the Trust instrument, by holding an amendment clause cannot be used to modify the beneficiary section of the Trust, even though the amendment complied with the plain language of the amendment clause?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">On December 2, 2016, we granted the petition. See Vito v. Grueff, 450 Md. 664, 150 A.3d 819 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ayj\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Michael and Judith contend that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision, reversing the judgment of the circuit court as to Counts I and V, was not based on established Maryland law, but rather was fashioned to avoid an \u201cundesirable result\u201d\u2014the divestment of Candace. Michael and Judith argue that the Court of Special Appeals failed to give the language of Item Tenth its plain meaning, which, in their view, grants the beneficiaries broad discretion to modify the irrevocable trust, including the authority to divest a beneficiary. Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>on principles of contract interpretation, Michael and Judith assert that the Court of Special Appeals was prohibited from considering provisions outside of Item Tenth unless the Court determined that the language of Item Tenth was ambiguous. Michael and Judith maintain that, in rejecting the use of the 75% rule to amend Item Sixth, the Court of Special Appeals substituted its judgment for Vito\u2019s clearly stated intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Candace responds that the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s interpretation of Item Tenth contravened Vito\u2019s intent, which was to have the irrevocable trust benefit his four children equally. Candace contends that the Court of Special Appeals properly considered the language of the irrevocable trust in its entirety in determining the scope of Item Tenth. According to Candace, language throughout the irrevocable trust demonstrates that Vito intended the irrevocable trust to benefit all four children and, thus, any amendment divesting one child would contravene that intent. Candace argues that Amendment V violates well-established Maryland law regarding testamentary power of appointment, which prohibits beneficiaries from unilaterally taking a greater share of trust property for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In reply, Michael and Judith contend that Vito\u2019s intent, as expressed in the irrevocable trust, comports with their interpretation of Item Tenth. Michael and Judith argue that, considering the irrevocable trust as a whole, nothing contained therein contradicts the validity of the divestment of Candace under Item Tenth. Michael and Judith assert that Item Tenth provides for broad amendment authority that is to be exercised by 75% of the beneficiaries. Michael and Judith maintain that any amendment to the irrevocable trust, including the first four amendments, would alter its original intent. Michael and Judith contend that Candace\u2019s objection to their use of Item Tenth stems from the circumstance that the modification achieves an obviously undesirable result for her, rather than from any legal shortcoming of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We treat the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment as a motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>mary judgment, as the circuit court considered materials outside of the pleadings\u2014namely, the irrevocable trust and Amendment V. See Anne Arundel Cty. v. Bell, 442 Md. 539, 552, 113 A.3d 639, 647 (2015) (\u201cWe will treat the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of the County\u2019s motions to dismiss as a grant of summary judgment because the trial court considered materials (specifically, affidavits) outside the complaints (i.e., the complaints and documents attached thereto).\u201d (Citations omitted)). We review all questions of law, including whether summary judgment was properly granted, without deference. See id. at 552, 113 A.3d at 647; see also Toms v. Calvary Assembly of God, Inc., 446 Md. 543, 551, 132 A.3d 866, 870-71 (2016) (\u201cAs with all questions of law, we review this matter <em>de novo.\u201d </em>(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cThe creation of a trust is a means of providing benefits for another, sometimes for a consideration but more generally as a donative transfer.... The intent to create a trust must be definite and particular.\u201d Amy Morris Hess et al., Bogert\u2019s Trusts and Trustees (\u201cBogert\u2019s\u201d) \u00a7 46 (2016) (footnote omitted). At common law, there is a presumption that beneficiaries do not possess the power to modify a trust. See Bogert\u2019s \u00a7 992 (\u201cAlthough a beneficiary may be expressly granted the power to amend the trust, at common law, neither some nor all of the beneficiaries have an implied power to modify the trust.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)). A settlor may, however, affirmatively grant a beneficiary the power to amend the trust. See id. Similarly, a trustee may not unilaterally amend a trust without the consent of the beneficiaries, except as expressly provided in the trust instrument. See From the Heart Church Ministries, Inc. v. African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 370 Md. 152, 184, 803 A.2d 548, 568 (2002) (\u201cOnce established, a trust may be modified without the beneficiaries\u2019 consent, but only if the power to do so is reserved. If no such right has been reserved, then the beneficiaries\u2019 consent is required before the trust may be modified.\u201d (Citation omitted)); Shriners Hosps. for Crippled Children v. Md.

The premise is that the intent of the settlor or testator controls.

If the question cannot be resolved by reference to the clause alone, the court will examine the entire trust instrument to determine the settlor\u2019s intent and purposes; where necessary they apply statutory or court rules of construction or presumptions. The third step becomes necessary when the intent or meaning of the settlor or testator cannot be determined by reference to the provisions of the trust instrument itself, for example, if the language is ambiguous.

In Pfeufer, 397 Md. at 660, 919 A.2d at 652, we held that a testator\u2019s clearly stated intent that an inheritance tax on the estate be paid from the residuary estate \u201cwithout apportionment\u201d was controlling, even though a number of the residuary legatees would ordinarily be exempt from paying inheritance taxes on their share. In Pfeufer, id. at 646, 919 A.2d at 643-44, the testator\u2019s will provided that the residuary estate be divided in equal shares among four individuals: his daughter, his son, his sister, and a fourth individual who was of no relation. Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Tax-Gen. (1988, 2004 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cTG\u201d) \u00a7 7-203(b)(2), the three relatives of the testator were exempt from paying inheritance taxes, but the fourth legatee did not qualify for such an exemption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> gee Pfeufer, 397 Md. at 646-47, 919 A.2d at 644.

See id. at 647, 919 A.2d at 644. The fourth legatee challenged the amendment, but the Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County upheld the amendment, finding that the legislative intent of TG \u00a7 7-203(b) controlled over the \u201cboilerplate language\u201d of the will. Id. at 647-48, 919 A.2d at 644. Upon determining that the clearly expressed intent of the testator was that the inheritance tax be paid from the residuary estate without apportionment, we reversed the judgment of the Orphans\u2019 Court for Montgomery County. See id. at 660, 919 A.2d at 662. In so holding, we emphasized the primacy of the testator\u2019s intent in determining the allocation of an estate, and noted that it must control unless in conflict with law or public policy, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">[T]he testator must have intended that the amount of the residuary shares to be distributed would be determined based on the value of the residuary estate after the taxes had been paid, off the top, out of the estate; it was the clear intention of the testator that each individual share of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>residuary estate be determined after the taxes were paid on the entire estate, albeit from the residuary estate. Thus, it is immaterial that under the Tax Code, some of the legatees would not have been obligated, in any event, to pay taxes on their share; they are, in reality, not being taxed on their residuary share, nor is any residuary legacy being reduced. As we have said, the intent of the testator, as ascertained from the language of the will, controls the source of the funds to be used to pay inheritance taxes so long as there is no conflict with the applicable statute, other law or public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Id. at 655, 919 A.2d at 649 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">To ascertain the intent of the testator, the Court considers a will in its entirety.

The friend contended that \u201cpersonal property\u201d included both tangible and intangible personal property, whereas the Anne Arundel General Hospital and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals argued that the phrase referred only to tangible personal property. See id. at 279, 277 A.2d at 612.

We also noted that the structure of the bequests became unworkable if we were to interpret the will as granting the friend all of the testators\u2019 tangible and intangible personal property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">Debts, expenses and death taxes are directed to be paid from the residue. If it was intended that [the friend] was to get all the intangible personal property as well as all the tangibles, the residue could have consisted only of the real estate, that is, the home property.

Hutson, 313 Md. 243, 247, 545 A.2d 43, 45 (1988), we held that a broadly-phrased devise of a life tenancy in a will did not grant the life tenant the right to subsequently gift the property to another party. In that case, the testatrix executed a will in which she granted a life tenancy in the family home to her daughter, who was one of the testator\u2019s three adult children. See id. at 244, 545 A.2d at 44. Specifically, the will granted the daughter the \u201c \u2018full power to sell, mortgage, lease, rent or in any other manner whatsoever to dispose of the entire estate, or any portion thereof (except by Will).\u2019 \u201d Id. at 244, 545 A.2d at 44. The will provided that, in the event that the daughter sold the property, the net proceeds of the sale would be divided among the three adult children, with $1,000 provided to the testatrix\u2019s son, two-thirds to the daughter with the life tenancy, and one-third to the testatrix\u2019s other daughter. See id. at 244-45, 545 A.2d at 44. The will ordered that, if the daughter with the life tenancy passed away before selling the property, the estate\u2019s executor was to sell the property and divide the proceeds according to the same ratio, but with the testatrix\u2019s granddaughter standing in the place of her mother and receiving two-thirds. See id. at 245, 545 A.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The daughter retained the property for eighteen years. See id. at 244-45, 545 A.2d at 44. Shortly before her death, she deeded the property to her daughter, the testatrix\u2019s granddaughter, without consideration. See id. at 245, 545 A.2d at 44. The testatrix\u2019s other daughter and the heirs of the testatrix\u2019s son initiated an action seeking to invalidate the deed. See id. at 245, 545 A.2d at 44. Specifically, they contended that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>will, when considered as a whole, did not grant the daughter the power to gift the property. See id. at 245, 545 A.2d at 44. Conversely, the granddaughter argued that the testatrix\u2019s will granted the daughter the authority to dispose of the property in any manner that she chose. See id. at 246, 545 A.2d at 45. We explained the granddaughter\u2019s argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">[The granddaughter] claimfs] that the plain meaning of the words contained in [the testatrix]\u2019s will manifested an intention to grant [her daughter] absolute powers of disposition of the [ ] property, including disposition by gift. [The granddaughter] argue[s] that [the testatrix]\u2019s intention must be gathered from only one source[\u2014]the words employed by her. Accordingly, the [granddaughter] say[s] that because [the testatrix] vested [her daughter] with unlimited power to dispose of the [ ] property \u201cin any other manner whatsoever,\u201d except by will, that intention can only be gratified if [the daughter\u2019s gift of the property is upheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Id. at 246, 545 A.2d at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We concluded, however, that the granddaughter\u2019s interpretation of the will was at odds with the testatrix\u2019s general intent, and that the provision of the will granting the daughter the right to dispose of the property could not be read in isolation. See id. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45-46. Rather, we determined that the provision at issue needed to be considered in the context of the entire will, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">Of course ... the intention of the testatrix is to be determined by the words employed by her. But those words are not to be considered in isolation, but only in association with the other provisions of the will[\u2014]the overall testamentary plan of the testatrix. In other words, the will must be read as a whole. Therefore, [the daughter\u2019s power to sell, mortgage, lease, rent, or \u201cin any other manner whatsoever to dispose of the entire estate,\u201d except by will, must be construed in light of, and circumscribed by, [the testatrix]\u2019s intent that the property would provide a residence or support for [the daughter] but would eventually be sold and the proceeds distributed to the designated beneficiaries. Thus, while the words contained in the broad power of disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tion given [the daughter] in this case, if literally applied, would accommodate a gift of the property, the will in its entirety reveals that such a disposition was not within [the testatrix]\u2019s real intention. The general plan of [the testatrix]\u2019s will required that whatever disposition [the daughter] made of the property under the power granted to her, a monetary value would be received for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Id. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45-46 (emphasis added). In reviewing the will in its entirety, we also found it significant that the testatrix had given other property to her daughter outright, without any restrictions, yet had expressly chosen not to do so with the family home. See id. at 248, 545 A.2d at 46 (\u201cIndeed, had [the testatrix] intended that [her daughter] have an unrestricted power of disposition over the property, she would have given it to her outright, as she did with her other property\u201d). In sum, we concluded that the authority granted to the daughter with respect to the family home did not include the power to gift the property. See id. at 247-48, 545 A.2d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In this case, taking into account the language of the entire irrevocable trust, we hold that the plain language of Item Tenth does not grant authority for three beneficiaries of the trust to remove the fourth beneficiary, and that the irrevocable trust clearly demonstrates Vito\u2019s intent for the trust to benefit his four children\u2014the four beneficiaries\u2014 equally. In other words, Amendment V\u2014in which three of the four beneficiaries purported to divest the fourth beneficiary, Candace\u2014was impermissible under the terms of the irrevocable trust. Item Tenth does not provide 75% of the beneficiaries with the power to divest the remaining beneficiary. Although Item Tenth gives 75% of the beneficiaries authority to revoke, alter, or amend the terms of the irrevocable trust, an interpretation that grants three beneficiaries the power to divest the fourth beneficiary would directly contravene Vito\u2019s express intent, as ascertained from the language of the irrevocable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>trust, which was that the irrevocable trust benefit his four children equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Guided by the principles of testamentary interpretation set forth in Pfeufer, 397 Md. at 660, 919 A.2d at 652, LeRoy, 262 Md. at 281, 277 A.2d at 614, and Childs, 313 Md. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45, we conclude that the trust agreement is to be construed based on the settlor\u2019s intent, as ascertained from the language of the provision at issue, within the context of the document as a whole. In this case, Vito\u2019s intent to have the irrevocable trust benefit his four children equally is evident from the totality of the irrevocable trust\u2019s language. Similar to this Court\u2019s determination in Childs, 313 Md. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45, if read in isolation, the language of item Tenth could arguably be interpreted to permit divestment of a beneficiary by 75% action of the beneficiaries. But, when the content of Item Tenth is considered along with the language of the irrevocable trust in its entirety, it is clear that Item Tenth does not grant authority for 75% of the beneficiaries to divest a remaining beneficiary, and Amendment V cannot be reconciled with Vito\u2019s clear intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Even a cursory review of Item Tenth reveals that Item Tenth does not provide 75% of the beneficiaries with the power to change the number of beneficiaries and eliminate a remaining beneficiary of the irrevocable trust. Indeed, Item Tenth makes no express mention of increasing or decreasing the number of beneficiaries, and speaks only of generally amending, altering, or revoking the terms of the irrevocable trust. Plainly, the language of Item Tenth does not explicitly resolve the present issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">When read in its entirety, the plain language of the irrevocable trust provides ample substantiation that Vito intended the irrevocable trust to benefit all four children. Significantly, the preamble includes the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">WHEREAS, [Vito] desires to dispose of said contract by gift on this date to this Trust for the immediate benefit of his children, namely, CANDACE VITO GRUEFF, JUDITH A.

Within the irrevocable trust, Vito included provisions to ensure that his four children would receive the benefits of the trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">[T]he Trustee shall at least once each year distribute all the net income and any capital gains of the trust to the beneficial owners in the shares set forth in item SIXTH below in such partial or periodic distributions as he deems appropriate within his discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">* \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">Upon the termination of this Trust ... the Trust Estate then held by the Trustee shall be paid over, transferred and delivered to the beneficiaries in the shares set forth in Item SIXTH below, free of all Trusts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">SIXTH: If at any time the assets comprising the Trust estate shall have been liquidated and all of the aforesaid assumed obligations or liens or encumbrances on the Trust property have been satisfied, the Trustee shall, after setting aside an amount which in his judgment will be sufficient to provide for the payment of any taxes and/or costs of administration, pay over and distribute the remaining assets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>exclusive of the reserve for taxes and/or costs, to the beneficiaries free of all Trust, in the shares listed below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">CANDACE VITO GRUEFF 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap-\">JUDITH A. VITO 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZz\">MICHAEL A. VITO 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajs\">JOHN T. VITO 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqM\">100%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">EIGHTH: In the event of the death of any of the issue of [Vito], prior to the termination of this Trust, the beneficial interest herein of such deceased person shall pass to his or her estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Tellingly, in addition to Item Sixth, which identifies Vito\u2019s four children by name and directs that each receive an equal 25% share of the trust, Item Eighth specifies that, in the event that one of the beneficiaries dies while the trust is in existence, the deceased beneficiary\u2019s estate, not the other beneficiaries, would be entitled to the deceased beneficiary\u2019s share. In other words, under Item Eighth, Candace\u2019s heirs would inherit her interest in the trust. Thus, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s interpretation of Item Tenth is at odds with the intent evident in Item Eighth, as well as the preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">As we explained in Childs, 313 Md. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45, when interpreting a will, the intention of the testator is ascertained by the language employed by the testator in the context of the will as a whole. As we noted in Childs, id. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45, had we analyzed the clause at issue in isolation, we would have concluded that the testatrix\u2019s daughter was empowered to dispose of the property in any way that she saw fit, except by will. In Childs, id. at 247, 545 A.2d at 45, however, we explained that the testatrix\u2019s \u201cwords are not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>considered in isolation, but only in association with the other provisions of the will[\u2014]the overall testamentary plan of the testatrix.\u201d Our considerations in this case are the same. Without further context, Item Tenth could debatably be read to permit divestment of a beneficiary through amendment of the irrevocable trust. When Item Tenth is considered in the context of the entirety of the irrevocable trust, however, it is clear that it was not Vito\u2019s intent that three beneficiaries could divest the remaining beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In more than one instance, Vito provided that the irrevocable trust was intended to benefit his four children equally, including Candace. As such, adopting Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s interpretation would lead to an unreasonable result. As Candace points out, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s interpretation of the irrevocable trust would, in theory, have permitted Michael, Judith, and Timothy to remove Candace instantly as a beneficiary of the irrevocable trust as soon as the trust was created. This outcome cannot be reconciled with Vito\u2019s intent, and would have brought about the result of immediately undermining the purpose of the irrevocable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Beyond the language of Item Tenth authorizing the alteration, revocation, or amendment of the irrevocable trust, we discern no language in the irrevocable trust that would even remotely suggest that Vito intended to permit 75% of the beneficiaries to divest the remaining beneficiary. Notably, Amendment V, by having amended only Item Sixth of the irrevocable trust, and not having amended the preamble and other provisions of the irrevocable trust, creates an instrument that is internally inconsistent. The preamble explicitly provides that the named beneficiaries, including Candace, are to share equally in the benefits of the irrevocable trust. At oral argument, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Amendment V changed only the terms of Item Sixth and had no effect on the preamble. Thus, were we to assume that Vito intended to permit 75% of the beneficiaries to amend the irrevocable trust divest another beneficiary\u2014which we do not\u2014without altering the preamble, the amendment to Item Sixth would directly contradict the preamble and other por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tions of the irrevocable trust, such as Item Eighth. In short, Amendment V, in amending only Item Sixth, did not effectively alter the irrevocable trust to divest Candace, as the preamble still provides that Candace, like the other three beneficiaries, is to share equally in the benefits of the trust, and Item Eighth continues to provide that, in the event of the death of any of Vito\u2019s children before the trust terminates, the beneficial interest will pass to that child\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Similarly, we observe that Amendment V also produces the unacceptable result of rendering the 75% amendment provision of Item Tenth illogical. Item Tenth does not require unanimity for alterations, amendments, or revocations of the terms of the irrevocable trust, but rather provides that such changes would require approval of at least 75% of the beneficiaries. By reducing the number of beneficiaries to three, Amendment V made it impossible to amend the irrevocable trust without unanimity because, without Candace as a beneficiary, only three beneficiaries remain, and it is mathematically impossible to have an exact 75% majority of three people. Indeed, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s counsel conceded as much at oral argument. At oral argument, upon a question from the Court, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Item Tenth now requires unanimity of the beneficiaries to amend the irrevocable trust. As with the failure to amend the preamble, Amendment V pertained only to Item Sixth, not Item Tenth, and, as a result, now renders Item Tenth\u2019s 75% amendment provision unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Indisputably, this case\u2019s circumstances are similar to those of Childs, 313 Md. 243, 545 A.2d 43. As in Childs, id. at 245-46, 545 A.2d at 44-45, at issue is the extent of the authority that a maker of an instrument intended to give a beneficiary. In Childs, id. at 244-47, 247, 545 A.2d at 44-45, the parties, who were siblings and beneficiaries to a will, disagreed as to whether a beneficiary had the authority to gift the family home where sale of the home was intended to benefit all of the sibling beneficiaries. In this case, the parties disagree as to the scope of the beneficiaries\u2019 authority to modify the irrevocable trust. Namely, Item Tenth does not expressly set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>whether it provides three of the beneficiaries with the authority to divest a fourth beneficiary. As explained above, we must consider the language of the irrevocable trust in its entirety to ascertain Vito\u2019s intent. We conclude that Vito\u2019s clear intent to benefit his four children equally cannot be reconciled with an interpretation of the irrevocable trust that would permit three of the beneficiaries to divest the fourth beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">At oral argument, Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s counsel discussed the \u201cobjective rule of contraed\u201d Maryland case law prescribes an objective interpretation of contracts, while case law pertaining to the interpretation of wills\u2014and, by extension, trust agreements\u2014directs that the goal is to effectuate the settlor\u2019s intent, as gleaned from the entire trust agreement. As evident from the relevant case law, the interpretation of a will is guided first and foremost by the testator\u2019s intent. This approach, which applies equally to interpretation of trust agreements, differs notably from case law governing the interpretation of contracts. Indeed, when interpreting a contract, we have adopted an objective approach in which the court must \u201cdetermine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated.\u201d Spacesaver Sys., Inc., v. Adam, 440 Md. 1, 8, 98 A.3d 264, 268 (2014) (citation omitted). Thus, we have explained that, when interpreting the terms of a contract, the subjective intent of the parties is not controlling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give away to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Id. at 8, 98 A.3d at 268-69 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Maryland case law regarding the interpretation of contracts differs from case law pertaining to the interpretation of wills and trusts, where ascertaining the testator\u2019s or settlor\u2019s \u201c[i]n-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>tention is primary and paramount.\u201d Marty, 209 Md. at 216, 120 A.2d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We are not persuaded by Michael\u2019s and Judith\u2019s contention that the irrevocable trust\u2019s reference to both the lowercase term \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d and the capitalized term \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d allegedly differentiates between the defined group of four \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d and an undefined group of potential other \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d and evinces an unspoken presumption by Vito that the designated beneficiaries might change over time. Although the preamble defines \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d as Vito\u2019s four children, throughout the trust instrument the four children are also referred to as \u201cbeneficiaries[.]\u201d As Candace correctly points out, the capitalized term \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d is not used in the irrevocable trust with the exception of one reference in the preamble. The subsequent use of \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d appears to be nothing more than a typographical oversight or the use of the lowercase version of the word to which Vito attached no significance, rather than an intentional distinction between people who could benefit from the trust. Indeed, it would be nonsensical for Vito to define \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d once in the document and then never use the word again.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On brief, Michael and Judith mischaracterize the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis by arguing, in a single sentence without elaboration or discussion, that it incorrectly applied the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>which is \u201c[a] canon of construction holding that to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative.\u201d <em>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); see also Breslin v. Powell, 421 Md. 266, 287-88, 26 A.3d 878, 891 (2011) (\u201c[CJourts may consider with caution the can[ jon of [statutory] construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>meaning to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative[.]\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). We do not discern that the Court of Special Appeals based its decision\u2014\u201cthat a broadly worded power to amend in an irrevocable trust instrument cannot be used by a majority of beneficiaries to divest a minority beneficiary of her interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the trust when doing so would be contrary to the settlor\u2019s intent in creating the trust\u201d\u2014solely on Item Tenth\u2019s lack of a reference to removing a beneficiary. Grueff, 229 Md.App. at 356, 145 A.3d at 87. Rather, the Court of Special Appeals specifically noted that the language of Item Tenth had to be considered in the context of the entire trust instrument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae9\">Item TENTH of the Irrevocable Trust is a generally worded power. It allows the \u201cAgreement\u201d to \u201cbe revoked, altered or amended from time to time by an instrument in writing, signed by the holders of not less than seventy-five (75%) interest\u201d in the trust, and delivered to the Trustee. Read broadly, the \u201calter and amend\u201d language in Item TENTH would seem to give the holders of a 75% beneficial interest in the trust the power to make <em>any </em>change to the trust instrument, including, as Michael and Judith argue, to eliminate the beneficial interest of the 25% beneficiary and allocate it among the remaining beneficiaries. Item TENTH does not specify that that can be done, however, and therefore we must look to the entire trust instrument to determine whether such a reading of Item TENTH is consistent with [Vitoj\u2019s intention as the Settlor of the trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Id. at 371, 145 A.3d at 96-97 (emphasis in original). The Court of Special Appeals properly considered the entire trust instrument to ascertain Vito\u2019s intent. We detect no misapplication of the principle of <em>expressio unius est exelusio alterius </em>in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Michael and Judith also contend that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cimplicitly applied]\u201d the Maryland Trust Act in reaching its decision. We observe, however, that the Court of Special Appeals mentioned the Maryland Trust Act once in the body of its opinion in reference to a potential future claim brought by Candace regarding the revocable trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">In this opinion, we have reviewed the rulings that were made in the circumstances that they were made; specifically, with respect to the Revocable Trust, that [Vito] was alive. [Vitoj\u2019s death rendered the Revocable Trust irrevocable. Whether, post [Vitoj\u2019s death, Candace is in a position to bring claims against Mary and Brennan for alleged breach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>es of the duties they owed [Vito] as the Settlor is a question not before us. We note that any such claim would be governed by the Maryland Trust Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Grueff, 229 Md.App. at 383, 145 A.3d at 103-04 (citations and footnote omitted). Earlier in the opinion, in a footnote, the Court of Special Appeals explicitly stated that the Maryland Trust Act did not apply to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">We read [the language regarding the effective date of the Maryland Trust Act] to mean that the Act was not controlling when the circuit court made its ruling concerning the trusts in this case. Clearly, if the Act had controlled when the Irrevocable Trust was amended to eliminate Candace\u2019s beneficial interest, the amendment would not have survived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXN\">Id. at 368 n.7, 145 A.3d at 94 n.7. Plainly, the Court of Special Appeals did not base its decision on the Maryland Trust Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In addition to contending that Amendment V contravened Vito\u2019s clearly stated intention, in her brief and at oral argument, Candace contended that Amendment V violated well-established Maryland law regarding the testamentary power of appointment. We agree. As to distribution and disposal of testamentary property, Maryland\u2019s case law concerning power of appointment constrains a beneficiary\u2019s power to appoint to himself or herself the property of a testamentary estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">The Maryland law on powers of testamentary appointment is unusual if not unique. A power to appoint or dispose of property by will, unrestricted as to beneficiaries, as for example, \u2018in such manner as she may see fit\u2019 <em>(Balls v. Dampman, </em>69 Md. 390, 391, 16 A. 16, 17 [ (1888) ]) or \u2018to such person or persons as she may limit, nominate, and appoint\u2019 <em>(Lamkin v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>192 Md. 472, 475, 64 A.2d 704, 705 [ (1949) ]), is called in Maryland a general power, as it is in most jurisdictions, but unlike most jurisdictions, Maryland holds that such a power does not authorize the holder of the power to appoint to him[- or her]self, to his [or her] own estate or to his [or her] creditors unless the power in terms so authorizes (with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>exception that where the donee and donor of the power are the same person, an appointment may be made to a creditor, <em>Wyeth v. Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>176 Md. 369, 4 A.2d 753 [ (1939) ]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Frank v. Frank, 253 Md. 413, 415, 253 A.2d 377, 379 (1969). Thus, in Maryland, beneficiaries may appoint testamentary property to themselves or for their benefit only where the instrument specifically grants the beneficiaries this authority. See Bryan v. United States, 286 Md. 176, 179, 406 A.2d 423, 425 (1979) (\u201cSince 1888, we have consistently adhered to the view that the donee of a testamentary power otherwise general may not direct property subject to the power to his [or her] own use, absent a specific enabling grant of this authority.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Under Maryland\u2019s common law, any amendment granting a majority of beneficiaries the power to apportion to themselves a larger share of a trust than that to which they were originally entitled would have to be explicitly stated in the original trust instrument. In this case, the irrevocable trust did not contain such a provision; yet, with Amendment V Michael, Judith, and Timothy increased each of their own shares of the benefits of the trust from 25% to 33 1/3%. Thus, by executing Amendment V, Michael, Judith, and Timothy impermissibly granted to themselves a greater apportionment of the trust property than Vito intended. As they lacked the explicit appointment power to do so, this action was prohibited under Maryland case law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In sum, we hold that Item Tenth of the irrevocable trust does not authorize 75% of the beneficiaries to remove the remaining beneficiary. Our holding is grounded in the well-established principle that the settlor\u2019s intent controls the disposition of the trust property. In this case, Vito\u2019s intent that the irrevocable trust benefit his four children equally is clearly demonstrated in the trust instrument and, as such, the divestment of Candace by Michael, Judith, and Timothy was plainly inconsistent with Vito\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
