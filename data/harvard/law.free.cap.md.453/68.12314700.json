Petitioner Jayson Amster seeks access to a lease between Respondent Calvert Tract, LLC (\u201cCalvert Tract\u201d) and the grocery store Whole Foods, which was voluntarily provided to Respondent Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe County\u201d) while Calvert Tract\u2019s zoning application was pending. This case presents the question of how a trial court should determine whether portions of a public document fall within the confidential commercial information exemption to the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cthe MPIA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Calvert Tract owns about 36 acres of land in northern Prince George\u2019s County, near the intersection of U.S. 1 and Maryland Route 410. In October 2011, Calvert Tract submitted a zoning application to the Prince George\u2019s Planning Board of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cthe Planning Board\u201d) seeking to use the land for a mixed-use town center. Around the same time, Calvert Tract entered into a lease with Whole Foods for a grocery store to \u201canchor[ ]\u201d the new development. Calvert Tract voluntarily provided a redacted version of the lease to Prince George\u2019s County Executive Rushern L. Baker \u201cas part of the ongoing discussions of the development of the property.\u201d The Planning Board approved Calvert Tract\u2019s zoning application, which was then sent to the District Council for further review. The District Council approved the application in the summer of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In April 2012, Petitioner filed an MPIA request with Baker seeking access to the lease between Whole Foods and Calvert Tract. The Prince George\u2019s County Office of Law denied Petitioner\u2019s request, explaining that the lease was not subject to MPIA disclosure. In July 2012, Petitioner filed a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>against Baker in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County-seeking access to the lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Petitioner alleged that proponents of Calvert Tract\u2019s zoning application referenced deadlines in the Whole Foods lease to urge the District Council to expedite the application process. He sought access to the lease, in part, to validate this information. Attached to his complaint, Petitioner included a letter from Baker to a citizen of the County, Kate Kelly, who had inquired about the zoning application. The letter indicated that Calvert Tract\u2019s lease with Whole Foods influenced Baker\u2019s decision to support its zoning application. Baker explained, \u201cI strongly believe that attracting retailers of the quality of Whole Foods is important to our County.\u201d He concluded, \u201cI am persuaded that the dialogue should be focused on how we ensure that this is a development that the community can support and how we can improve upon what has been proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The court granted Calvert Tract\u2019s motion to intervene as a defendant, and both Calvert Tract and Baker filed motions for summary judgment arguing that the lease was exempt from disclosure as confidential commercial information. Calvert Tract also filed an affidavit from its employee, Jane Cafritz, in which she stated that: (1) the Whole Foods lease was \u201cthe product of extensive confidential negotiations\u201d between Calvert Tract and Whole Foods; (2) Calvert Tract provided a redacted copy of the lease to the County; (3) Calvert Tract \u201cdid not intend for the lease to become publicly available\u201d; (4) \u201cCalvert [Tract] does not customarily publicly disclose its commercial leases\u201d; (5) \u201c[n]either Calvert [Tract] nor Whole Foods has made the lease available to the general public\u201d; and (6) \u201c[disclosure of the Whole Foods lease would place Calvert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>[Tract] at a disadvantage when negotiating future commercial leases for the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Petitioner filed a motion opposing summary judgment and attached an affidavit from Kelly in which she testified that the project manager for the new development announced at a public meeting that the Whole Foods lease requires \u201cgrading [to] begin by August 2013\u201d and that the store \u201cmust open by February 2015.\u201d Petitioner argued that the County could not \u201crefuse to release to [Petitioner] what has already been made public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">At the summary judgment hearing, the trial court applied the test established in <em>Critical Mass Energy Project v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>975 F.2d 871 (D.C. Cir. 1992), to determine what constitutes confidential commercial information under the federal Freedom of Information Act (\u201cthe FOIA\u201d). It concluded that the lease was confidential commercial information and granted summary judgment. The court also substituted the County in as a defendant, dismissing the suit against Baker as an individual.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider the judgment and attached his own affidavit, which stated that he heard the Whole Foods CEO reveal on the radio a lease term for a store in Detroit. The trial court denied the motion. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on the <em>Critical Mass </em>test. <em>Amster v. Baker, </em>229 Md.App. 209, 228, 145 A.3d 1 (2016). The intermediate appellate court further held that the public release of certain information within the lease did not waive the confidential commercial information exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 145 A.3d 1. The court explained that the contents disclosed \u201cconstituted a \u2018small portion\u2019 of the lease, not the detailed, technical, or specific information that appellant was requesting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 145 A.3d 1 (quoting <em>Bowen v. U.S. Food &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>Drug Admin., </em>925 F.2d 1225, 1228 (9th Cir. 1991)). Additionally, the court stated that because the information was disclosed by Calvert Tract, and not by the County, the release cannot limit the County\u2019s ability to invoke the confidential commercial information exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 232, 145 A.3d 1. Lastly, the court concluded that MPIA disclosure of any severable portions of the lease was not appropriate because it might deter individuals from voluntarily providing commercial information to the government. <em>Id. </em>at 238-41, 145 A.3d 1. Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following question:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOo\">Did the trial court err in entering summary judgment on the grounds that the Whole Foods lease was protected from disclosure under the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Because we answer this question in the affirmative, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Petitioner appeals from the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his MPIA request. We have yet to enunciate a standard of review for summary judgment granted in MPIA cases. Under the FOIA, federal circuit courts are split on this question. Recognizing that trial courts often make factual determinations at the summary judgment stage in FOIA cases, some federal circuit courts limit their review to \u201cwhether (1) the district court had an adequate factual basis for the decision rendered and (2) whether upon this basis the decision reached is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Bowers v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>930 F.2d 350, 353 (4th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted); <em>see also Rubman v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>800 F.3d 381, 388 (7th Cir. 2015); <em>Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, Local Union No. 19 v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>135 F.3d 891, 896 (3d Cir. 1998). Others adhere to the traditional standard of review for summary judgment and review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See, e.g., Animal Legal Def. Fund v. U.S. Food &amp; Drug Admin., </em>836 F.3d 987, 988-89 (9th Cir. 2016); <em>Bloomberg, L.P. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>601 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir. 2010); <em>Juarez v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>518 F.3d 54, 58 (D.C. Cir. 2008); <em>Missouri ex rel. Garstang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>297 F.3d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently departed from its past decisions applying the limited two-step review in favor of the traditional <em>de novo </em>approach. The court explained, \u201cBy definition, summary judgment may be granted only when there are no disputed issues of material fact, and thus no factfinding by the district court. Thus, where the district court has made a factual determination, summary judgment cannot be appropriate.\u201d <em>Animal Legal Def. Fund, </em>836 F.3d at 989-90 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We agree. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Respondents without deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Petitioner argues that the trial court (1) erred in adopting the <em>Critical Mass </em>test to determine whether the Whole Foods lease is protected from disclosure by the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption and (2) failed to gather sufficient information about the contents of the lease to make a determination as to whether the entire document falls within the exemption. Respondents contend that the trial court properly applied the <em>Critical Mass </em>test, and that there is no dispute of material fact as to whether the lease falls within the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The MPIA provides that \u201c[a]ll persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>official acts of public officials and employees.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-103(a) of the General Provisions Article (\u201cGP\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To effectuate this right, the Act allows individuals to inspect any public record, subject to various exemptions. GP \u00a7 4-201 (a). The MPIA defines a \u201cpublic record,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cthe original or any copy of any documentary material that: (i) is made by a unit or an instrumentality of the State or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business.\u201d GP \u00a7 4-101(h)(l)(i). We have repeatedly explained that \u201cthe provisions of the [MPIA] reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Md. State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>480 Md. 179, 190, 59 A.3d 1037 (2013) (quoting <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 81, 721 A.2d 196 (1998)); <em>see also Ireland v. Shearin, </em>417 Md. 401, 408, 10 A.3d 754 (2010); <em>Hammen v. Balt. Cty. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>373 Md. 440, 456, 818 A.2d 1125 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Under the MPIA, government entities are required to allow inspection of public records unless the law deems them \u201cprivileged or confidential\u201d or the inspection would be contrary to state or federal law. GP \u00a7 4-301. The MPIA also specifically provides numerous exemptions from disclosure. Some of these exemptions are mandatory\u2014they require the agency to withhold the protected records. GP \u00a7 4-304; GP \u00a7 4-328. Others are discretionary\u2014the agency can decide whether it would be \u201ccontrary to the public interest\u201d to disclose the requested records. GP \u00a7 4-343.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Within these two broad categories, some records are protected in their entirety\u2014no portion of them may be disclosed. GP \u00a7 4-304. This includes adoption records, hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>records, and welfare records. GP \u00a7\u00a7 4-805-307. Other provisions exempt specific pieces of information and direct public officials to \u201cdeny inspection of [the] part of a public record\u201d that contains such information. GP \u00a7 4-328; <em>see also </em>GP \u00a7 4-343. Documents that contain information that falls within these provisions may be disclosed in a redacted form, as tong-as the specific pieces of exempted information remain protected. <em>See Fioretti v. Md. State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 87, 716 A.2d 258 (1998) (explaining that part of an alleged investigatory file compiled for law enforcement purposes could be disclosed in a redacted form).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The exemption at play in this case is a mandatory exemption that protects specific pieces of information. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9U\">A custodian shall deny inspection of the part of a public record that contains any of the following information provided by or obtained from any person or governmental unit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">(1) a trade secret;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">(2) confidential commercial information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">(3) confidential financial information; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">(4) confidential geological or geophysical information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">GP \u00a7 4-335 (emphasis added). The MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption\u2014GP \u00a7 4-335(2)\u2014is similar to a FOIA exemption. The POIA provides that its disclosure requirements do not apply to \u201cmatters\u201d that are \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and [that is] privileged or confidential.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">This case provides our first opportunity to interpret the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption in the context of information provided to the government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The FOIA\u2019s parallel exemption, however, has been reviewed extensively in this context by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Circuit. <em>See Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 872 (collecting cases). In <em>National Parks and Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Morton, </em>498 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1974), the D.C. Circuit established a two-part test for determining whether commercial information is \u201cconfidential\u201d and thus protected by the exemption. The court reasoned that the confidential commercial information exemption \u201cis intended to encourage individuals to provide certain kinds of confidential information to the [government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the court defined commercial matter as \u201cconfidential\u201d if disclosure of the information is likely either: \u201c(1) to impair the [government\u2019s ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or (2) to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770 (footnote omitted). Applying the test to the case before it, the court reasoned that because the requested documents\u2014records of concessions operations in national parks\u2014were supplied to the government pursuant to statute, there was no risk that disclosure would prevent the government from obtaining the information in the future. <em>Id. </em>It then remanded for further findings on the competitive harm of disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 770-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In <em>Critical Mass, </em>the D.C. Circuit again addressed the FOIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption, but this time regarding information that had been voluntarily provided to the government. A public interest organization sought access to operations reports provided to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, a nonprofit corporation consisting of nuclear power plant operators. <em>Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 874. The court distinguished the case from <em>National Parks, </em>in which the government had compelled the information at issue. It reasoned that when information is given to the government voluntarily, there are different government interests at stake. <em>Id. </em>at 878. Thus, it set forth a new test for determining what constitutes \u201cconfidential\u201d commercial information when the information is freely volunteered to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">First, the court acknowledged that \u201cwhen information is obtained under duress, the [gjovernment\u2019s interest is in ensur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ing its continued reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When evaluating whether such information should be disclosed under the FOIA, \u201cthe governmental impact inquiry will focus on the possible effect of disclosure on its quality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, \u201cwhen that information is volunteered, the [government's interest is in ensuring its continued availability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It explained that if confidential information voluntarily provided to the government is disclosed, \u201cthe persons whose confidences have been betrayed will, in all likelihood, refuse further cooperation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court declined to use <em>National Park\u2019s </em>two-part test. Instead, it adopted language from a Senate Report explaining the purpose of the exemption and held that information voluntarily provided to the government is \u201cconfidential\u201d if it \u201cwould customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 873, 879 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Test for Confidentiality</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We have recognized that the MPIA \u201cwas to some extent modeled after the [FOIA], and the purpose of the MPIA is virtually identical to that of the FOIA.\u201d <em>Immanuel v. Comptroller of Md., </em>449 Md. 76, 89, 141 A.3d 181 (2016) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when interpreting the MPIA, we generally give significant weight to the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of similar FOIA provisions. <em>Id.; see also Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Cty., </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880 (1984). But here, Petitioner contends that the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption is different from the FOIA\u2019s, and therefore we should not apply the D.C. Circuit\u2019s <em>Critical Mass </em>test. He argues that the FOIA exemption applies to entire documents, rather than information within those documents. Thus, he contends, we should direct the trial court to determine what constitutes confidential commercial information without consideration of whether the information is customarily released to the public. Petitioner\u2019s reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The FOIA\u2019s exemption for confidential commercial information applies to \u201cmatters\u201d that fall within that category. 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>U.S.G. \u00a7 552(b). It does not apply to entire documents. Indeed, at the end of the section listing the FOIA\u2019s exemptions, the statute explains that \u201c[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The protected information should simply be redacted. Additionally, the D.C. Circuit has explained, \u201cThe focus of the FOIA is information, not documents, and an agency cannot justify withholding an entire document simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.\u201d <em>Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>566 F.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (emphasis added). Even when an agency has established that a document contains protected information, \u201cit must nonetheless disclose all reasonably segregable, nonexempt portions of the requested record(s).\u201d <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>802 F.Supp.2d 185, 206 (D.D.C. 2011) (citation omitted). Thus, both the MPIA and the FOIA only protect the specific confidential commercial information within a requested document. Neither Act protects the entirety of any document that contains such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The <em>Critical Mass </em>test has been widely accepted by other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Perez, </em>835 F.3d 1223, 1231 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cThe first step in an Exemption Four [confidentiality] analysis is determining whether the information submitted to the government agency was given voluntarily or involuntarily.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Contract Freighters, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y of U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>260 F.3d 858, 862 (8th Cir. 2001) (addressing FOIA request for information compelled by the government, but noting <em>Critical Mass </em>test for information voluntarily provided); <em>Cozen O\u2019Connor v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>570 F.Supp.2d 749, 777 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (\u201cFor purposes of Exemption 4, the test of confidentiality differs depending upon whether the information was required by, or was voluntarily provided to, the agency.\u201d (citing <em>Critical </em>Mass)); <em>Sun-Sentinel Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>431 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1275 (S.D. Fla. 2006), <em>aff'd sub nom. News-Press v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>489 F.3d 1173 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that both parties agree that <em>Critical Mass </em>would apply if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>information was voluntarily provided to the government); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. U.S. EEOC, </em>922 F.Supp. 235, 242 (E.D. Mo. 1996) (holding that information was voluntarily provided to the government, which mandated the <em>Critical Mass </em>test); <em>Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Ctr. Auth., </em>774 A.2d 40, 47 (R.I. 2001) (adopting the <em>Critical Mass </em>test).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We note that the Office of the Maryland Attorney General has directed state agencies to interpret the confidential commercial information exemption using <em>Critical Mass </em>since it was decided. <em>See </em>Office of the Md. Attorney Gen., Maryland Public Information Act Manual 3-23 (14th ed. 2015); Office of the Md. Attorney Gen., Public Information Act Manual 14 (6th ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Upon consideration of its widespread approval, we agree that the <em>Critical Mass </em>test properly balances the need to protect confidential information voluntarily provided to the government with the public interest in disclosure\u2014under both the FOIA and the MPIA. <em>See Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 878-79. Accordingly, we adopt the <em>Critical Mass </em>test for determining what information is \u201cconfidential\u201d under the MPIA exemption. Thus, we hold that commercial information is \u201cconfidential\u201d\u2014and therefore exempt from MPIA disclosure\u2014if it \u201cwould customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.\u201d <em>Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Necessary Factual Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Petitioner argues that even if <em>Critical Mass </em>applies, the trial court did not conduct a thorough enough inquiry to determine whether all aspects of the lease are \u201cconfidential.\u201d He claims that the trial court should have reviewed the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>in camera </em>or requested an index detailing its provisions. Respondents argue that the trial court properly applied the <em>Critical Mass </em>test. They contend that there is no dispute of material fact as to whether the lease is confidential, and therefore the court properly granted summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They claim that the trial court was not required to conduct a more detailed inquiry into the contents of the lease, and it properly exercised its discretion in declining to do so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree with Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\n<em>Cranford</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We conducted an in-depth analysis of a trial court\u2019s responsibility to examine public records potentially exempted from MPIA disclosure in <em>Cranford v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 481 A.2d 221 (1984). In that case, a newspaper sought access to documents regarding the construction of a courthouse and government executive office building in Montgomery County. <em>Id. </em>at 762, 481 A.2d 221. The County withheld certain documents from disclosure under various exemptions to the MPIA, including the confidential commercial information exemption. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66, 481 A.2d 221. For some of the documents, the County provided general descriptions of their contents and stated which exemption applied. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 481 A.2d 221. In evaluating whether this was sufficient, we explained that \u201c[t]he custodian who withholds public documents carries the burden of justifying nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771, 481 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>A.2d 221 (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>GP \u00a7 4-362(b)(2)(i) (providing that the defendant \u201chas the burden of sustaining a decision ... to deny inspection of a public record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In <em>Cranford, </em>we provided two options for trial courts to evaluate whether a custodian has carried its burden to prove that the requested information falls within an MPIA exemption: (1) conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the public records;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or (2) direct the custodian to provide \u201ca sufficiently detailed description and explanation to enable the trial court to rule whether a given document, or portion thereof, is exempt.\u201d 300 Md. at 777-80, 481 A.2d 221. Although we acknowledged that public records should not be \u201croutinely dumped\u201d on trial courts for <em>in camera </em>review, we explained that in the absence of such review, the trial court should direct the custodian \u201cto furnish such further affidavits, indices, tables, summaries, and cross references as the trial judge believes will be of help.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 779-80, 481 A.2d 221. But when the custodian cannot provide a detailed description of the requested documents without revealing confidential information, \u201cthere is strong reason for conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780, 481 A.2d 221. \u201cBecause generalities and conclusory testimony that one or more exemptions apply do not satisfy the burden to explain the withholding of documents,\u201d in <em>Cranford </em>we remanded the case for the trial court to conduct further factual inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 781, 481 A.2d 221; <em>see also Univ. Sys. of Md. v. Balt. Sun Co., </em>381 Md. 79, 106-07, 847 A.2d 427 (2004) (remanding for trial court to conduct <em>in camera </em>review of documents requested under the MPIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Vaughn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The D.C. Circuit has also addressed the question of how a trial court should collect sufficient information about a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>record to make a determination as to confidentiality. In <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), which we discussed in <em>Cranford, </em>the court addressed the Civil Service Commission\u2019s claim that requested documents fell within various exemptions from the FOIA. <em>Id. </em>at 821-22. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the agency because it had only provided a single affidavit that \u201cdid not illuminate or reveal the contents of the information sought, but rather set forth in conclusory terms the [agency\u2019s] opinion that the evaluations were not subject to disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 823. Acknowledging that the \u201clack of knowledge by the party seeking disclosure seriously distorts the traditional adversary nature\u201d of our courts, the appellate court proposed that the agency \u201csubdivide the document under consideration into manageable parts cross-referenced to the relevant portion of the [g]overnment\u2019s justification\u201d for withholding the information. <em>Id. </em>at 824, 827. This is now known as a <em>Vaughn </em>index, and it is commonly used to justify the withholding of public documents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Office of State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, Inc., </em>356 Md. 118, 121 n.1, 737 A.2d 592 (1999); <em>Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 778-79, 481 A.2d 221 (collecting federal cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">When a <em>Vaughn </em>index or agency affidavits are \u201cinsufficiently detailed to permit meaningful review of exemption claims,\u201d the D.C. Circuit has \u201crepeatedly noted that <em>in camera </em>review may be particularly appropriate.\u201d <em>Qui\u00f1on v. FBI, </em>86 F.3d 1222, 1228 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (collecting cases); <em>see also Carter v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>830 F.2d 388, 392-93 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In determining whether to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review, the trial court should consider the length of the requested documents, and whether the government\u2019s affidavits \u201cmerely parrot the language of the [exemption].\u201d <em>Allen v. Cent. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Intelligence Agency, </em>636 F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <em>overruled on other grounds by Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. Smith, </em>721 F.2d 828 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Federal courts have emphasized, however, that \u201cdue to the <em>ex parte </em>nature of the process and the potential burden placed on the court\u201d <em>in camera </em>review \u201cshould not be resorted to lightly.\u201d <em>Lane v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>523 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted); <em>see, e.g., Kortlander v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., </em>816 F.Supp.2d 1001, 1009 (D. Mont. 2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>Application of </em>Cranford <em>and </em>Vaughn</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Here, the trial court failed to either direct the custodian to provide a <em>Vaughn </em>index or conduct an <em>in camera </em>review to determine whether the lease contained nonconfidential information subject to disclosure. The only information provided to the trial judge regarding the contents of the lease was an affidavit from Jane Cafritz, a Calvert Tract employee, which stated that the lease \u201cwas the product of extensive confidential negotiations between Calvert [Tract] and Whole Foods,\u201d and that, \u201cCalvert [Tract] does not customarily publicly disclose its commercial leases.\u201d Like the \u201cgeneralities\u201d we rejected in <em>Cranford, </em>this is not a sufficient description for the trial court to determine that all of the information within the lease falls within the confidential commercial information exemption. It is merely \u201cconclusory testimony\u201d that does not carry the County\u2019s burden to justify nondisclosure. <em>See Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 781, 481 A.2d 221. Furthermore, although the exact length of the lease at issue is unknown, it is a single document that the trial court could presumably review <em>in camera </em>without an unreasonable exertion of judicial resources. <em>See Church of Scientology of California v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>611 F.2d 738, 743 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>overruled on other grounds by Animal Legal Def. Fund, </em>836 F.3d 987 (affirming the trial court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review in part due to the \u201csmall number of documents requested, and their relative brevity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Respondents also argue that if the trial court relies on an <em>in camera </em>review, it may disclose confidential commercial infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>mation by accident. They contend that the judge may not know what constitutes confidential information within the lease.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But the burden is on the County to explain to the trial court what information within the lease is exempt from disclosure. The court should not be put in a position where it has to guess. As we explained in <em>Cranford, </em>the County can provide descriptions, affidavits, a <em>Vaughn </em>index, or other materials to aid the court in teasing apart the confidential and nonconfiden-tial information if it is concerned the judge will not be able to accurately do so otherwise. Indeed, if the County provides sufficiently detailed information about the contents of the lease, the trial court may find <em>in camera </em>review unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Lastly, Respondents argue that the disclosure of information within the lease would discourage others from voluntarily providing commercial information to the government. But the <em>Critical Mass </em>test addresses precisely this point. By asking whether the source of the information would \u201ccustomarily\u201d disclose it, the test seeks to protect the same information that the source would otherwise keep confidential. <em>Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 879. In adopting the <em>Critical Mass </em>test, we find that it properly balances the public interest in access to government records with the government interest in \u201cencouraging cooperation ... by persons having information useful to officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878 (quoting <em>National Parks, </em>498 F.2d at 768). Here, Respondents have not met their burden of showing that this lease is protected in its entirety from disclosure because they have not demonstrated that Calvert Tract would not \u201ccustomarily\u201d disclose any of its contents. For this reason, summary judgment should not have been granted in favor of Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Although reaching this conclusion could end our discussion, we will examine one further issue at Petitioner\u2019s request because it will be helpful to the Circuit Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Public Disclosure of Lease Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Petitioner argues that Calvert Tract has already disclosed certain information within the lease to the public, making that information ineligible for the confidential commercial information exemption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals held that the public release of information within the lease did not affect the MPIA analysis because the information was revealed by Calvert Tract\u2014not the government custodian. <em>Amster, </em>229 Md.App. at 232, 145 A.3d 1. Petitioner argues that this holding \u201ccreate[s] an insurmountable burden on citizen[s\u2019] access to alleged commercial information.\u201d As indicated, we address this argument to provide guidance to the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We have yet to face the question of whether the government can deny access to a public record under an MPIA exemption when the information has already been publicly disclosed. Interpreting the FOIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption, the D.C. Circuit has held, \u201cTo the extent that any data requested under [the] FOIA are in the public domain, the submitter is unable to make any claim to confidentiality\u2014a <em>sine qua non </em>of [the exemption].\u201d <em>CNA Fin. Corp. v. Donovan, </em>830 F.2d 1132, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 977, 108 S.Ct. 1270, 99 L.Ed.2d 481 (1988). Indeed, when a source of commercial information has already revealed it to the public, it can hardly be said that the information \u201cwould customarily not be released to the public by the person from whom it was obtained.\u201d <em>Critical Mass, </em>975 F.2d at 879; <em>see also Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat\u2019l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., </em>93 F.Supp.2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. 2000) (analyzing whether the information has in fact been released to the public in determining whether source \u201ccustomarily\u201d does so). Thus, such information should not be withheld under the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We hold that the trial court applied the correct test\u2014 <em>Critical </em>Mass\u2014to determine whether commercial information is \u201cconfidential\u201d under the MPIA\u2019s confidential commercial information exemption. Respondents did not carry their burden of proof, however, to demonstrate that the entire Whole Foods lease was confidential. Thus, we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for the judge to direct Respondents to provide a <em>Vaughn </em>index, review the lease <em>in camera, </em>or conduct other proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.
