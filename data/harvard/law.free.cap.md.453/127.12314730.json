(Mr. Parker\u2019s son, who, by that time was five years old), filed survival and wrongful death actions against Appellee William Stevens Hamilton, arising out of the death of Craig Junior Parker. The wrongful death claims were dismissed by the circuit court as time-barred under Maryland Code, \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether the claims were timely depends on the applicability of two provisions\u2014Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that the time period for bringing a wrongful death action that accrues in favor of a minor plaintiff is tolled during the period of minority, and Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">If the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We shall hold that both provisions apply. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 operates to toll a minor plaintiffs wrongful death claims during the period of his or her minority. Thus, the circuit court erred in dismissing the minor Appellant\u2019s wrongful death claims as untimely. Furthermore, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>erred in failing to consider that the time limitation to file a wrongful death action is tolled when the defendant engages in fraudulent conduct that prevents the plaintiffs from bringing a wrongful death action within three years from the date of death, pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203. Appellants\u2019 amended complaint sufficiently pled fraud in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The following facts are alleged in Appellants\u2019 Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">On or about August 22, 2009, Mr. Hamilton shot and killed Mr. Parker. At the time, Mr. Parker was thirty-eight years old, and worked as a farmhand for Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Parker was survived by his mother, Cassandra Parker and his son, Z., born on November 17, 2009\u2014Appellants in this matter. Appellants allege that Mr. Hamilton buried Mr. Parker\u2019s remains in order to conceal his wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">On June 9, 2015, Cassandra Parker (acting individually and as the Personal Representative of the Estate of her son, Mr. Parker) and her minor grandchild, Z. (Mr. Parker\u2019s son), filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County against Mr. Hamilton arising out of the wrongful death of Mr. Parker. Appellants thereafter filed an amended complaint in which they added William Vogel, Jr.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a defendant. The amended complaint included counts of: (1) wrongful death based on negligence, (2) a survival action based on negligence, (3) wrongful death based on gross negligence, (4) a survival action based on gross negligence, (5) wrongful death based on battery, (6) a survival action based on battery, and (7) fraudulent conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Mr. Hamilton filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice, or in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. The circuit court held a motions hearing, after which it issued a written opinion granting the motion to dismiss as to the wrongful death claims, and denying the motion as to the survival claims of Mr. Parker\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied without a hearing. Appellants filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court granted certiorari before the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 consideration of the direct appeal. <em>Parker v. Hamilton, </em>450 Md. 664, 150 A.3d 819 (2016). Appellants\u2019 brief<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> presents three questions for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">I. Did the trial court improperly ignore Md. Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 when it determined that the wrongful death claims of the minor plaintiff were not tolled until the age of majority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">II. Does the trial court\u2019s decision that the minor plaintiffs wrongful death claims were not tolled during his minority violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">III. Did the trial court err when it determined that the defendant\u2019s fraudulent concealment of a murder failed to toll the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death claims under Md. Code, Cts. &lt;&amp; Jud. [Proc.] \u00a7 5-203?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The parties contest the appropriate standard of review. Mr. Hamilton argues that the circuit court granted a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>dismiss, not a motion for summary judgment\u2014and therefore, this Court should not consider evidence outside of the pleadings. In response, Appellants argue that while the circuit court\u2019s order was not clear as to whether it granted a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court referred throughout the opinion to evidence and testimony received at the motions hearing, which was beyond the four corners of the complaint. Appellants assert that by considering evidence outside of the scope of the pleadings in rendering its ruling, the motion to dismiss was converted to one for summary judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(c). During oral argument before this Court, counsel for Mr. Hamilton contended that the circuit court conducted a discrete review of the wrongful death actions, as a motion to dismiss, and only considered evidence outside of the pleadings as it pertained to the remaining causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the section of the circuit court\u2019s opinion entitled <em>\u201cWrongful Death Claims\u2014Condition Precedent^]\u201d </em>the circuit court concluded, \u201cBecause the Complaint was not filed until June 9, 2014, long after the three-year time deadline of August 22, 2012, the wrongful death claims, Counts 1, 8, and 5, must be dismissed.\u201d The dismissal of the wrongful death claims was grounded in (1) the application of the time limitation in the wrongful death statute as a condition precedent and (2) the rejection of Appellants\u2019 argument regarding the retroactivity of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(g), which creates an exception to the condition for wrongful death actions based on criminal homicides. Based on these grounds for dismissal, we determine the review of the wrongful death causes of action was limited to the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We have outlined the applicable standard of review pertaining to dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(b)(2), a trial court must assume the truth of all well-pleaded relevant and material facts in the complaint, as well as all inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom. <em>Stone v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 333, 624 A.2d 496, 498 (1993); <em>Odyniec v. Schneider, </em>322 Md. 520, 525, 588 A.2d 786, 788 (1991). To this end, the facts comprising the cause of action must be pleaded with sufficient specificity. Bald assertions and conclusory statements by the pleader will not suffice. <em>[Cont'l] Masonry Co. v. Verdel Constr. Co., </em>279 Md. 476, 481, 369 A.2d 566, 569 (1977). Further, while the words of a pleading will be given reasonable construction, when a pleading is doubtful and ambiguous, it will be construed most strongly against the pleader in determining its sufficiency. <em>Hixon v. Buchberger, </em>306 Md. 72, 75, 507 A.2d 607, 608 (1986); <em>Read Drug &amp; Chem. Co. v. Colwill Constr. Co., </em>250 Md. 406, 416, 243 A.2d 548, 555 (1968). Dismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff. <em>Morris v. Osmose Wood Preserving, </em>340 Md. 519, 531, 667 A.2d 624, 630 (1995). On appeal, a reviewing court must determine whether the trial court was legally correct, examining solely the sufficiency of the pleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 708-09, 697 A.2d 1371, 1372-73 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Appellants argue that Cts. &lt;&amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 was enacted more than 20 years ago in response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 626 A.2d 353 (1993), and that Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 clearly provides for tolling in a wrongful death case during the period of minority. Appellants further aver that not allowing the action to be tolled until the age of majority would violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as held by this Court in <em>Piselli v. 75th St. Med., </em>371 Md. 188, 808 A.2d 508 (2002). Lastly, Appellants argue that they properly invoked Cts. &lt;&amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203, which tolls the time limit for bringing a wrongful death action when the defendant fraudulently conceals his or her wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In response, Mr. Hamilton argues that the circuit court properly construed Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 as inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>to -wrongful death claims. Mr. Hamilton relies on our ruling in <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 626 A.2d 353 (1993), where we determined the time limit contained in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(g) was a condition precedent to maintaining an action, as opposed to a statute of limitations. Mr. Hamilton opposes Appellants\u2019 proffered interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights as applied to the minor plaintiff. Lastly, Mr. Hamilton proposes that the Appellants did not specifically plead fraud within their complaint, and thus, their -wrongful death claims could not be tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A <em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in its current form provides for tolling of wrongful death claims during the period of minoritg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 states that the time period for bringing a wrongful death action that accrues on behalf of a minor plaintiff is tolled during the period of minority. Subsection (a) of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">(a) When a cause of action subject to a limitation under Subtitle 1 of this title or Title 3, Subtitle 9 of this article accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person shall file his action 4vithin the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">(emphasis added). The history leading up to the current section provides context for the statute\u2019s establishment of a tolling provision for minor wrongful death beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">1. A brief history of wrongful death limitations</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">At common law, a tort victim\u2019s dependents were not entitled to pursue an action for wrongful death. <em>See Walker v. Essex, </em>318 Md. 516, 522, 569 A.2d 645, 648 (1990) (citing W. Page Keeton, <em>et al, Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 127, at 945 (5th ed. 1984)). \u201cThe common law not only denied a tort recovery for injury once the tort victim had died it also refused to recognize any new and independent cause of action in the victim\u2019s dependents or heirs for their own loss at his death.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>318 Md. at 522, 569 A.2d at 648 (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>marks omitted). To remedy this, the English Parliament enacted the Fatal Accidents Act of 1846, otherwise known as Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. <em>Id. </em>Every state has since adopted its own version of a wrongful death statute, Maryland in 1852. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A wrongful death action is brought for the benefit of the surviving family members, to compensate for the losses occasioned by their family member\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">The purpose of the Wrongful Death Act is \u201cto compensate the families of persons killed by the wrongful act, neglect or default of another person.\u201d It gives to the family a \u201cnew cause of action for something for which the deceased person never had, and never could have had the right to sue\u2014that is to say, the injury resulting from his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Binnix v. Johns-Manville Prod. Corp., </em>593 F.Supp. 1180, 1182 (D. Md. 1984) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Stewart v. United Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 341, 343, 65 A. 49, 53 (1906)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Originally, the statute required suit to \u201cbe commenced within 12 calendar months after the death of the deceased person.\u201d <em>Waddell, </em>331 Md. at 56 n. 4, 626 A.2d at 355 n.4 (quoting 1852 Md. Laws Ch. 299). This time limitation, which was eventually codified in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904, was later extended to eighteen months, then in 1959 to two years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In 1971, the General Assembly again amended the statute, extending the time period from two to three years from the date of the decedent\u2019s death. In making this change, the General Assembly stated its intent to treat the time period to file a wrongful death action the same as the time limitations applicable in negligence actions. In the Preamble to the legislation approving the extension of time from two to three years, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">WHEREAS, the General Assembly desires to bring the statute of limitations for wrongful death actions in uniformity with that of other negligence actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">WHEREAS, there is no logical reason for the variance between the time limits for commencement of actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>WHEREAS, citizens may be misled to their detriment by the variance between the respective statutes of limitations resulting in an undue forfeiture of rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Waddell, </em>331 Md. at 56, 626 A.2d at 355 (quoting 1971 Md. Laws Ch. 784).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">2. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In 1993, a case came before this Court in which the plaintiff, who was only three years old at the time of her father\u2019s death, waited until she was twenty years old to file her wrongful death claim. <em>Waddell v. Kirkpatrick, </em>331 Md. 52, 626 A.2d 353 (1993). She argued that her claim was timely even though it was filed more than three years after her father\u2019s death because, pursuant to Cts. &lt;&amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 (which, at the time, did not refer to Title 3, Subtitle 9 of the Courts &lt;&amp; Judicial Proceedings Article),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the time limit for bringing her claim was tolled during her minority. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 626 A.2d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">We discussed the distinction between a statute of limitations and a condition precedent\u2014as a statute of limitations affects only the remedy, not the cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 626 A.2d at 356. Conversely, we looked to our jurisprudence analyzing the effect of a time requirement then prescribed within the wrongful death statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">The [statute] create[s] a new legal liability, with the right to suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within twelve months, and not otherwise. The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone. It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.... Time has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>been made of the essence of the right and the right is lost if the time is disregarded. The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 59, 626 A.2d at 356 (quoting <em>State v. Parks, </em>148 Md. 477, 129 A. 793, 794 (1925)). We thus held that the time period for commencing actions prescribed in the wrongful death statute is a condition precedent, operating as a limitation of both liability and remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Once it has been established that section 3-904(g) is a condition precedent, as opposed to a statute of limitations, it follows inexorably that it does not fit within the prescription of section 5-101. Consequently, section 5-201 does not save a cause of action for wrongful death notwithstanding the disability of the plaintiff at the time the action accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"><em>Waddell, </em>331 Md. at 60, 626 A.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">3. The General Assembly\u2019s amendment of Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in response to <em>Waddell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Waddell, </em>in 1997, the General Assembly added language to Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 that specifically referenced its application to wrongful death actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">(a) When a cause of action subject to a limitation under Subtitle 1 of this title OR TITLE 3, SUBTITLE 9 OF THIS ARTICLE accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person shall file his action within the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">1997 Md. Laws Ch. 318 (emphasis added). By specifically referencing the wrongful death statute within the new version of Cts. &lt;&amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201, the General Assembly amended the statute to provide that the time period to file a wrongful death cause of action is tolled during a plaintiffs minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>This intent is supported by the legislative history contained in the bill file. The Bill Analysis generated by the General Assembly for the Bill states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">Additionally, the bill establishes that when the time period to file wrongful death action accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person must file the action within the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">$ \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">[CJurrent law provides that when a cause of action subject to a statute of limitations accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person has three years after the disability is removed to file the action. Courts have interpreted the time period to file a wrongful death action as a condition precedent and not a statute of limitations. The bill provides the same extension of time to wrongful death actions that is currently provided to other actions with a statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Bill Analysis of H.B. 770 (1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The legislative history of the General Assembly\u2019s 1997 amendment to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 demonstrates that the amendment was intended to address our determination in <em>Waddell </em>that there was no tolling for minor plaintiffs in wrongful death actions. Thus, we hold that Cts. &amp; Jud, Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in its current form provides for tolling during the period of minority. Accordingly, under the version of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in effect here, the minor plaintiff Z.\u2019s wrongful death claims were tolled during the period of his minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Appellants further argue that not allowing for tolling until the age of majority would violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as held by this Court in <em>Piselli v. 75th St. Med., </em>371 Md. 188, 808 A.2d 508 (2002). Because we determined that the plain language of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in its current form provides for tolling of a wrongful death claim during a period of minority, it is not necessary for us to reach the constitutional issue. <em>See, e.g,, Mercy Hospital v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 565, 510 A.2d 562, 566 (1986) (stating that \u201cthis Court\u2019s established policy is to decide constitutional issues only when necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\n<em>B. Appellants\u2019 amended complaint sufficiently pled fraud in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Appellants further argue that the circuit court erred in dismissing their causes of action by failing to consider that the time limitation to file a wrongful death action is tolled when the defendant engages in fraudulent conduct that prevents the plaintiff from bringing a wrongful death claim within three years from the date of death. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Appellants aver that our decision in <em>Geisz v. Greater Balt. Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 545 A.2d 658 (1988) controls this issue and supports the determination that their claims should be tolled. <em>Geisz </em>was a medical negligence case in which the plaintiffs\u2014a wife and son\u2014brought a wrongful death action ten years after the death of a husband and father from cancer. They argued, pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203, that their cause of action was tolled by the defendant physician\u2019s fraudulent conduct in continuing to assure them that he was receiving the best possible care with the most up-to-date technologies. <em>See id. </em>at 309, 321-25, 545 A.2d at 662, 667-70. They claimed that it was not until years later that they discovered the physician\u2019s department was understaffed, underequipped, and failed to properly verify that the radiation treatment he was rendering was working. <em>Id. </em>at 312-13, 545 A.2d at 663-64. In addressing the threshold issue of first impression, this Court held that Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203 applied to wrongful death actions. <em>Id. </em>at 324-25, 545 A.2d at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Mr. Hamilton argues that the Appellants did not sufficiently plead fraud within their complaint in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203. We disagree. In the amended complaint, Appellants pled that (1) on or about August 22, 2009, Mr. Hamilton shot and killed Mr. Parker and (2) Mr. Hamilton buried Mr. Parker\u2019s remains in order to conceal his wrongdoing. We determine that these allegations were sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>reflect Mr. Hamilton\u2019s fraudulent conduct, and facts from which Mr. Hamilton\u2019s fraud can necessarily be implied. <em>See Antigua Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Melba Inv\u2019rs Atl., Inc., </em>307 Md. 700, 735, 517 A.2d 75, 93 (1986) (\u201cGeneral or conclusory allegations of fraud are insufficient. A plaintiff must allege facts which indicate fraud or from which fraud is necessarily implied.\u201d); <em>Parish v. Md. &amp; Va.

Thus, the circuit court erred in dismissing the wrongful death counts, as the amended complaint sufficiently pled fraud in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud.

Furthermore, the Appellants\u2019 amended complaint sufficiently pled fraud in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203. Thus, the circuit court erred in granting Mr. Hamilton\u2019s motion to dismiss the wrongful death counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR DOR-CHESTER COUNTY IS REVERSED.
