Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCRIM. PROC.\u201d). James Patrick Beaman (\u201cAppellant\u201d) seeks review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of the denial by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County of his Petition for Post-conviction DNA Testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A4_Z\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On February 2, 1990, Appellant was charged in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County with four counts of first-degree murder, four counts of using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. After a jury trial between April 18, 1990 and April 21, 1990, the jury convicted Appellant of all counts. On September 13,1990, Appellant was sentenced to four consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole, and four concurrent terms of twenty years. Appellant noted an appeal on September 19, 1991, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Appellant subsequently filed several post-conviction petitions. Appellant filed the instant <em>pro se </em>Petition for DNA Testing of Scientific Evidence in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on August 30, 2012. A hearing on the Petition was held on March 17, 2016. On October 20, 2016, the Circuit Court issued an order denying Appellant\u2019s Petition. On November 2, 2016, Appellant filed a notice of direct appeal to this Court pursuant to \u00a7 S^ORk)\u00ae.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In the early morning hours of November 7, 1989, police responded to the scene of 6439 Hil-Mar Drive, an apartment residence in Prince George\u2019s County, after receiving a call for shots fired. Police found four men\u2014Terrance Stephenson, Edmond Stephenson, Robert Morton, and Abraham Williams\u2014murdered as a result of gunshot wounds. The body of Abraham Williams was found inside the fourth-floor apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ment unit in front of the door. Police discovered a broken window in one of the bedrooms, through which it appeared someone had jumped. Officers found a second body in the hallway of the living room, and a third body in the den area of the apartment. The three men in the apartment each had a gunshot wound to the head. Police found a fourth body, that of Edmond Stephenson, at the side of the apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The State\u2019s theory of the case was that the victims, who were living in the apartment together, were killed by Appellant and Ervin Holton in retaliation for a dispute over turf for narcotic sales. The dispute between Appellant, Holton, and the Stephenson brothers had occurred one week prior to the murders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Investigators recovered blood evidence from the ground-level patio, directly below the fourth-floor apartment\u2019s window, from which, the State believed, the fourth victim had jumped. The State\u2019s theory regarding the murder of the fourth victim, Edmond Stephenson, was that he jumped through the bedroom window to escape and was shot in the buttocks as he did so. The State believed that Edmond Stephenson landed on a balcony where he tried to get into that apartment to evade the shooters. Edmond Stephenson left blood on the ground of the balcony\u2019s patio as well as on a table that was on the balcony\u2019s patio. The State argued that Edmond Stephenson was then \u201cchased, pursued like an injured animal\u201d and ultimately shot to death by either of the two shooters as he ran around the back of the building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">At trial, Doria Rogers testified as an eyewitness. Ms. Rogers and her mother lived in the same apartment complex where the murders took place. Ms. Rogers knew the deceased residents of the apartment. Ms. Rogers testified that loud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>noises \u201clike people was fighting or something\u201d awoke her on the morning of the November 7. She testified that she got up and ran to the balcony and saw \u201ctwo boys running past.\u201d One was light-skinned and wore a white jacket with blue windbreaker pants and was carrying a gun. The other was dark-skinned and wore a black coat. Ms. Rogers described the men as being \u201ctogether.\u201d Ms. Rogers testified that the light-skinned man was in front and the dark-skinned man was behind him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both men were about the same height and the dark-skinned man had a \u201cbig nose and a little bit of hair on his mustache.\u201d Ms. Rogers testified that she watched until the men disappeared from her sight. Once she returned inside the apartment, she heard gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On the day following the murders, Ms. Rogers saw the same two men walking by the apartment building. She testified that the dark-skinned man was wearing the same pants he wore the previous night and the light-skinned man was wearing the same coat he wore the previous night. The police showed Ms. Rogers photographic arrays and she identified Appellant and Ervin Holton as the two men she saw running from the scene the morning of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">At trial, the State conceded that it could not ascertain which of the two suspects shot which victim, but the State argued that Appellant at least bore accomplice liability in all four shootings. Defense counsel explained to the jury during closing arguments Appellant\u2019s theory of misidentification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">[Mr. Ferguson<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] was specifically inquired of as to whether there were one person or two persons who ran behind that building. He said there was one person. This evidence was established primarily through the direct examination of the [Sjtate, but the [Sjtate doesn\u2019t mention this evidence to you, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>and why not? Because if you consider this evidence and you consider the credibility, and you are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses, if you consider the credibility of Mr. Ferguson, who is a middle-aged gentleman who is living across the court who knows none of the people involved here who testified to you directly, looked right at you, told you that that is what he saw, that there were no obstructions, and you consider that evidence together with what Doria Rogers tells you that she saw, you must reach the inescapable conclusion that the second person that she saw from inside of her apartment looking out across the balcony and her limited field of vision, and there is an exhibit which demonstrates that where she was asked to make some marks ... the conclusion is that the dark-skinned person that she saw ahead of the light[-]skinned person was a person who ended up dead at the comer of 6487, Edmond Stephenson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">What she saw in those two seconds was Edmond Stephenson running for his life and a gentleman in a white coat and white hood with a gun she said she saw that individual with a gun chasing after him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As previously stated, the jury found Appellant guilty of all counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Post-conviction Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">In Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>Petition, he sought DNA testing of the blood-evidence found on the first-floor patio. The Circuit Court held a hearing on March 17, 2016 regarding Appellant\u2019s post-conviction petition. At the hearing, Appellant, representing himself, stated in a colloquy with the hearing judge why he believed that DNA testing of the blood was appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">THE COURT: Because there was some confusion by Ms. Rogers with respect to this dark-skinned man versus light-skinned man, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">[APPELLANT]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>THE COURT: And the order they were moving in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amjt\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">THE COURT: Okay. And why would that information have some mitigation or exculpatory effect on your case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmXP\">[APPELLANT]: It would show that she misidentified me as being the victim. And also, Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">THE COURT: She misidentified you as being the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajm-dedup-1\">[APPELLANT]: She identified me as being the dark-skinned man. And I\u2019m trying to say it was not me, it was Mr. Edward Stevenson [sic] that she seen running when (inaudible). Also I\u2019d like to say that in my trial, on page, I believe it\u2019s 420, the trial judge told the jury that if you believe her identification, then it was enough to convict me. She also gave a second identification saying the next day or two days later, she seen the same two men that she seen out back of her apartment, in front of her apartment two days later. She gave the jury reason to believe that she did see me. But the blood tests will show that it was the victim that she seen and it would have been impossible for her to see the same two men, because the victim, Edward Stevenson [sic] was deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">[APPELLANT]: It could establish that the dark-skinned man was somebody else other than myself. That\u2019s what I\u2019m claiming ... I\u2019m saying that the dark-skinned person that was seen running underneath the (inaudible) was the victim. I\u2019m saying if I could have that blood tested, I could establish by showing a jury that it was the victim that she seen underneath (inaudible), not the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The Circuit Court issued a written order denying Appellant\u2019s petition. In doing so, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">[Mr. Beaman] was charged with four counts of first degree murder. Murder is a crime of violence as detailed in \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, thus it is the Petitioner\u2019s right to request for DNA testing of scientific identification evidence the State possesses related to the judgment of conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>[Mr. Beaman] contends that the State\u2019s eyewitness Doria Rogers testified at Grand Jury that a dark-skinned man was in the front. [Mr. Beaman] continues to explain that on June 20, 1990, Doria Rogers testified in trial that the dark-skinned man was second. [Mr. Beaman] states that on August 8, 1990,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> State\u2019s witness Doria Rogers testified that the dark-skinned person was in front and the light[-]skinned person was in the back, and then she recanted her testimony. Because of this, [Mr. Beaman] claims that the State knowingly used false evidence to obtain a conviction. [Mr. Beaman] explains that the jury determines the truthfulness and or the falsity of the evidence and had no reason to believe that the red fluid substance was relevant to the identity of the dark-skinned person. [Mr. Beaman] claims that the DNA test is relevant to the true identity of the dark-skinned person seen running underneath and past the balcony area. [Mr. Beaman] continues to claim that there was no eyewitness testimony or evidence introduced at his trial that identified the victim Edmond Stephenson as the dark-skinned person running to or from the patio area. [Mr. Beaman] requests a search of, but not limited to, the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department\u2019s Forensic Science Division and other law enforcement agencies or databases or logs used for the purpose of identifying the source of the physical evidence used for DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">The State argues that [Mr. Beaman] is seeking to prove what was already presented at trial, that the donor of the blood found on or about the patio area belonged to the victim Edmund Stephenson, and thus the petition should be denied as DNA testing would not produce mitigating or exculpatory evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing. The [c]ourt agrees. In this instance, it is not reasonable to believe that simply testing blood found at the crime scene would prove [Mr. Beaman\u2019s] innocence, especially since the State never presented an argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the blood belonged to [Mr. Beaman], The Victim was found shot several times, and therefore it is reasonable to believe his blood would be found at the scene. Since there is not a substantial probability that testing DNA would have changed the verdict, the request is denied,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Because we must interpret CRIM, PROC. \u00a7 8-201 and determine whether the hearing court applied the correct legal standard when it denied Appellant\u2019s petition, our review is <em>de novo. Edwards v. State, </em>453 Md. 174, 185, 160 A.3d 642, 2017 WL 2266932 (2017). <em>See also Fuster v. State, </em>437 Md. 653, 671, 89 A.3d 1114, 1124 (2014) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews without deference the legal standard that a trial court uses in ruling on a petition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Appellant maintains that the Circuit Court erroneously denied his petition for postconviction DNA testing because in reaching its conclusion, the court applied the incorrect standard of law. Appellant argues that the standard is whether there is a <em>reasonable probability </em>that DNA testing has the scientific <em>potential </em>to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing. Appellant contends that the Circuit Court applied a more stringent standard when it ruled that DNA testing would not \u201cprove\u201d Appellant\u2019s \u201cinnocence\u201d and that there was not a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that DNA testing would have \u201cchanged the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The State argues that even if the outcome of the requested testing is as Appellant desires, such would not produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence. The State contends that if DNA testing showed that the blood belonged to the victim, this would be consistent with the State\u2019s theory at trial that the victim jumped out of the window after being shot in the buttocks in an attempt to flee from the shooters, but that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>shooters chased after the victim and shot him fatally outside the apartment. The State notes that it argued at trial that the blood on the ground was that of the victim, and that it never argued that the blood belonged to the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We recently discussed generally our Post-conviction DNA testing statute in <em>Edwards v. State:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">Maryland\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing statute, which was enacted by the General Assembly in 2001, is codified at \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article. \u201cSection 8-201 entitles persons convicted of certain serious crimes to pursue DNA testing of physical evidence that is in the possession of the State and might produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing.\u201d <em>Simms v. State, </em>409 Md. 722, 727, 976 A.2d 1012, 1015-16 (2009). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 4-703(2)(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">The statute was enacted \u201cin line with a nationwide trend to adopt postconviction DNA testing statutes designed to provide an avenue for the exoneration of the actually innocent.\u201d <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 219, 909 A.2d 1020, 1023 (2006). We have stated that the purpose of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 is to \u201cfacilitate the establishment of claims of actual innocence for serious crimes.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>395 Md. 240, 252, 909 A.2d 1035, 1042 (2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">Under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201, persons convicted of certain crimes of violence may file a petition requesting \u201cDNA testing of scientific identification evidence that the State possesses that is related to the judgment of conviction.\u201d Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(b)(l). \u201cScientific identification evidence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 8-201(a)(5) as evidence that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">(i) is related to an investigation or prosecution that resulted in a judgment of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">(ii) is in the actual or constructive possession of a law enforcement agency or agent of a law enforcement agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(in) contains biological evidence from which DNA may be recovered that may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of a convicted person of wrongful conviction or sentencing if subject to DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Crim.

Proc. \u00a7 8-201(a)(2). The statute mandates that a court grant a petition for DNA testing if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">(i) a reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">(ii) the requested DNA test employs a method of testing generally accepted with in the relevant scientific community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(d)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\"><em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 186-90, 160 A.3d 642 (footnotes omitted). The parties have not raised as an issue on appeal Appellant\u2019s compliance with the scientific testing requirements of \u00a7 8\u2014201(d)(l)(ii), thus our concern is focused on the requirements of \u00a7 8-201(d)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">In <em>Edwards, </em>we defined the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d under \u00a7 8-201(d)(1) as meaning \u201cevidence that would tend to clear the accused of guilt, or tend to establish his or her innocence.\u201d 453 Md. 174,196,160 A.3d 642. We further explained that \u201c \u2018exculpatory\u2019 under this provision does not require a petitioner to establish that the [outcome] would have been different if the DNA results sought were known at the time of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There, we held that the hearing judge applied the incorrect standard of law in denying Mr. Edward\u2019s petition for post-conviction DNA testing where the judge ruled that there was \u201cno possibility that a DNA test performed on the items requested <em>would </em>exonerate\u201d Mr. Edwards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Here, the hearing judge\u2019s ruling included language that \u201cit' is not reasonable to believe that simply testing blood found at the crime scene would <em>prove [Mr. Beaman\u2019s] innocence[.]\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Further, the hearing judge concluded \u201cSince there is <em>not a substantial possibility </em>that testing DNA <em>would have changed the verdict, </em>the request is denied.\u201d (emphasis added). Applying <em>Edwards, </em>we hold that the hearing judge applied the wrong standard of law in denying Appellant\u2019s petition. By invoking language suggesting that a petitioner must show that the DNA results would <em>prove </em>his or her innocence or that the result would have been different had the DNA results been known at the time of the conviction, the hearing judge applied a standard of law more stringent than \u00a7 8-201(d)(l) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Furthermore, in concluding that \u201cthere is <em>not a substantial possibility </em>that testing DNA <em>would have changed the verdict,\u201d </em>the hearing judge ostensibly relied on the more rigorous standard used to determine whether a petitioner is entitled to a new trial under \u00a7 8-201(c). Recently, in <em>Wallace v. State, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">If the petitioner moves for a new trial \u201con the grounds that the conviction was based on unreliable scientific evidence,\u201d then the court must determine whether a \u201csubstantial possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted without the evidence.\u201d CP \u00a7 8-201 (c) (emphasis added). Similarly, \u201c[i]f the results of the postconviction DNA testing are favorable to the petitioner,\u201d then the court must find \u201cthat a substantial possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted if the DNA testing results had been known or introduced at trial\u201d before ordering a new trial. CP \u00a7 8\u2014201 (i)(2)(iii) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Because this <em>\u201csubstantial possibility\u201d standard relates to whether the outcome of the petitioner\u2019s trial would have been different, it is a higher threshold than the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard, which relates only to whether the DNA testing has the potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence, not what the effect of that evidence would have been at trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Wallace v. State, </em>452 Md. 558, 575 n. 8, 158 A.3d 521, 531 n. 8 (2017) (emphasis in italics added). Accordingly, we hold that the hearing court erred in applying the incorrect standard of law when denying the petition. We shall now evaluate Appellant\u2019s petition under the correct standard of law as set forth in <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In <em>Edwards, </em>we held that under the correct standard of law, Mr. Edwards was entitled to DNA testing of a cigarette lighter, and we ordered that such testing be performed. <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 200, 160 A.3d 642. The pertinent facts of that case were that Mr. Edwards was convicted of attempted rape and assault of the victim, Ms. K. <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 178, 160 A.3d 642. In his post-conviction petition for DNA testing, Mr. Edwards sought DNA testing of a cigarette lighter, a plastic Forever 21 bag, and a cigarette pack. <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 178, 160 A.3d 642. At trial Ms. K. testified that her attacker used her cigarette lighter and that he sat in the passenger seat of her vehicle (in close proximity to the bag and the cigarette pack). <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 179, 160 A.3d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We held that there was a reasonable probability that DNA testing of the lighter had the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence because the attacker was alleged to have come into direct contact with the lighter, and the absence of Mr. Edwards\u2019 DNA on the lighter would tend to suggest that he was not the man who assaulted her. <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 198, 160 A.3d 642. (\u201cThe absence of [Mr. Edwards\u2019] DNA has the potential to exculpate [him] to the extent that it would tend to prove that he either did or did not use the lighter that Ms. K testified was used by the man who assaulted her. Where criminal agency is an issue, such as in this case, evidence tending to prove or disprove that the accused\u2019s DNA is present on items that the perpetrator touched or may have come into contact with has a great potential to exculpate.\u201d). We limited our holding to the DNA testing of the lighter because the bag and the cigarette pack</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">were items that the perpetrator could have <em>possibly </em>or <em>conceivably </em>come into contact with, but the trial record in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>th[e] case contains no evidence that the perpetrator actually did come into contact with these items. Unlike the cigarette lighter ... the absence of [Mr. Edwards\u2019] DNA on these items would not tend to establish that he was not the perpetrator of this crime, as the perpetrator of this crime was never alleged to or shown to have come into contact with these items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Edwards, </em>458 Md. 174, 199 n.15, 160 A.3d 642 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In the case before us, Appellant\u2019s argument for DNA testing is comparatively weaker than the argument made by Mr. Edwards in <em>Edwards. </em>Here, Appellant argues that he was misidentified as the dark-skinned man who Ms. Rogers saw running from the apartment before she heard gunshots. He argues that the man Ms. Rogers saw was in fact the victim, Edmond Stephenson. Appellant wishes to support this contention by testing the DNA of blood evidence found on the patio where the victim, injured with a non-fatal gunshot wound to the buttocks, landed after jumping from the apartment window. Appellant\u2019s desired-for outcome is that said DNA testing will show the blood belonged to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Wallace, </em>we explained that the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard of \u00a7 8-201(d) requires a showing of \u201ca fair likelihood that something is true.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 576, 158 A.3d 521 (citation omitted). We also explained that the <em>reasonable probability </em>standard requires showing more than a mere <em>possibility. Id. </em>Even if Appellant were to achieve his desired result of the DNA testing, it would in no way tend to establish that Ms. Rogers saw the victim and not the Appellant. The State argued at trial that the blood came from the victim. There was never any argument or suggestion that the blood came from the perpetrator of the crime. That a gunshot victim who jumps from a window might leave behind blood is obvious. That the blood belongs to the victim does not tend to suggest that Ms. Rogers saw one perpetrator chasing a victim, as opposed to seeing two perpetrators chasing a victim that had already run past Ms. Rogers\u2019 line of vision. In other words, there is not a \u201cfair likelihood\u201d that DNA testing of the blood would produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>evidence that would \u201ctend to establish [Appellant\u2019s] innocence.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 576, 158 A.3d 521; 453 Md. 174, 196, 160 A.3d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Edwards, </em>there was a connection between the item on which testing was sought and the contention the petitioner wished to support\u2014the evidence showed that the perpetrator touched the lighter, and by showing that his DNA was not on the lighter, Mr. Edwards sought to support the conclusion that he was not the perpetrator. Here, there is no such connection. The evidence in this case showed that the blood came from the victim. Appellant wishes to have testing performed to show that his DNA is not in the blood found on the patio to support the contention that he was falsely identified by an eyewitness. That the blood may belong to the victim would not logically support the conclusion that Ms. Rogers saw the victim and not Appellant. We thus hold that there is no reasonable probability that the testing of the blood found on the patio would have the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the arguments presented by Appellant in his petition and at the hearing on the petition utterly fail to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 8-201. <em>See Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 576, 158 A.3d 521 (\u201cTherefore, \u2018[establishing a possibility requires a lower quantum of proof or evidence (the showing of a chance, not necessarily a fair likelihood) than establishing a reasonable probability. In that regard, a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a higher standard than a possibility.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). In this respect, we shall affirm the ruling of the hearing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Finally, with respect to the ultimate disposition of this case, we must determine whether or not we should remand for further proceedings. In <em>Edwards, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he Post-conviction Court effectively denied Appellant\u2019s Petition as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 185, 160 A.3d 642. There we held that the hearing judge applied the incorrect standard of law and we did not remand the case for further proceedings. Because we determined that the petition satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 8-201, we applied <em>Gregg v. State, </em>409 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Md. 698, 721, 976 A.2d 999, 1012 (2009)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, and remanded the case with directions for the Circuit Court to order testing. <em>Edwards, </em>453 Md. 174, 200, 160 A.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The difference between this case and the cases of <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Edwards </em>is that the petition and Appellant\u2019s assertions in this case do not come close to satisfying the standard under \u00a7 8-201 for ordering DNA testing. We conclude that Appellant is not entitled to testing under the statute. Notwithstanding the fact that the hearing court confounded the applicable standards in its ruling, there is no reason to remand this case for further proceedings because of the obvious futility of Appellant\u2019s assertions. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>448 Md. 387, 411, 139 A.3d 976, 990 (2016) (\u201c[W]e determine that Jackson\u2019s 2015 Petition was properly denied without a hearing by the Circuit Court, albeit without [it] including factual findings; <em>we choose not to remand for inclusion of further findings, however, because of the obvious futility of Jackson\u2019s assertions.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">. Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl.
