On August 22, 2016, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), through Bar Counsel, filed in this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (\u201cPetition\u201d) against Respondent as a result of having received a notice from Citibank that Respondent had over-drafted his operating account ending in - 3487. Upon investigation, the Commission discovered that Respondent had failed to disclose assets that were associated with his law firm\u2019s pension plan in his bankruptcy petition, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that Respondent had outstanding federal and state tax liens totaling $85,092.72.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its Petition, the Commission alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Attorneys\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMARPC\u201d) \u00a7 19-301.15(a) (safekeeping property),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 19-308.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On September 1, 2016, this Court referred the matter to the Honorable Steven G. Salant (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct a hearing and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 19\u2014727(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 10, 2017, the hearing judge conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding Respondent\u2019s professional misconduct. Thereafter, the hearing judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, determining by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4(a),(c), and (d).On April 4, 2017, this Court entered a <em>per curiam </em>order disbarring Respondent, effective immediately. For the reasons stated below we hold that the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Respondent\u2019s violations of MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d) were supported by clear and convincing evidence and disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">a. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the hearing-judge rendered the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">During the time covered by the [Petition], Respondent maintained a general solo practice in Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">On January 14, 2015, a check presented to Citibank account No. X3487 by the Respondent was dishonored for insufficient funds. On January 26, 2015, Bar Counsel received notice from Citibank that Respondent had over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>drafted account No. X3487 in the amount of $103.83. Bar Counsel informed the Respondent through letter dated January 27, 2015 that he should provide information and documentation relating to the overdraft within ten days of receipt of the letter. The letter was sent to the address maintained with the Client Protection Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">Respondent wrote to Bar Counsel by letter dated March 12, 2015, stating the account was an operating account, not an attorney trust account, and the overdraft was due to a stop payment. Respondent provided a copy of the January 2015 statement for account Nos. X3487 and X1177. Account No. X1177 was Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account. The statement showed that Respondent disbursed a sum of $53,484 to \u201c6 Beachside LLC\u201d (\u201cLLC\u201d) from his attorney trust account on January 7, 2015. The LLC is a Florida limited liability company owned by the Respondent. The LLC owns real property in Palm Coast, and the resident agent for the LLC is Alla March, aka, Alla Marchenko, who is Respondent\u2019s girlfriend and paralegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">Respondent replied to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries that the transactions to the LLC were for his law firm\u2019s pension plan. After further investigation, Bar Counsel discovered that Respondent filed a Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Respondent failed to disclose all of his assets, as well as assets associated with his pension plan in the bankruptcy petition, which is signed under oath. Additionally, Bar Counsel learned that Respondent had outstanding state and federal tax liens in the amount of approximately $22,948.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">Respondent was instructed to provide information and documentation about the tax liens and related tax liability by July 10, 2015 through a letter from Bar Counsel dated June 22, 2015. However, Respondent failed to respond in any manner after receiving the letter. Bar Counsel sent another letter on July 13, 2015 requesting a reply no later than July 27, 2015 and Respondent again failed to answer after receiving the second letter. On August 4, 2015, Bar Counsel sent a third letter to Respondent, which he did not answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Bar Counsel received Respondent\u2019s bank records from Citibank through a subpoena issued on June 22, 2015. Bar Counsel requested information about eight transactions pertaining to Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account and relating to client ledgers for six named individuals through letter dated January 26, 2016. Respondent received the letter on about the same day and has failed to answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">b. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Based on the aforementioned findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent had violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) prohibits a lawyer from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO1\">[F]ail[ing] to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 19-301.6 (1.6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters and requests for information dated June 22, 2015, July 13, 2015, August 4, 2015, and January 26,2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for an attorney to:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Attorneys\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">* \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonest, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The hearing judge determined that Respondent violated subsection (a) because Respondent had violated other Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 710-11, 810 A.2d 996, 1018 (2002) (\u201cAs we have held that respondent violated several Rules of Professional Conduct, [the attorney] necessarily violated [MARPC] 8.4(a) as well.\u201d); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 411, 983 A.2d 434, 465 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The hearing judge held that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4(c) by failing to disclose assets associated with his pension plan when he filed his Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on February 6, 2013. The hearing judge also concluded that Respondent\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The hearing judge also determined there were no mitigating factors in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hodes, </em>441 Md. 136, 105 A.3d 533 (2014), we articulated our oft-cited standards for reviewing attorney disciplinary proceedings, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATPR\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland. We conduct an independent review of the record and we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless shown to be clearly errone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ous. Under our independent review of the record, we must determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear and convincing evidence. With respect to exceptions, upon our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. A hearing judge\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous if there is any competent material evidence to support it. As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the Maryland [Attorneys\u2019] Rules of Professional Conduct were violated, our consideration is <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 168, 105 A.3d at 552 (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We note that Respondent did not appear for either the fact-finding or for oral argument before this Court and that neither Bar Counsel nor Respondent filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are thereby established. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 19-741(b)(2)(A) (\u201cIf no exceptions are filed, the Court may treat the findings of fact as established.\u201d). We also agree that the findings of fact establish by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b) and \u00a7 19-308.4(a), (c), and (d) when he failed to respond to lawful demands for information by Bar Counsel and failed to disclose assets associated with his law firm\u2019s pension plan in his petition for bankruptcy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>IV. SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The Commission requests that this Court disbar Respondent from the practice of law. According to the Commission, Respondent\u2019s repeated failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries regarding outstanding tax liens, his attorney trust account, and his failure to disclose assets associated with his law firm\u2019s pension plan in his Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, warrant such a sanction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u201cIn fashioning the appropriate sanction to be imposed, we are guided by our interest in protecting the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 595, 876 A.2d 642, 660 (2005) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002)). We have also noted that \u201cthe purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the lawyer, but to protect the public as well as to deter other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 876 A.2d at 660 (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ellison, </em>384 Md. 688, 714, 867 A.2d 259, 274 (2005)). In addition, \u201c[t]he gravity of misconduct is not measured solely by the number of rules broken but is determined largely by the lawyer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 74, 930 A.2d 328, 347 (2007) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 568, 745 A.2d 1037, 1044 (2000)). To determine the proper sanction, we also consider the facts and circumstances of an individual case, including the \u201cnature of the ethical duties violated[,]\u201d and \u201cany aggravating or mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shephard, </em>444 Md. 299, 339, 119 A.3d 765, 788 (2015) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Paul, </em>423 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>268, 284, 31 A.3d 512, 522 (2011). Considering the facts presented before us, and absent mitigating circumstances, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We have consistently held that repeated failures to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigative requests can be a violation of MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gray, </em>436 Md. 513, 521-22, 83 A.3d 786, 791 (2014) (holding attorney violated Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to two letters from the Commission regarding grievance complaint); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harmon, </em>435 Md. 306, 315-16, 77 A.3d 1107, 1112-13 (2013) (concluding that attorney violated Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters regarding multiple grievance complaints); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 174, 994 A.2d 928, 944 (2010) (determining that attorney violated Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to repeated written requests for information from Bar counsel regarding grievance complaint). Here, the record reflects that Respondent repeatedly failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information regarding Respondent\u2019s trust account and the tax liens entered against him in violation of MARPC \u00a7 19-308.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In <em>Siskind, </em>we noted that \u201cacts of dishonesty, fraud, or misleading behavior may warrant a sanction of disbarment.\u201d 401 Md. at 75, 930 A.2d at 348; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 366, 731 A.2d 447, 458 (1999) (\u201c[t]actics involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit, carry the risk of the ultimate sanction by this Court.\u201d). We concluded that this is so, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axs-dedup-0\">[u]nlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in any attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\"><em>Siskind, </em>401 Md. at 75, 930 A.2d at 348 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001)). We have also held that \u201c[o]nly in the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>compelling extenuating circumstances \u2018will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment\u2019 in cases involving dishonesty and fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, </em>406 Md. 1, 19, 956 A.2d 135, 145-46 (2008) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 499, 850 A.2d 1157, 1168 (2004)). Elaborating on the \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d requirement, we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">we will not accept, as \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u201croot cause\u201d of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also results in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the [MARPC].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 413-14, 773 A.2d 463, 485 (2001). We conclude that no such \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d exist in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">This case is analogous to our decisions in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Byrd, </em>408 Md. 449, 970 A.2d 870 (2009) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zodrow, </em>419 Md. 286, 19 A.3d 381 (2011). In <em>Byrd, </em>we disbarred an attorney for, <em>inter alia, </em>perjuring himself by filing false business reports under oath in the attorney\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding in violation of Rule 8.4(b), (c), and (d). 408 Md. at 483, 970 A.2d at 889. In <em>Zodrow, </em>a reciprocal discipline proceedings case, we disbarred an attorney for, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to make pertinent asset disclosures during his personal bankruptcy case in violation of Rule 8.4. 419 Md. at 303-04, 19 A.3d at 391-92. In the present case, Respondent knowingly failed to disclose a potential claim his law firm\u2019s pension plan may have received in his petition for bankruptcy, thereby violating MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In concluding that Respondent has violated multiple Rules of Professional Conduct, we further hold that Respondent thereby violated MARPC \u00a7 19-308.4(a). <em>See Gallagher, </em>371 Md. at 710-11, 810 A.2d at 1018 (holding that because attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>violated several Rules of Professional Conduct, the attorney also violated Rule 8.4(a)); <em>Foltz, </em>411 Md. at 411, 983 A.2d at 465 (concluding that attorney\u2019s violation of multiple other Rules constituted a violation of Rule 8.4(a)). Accordingly, and guided by our holdings in <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Zodrow, </em>we entered the April 4, 2017 <em>per curiam </em>order, disbarring Respondent and awarding costs against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-4\">.

Specifically, the hearing judge noted that we discussed in <em>Walker-Turner </em>\u201cthat when an attorney violates several of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the attorney necessarily violates the Rule prohibiting attorneys from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. at 232, 51 A.3d at 564. This portion of our opinion addressed, however, the attorney\u2019s violation of Rule 8.4(a), not 8.4(d), as the hearing judge suggested in his Conclusions of Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">. The record before the hearing judge reflects that on November 18, 2010, Silver Spring Family Medical Center, LLC (\"SSFMC\u201d) filed a voluntary Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in the Maryland Bankruptcy Court. On November 23, 2010, Respondent entered his appearance in the SSFMC bankruptcy case as counsel for the Law Office of Mark Kotlarslcy, Esq. Pension Plan, alleging the Pension Plan was an unsecured creditor of SSFMC. Three years later, on February 6, 2013, Respondent filed a Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, in his personal capacity, in the Maryland Bankruptcy Court. Although Respondent disclosed the Pension Plan in his bankruptcy petition, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>indicates that he failed to disclose the potential SSFMC claim as an asset. Upon discovery of the Pension Plan\u2019s potential claim, Respondent\u2019s bankruptcy trustee contested the Final Report and Account in the SSFMC bankruptcy. The SSFMC bankruptcy judge subsequently held that the funds due to Respondent\u2019s Pension Plan would be distributed to Respondent\u2019s bankruptcy trustee until ownership of the funds could be determined. On August 28, 2013, $41,148.55 was distributed to Respondent\u2019s bankruptcy trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
