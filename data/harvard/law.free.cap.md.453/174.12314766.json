Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.), \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article (Crim. Pro.). Appellant Richard A. Edwards seeks our review of the denial, by the Circuit Court for Saint Mary\u2019s County, of his Petition for Post-Conviction DNA Testing. For the reasons set forth below, we shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand this case to that court with directions to order the DNA testing of the cigarette lighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">On May 12, 2010, a grand jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Saint Mary\u2019s County returned an indictment in three counts charging Appellant with committing attempted first-degree rape, third-degree sexual offense, and second-degree assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These charges went before a Circuit Court jury for trial on February 8 and 9, 2011, following which the jury convicted Appellant on all counts. On February 9, the trial court sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment for the attempted first-degree rape, and imposed a concurrent ten years\u2019 imprisonment for the third-degree sexual offense. The second-degree assault merged. Appellant lodged a direct appeal with the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">On or about September 14, 2015, Appellant filed a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in the Circuit Court for Saint Mary\u2019s County. On January 4, 2016, the Circuit Court granted Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw this first Petition, and on that date Appellant\u2019s Petition for Post-Conviction DNA Testing was filed pursuant to Crim. Pro. \u00a7 8-201 and Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>4-701.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A hearing on the petition was held on June 14, 2016 before a Circuit Court judge (\u201cPost-conviction Court\u201d), who, in a written opinion and order issued on July 6, 2016 denied the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 21, 2016, Appellant noted a direct appeal to this Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-201(k)(6).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The operative facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the trial, the jury heard testimony that, on the evening of February 12, 2010, the complainant, J.K.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> went to the Big Dogs Paradise bar in Mechanicsburg. She arrived at 9:00 p.m. and remained there until the bar closed at 2:00 a.m. the next morning. After leaving the bar, Ms. K., accompanied by some friends, went outside to smoke a cigarette and socialize. Soon thereafter, the others left, and Ms. K. decided to call a friend, Alex, for a ride home because she had been drinking. She returned to her car, locked the doors, and called another friend, Mark, to pass the time until her ride arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">While Ms. K. was on the phone with Mark, a man approached her car and identified himself as a \u201csecurity guy\u201d at Big Dogs. He claimed that he wanted to ensure Ms. K. had a safe ride home. Ms. K. told the man that she had a friend on the way to give her a ride and the man left. A few minutes later, however, while Ms. K. was still on the phone, the man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>returned to her car with a cigarette in his hand and asked to borrow her lighter. When Ms. K. gave the man her lighter, he asked to use her door to shield him from the wind while he lit his cigarette. Ms. K. agreed. The man crouched down in front of the passenger door to light the cigarette, but then he entered her car and sat down. When Ms. K. told the man to get out of her car he did not comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Ms. K. then told the man she needed to go to the bathroom and that she was going back to the bar to see if she could use the bathroom. The man responded, \u201cOh no, I work for Big Dogs, they are closed. They won\u2019t let you back in there.\u201d Ms. K. then said \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna go check.\u201d She then ended her phone call with Mark, opened her door and started to get out.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The man got out of the car about the same time and pushed Ms. K. to the ground. He then pulled Ms. K. back up and pushed her into the driver\u2019s seat of the car. At that point, he fondled her, kissed her neck, and attempted to pull down her pants, placed his fingers in her vagina, and attempted to force her to have sexual intercourse with him. At one point during the attack, the man took Ms. K.\u2019s keys and threw them. Ms. K. managed to retrieve her keys and start the ignition. She \u201cgunned it\u201d and the man fell out of the car and ran toward the back of the bar. Ms. K. drove to the front of the bar and continuously honked her horn until some of the Big Dogs bouncers came out. When these employees asked what was wrong, Ms. K. reported that a man tried to rape her. The police were summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Officers processed Ms. K.\u2019s car for fingerprints, and investigators also recovered some items from the car that the suspect could have touched, including a Bic lighter, a Forever 21 plastic shopping bag, and a pack of Marlboro Menthol cigarettes. Ms. K. did not go to the hospital on the night of her attack and the police did not take her clothing for examination. The police did not submit any evidence for DNA testing from Ms. K, her car, or the items in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Ms. K. testified that she had not known her attacker, but recalled that she had seen him earlier that night inside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>bar. Ms. K. described her attacker as having brown hair and dark eyes, being in his late thirties to forties, and wearing a long-sleeve denim button-up shirt. Based on Ms. K\u2019s description of her assailant and on interviews with the employees and owners of Big Dogs, the police had initially identified a man named Richard Wathen as a suspect. The police showed Ms. K. two photo arrays, each containing a photo of a St. Mary\u2019s county resident named Richard Wathen. Ms. K. was unable to make a positive identification from these arrays.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The police later identified Appellant as a possible suspect and compiled a photo array with Appellant\u2019s picture, which they showed to Ms. K. She positively identified Appellant as the man who assaulted her in the parking lot outside of Big Dogs. Ms. K. later testified that she was \u201cpositive\u201d of her identification of Appellant as the man who assaulted her. At trial, Ms. K\u2019s friend Mark, who was on the phone with her that evening during her interaction with her assailant, recounted that Ms. K. had said she was at Big Dogs and that during their conversation, Mark could hear a person with a male voice asking for a light or a cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The co-owner of Big Dogs, Victoria Adkins, had been working at the bar that evening and testified that she had spoken with Ms. K. about the incident. Ms. Adkins testified that after hearing Ms. K. describe the man who attacked her, Ms. Adkins came to the conclusion that the man was Ricky Edwards, who was at the bar that evening and wearing a denim button-up shirt. Brian Adkins, who also owns Big Dogs, testified that when he heard Ms. K.\u2019s description, he thought the person\u2019s name was Ricky. Mr. Adkins also said Ricky was at the bar that evening and was wearing a blue denim button-up shirt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A bar employee named James Dougherty testified that he believed the man who Ms. K. described was Appellant, a man with whom Mr. Dougherty had had an altercation on the night in question. Before trial, Mr. Dougherty positively iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tified Appellant in a photo array shown to him by police as the man he saw in the bar that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At trial, Appellant called the investigating detective, Det. Thomas Hedderich, as a defense witness. Det. Hedderich testified that he interrogated Appellant and that Appellant did not confess to the crime despite the fact that the detective lied to Appellant, claiming that police had obtained DNA evidence, that the incident was captured on video, and that an undercover narcotics officer had seen the incident. Appellant also testified in his own defense and acknowledged that he was at Big Dogs from 12:30 am to 1:30 am, when he left the bar in the car that his wife drives. Appellant denied having any contact with Ms. K. on the night in question. Appellant finally testified that he has green eyes, and that he has a rotten tooth and missing teeth, which he displayed at trial for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The Post-Conviction Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In his post-conviction Petition, Appellant asserted that there was a reasonable probability that DNA testing of the requested items has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory evidence relevant to his claim of wrongful conviction. Appellant noted that the victim testified that the perpetrator used her lighter and two witnesses testified that the victim told them the perpetrator asked her for a cigarette. Appellant maintained that it is likely that the perpetrator transferred epithelial cells to the lighter when he used it and that the perpetrator could also have touched the Forever 21 bag and the cigarette pack given his proximity to those items when he sat in the passenger seat.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Appellant contended that \u201ceven with minute or degraded quantities of DNA, it is \u2018frequently possible to obtain successful DNA results from cellular material transferred from the skin of an individual who has simply touched an object.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ray A. Wickenheiser, <em>Trace DNA: A Review, Dis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>cussion of Theory, and Application of the Transfer of Trace Quantities of DNA Through Skin Contact, </em>3 J. FORENSIC SCI. 442 (2002)). The petition noted Wickenheiser\u2019s observation that cigarette lighters specifically are an \u201cunusual exhibit material yielding successfully DNA profiles using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and short tandem repeat (STR) typing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Appellant further asserted that the testing could show that his DNA was absent on all of the tested items but that the DNA profile of another individual may instead be present on the items. Appellant argued that this would not only support his testimony that he was falsely identified as the perpetrator but it also has the potential to identify the actual perpetrator. Finally, the petition asserted that the DNA testing requested, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and short tandem repeat (STR) testing, are generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">As noted, a hearing on the petition was held on June 14, 2016 in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. At the hearing, the State did not challenge whether the DNA testing requested by Appellant is employed by a method generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. Rather, the focus of the hearing was whether there was a reasonable probability that the testing requested has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory evidence relevant to Appellant\u2019s claim that he was not the individual who assaulted Ms. K.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On July 6, 2016, the Post-conviction Court issued an order denying Appellant\u2019s petition for DNA testing. The order was accompanied by a written opinion, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">As previously stated, the standard in CP \u00a7 8~201(d)[ (1) ](i) is that there must be a \u201creasonable probability ... that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence.\u201d Because of the highly speculative nature of what petitioner hopes to gain from DNA testing of these items, this [c]ourt can see no possibility that a DNA test performed on the items requested would exonerate Petitioner. Even if petitioner\u2019s DNA is not found on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the items and other persons\u2019 DNA is found, that does not prove or even suggest that any of those other people committed this crime, even if one of them turns out to be a convicted sex offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">Here, there is no instrument that was used to commit the crime, and therefore, no relevance to finding the DNA of random people on the items Petitioner seeks to have tested. The [cjourt need not \u201cconduct a fishing expedition to indulge every permutation\u201d that Petitioner might imagine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2U\">The Post-conviction Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">In this case, it is noteworthy and even dispositive that, at trial, the victim positively identified Petitioner as the perpetrator. She was able to give the police a description of him and what he was wearing. She testified that she got a good look at him because \u201c[h]e was in my face quite a bit ... I had seen him earlier in the bar ... I said that guy looks like a creeper because he kept looking at me as we were dancing.\u201d In addition, the victim identified Petitioner for the jury and testified to identifying Petitioner in a photo array. Trial counsel cross-examined the victim and she did not waiver in her identification of Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The judge distinguished cases where relief had been granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_M\">This is clearly different than <em>Gregg </em>where it was highly probative that the killer had handled a gun which was the murder weapon and the DNA on the gun would have a reasonable probability of producing exculpatory evidence that would corroborate defendant\u2019s claim that he was not the shooter. This was especially true given the ambivalent evidence which did convict the Petitioner. It is also different than <em>Brown </em>where the defendant was challenging whether the crime had actually happened and wanted the items tested to disprove it had. Here, there is no such probability that the testing would produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence for the Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">On July 21, 2016, Appellant noted a direct appeal to this Court pursuant to \u00a7 8-201(k)(6), and presents the following question on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Did the Circuit Court err when it denied Mr. Edwards\u2019 Petition for Post-Conviction DNA Testing, where a reasonable probability exists that the requested testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory evidence relevant to Mr. Edwards\u2019 claim of wrongful conviction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">For the following reasons, we shall answer the Appellant\u2019s question in the affirmative and remand the case to the Post-conviction Court for to order testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASqG\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">There is some dispute as to the appropriate standard of review. The State insists at length that our review of the Post-conviction Court\u2019s ruling is for an abuse of discretion. We do not agree. Because we are asked to interpret the language in the post-conviction DNA testing statute, and to determine whether the hearing judge applied the correct standard of law in denying Appellant\u2019s petition, our review is plenary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Faster v. State, </em>437 Md. 653, 671, 89 A.3d 1114, 1124 (2014) (\u201cAn appellate court reviews without deference the legal standard that a trial court uses in ruling on a petition.\u201d). <em>See also, e.g., Howard v. State, </em>440 Md. 427, 434, 103 A.3d 572, 576 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The cases cited by the State in support of its version of the appropriate standard of review for an abuse of discretion, do not support its argument on this record. <em>Brown v. State, </em>431 Md. 576, 66 A.3d 675 (2013); <em>Washington v. State, </em>424 Md. 632, 37 A.3d 932 (2012); <em>Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 983 A.2d 1071 (2009). In each of the cases upon which the State relies, we were asked to review the circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial. By contrast, in the case before us, the Post-conviction Court concluded that the sought after DNA testing could not yield results that would exonerate Appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The Post-conviction Court effectively denied Appellant\u2019s Petition as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On appeal, Appellant maintains that a reasonable probability exists that the testing has scientific potential to produce exculpatory evidence relevant to Appellant\u2019s claim of wrongful conviction. Ms. K. told the jury that her attacker used her lighter and moreover, photographs of the crime scene show a Forever 21 bag and a pack of cigarettes on the edge of the passenger seat where the attacker sat before the assault. Appellant maintains that it is likely that the perpetrator of the crime transferred epithelial cells onto the lighter when he touched it and that it is also likely the perpetrator could have touched the cigarette pack or Forever 21 bag given his proximity to those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Further, Appellant urges that the hearing judge applied the wrong standard in denying the petition when the judge ruled that \u201cthe [c]ourt can see no possibility that a DNA test performed on the items requested would exonerate the Petitioner.\u201d Appellant insists that the proper standard is not whether DNA testing would \u201cexonerate\u201d him or that such testing would \u201cprove\u201d someone else committed the crime. Instead, Appellant contends that the proper inquiry is whether a reasonable probability exists that the testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to the claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing. Appellant posits that this case turns upon the meaning of exculpatory, which, he argues, sweeps more broadly than the term exonerating. Appellant also argues that the inclusion of the terms \u201cor mitigating\u201d and \u201cor sentencing\u201d in the statute show that the standard is one of exculpatory evidence and not exonerating evidence. Finally, Appellant avers that the absence of his DNA on an item where one would expect the perpetrator\u2019s DNA, although not necessarily exonerating, is certainly exculpatory to the extent that it would tend to establish that Appellant was not the person that assaulted Ms. K. In other words, negative DNA results would satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>broader, less stringent threshold for entitlement to DNA testing than the standard advocated by the State and applied by the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Urging that we affirm, the State avers that Appellant\u2019s hoped-for outcome of DNA testing would not be exculpatory. The State first notes that there is no evidence that the assailant touched the Forever 21 bag and the cigarette pack, thus the absence of his DNA on these items would in no way tend to exonerate him. The State explains that the testing would reveal one of two things\u2014either Appellant\u2019s DNA is on the lighter or it is not\u2014and argues that neither is exculpatory. The State contends that the best result for Appellant is that Appellant\u2019s DNA is not on the lighter and notes that the jury was already told that there was no DNA evidence in this case inculpating Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We agree with Appellant that the standard to be employed by a post-conviction court in the analysis of a petition for DNA testing does not require the proponent to establish that the results must, in all instances, exonerate the defendant. We also conclude that our decision in <em>Brown </em>is, on this record, inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Maryland\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing statute, which was enacted by the General Assembly in 2001, is codified at \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cSection 8-201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>entitles persons convicted of certain serious crimes to pursue DNA testing of physical evidence that is in the possession of the State and might produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of \u2022wrongful conviction or sentencing.\u201d <em>Simms v. State, </em>409 Md. 722, 727, 976 A.2d 1012, 1015-16 (2009). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 4-703(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The statute was enacted \u201cin line with a nationwide trend to adopt post-conviction DNA testing statutes designed to provide an avenue for the exoneration of the actually innocent.\u201d <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 219, 909 A.2d 1020, 1023 (2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>We have stated that the purpose of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 is to \u201cfacilitate the establishment of claims of actual innocence for serious crimes.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>395 Md. 240, 252, 909 A.2d 1035, 1042 (2006).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201, persons convicted of certain crimes of violence may file a petition requesting \u201cDNA testing of scientific identification evidence that the State possesses that is related to the judgment of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(b)(l). \u201cScientific identification evidence\u201d is defined in Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 (a)(5) as evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">(i) is related to an investigation or prosecution that resulted in a judgment of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">(ii) is in the actual or constructive possession of a law enforcement agency or agent of a law enforcement agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">(iii) contains biological evidence from which DNA may be recovered that may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of a convicted person of wrongful conviction or sentencing if subject to DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(a)(5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cBiological evidence\u201d is defined as evidence that \u201cincludes, but is not limited to, any blood, hair, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>saliva, semen, epithelial cells, buccal cells, or other bodily substances from which genetic marker groupings may be obtained.\u201d Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(a)(2). The statute mandates that a court grant a petition for DNA testing if the court finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">(i) a reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">(ii) the requested DNA test employs a method of testing generally accepted with in the relevant scientific community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Here, the parties do not disagree that the requested DNA test employs a method that is generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. Hence, there is no dispute that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8\u2014201 (d)(1 )(ii) is satisfied. At issue in this case is whether a reasonable probability exists that the requested testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory evidence relevant to the Appellant\u2019s claim of wrongful conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Again, in denying the petition, the post-conviction judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">Because of the highly speculative nature of what Petitioner hopes to gain from DNA testing of these items, this [cjourt can see no possibility that a DNA test performed on the items requested <em>would exonerate </em>Petitioner. Even if Petitioner\u2019s DNA is not found on the items and other persons\u2019 DNA is found, that <em>does not prove </em>or even suggest that any of those other people committed this crime, even if one of them turns out to be a convicted sex offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">(Emphasis added). The theory of the court\u2019s denial, that the proposed DNA analysis would not exonerate Appellant, leaves no room for the broader reach of the statute as indicated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the term \u201cexculpatory.\u201d The State argues that the hearing judge applied the appropriate standard. On this point, the parties are in disagreement, specifically over the meaning and application of the term \u201cexculpatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The term \u201cexculpatory\u201d as employed in the statute embraces a far broader scope of relief than the \u201czero sum\u201d standard characterized by the term \u201cexonerate\u201d and advanced by the State and applied by the Post-conviction Court. The sought after testing of objects described by Ms. K., most notably the cigarette lighter, have the \u201cscientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence.\u201d Nothing in the plain language of the statute suggests that the testing results must \u201cexonerate\u201d a petitioner or \u201cprove\u201d that someone else committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Although the General Assembly did not define the word \u201cexculpatory\u201d in the statute, we are able to discern the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d with its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See Ali v. CIT Tech. Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>416 Md. 249, 262, 6 A.3d 890, 897-98 (2010) (\u201cWhen the Court can ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the verbiage, the Court need not delve deeper. ... In seeking to apply the plain-meaning rule, it is proper to consult a dictionary or dictionaries for a term\u2019s ordinary and popular meaning.\u201d). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines exculpatory as \u201cevidence tending to establish a criminal defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 577 (7th ed. 1999). This is consistent with the policy of the statute\u2014to facilitate claims of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Our cases confirm this conclusion. In <em>Gregg v. State, </em>409 Md. 698, 976 A.2d 999 (2009), we discussed \u00a7 8-201(d)(l) and noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Given that the statute only requires a showing that the desired testing has a reasonable probability that the DNA testing of the epithelial cells has the scientific potential to produce relevant exculpatory or mitigating evidence, the petition, on its face, satisfies that standard.

State, </em>411 Md. 664, 985 A.2d 32 (2009), is also instructive. The defendant in that case filed for post-conviction relief, asserting that the results of DNA testing established that he had been convicted of rape, felony murder and associated offenses in error. One issue before us was whether the \u201cmore liberal\u201d standards for the granting of a new trial should apply to Thompson\u2019s case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In 2008, the General Assembly amended the DNA provisions of the Criminal Procedure Article by adding, <em>inter alia, </em>the following standard for the post-conviction court to apply in assessing a motion for a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">A petitioner may move for a new trial under this section on the grounds that the conviction was based on unreliable scientific identification evidence and a substantial possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Md. Code (2009 Supp.), \u00a7 8-201(c). We held that, although Thompson had filed for post-conviction relief prior to the effective date of the amendment, January 1, 2009, the appropriate standard for the post-conviction court to apply should be the above provision, Section 8-201(c), as added in 2008. <em>Thompson, </em>411 Md. at 683-84, 985 A.2d at 43. In a footnote, we further commented on the appropriate standard, and this note is particularly relevant to the case before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">We note that this is in keeping with the standard employed by many other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., Bedingfield v. Commonwealth, </em>260 S.W.3d 805, 814-15 (Ky. 2008) (deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>mining that DNA evidence that would \u201cprobably\u201d produce a different result was sufficient to warrant a new trial, and need not explicitly exculpate the petitioner); <em>People v.

Although we were concerned, <em>inter alia, </em>with the \u201cnew trial\u201d provision set forth in Section 8-201(c) (2009), the decision in <em>Thompson </em>informs our analysis of the sum and substance of the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d and its place in a remedial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Bedingfield v. Commonwealth, </em>260 S.W.3d 805 (Ky. 2008), cited with approval in <em>Thompson, </em>the Supreme Court of Kentucky ruled that the defendant was entitled to a new trial on a rape charge after newly discovered DNA test results ruled out the presence of his DNA in sperm recovered from the victim\u2019s rape kit. After surveying decisions from other jurisdictions on the issue, the Kentucky high court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">It would seem that this Court has never thoroughly examined the exculpatory effect of newly discovered DNA evidence in this context. However, many of our sister jurisdictions, acknowledging the accuracy, effectiveness, and implicit interests of justice inherent in DNA testing have recognized the exculpatory effect that such evidence may have in post-conviction criminal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Bedingfield, </em>260 S.W.3d at 811. In securing Bedingfield\u2019s conviction, the prosecutor had emphasized that semen analyzed from the rape kit was crucial proof of Bedingfield\u2019s identity. A police lab technician, who could not prove Beding-field as the source of the semen, nevertheless prompted the \u201csupposition\u201d that he was in any event the perpetrator. The lab technician\u2019s analysis buttressed an already suspect circumstantial evidence case, which would have been undermined by the precision of the later DNA test results. The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion as to the clarifying impact of the DNA testing merits quotation at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">Ultimately, the substantive exculpatory nature of the newly discovered DNA evidence coupled with the blatant testimonial inconsistencies of the material witnesses and the substantial impact which this newly discovered evidence has upon said testimony, along with the fact that this evidence would probably induce a different conclusion by a jury, all serve to warrant a new trial to avoid a substantial miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u2021 \u215d \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">For clarity\u2019s sake we emphasize: the presence of sperm which DNA testing proves did not belong to Appellant <em>does not exonerate him; however, the presence of this new evidence does cast a long shadow and assuredly merits consideration in the form a new trial. </em>It cannot be overlooked that in Appellant\u2019s initial trial, all other arguments were enhanced and corroborated by the supposition that the sperm found belonged to Appellant. Indeed, this theme was central to the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution. Because the technology was not available for Appellant to refute that claim, Appellant was left to rely on his word against that of the Commonwealth. This new evidence is substantial, if not pivotal, and we are inclined to believe that it is precisely the type of evidence that is envisioned by the rule and that may change the result if a new trial were granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\"><em>Bedingfield, </em>260 S.W.3d at 814-15 (emphasis added) (statutory citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The <em>Bedingfield </em>Court\u2019s analysis of the \u201cexculpatory effect\u201d of the DNA evidence applies with substantial force to our inquiry into the proper assessment of the term \u201cexculpate\u201d as written in our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>308 Kan. 609, 366 P.3d 200 (2016), also helps to inform our analysis. Hernandez was convicted of raping and sodomizing his daughter. <em>Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 202. At trial, evidence showed that the assaults took place on the victim\u2019s bed and on the petitioner\u2019s bed. <em>Id. </em>Evidence also showed that the petitioner sometimes used condoms and sometimes did not. <em>Id. </em>During the investigation of the crime, police recovered a sheet from the victim\u2019s bed and bedding from the petitioner\u2019s bed, but neither item of evidence was tested for DNA at that time. <em>Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 203. After his conviction, the petitioner filed a petition seeking DNA testing of the sheets and bedding. <em>Id. </em>Kansas\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing statute is similarly worded to our own, and provides that \u201c[a] court shall order DNA testing pursuant to a petition made under subsection (a) upon a determination that testing may produce noncumulative, exculpatory evidence relevant to the claim of the petitioner that the petitioner was wrongfully convicted or sentenced.\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-2512; <em>Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 204. The trial court denied his petition and petitioner appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court. <em>Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The prosecution argued that the absence of Hernandez\u2019s DNA on the evidence \u201cwould not have changed the verdict.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 206. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument, the Kansas high court defined exculpatory as evidence that \u201ctends to disprove a fact in issue which is material to guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that evidence can be exculpatory without being exonerating and that \u201c[t]o be exculpatory evidence, it need not definitively prove the petitioner\u2019s innocence but only <em>tend to disprove </em>a disputed <em>material fact.\u201d Hernandez, </em>366 P.3d at 208 (emphasis added). The <em>Hernandez </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d applies with equal force to the case before us. This is consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>interpretation of this term by our intermediate appellate court. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>207 Md.App. 336, 357, 52 A.3d 980, 992 (\u201c[Efcculpatory evidence is that which is capable of clearing or tending to clear the accused of guilt\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 530, 56 A.3d 1242 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We thus hold that \u201cexculpatory\u201d under \u00a7 8-201(d)(l) means evidence that would tend to clear the accused of guilt, or tend to establish his or her innocence. We further hold that \u201cexculpatory\u201d under this provision does not require a petitioner to establish that the result would have been different if the DNA results sought were known at the time of the trial. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing judge erroneously applied the wrong standard when she ruled that there was \u201cno possibility that a DNA test performed on the items requested <em>would exonerate </em>[Appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Recently, in <em>Wallace v. State, </em>this Court had the occasion to address the definition of \u201cscientific identification evidence\u201d for purposes of the evidence retention provisions of the Postcon-viction DNA testing statute. <em>See </em>Crim. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 8-201 (a)(5), 8-201(j). In that case, we examined the different thresholds that a petitioner must satisfy in showing the State\u2019s duty to preserve certain evidence, Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(j), and in demonstrating entitlement to DNA testing, Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201(d). <em>Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 573-76, 158 A.3d 521, 2017 WL 1422828 *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We concluded in <em>Wallace </em>that the correct legal standard for holding the State to the obligation to preserve evidence was not stringent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">The threshold that a petitioner must satisfy in order to show that the State had a duty to preserve certain evidence under the Postconviction DNA Testing Statute is lower than the threshold that a petitioner must satisfy in order to be entitled to DNA testing on that evidence. In other words, evidence that satisfies the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard of subsection (d), and is therefore subject to DNA testing, is a subcategory of evidence that satisfies the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cscientific identification evidence\u201d in subsection (a), and is therefore subject to the State\u2019s duty of preservation. \u201cScientific identification evidence\u201d includes all evidence that \u201ccontains biological evidence from which DNA may be recovered that may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of a convicted person of wrongful conviction or sentencing if subject to DNA testing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><em>Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 575, 158 A.3d 521, 2017 WL 1422828, at *7 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We went on to hold in <em>Wallace </em>that the T-shirt in question did not qualify as \u201cscientific identification evidence\u201d because there was \u201cno possibility, or chance, that DNA testing could have produced exculpatory or mitigating evidence.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>452 Md. at 577, 158 A.3d 521, 2017 WL 1422828, at *8. By contrast, the articles described by Ms. K. in the case before us, particularly the cigarette lighter, were not merely random items that would be the subject of a \u201cfishing expedition,\u201d but potentially relevant material that may satisfy the slightly higher threshold for demonstrating entitlement to DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The State argues that the absence of Appellant\u2019s DNA on the lighter does not \u201cprove\u201d he was not the assailant because Appellant \u201cwas charged with sexual assault; he was not charged with touching a lighter\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny assessment of the exculpatory value of lighter-related evidence must be understood in that context\u2014the lighter (unlike, say, the murder weapon in Gregg) was of <em>marginal relevance.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). This contention confuses the concept of exculpatory evidence. The fact that the jurors were informed, even repeatedly, that there was no forensic evidence linking Appellant with the incident, does not detract from the fact that DNA testing might rule out the presence of Appellant\u2019s DNA on the items tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The State posits that our decision in <em>Brown v. State, </em>431 Md. 576, 66 A.3d 675 (2013), is apposite. In that case we held that DNA test results showing an absence of the defendant\u2019s DNA on an assault weapon \u201cdid not contradict or undercut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>any information presented to the jury at trial.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>431 Md. at 589, 66 A.3d at 683. In denying <em>Brown\u2019s </em>motion for a new trial, the post-eonviction court in that case determined that negative results from DNA testing did not undermine the prosecution\u2019s case, because the jury heard, at length, evidence that there was no forensic evidence linking Brown to the crime. We affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We explained that, in the context of a motion for a new trial, the post-conviction court \u201cdid not abuse its discretion in finding that the absence of Brown\u2019s DNA on [the evidence in question] did not provide a substantial possibility that the jury would have reached a different conclusion with respect to Brown\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>431 Md. at 589, 66 A.3d at 683. The distinction between <em>Brown </em>and the case before us is that Brown\u2019s petition was evaluated in the context of a motion for a new trial and the evidence of trial was such that the post-conviction court was satisfied that, in light of the DNA evidence, Brown failed to demonstrate a \u201csubstantial possibility that he would not have been found guilty if the DNA evidence had been introduced at trial,\u201d while the post-conviction court in the case applied an incorrect legal standard. 431 Md. at 590, 66 A.3d at 683-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The State further posits that the absence of trace evidence only proves that there was no trace evidence. The State claims that DNA cannot establish a negative, meaning that although the presence of Appellant\u2019s DNA on the lighter would tend to establish he wag the perpetrator, the absence of his DNA would not tend to establish that he was not the perpetrator; the absence of a DNA match effectively proves nothing, according to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The absence of Appellant\u2019s DNA has the potential to exculpate Appellant to the extent that it would tend to prove that he either did or did not use the lighter that Ms. K. testified was used by the man who assaulted her. Where criminal agency is an issue, such as in this case, evidence tending to prove or disprove that the accused\u2019s DNA is present on items that the perpetrator touched or may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>come into contact with has a great potential to exculpate. Thus, the State\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Gregg </em>on the basis that the item to be tested in that case was the instrument of the crime, is not dispositive with respect to all cases of DNA testing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the absence of Appellant\u2019s DNA on the lighter would not <em>conclusively </em>prove that Appellant did not assault Ms. K., as the attacker may not have transferred any trace DNA to the lighter, absolute certainty is not the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In assessing whether there is a reasonable probability that DNA testing may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence, where the State has possession of an item that a perpetrator allegedly touched, a court may take into account factors such as the nature of the item (e.g., whether it is an instrumentality of the crime), the physical proximity between where the item was located and where the crime occurred, and the temporal proximity between when the perpetrator touched the item and when the crime occurred. Applying these factors to the instant case, we conclude that Appellant has established that DNA testing is warranted as to the cigarette lighter. Although the cigarette lighter is not an instrumentality of the crime, the physical proximity between where the lighter was located and where the crime occurred and the temporal proximity between when the perpetrator touched the lighter and when the crime occurred are factors that weigh heavily in favor of granting Appellant\u2019s request. The perpetrator gained access to Ms. K.\u2019s vehicle by asking to borrow her lighter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the crime occurred immediately after the perpetrator touched the lighter. In sum, as discussed above, the standard is simply whether there is a reasonable probability, or fair likelihood, that the testing has the potential to produce exculpatory evidence, which in turn, is evidence that <em>tends </em>to disprove or negate a petitioner\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The hearing judge incorrectly applied a more stringent standard that would require Appellant to show that the DNA testing he seeks would exonerate him. Given the extant record, we conclude that Appellant has established that DNA testing is warranted in light of the proper standard set forth above. Accordingly, we shall vacate the order of the hearing judge and remand the case to the Circuit Court to enter an order directing DNA testing on the cigarette lighter. Crim.

Laws, ch. 369, \u00a7 1, which took effect on October 1, 2015, before Appellant filed his petition for DNA testing. Accordingly, any reference made to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 in this opinion is to the version of the statute current through the date of this opinion, unless otherwise specifically noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\">.

All of the evidentiary items at issue in this case, the Forever 21 bag, the cigarette pack, and the lighter, meet the statutory definition of \"scientific identification evidence.\u201d Md. Code (2001, 2008 Repl. VoL, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>2015 Supp.), \u00a7 8-201(a)(5). These items are related to the investigation of Appellant to the extent that the police collected these items from the scene of crime for processing. <em>See generally, Wallace v. State, </em>452 Md. 558, 576-78, 158 A.3d 521, 2017 WL 1422828 *8 (2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">. <em>See </em>2008 Laws of Maryland, chap. 337, \u00a7 1, <em>abrogated </em>December 31, 2013. <em>See id., </em>\u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b229-5\">. This is only true with respect to the cigarette lighter. Under our interpretation of the DNA statute, Appellant would not be entitled to testing of the Forever 21 bag and the cigarette pack. Appellant\u2019s contention that the peipetrator \"could have\u201d transferred epithelial cells due to his \"proximity\u201d to these items speaks to a mere <em>possibility </em>and is insufficient to satisfy the <em>reasonable probability </em>standard. These items were items that the peipetrator could have <em>possibly </em>or <em>conceivably </em>come into contact with, but the trial record in this case contains no evidence that the peipetrator actually did come into contact with these items. Unlike the cigarette lighter in this case, the absence of Appellant\u2019s DNA on these items would not tend to establish that he was not the perpetrator of this crime, as the perpetrator of this crime was never alleged to or shown to have come into contact with these items.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
