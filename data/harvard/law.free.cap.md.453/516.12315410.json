(\u201cDonaldson\u201d), filed a conditional use application with the Board, seeking to build a funeral home and mortuary. The proposed site was a 3.207 parcel of land located on the western side of Maryland Route 108 and close to a stream system protected by the Maryland Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d). The proposed conditional use plan was initially denied by the Howard County Board of Appeals Hearing Examiner (\u201cHearing Examiner\u201d), but Donaldson appealed <em>de novo </em>to the Board. The Board held public hearings spanning a total of 22 days between January, 2012 and April, 2013. After two revisions, the Board approved Donaldson\u2019s conditional use application on July 13, 2013, subject to several conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">On August 2, 2013, community members who participated in the public hearings filed a petition for judicial review in the circuit court. Following a hearing on March 14, 2014, the circuit court issued an order on September 15, 2014, affirming the Board\u2019s decision. The community members appealed and on July 20, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported decision, upheld the Board\u2019s approval of Donaldson\u2019s conditional use. Thereafter, the community members filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">I. The Property</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In December 2009, Donaldson filed a proposed conditional use plan (\u201cConditional Use Plan\u201d) for a funeral home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>mortuary with the Board. The proposed site for the funeral home is a 3.207 acre parcel located at 12540 Clarksville Pike (\u201cthe Property\u201d) on the western side of Maryland Route 108 in the RR-DEO zoning district.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Property is located in the Carroll Branch watershed with two perennial Tier II streams located along the western edge of the Property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Property is bordered by St. Louis Catholic Church directly to the north, and Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church of Columbia (\u201cChrist Lutheran Church\u201d) to the south. On the eastern side of Route 108, across from the Property, there is a two-story single family home setback 180 feet from Route 108. To the west of the Property, there is a 42.44-acre non-buildable preservation parcel owned by Howard County. Several housing developments are in the vicinity of the Property, including the Preserve of Clarksville development to the west of the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>buildable parcel, the Clarks Glen housing developments to the north of St. Louis Church, and the Clarksville Overlook housing development to the south of Christ Lutheran Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Donaldson proposes to construct an approximately 17,049 square foot funeral home and mortuary on the Property. The funeral home would be approximately 135 feet in length, from east to west, 70 feet wide, from north to south, and approximately 32.5 feet tall. The funeral home would be situated in the southeastern section of the Property, approximately 125 feet from Route 108 and 30 feet from the southern lot line. The funeral home is designed to be compatible in scale and character with the residential development in the vicinity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Viewings would be held on the Property between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., Sunday through Friday, and funeral services between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Outside of those times, fewer people would be on the Property for general office and business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Pursuant to Howard County Code (\u201cHCC\u201d) \u00a7 16.302(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> between April 26 and October 25, 2010, the Hearing Examiner considered the Conditional Use Plan. On March 17, 2010, the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning (\u201cDPZ\u201d) issued their Technical Staff Report (\u201cTSR\u201d), recommending that the Conditional Use Plan be approved, subject to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>conditions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On November 29, 2010, the Hearing Examiner denied the Conditional Use Plan, prompting Donaldson to appeal to the Board for a <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Between January 10, 2012 and April 30, 2013, the Board held hearings on the Conditional Use Plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Clarksville Residents Against the Mortuary, Inc., et al. (\u201cPetitioners\u201d) participated in the proceedings as members in opposition to the Conditional Use Plan. During the proceedings, Donaldson submitted two revised proposed conditional use plans, the first on January 10, 2012, and the second on August 23, 2012 (hereinafter \u201cRevised Plan\u201d). The DPZ subsequently issued two addendums to its TSR, the first on February 1, 2012, and the second on August 23, 2012. The DPZ concluded in both addendums that Donaldson\u2019s proposed conditional use met the General Standards and Specific Criteria for a funeral home and mortuary conditional use, and recommended the plan be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On July 3, 2013, the Board issued a Decision and Order finding that the Revised Plan met all of the legal criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the conditional use. The Board granted Donaldson\u2019s conditional use, subject to several conditions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of its decision, the Board, in relevant part, rendered the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">[Robert] Vogel[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] also stated that the [Revised] Plan is consistent with the General Plan given that legislation had recently been proposed to remove the funeral home conditional use from the RR-DEO zone, but DPZ and [the Board] recommended against its enactment. According to Mr. Vogel, this action by County planning agencies affirmed that funeral homes are important in the RR-DEO zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u215d sfc \u215d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Testifying regarding potential adverse impacts, Mr. Vogel provided a lighting plan that would generate no light trespass beyond the parking lot. Mr. Vogel testified that the adverse effects of noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions would not be greater at the Property than they would generally be elsewhere in the RR-DEO zone or applicable other zones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">Shun Lu testified that she is a resident of Clarksville, Maryland, and that she is opposed to the petition. Ms. Lu testified that persons of Asian descent have a cultural sensitivity to funeral homes and that she believed it to be bad luck to live close to a funeral home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u00be{ iji \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">[Dr. Peter] Li [] testified that funeral homes are not compatible with nearby residences from a feng shui[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">Marianne Lee testified that she is a resident of Clarksville, Maryland, and that she is opposed to the petition. Ms. Lee testified that persons of Asian descent have a cultural sensitivity to funeral homes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">Anthony Redman, a professional land planner, testified that he believed the Property to be too small for the proposed use. Mr. Redman stated that he believed that MDE could require a 150 feet buffer from the stream tributary running along the west side of the Property instead of the 100 foot buffer shown on the Plan. Mr. Redman testified that the stream is a Tier II stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAL-\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Tira Liang testified that she is a resident of Clarksville, Maryland, and that she is opposed to the petition .... Ms. Ming [sic] stated that she was also concerned with the potential environmental impacts of the Funeral Home. Richard Klein, a professional environmental consultant, testified that he believed the Property might not be able to satisfy environmental site design standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAkdA\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">On rebuttal ... Mr. Vogel stated that he visited the Property and that no wetlands or wetlands buffers existed on the Property. Regarding potential impacts to the Tier II stream, Mr. Vogel testified that the purpose of the 100 foot buffer was to protect the stream. So long as [Donaldson] complied with the imposed buffer, according to Mr. Vogel, the stream would not be adversely impacted .... Finally, Mr. Vogel testified that persons of Asian descent moved into new homes located in close proximity to two existing funeral homes on Old Columbia Pike in Ellicott City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">* \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">On rebuttal, Mark Burchick, an environmental consultant, testified that the stream buffer would be 100 feet from the unnamed tributary located at the northwest corner of the Property. [Mr.] Burchick stated that even if a temporary encroachment into the buffer was necessary during the site development process, MDE would be unlikely to impose a greater buffer from the stream tributary, Mr. Burchick testified that the 100 foot stream buffer shown on the Plan would be sufficient to prevent deleterious impacts to the stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">On rebuttal, Jennifer Yocum, a feng shui consultant, testified that [Donaldson] incorporated into the Plan several features Ms. Yocum proposed in order to improve the feng shui of the Funeral Home. Ms. Yocum testified that she did not believe the Funeral Home would adversely impact nearby residents from a feng shui perspective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The Board based its conclusions of law exclusively on the General Standards for Conditional Use Approval contained in Howard County Zoning Regulation (\u201cHCZR\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u00a7 131.B and the Specific Criteria for Funeral Homes and Mortuaries contained in HCZR \u00a7 131.N.22. In relevant part, the Board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">[Donaldson\u2019s Revised] Plan is in harmony with the land uses and policies indicated in Howard County\u2019s General Plan, PlanHoward2030, for the RR-DEO zoning district. Funeral homes and mortuaries that satisfy the conditional use requirements of the [HCZR] are presumed to promote the general welfare of the community and the RR-DEO zoning district. Evidence was produced before the Board indicating that legislation had been proposed to remove the funeral home and mortuary conditional use from the RR-DEO zoning district. [The Board] and DPZ, however, recommended against such removal, and the legislation was not enacted. These actions by agencies charged with planning responsibilities for the County confirm that funeral homes and mortuaries are important in the County\u2019s RR-DEO zoning district and are consistent with the policy goals of the General Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">2. Adverse Effect: Section 131.B .2 of the [HCZR] provides, in pertinent part, the Board shall have the power to permit a conditional use provided that the proposed location will not have adverse effects on vicinal properties above and beyond those ordinarily associated with such uses. In evaluating the Plan under this standard, the Board shall consider the following four adverse effect criteria: (a) physical conditions; (b) structures, walls, fences, and landscaping; (c) parking areas, loading areas, driveways, and refuse areas; and (d) safe access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>When assessing a proposed conditional use under these criteria, the Board must begin with the realization that virtually every human activity has the potential for adverse impact. Zoning recognizes this fact and, when concerned with conditional uses, accepts some level of such impact in light of the beneficial purposes the zoning body has determined to be inherent in the use. Thus, the question before the Board is not whether the proposed use would have adverse effects in an RR-DEO zoning district. The proper question is whether those inherent adverse effects are greater at the proposed Property than they would be generally elsewhere within the RR-DEO zoning district. <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981); <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 666 A.2d 1253 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA2I\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">Much of the testimony presented by the [Petitioners] amounted only to unsupported opinions and conclusions. Unsupported conclusions or fears of witnesses to the effect that a proposed use of property will or will not result in harm amount to nothing more than vague and general expressions of opinion that are lacking in probative value. <em>Anderson v. Sawyer, </em>23 Md.App. 612, 329 A.2d 716 (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">[T]he [Revised] Plan complies with all legally imposed stream buffer requirements. [Petitioners] presented no credible testimony that the stream buffer would be increased, or that adverse impacts would occur to the stream irrespective of the Petitioner\u2019s adherence to the legally imposed buffer. [Donaldson\u2019s] witnesses, on the other hand, testified that the proposed use as shown on the Plan would not result in adverse impacts on the stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">The Board further concludes that the cultural sensitivities testified to by various [Petitioners] is not a \u201cphysical condition\u201d to be considered pursuant to [HCZR] Section 131.-B.2.a. Even if it were a relevant consideration, the Board considered the totality of the evidence presented in this case and is not persuaded that the proposed use will create an adverse cultural impact on vicinal properties or that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>impact will be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with funeral home and mortuary uses in the RR-DEO zoning district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">$ \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">On August 2, 2013, Petitioners filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Howard County. On March 14, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing, and on September 15, 2014, issued an order affirming the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">On October 15, 2014, Petitioners filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>See Clarksville Residents Against Mortuary Defense Fund, Inc., et al. v. Donaldson Properties, et al., </em>No. 1762, Sept. Term 2014 (filed July 20, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Additional facts shall be provided, <em>infra, </em>to the extent they prove relevant in addressing the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">When reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, \u201cwe look \u2018through the circuit court\u2019s and intermediate appellate court\u2019s decisions, although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate[ ] the decision of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Loyola Coll. of Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166, 173 (2008) (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007)). Judicial review of an administrative agency decision is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised on an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assur. v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999) (quoting <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test requires a reviewing court to decide \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380 (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Woods Apts., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)). \u201cIn applying the substantial evidence test, we have emphasized that a \u2018court should [not] substitute its judgment for the <em>expertise </em>of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198, 210 (1993) (quoting <em>Bullock, </em>283 Md. at 513, 390 A.2d at 1124)). We also review \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct, ... and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d at 210. No deference is owed, however, when the local zoning board\u2019s decisions are based on an error of law. <em>See Loyola Coll. of Md., </em>406 Md. at 68, 956 A.2d at 174 (quoting <em>Belvoir Farms Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

In contrast, Donaldson and the Board argue that HCZR \u00a7 130.C is a general provision that relates to \u201cpublic health, safety, security or general welfare,\u201d whereas, HCZR \u00a7 131.B and \u00a7 131.-N.22 provide tailored standards for approving conditional uses, and specifically conditional use approval for a funeral home. Donaldson and the Board contend that it is a basic principle of statutory construction that specific provisions of an enactment control over provisions that are more general in nature; and therefore, HCZR \u00a7 131 governs consideration of conditional uses, not HCZR \u00a7 130.C.

In <em>Schultz, </em>we concluded that our precedent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIZ\">establishes] that a special exception use has an adverse effect and must be denied when it is determined from the facts and circumstances that the grant of the requested special exception use would result in an adverse effect upon adjoining and surrounding properties unique and different from the adverse effect that would otherwise result from the development of such a special exception use located anywhere within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327.

In <em>Loyola Coll, of Md., </em>we clarified that the language in <em>Schultz </em>regarding \u201cadverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated\u201d with a conditional use is best understood in the context of the local legislature\u2019s intent. We determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AldP\">[t]he local legislature, when it determines to adopt or amend the text of a zoning ordinance with regard to designating various uses as allowed only by special exception in various zones, considers in the generic sense that certain adverse effects, at least in type, potentially associated with (inherent to, if you will) these uses are likely to occur wherever in the particular zone they may be located. In that sense, the local legislature puts on its \u2018Sorting Hat\u2019 and separates permitted uses, special exceptions, and all other uses. That is why the uses are designated special exception uses, not permitted uses. The inherent effects notwithstanding, the legislative determination necessarily is that the uses conceptually are compatible in the particular zone with otherwise permitted uses and with surrounding zones and uses already in place, provided that, at a given location, adduced evidence does not convince the body to whom the power to grant or deny individual applications is given that actual incompatibility would occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><em>Loyola Coll. in Md., </em>406 Md. at 105-06, 956 A.2d at 197-98 (footnotes omitted).

In support of this view, Petitioners rely on the decision in <em>Mills v. </em>Godlove,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>where the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the zoning board \u201cdid not sufficiently discuss the adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with a storage yard.\u201d 200 Md.App. at 239, 26 A.3d at 1049. Petitioners contend that the case at bar is analogous to <em>Mills </em>because the Board did not identify or determine what the ordinary or inherent adverse effects of a funeral home might be. Instead, Petitioners argue that the Board merely offered the general premise that it \u201cbegin[s] with the realization that virtually every human activity has the potential for adverse impact. Zoning recognizes this fact and, when concerned with conditional uses, accepts some level of such impact in light of the beneficial purposes the zoning body has determined to be inherent in the use.\u201d Petitioners acknowledge, however, that the Board considered \u201cnoise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions\u201d as \u201cpotential adverse impacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In contrast, Donaldson argues that the Board properly considered the adverse impact of the proposed funeral home, including evaluation of: (1) the noise, dust, odors, lighting, vibrations, and fumes; (2) the adverse environmental impact; (3) the adverse impact related to cultural sensitivities; (4) the adverse impact related to structures, walls, and fences; (5) the adverse impact related to parking areas, loading areas, driveways, and refuse areas; and (6) the adverse traffic impacts. <em>See </em>HCZR \u00a7 131.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Donaldson also contends that <em>Mills </em>was not intended to create a formulaic approach that required the Board to first identify all of the adverse impacts generally associated with a funeral home and then systematically deconstruct or refute such adverse impacts to arrive at the Board\u2019s ultimate conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>sion. Instead, Donaldson argues the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Mills </em>was based on its assessment that the zoning board\u2019s conclusions \u201cwere insufficient because it merely presented conclusions without pointing to any evidentiary basis.\u201d 200 Md.App. at 236, 26 A.3d at 1048. Donaldson avers that the purpose behind requiring detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law in the decisions and orders of an administrative agency is to permit a party to the proceedings \u201cto be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision\u201d and to \u201cpermit meaningful judicial review of those findings.\u201d <em>Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., </em>322 Md. 493, 506, 588 A.2d 772, 778 (1991). Donaldson argues that ultimately, the test is whether the Board\u2019s decision regarding adverse impacts was carefully evaluated and sufficient to permit meaningful judicial review, which it contends, the Board did. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In <em>Schultz, </em>we recognized that in designating a conditional use, the local legislature \u201cconsiders the variety of possible uses available, examines the impact of uses upon the various purposes of the zoning ordinance, determines which uses are compatible with each other and can share reciprocal benefits, and decides which uses will provide for coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development of the district.\u201d <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 22, 432 A.2d at 1330.

Because Petitioners interpret the enumerated considerations contained in HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a to constitute a minimum set of considerations, they argue the Board \u201cerroneously discounted the cultural sensitivity issue as \u2018not a physical condition\u2019 and therefore not an adverse effect to be considered.\u201d In further support of their view, Petitioners also note that HCZR \u00a7 131.A states that \u201cparticular uses in particular locations may have characteristics or impacts that are not typical.\u201d Petitioners contend that the Hearing Authority cannot address atypical \u201ccharacteristics or impacts\u201d if it limits its inquiry to the boilerplate \u201cphysical\u201d considerations enumerated in HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a. .</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Petitioners also rely on language in HCZR \u00a7 100.A, stating that the legislative intent of the HCZR is to \u201cpreserv[e] and promot[e] the health, safety, and welfare of the community.\u201d Petitioners argue that health is not solely impacted by physical conditions, and that the \u201cextraordinary adverse effect on the mental health of the Asian community not only may be considered, but <em>must </em>be considered in light of the testimony and evidence before the Board.\u201d Petitioners aver the Board should have compared the adverse effects of the funeral home at the proposed location with the ordinary or inherent effects of a funeral home, including the depressive effects acknowledged in <em>Sawyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Donaldson and the Board both argue that because cultural sensitivities are not a \u201cphysical condition\u201d, it would be impossible for Donaldson to prove the proposed funeral home would not offend a particular person or group of people. Donaldson contends that Petitioners\u2019 view would require it to somehow know about and consider the \u201cheightened, extraordinary hypersensitivities of nearby residents, even though Donaldson (and any other conditional use applicant) would never be able to prove that a particular use would not offend a particular person or group of people, who ... claim a heightened aversion to such use.\u201d Donaldson also argues it is unaware of any Maryland case addressing whether a resident\u2019s subjective hypersensitivity is a permissible factor to consider as part of the <em>Schultz </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Donaldson analogizes the issue at bar to the law of nuisance,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> arguing that, like in the law of nuisance, an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>standard should be applied to the <em>Schultz </em>test because it would allow the conditional use applicant, in evaluating a particular property, \u201cto determine whether those normal effects might be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with the use and to mitigate any such effects to the fullest extent possible.\u201d Donaldson contends that if a subjective requirement\u2014like cultural sensitivity\u2014was applicable, a conditional use applicant would not be able, and cannot be expected, to plan for and mitigate impacts that might arise due to a property owner\u2019s unknowable hypersensitivities.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Board and Donaldson also argue that, even if cultural sensitivities were a valid consideration pursuant to the <em>Schultz </em>\u201cadverse effects\u201d test, the Board properly concluded that under the \u201ctotality of the evidence,\u201d the proposed use will not create an adverse impact on vicinal properties above and beyond those ordinarily associated with a funeral home. Donaldson acknowledges that testimony was presented regarding the cultural aversion to the death industry by some members of the Asian community, but argues it presented ample rebuttal testimony, and notes the Board\u2019s Decision and Order contained factual findings that were derived from testimony produced by both Donaldson and the Petitioners. Donaldson and the Board contend that while Petitioners may disagree with how the Board weighed the evidence and reached its conclusion, the evidence presented by Donaldson was sufficient to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the proposed use would not adversely affect vicinal properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We ordinarily give an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>considerable weight. <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381. As noted, <em>supra, </em>HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9hK\">2. The proposed use at the proposed location will not have adverse effects on vicinal properties above and beyond those ordinarily associated with such uses. In evaluating the plan under this standard, the Hearing Authority shall consider whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">a. The impact of adverse effects such as noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions will be greater at the subject site than it would generally be elsewhere in the zone or applicable other zones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In the case at bar, the Board concluded in its Decision and Order that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">the cultural sensitivities testified to by various [Petitioners] is not a \u201cphysical condition\u201d to be considered pursuant to [HCZR] Section 131.B.2.a. Even if it were a relevant consideration, the Board considered the totality of the evidence presented in this case and is not persuaded that the proposed use will create an adverse cultural impact on vicinal properties or that such impact will be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with funeral home and mortuary uses in the RR-DEO zoning district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We conclude that the Board did not err in determining that HCZR \u00a7 131.B, incorporating the <em>Schultz </em>\u201cadverse effects\u201d test, only required it to consider the enumerated considerations contained in the regulation because the plain language of the regulation supports that finding and we will defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. <em>See Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381. We further conclude that because the <em>Schultz </em>\u201cadverse effects\u201d test exists -within a county\u2019s regulatory scheme governing conditional uses, Petitioners were required to demonstrate a substantial nexus between their assertion of a \u201ccultural aversion to the death industry\u201d and the enumerated considerations in HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a, of \u201cnoise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions.\u201d Because the community members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>failed to present substantial evidence connecting their \u201ccultural sensitivities\u201d to any of the enumerated conditions contained in HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude the Board did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Additionally, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the Howard County Council, in approving funeral homes as a conditional use, already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>balanced the impact a funeral home would have on the general welfare and whether the use was compatible with the permitted uses in the RR-DEO zone. <em>See Loyola Coll. in Md., </em>406 Md. at 106, 956 A.2d at 198; <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d at 1325. The Board was not required, therefore, to consider the language contained in HCZR \u00a7 100,A, unless Petitioners presented evidence of a unique adverse effect to a \u201cphysical eondition[,]\u201d which they did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that because the community members did not provide a substantial nexus between their \u201ccultural aversion to the death industry\u201d and the enumerated considerations the Board was required to consider in HCZR \u00a7 131.B.2.a, the Board did not err in concluding that the Revised Plan would not \u201ccreate an adverse cultural impact on vicinal properties or that such impact will be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with funeral home and mortuary uses in the RR-DEO zoning district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">C. Removal of Natural Forest from Tier II Stream to Accommodate Funeral Home Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Finally, the fourth question presented for our review asks whether the Board satisfied the <em>Schultz </em>\u201cadverse effects\u201d test \u201cwhen it approved the removal of a natural forest along a Tier II stream to accommodate construction of the [fluneral [h]ome[,]\u201d Petitioners argue the Board erroneously approved the Revised Plan even though, according to Petitioners, the Revised Plan would remove a significant swath of the Property\u2019s naturally wooded riparian buffer. In support of its allegation that the Revised Plan calls for deforestation, Petitioners note that the Revised Plan shows fifty feet of natural forest on the western edge of the Property, whereas the preexisting naturally forested stream buffer shown in Donaldson\u2019s aerial map showed a width of 100 feet or more.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Petitioners aver the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Board never acknowledged that the Revised Plan contemplated the removal of natural forest from the riparian buffer in its Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">As both the Board and Donaldson argue, Petitioners\u2019 allegation is without merit. In its Decision and Order, the Board noted that \u201cMr. Vogel testified that the purpose of the 100 foot buffer was to protect the stream[;]\u201d and Mr. Burchick testified that \u201cthe stream buffer would be 100 feet from the unnamed tributary located at the northwest corner of the Property.\u201d Based on this testimony, the Board concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqmI\">the Plan complies with all legally imposed stream buffer requirements. [Petitioners] presented no credible testimony that the stream buffer would be increased, or that adverse impacts would occur to the stream irrespective of the Petitioner\u2019s adherence to the legally imposed buffer. [Donaldson\u2019s] witnesses, on the other hand, testified that the proposed use as shown on the Plan would not result in adverse impacts on the stream.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Nothing in the record reflects that Donaldson proposed to clear fifty feet of forested stream buffer in order to develop the funeral home. Because there is no indication from the record that Donaldson intends to remove trees from the stream buffer, Petitioners allegations that the Board failed to consider such action is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In summary, we hold that the Board properly analyzed Donaldson\u2019s Revised Plan pursuant to the specific statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>requirements contained in HCZR \u00a7 131.B and \u00a7 131.N.22 and was not required to consider the standards contained in the more general regulation HCZR \u00a7 130.C. We also hold that the <em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>\u201cadverse effects\u201d test does not require the Board to initially determine what the inherent or ordinary adverse effects in a conditional use are because those adverse effects were previously identified and weighed by the local legislature in deciding whether the use is compatible with other permitted uses within a given zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">We also hold that the Board properly concluded that the evidence of \u201ccultural sensitivit[y]\u201d was not sufficient relative to a denial of Donaldson\u2019s conditional use because the testimony provided by several members of the Asian community, explaining their \u201ccultural aversion to the death industry[,]\u201d failed to provide a substantial nexus between their \u201ccultural sensitivities\u201d and the conditions the Board was required to consider in deciding to grant or deny a conditional use. <em>See </em>HCZR \u00a7 131.B. Absent a substantial nexus between the community members\u2019 assertion of a \u201ccultural aversion to the death industry\u201d and the enumerated considerations the Board was required to consider in HCZR \u00a7 131.B, the Board did not err in concluding that the Revised Plan would not \u201ccreate an adverse cultural impact on vicinal properties or that such impact will be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with funeral home and mortuary uses in the RR-DEO zoning district.\u201d Finally, we conclude there is no merit to Petitioners\u2019 argument that the Board ignored Donaldson\u2019s alleged intent to remove fifty feet of trees from the stream buffer because there is no evidence Donaldson proposed to do so, and substantial evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Revised Plan contemplates a 100-foot stream buffer in compliance with State requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Watts, J., concurs</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">, Pursuant to Howard County Zoning Regulation (\"HCZR\u201d) \u00a7 105.0 the Rural Residential District was established</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">to allow low density residential development within a rural environment. The Rural Residential District is intended for an area of the County which is already largely committed to low density residential subdivisions. Within the RR District, agriculture is permitted as well as residential development in both cluster and non-cluster forms. Cluster development is permitted in order to protect environmental and landscape resources and to preserve agricultural land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Pursuant to HCZR \u00a7 106.0, the DEO Overlay District was established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to provide land owners in the RC and RR Districts with opportunity and incentive to preserve significant blocks of farmland in the rural area of the county. This district is also intended to encourage the clustering of residential development in areas where the development will not have an adverse impact on farm operations. To accomplish this, the DEO District allows residential density in the RC and RR Districts to be exchanged between parcels. Density exchanges in the District should result in large parcels being preserved in perpetuity, while residential development is directed toward parcels which are able to absorb the additional dwellings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-4\">. The RR-DEO district authorizes funeral homes as a conditional use. <em>See </em>HCZR \u00a7 105.G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. The Maryland Department of the Environment defines a Tier II stream as those streams \u201c[w]here water quality is better than the minimum requirements specified by the water quality standards[ ]\u201d and requires that the water quality in those streams be maintained. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.08.02.04-1A. Mark Burchick (\"Mr. Burchick\u201d), an environmental consultant who testified before the Board on behalf of Donaldson, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">The Maryland Department of the Environment has a Division called the Science of Service Center, and they\u2019ve gone out and done various exhaustive studies related to what they call the index of biological integrity. And they look at two parameters\u2014fish and aquatic insects. They call those benthics (?), and when you walk a reach of stream, and you go into the pools and up under undercuts where the fish live and you electroshock it, and you grab the fish, if you get just one species, a rosy side dace, that\u2019s not necessarily a great biological indicator of a really good stream. But if you find six or seven species and you get a good number of those each, that kind of suggests that that stream has a much higher water quality. Then they do the same thing for aquatic insects. If you get just a bunch of worms, that\u2019s not going to be too good, but if you start getting the aquatic insects with two and three tails and a diversity of them, that denotes relative health based on the diversity that you\u2019re getting. So in a Tier II stream, they get these IBI scores, Indicators of Biological Integrity, that are really high. And one of those streams happens to be Carrolls Branch, which is the named tributary for which this watershed, where the Donaldson Funeral Home is, goes through.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">.

The record reflects that multiple community members testified regarding their cultural aversions to the proposed funeral home. For example, Peter Li shared a story about Confucius, told to him as a child, whereby:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">Confucius\u2019 mother relocate[ed Confucius] three times. So first his family lived next to a butcher store. And the young Confucius picked up very quickly all the skill set for a butcher. And the mother noticed his narrow focus on things that violent, so immediately moved the family to another location, this time next to a funeral home. And the young Confucius now became fascinated with playing the sad music and mimicking the weeping and crying. One thing I do want to share with the Board member here is that Chinese... when Chinese go to funeral, they are actually encouraged to express their emotion openly. So you do see a lot of crying and weeping in the ceremony like that. So it\u2019s somewhat different. All we hear is more sad, calm, but you don\u2019t really see the open bursts of emotion. So when.. .when the mother noticed that young Confucius became fascinated with playing the sad music and all that weeping and all that, the mother moved the family away again because she doesn\u2019t really want the son to have that depressing aspect of the nature. And this time they moved right next to a well respected school. And then after moving, the young man now basically lost the focus on the violence or deaths or depressing nature of side of it and got very deeply into academic learning and family basically after that stay. And we all know now that Confucius is revered for his teaching on family value, education, and giving back to society. Many of our Asian people here in opposition to proposed funeral home have moved to this area for this sense of community and the environment that allows our children to focus on positives like education and then to avoid the negatives we associate with end of the life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Marianne Lee testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">I think the main reason I've already stated and the Board has already heard which is really significant fact personally for me and having spoken with other of my Asian neighbors is that you just, I personally would not want to live near a funeral home.

But we both grew up in the Korean American tradition and have assimilated here but yet maintained traditions with one of them being that you don\u2019t live near a funeral home, a cemetery or things related to death. And I don\u2019t want to bore the Board but I do want to somewhat, I guess, shed light on the issue as to why there\u2019s such a big brouhaha in the Asian community about funeral homes which predates, well just the historical, particularly with the Korean Community, the Buddhist history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai3o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>That within your body you have a soul and a spirit and when you die the spirit exits. And that there is good and bad spirits and the bad spirits will then haunt the adjoining properties or properties further down. And so therefore in Korea there are no funeral homes, there are no cemeteries in any residential areas. In fact, those of my family members who are Korean are either cremated and their ashes are thrown in the mountain or the ocean. Or they are buried in a further site, generally in the countryside or in mountains. And similarly that tradition has been carried over. And having talked with my neighbors I think this is pretty much the similar reasoning for the Chinese Community and the Indian Community. I think the Chinese Community describes it as a feng shui.

I have no objection to them because I know they have lost their loved one. And I can fully relate to them and their feeling. It is so painful to say the final goodbye. How am I going to enjoy even my back yard or my house. I and my husband, we are both first generation immigrants. We just invested all our life saving, working hard in the United States, to purchase the current home without knowing Donaldson\u2019s plan. We like Clarksville because of the beautiful rural surrounding. And we would like to retire there. It is our American dream.

I ana in accord with the outcome reached by the majority opinion. I write separately, however, to explain my reasons for agreeing that an impact on a community\u2019s cultural sensitivities may be considered under Howard County Zoning Regulation (\u201cHCZR\u201d) (2012) \u00a7 131.-B.2.&amp;.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 agree with the majority opinion\u2019s discussion on cultural sensitivities, see Maj.

Op. at 553, 162 A.3d at 951. In other words, I agree with the Majority\u2019s holding, but I write separately to describe, from my perspective, the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d necessary to have an alleged impact on cultural sensitivities considered under HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">I would hold that, under a plain reading of HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a, if the impact of adverse effects such as noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical <em>conditions\u2014i.e., </em>the impact of adverse effects of the type identified in HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a\u2014bears on a particular community\u2019s cultural sensitivities and the impact of those adverse effects will be greater at the subject site than it generally would be elsewhere due to the community\u2019s cultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sensitivities then the Hearing Authority must consider the community\u2019s cultural sensitivities in determining whether to permit the proposed conditional use. In other words, where, due to a community\u2019s cultural sensitivities, the impact of adverse effects of factors such as noise, fumes, et cetera, is greater at the subject site than it generally would be elsewhere, the Hearing Authority may not discard the impact on the community\u2019s cultural sensitivities in determining whether the proposed use will have an adverse effect on vicinal properties above those ordinarily associated with such uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B set forth the general standards required for approval of a conditional use and stated, among other things, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">The Hearing Authority shall have the power to permit conditional uses, provided the following general standards are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pALq\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">2. The proposed use at the proposed location will not have adverse effects on vicinal properties above and beyond those ordinarily associated with such uses. In evaluating the plan under this standard, the Hearing Authority shall consider whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">a. The impact of adverse effects such as noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions will be greater at the subject site than it would generally be elsewhere in the zone or applicable other zones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The plain language of HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a requires the Hearing Authority to consider the impact of adverse effects and whether the adverse effects would be above and beyond those ordinarily associated with the proposed use, <em>ie., </em>a conditional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Significantly, the question before the Court is not whether cultural sensitivities is one of the factors or conditions to be considered under HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a. Stated otherwise, the question is not whether cultural sensitivities is an identified or proper factor for <em>consideration\u2014ie., </em>an adverse effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>in and of itself\u2014akin to noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards, and other physical conditions. Rather, the question is whether the impact of factors such as noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards, or other physical conditions will have an adverse effect on vicinal properties above and beyond those ordinarily associated with the proposed conditional use. This includes consideration of whether an adverse impact is greater due to cultural sensitivities where such evidence is presented before the Hearing Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a does not limit the Hearing Authority to merely concluding or determining whether there will be an adverse effect of a physical type. Indeed, it is evident that HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a\u2019s provision that the \u201cimpact of adverse effects\u201d be considered is not limited to simply considering whether there is noise or not, or whether there are fumes or not. Instead, consideration of the \u201cimpact of adverse effects\u201d must be taken into account. Under a plain reading of HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a, if the impact of adverse effects such as noise or <em>fumes\u2014ie., </em>the type of adverse effects identified in HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a\u2014bears on a particular community\u2019s cultural sensitivities and the impact will be greater at the subject site due to those sensitivities, then the Hearing Authority must consider the impact on the community\u2019s cultural sensitivities in determining whether to permit the proposed conditional use. Importantly, holding as much would not preclude the Hearing Authority from considering the impact of physical conditions on vicinal properties or otherwise limit or expand what the Hearing Authority may consider as an impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In this case, in agreement with the Majority, I would conclude that Petitioners did not present evidence of repercussions to their cultural sensitivities in accord with HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B.2.a because they failed to tie the alleged affront to their cultural sensitivities to the impact of adverse effects such as noise, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards or other physical conditions. Here, as the majority opinion recounts, some members of the community testified generally about the deep-seated cultural aversion to the death industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>that certain Asian cultures have and that they generally were opposed to having a funeral home located so close to their residences. See Maj. Op. at 551-53 n.18, 162 A.3d at 950-51 n.18. Those community members, however, failed to provide any indication that untoward noises, dust, fumes, odors, lighting, vibrations, hazards, or other physical conditions would have any consequence at all to their cultural sensitivities, let alone a greater impact at the subject site due to their cultural sensitivities such that the Hearing Authority should have considered as much when determining whether to permit the conditional use. For example, had the community members testified that their cultural sensitivities would be impacted due to the circumstance that they would be able to detect untoward odors emanating from the funeral home, and that the impact at the subject site was greater than it would be elsewhere, then the Hearing Authority would necessarily have needed to consider such an impact under HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.-B.2.a. However, as stated, the community members in this case testified only to a general opposition and dislike to residing near a funeral home.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Accordingly, I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s discussion on cultural sensitivities, see Maj. Op. at 548-54, 162 A.3d at 948-52, and its determination that the community members did not provide a substantial nexus between their \u201ccultural aversion to the death industry\u201d and the enumerated considerations the Board was required to consider in HCZR \u00a7 131.-B.2.a. Maj. Op. at 553, 162 A.3d at 951. I write separately to define, from my view, the \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d required for an alleged impact on cultural sensitivities to be considered under HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.B,2.a.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">. As the majority opinion notes, in 2013, the Howard County Council adopted the current version of the HCZR. See Maj. Op. at 530 n.11, 162 A.3d 937 n.11. As a result of revisions, what was HCZR (2012) \u00a7 131.-B.2.a is now HCZR \u00a7 131.B.3.a, which is substantively identical to the prior version of the regulation. However, because the Board considered the Revised Plan in 2012, I, like the majority opinion, will refer to the HCZR as it existed at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
