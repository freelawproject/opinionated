The employer, on the other hand, seeks to uphold an injunction to prohibit the labor union from holding demonstrations about the employer\u2019s employment conditions on the employer\u2019s private property. United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (\u201cUFCW\u201d), petitioner, is a labor union that represents grocery, retail, meatpacking, and food-processing workers. The other petitioners are a subsidiary of UFCW known as the Organization United for Respect at Walmart (\u201cOURWalmart\u201d), employees of UFCW, a coali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tion of labor organizations known as Jobs with Justice, and demonstrators identified only as \u201cDoes 1-10.\u201d Respondents\u2014 Wal-mart Stores, Inc.; WalMart Stores East, LP; and Sam\u2019s East, Inc. (collectively, \u201cWalmart\u201d)\u2014own and operate approximately sixty retail stores in Maryland. Between 2011 and 2013, UFCW held demonstrations at Walmart stores throughout Maryland, protesting Walmart\u2019s employment conditions. In response, Walmart sued UFCW in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for trespass and nuisance, and sought an injunction against UFCW.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">UFCW filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Walmart\u2019s claims were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d). The circuit court held that Walmart\u2019s claims were not preempted, and denied UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss. Wal-mart filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, in which it argued that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of Maryland\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act (\u201cAIA\u201d). The circuit court agreed with Walmart that the AIA does not apply, and granted the preliminary injunction. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Walmart, and issued a permanent injunction against UFCW. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Before this Court, UFCW argues that the circuit court erred in denying its motion to dismiss, because Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance are preempted by the NLRA. Additionally, UFCW argues that this case involves a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, and that Walmart did not satisfy the AIA\u2019s requirements to receive an injunction. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Walmart\u2019s claims for trespass and nuisance are not preempted by the NLRA, and therefore the circuit court properly denied UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss. Furthermore, we hold that the circuit court was correct in ruling that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">UFCW represents grocery, retail, meatpacking, and food-processing workers. Between 2011 and 2013, UFCW held demonstrations at Walmart stores in thirteen states, including Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Walmart employees are not unionized, and UFCW does not seek to represent them. UFCW claims that the purpose of its demonstrations was to persuade Walmart to improve employment conditions and to stop retaliating against employees who speak out for better conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">UFCWs demonstrations in Maryland took place between July 16, 2011 and September 6, 2013, at seven Walmart stores located in Arbutus, Bowie, Germantown, Hanover, Landover Hills, Laurel, and Severn. Most demonstrations took place inside the stores; some took place in adjacent parking areas owned or leased by Walmart; and one took place on a public road near one of the stores. The demonstrations were organized as \u201cflash mobs,\u201d meaning the demonstrators were notified by social media or cell phone text messages to quickly gather at a particular store.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The demonstrators then arrived at the store <em>en masse </em>in a coordinated effort. During the demonstrations, they marched through the stores\u2014chanting, singing, blowing whistles, shouting into bullhorns and megaphones, and littering the stores with flyers. On some occasions, demonstrators inside the stores interrupted management meetings by forcing themselves into the meeting rooms and videotaping the managers\u2019 efforts to get them to leave. Some of the demonstrations lasted only fifteen to twenty minutes, while others lasted over an hour and included over one hundred demonstrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>During many of the demonstrations, the demonstrators interfered with customers by blocking access to the cash registers and restrooms. In some cases, customers with items in their shopping carts left the store without purchasing any items. For example, during a demonstration at the Laurel Walmart on July 16, 2011, forty demonstrators wearing OUR-Walmart t-shirts formed a human chain stretching from the first to the last checkout counter. In some instances, the demonstrators also blocked ingress and egress to parking lots, parking spaces, and store entrances. During a demonstration in May 2012 at the Bowie Walmart, demonstrators parked a large van decorated with OURWalmart logos in the parking lot. They played OURWalmart videos on a television screen mounted on the van, piped music through speakers, and solicited customers and employees as they passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">At all of the demonstrations, Walmart managers repeatedly told the demonstrators to leave Walmart\u2019s property, but they refused. In each instance, the demonstrators were ultimately removed by the police, but sometimes returned to the same store as soon as the next day. Walmart\u2019s lawyers sent cease and desist letters to counsel for UFCW in October 2011, October 2012, November 2012, and April 2013. UFCW refused to cease the demonstrations absent a court order to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In March 2018, Walmart filed an unfair labor practice (\u201cULP\u201d) charge against UFCW and OURWalmart with the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d). Walmart alleged that UFCW had violated section 8 of the NLRA \u201cby planning, orchestrating, and conducting a series of unauthorized and blatantly trespassory in-store mass demonstrations ... by which the UFCW restrained and coerced [Walmart] employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights\u201d under the NLRA. The ULP charge included a summary of seventy \u201cevents\u201d UFCW had held at Walmart stores in thirteen states, including twelve \u201cevents\u201d in Maryland. The allegations in the ULP charge all pertained to instances in which demonstrators confronted Walmart managers or employees directly, using \u201cin your face\u201d tactics in an effort to intimidate them into supporting UFCW. Demonstrations that did not include such coercive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tactics were not included in the ULP charge. In May 2013, Walmart amended its ULP charge to narrow its scope to several events at a few stores around the country. The amended ULP charge did not include any events at Walmart stores in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">On September 20, 2013, Walmart filed a complaint against UFCW in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its first amended complaint, filed on October 2, 2013, Walmart alleged that UFCW had violated Maryland law \u201cthrough coordinated, statewide acts of trespass,\u201d such as conducting \u201cin-store \u2018flash mobs\u2019\u201d and blocking \u201cingress and egress to parking lots, parking spaces, vehicular traffic, and store entrances.\u201d The amended complaint detailed fifteen demonstrations at seven Walmart stores in Maryland. The complaint set forth claims for trespass and public and private nuisance, and sought nominal damages, a permanent injunction, and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On October 10, 2013, Walmart filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. As part of its motion, Walmart argued that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, and therefore Walmart was not required to satisfy the AIA\u2019s heightened requirements to receive an injunction. On October 25, 2013, UFCW filed a response in opposition to the motion. UFCW responded to Walmart\u2019s argument concerning the AIA that this case does involve a labor dispute, and therefore Walmart must satisfy the heightened requirements in order to receive an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">On November 25 and 26, 2013, the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. First, after hearing argument from both parties, the circuit court ruled that the case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, so Walmart was not required to satisfy its heightened criteria for receiving an injunction. Next, Walmart presented three witnesses, each of whom was cross-examined by UFCW. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court granted the preliminary injunction. In its order, entered on November 26, 2013, the circuit court enjoined UFCW from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">(i) entering on or inside Walmart private property in the State of Maryland to engage in activities such as unlawful picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, \u201cflash mobs,\u201d handbilling, solicitation, customer interference, and manager confrontations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">(ii) entering on or inside Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Maryland without permission or authorization from Walmart for any purpose other than shopping for and/or purchasing merchandise at Walmart\u2019s stores; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">(iii) engaging in any nuisance conduct off Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Maryland which blocks, causes to be blocked, disrupts and/or interferes with Wal-mart customers\u2019 or associates\u2019 access to, or ability to move around on, or enter or exit Walmart private property in the State of Maryland[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Meanwhile, on October 11, 2013, UFCW filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that Walmart\u2019s claims were preempted by the NLRA. On October 28, 2013, Walmart filed a response in opposition to the motion. On November 12, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion, and ruled that Walmart\u2019s claims were not preempted. The circuit court issued an order denying UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss on November 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">On August 19, 2014, after extensive discovery, Walmart and UFCW filed cross-motions for summary judgment. At a hearing on March 3, 2015, the circuit court denied UFCW\u2019s motion and granted Walmart\u2019s motion. On March 16, 2015, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and order to that effect. That same day, the circuit court entered a permanent injunction against UFCW, prohibiting it from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">1. Entering on Walmart\u2019s private property in the State of Maryland to engage in activities such as picketing, patrolling, parading, demonstrations, chanting, \u201cflash mobs,\u201d handbilling, solicitation, customer disruptions, manager del<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>egations or confrontations, or associate engagement for a non-shopping purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">2.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\u201cUFCW\"), 228 </em>Md.App. 203, 137 A.3d 355 (2016). UFCW then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari on July 11, 2016, which we granted on September 2, 2016. <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union v. Wal-Mart, </em>450 Md. 103, 146 A.3d 463 (2016). UFCW presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>1) Did the circuit court err in denying UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on grounds of federal preemption?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">2) Did the circuit court err in ruling that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Whether a federal statute preempts Maryland law is a question of law that this Court reviews <em>de novo. Sweeney v. Savings First Mortg., LLC, </em>388 Md. 319, 326, 879 A.2d 1037 (2005). Similarly, the construction of a Maryland statute, like the AIA, and the determination of whether the statute applies to a particular case, are also questions of law that this Court reviews <em>de novo. See Vu v. Allied Foot &amp; Ankle, P.C., </em>180 Md.App. 663, 677-84, 952 A.2d 379 (2008) (reviewing without deference the circuit court\u2019s determination that the AIA did not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\n<em>A. NLRA Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Congress has the power, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the United States Constitution, to preempt state law. <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 708, 602 A.2d 1191 (1992) (citing <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824)). Federal law preempts state law when \u201cCongress has expressly stated preemptive intent or evidenced an intent to occupy a field,\u201d or when state law conflicts with federal law. <em>Law v. Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local No. 37, </em>373 Md. 459, 466-67, 818 A.2d 1136 (2003). \u201cBecause Congress has never exercised authority to occupy the entire field in the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of labor legislation, the question of whether a certain state action is preempted by federal law is one of congressional intent.\u201d Batson, 325 Md. at 708, 602 A.2d 1191 (citing <em>Malone v. White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504, 98 S.Ct. 1185, 55 L.Ed.2d 443 (1978)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6G\">The enactment of the NLRA in 1935 marked a fundamental change in this Nation\u2019s labor policies. Congress expressly recognized that collective organization of segments of the labor force into bargaining units capable of exercising economic power comparable to that possessed by employers could produce benefits for the. entire economy. Congress determined that those benefits would eventually outweigh the occasional costs of industrial strife associated with the organization of unions and the negotiation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Vane v. Nocella, </em>303 Md. 362, 366, 494 A.2d 181 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In addition, \u201c[t]he NLRA established the NLRB to adjudicate labor disputes between and among employees, unions and employers.\u201d <em>Law, </em>373 Md. at 468, 818 A.2d 1136. As explained by the Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Congress did not merely lay down a substantive rule of law to be enforced by any tribunal competent to apply law generally to the parties. It went on to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a specific and specially constituted tribunal and prescribed a particular procedure for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decision, including judicial relief pending a final administrative order. Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules and to avoid these diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\"><em>Garner v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 776, </em>346 U.S. 485, 490, 74 S.Ct. 161, 98 L.Ed. 228 (1953). \u201cThus, to achieve uniform as well as effective enforcement of the national labor policy, Congress vested the NLRB, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>federal or state courts, with primary jurisdiction over activities subject to regulation by the Board.\u201d <em>Vane, </em>303 Md. at 367, 494 A.2d 181 (citing <em>Local 926, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs v. </em>Jones, 460 U.S. 669, 681, 103 S.Ct. 1453, 75 L.Ed.2d 368 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The NLRB has primary jurisdiction over activities regulated by sections 7 and 8 of the NLRA. <em>Law, </em>373 Md. at 471, 818 A.2d 1136. Section 7 protects certain conduct of employees, while section 8 prohibits certain conduct of employers and labor organizations by defining what constitutes an \u201cunfair labor practice.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158. Pursuant to section 7, employees \u201chave the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection!)]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 157. In addition, and particularly relevant here, employees \u201calso have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to section 8, it is \u201can unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents ... to restrain or coerce ... employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section [7 of the NLRA.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158(b)(1) (paragraph break omitted). The NLRB has the authority, pursuant to the NLRA, \u201cto prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice ... affecting commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u201cIn enacting the NLRA, Congress never determined the precise extent to which state law must be displaced to achieve the unifying ends sought by the national legislature.\u201d <em>Vane, </em>303 Md. at 368, 494 A.2d 181. \u201cConsequently, a major difficulty with labor law preemption analysis is that \u2018the aims and social policy\u2019 Congress was implementing \u2018were drawn with broad strokes while the details had to be filled in, to no small extent, by the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, Millmen\u2019s Union, Local 2020 v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 240, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Accordingly, through a series of decisions, the Supreme Court established the following framework for determining whether state law causes of action are preempted by the NLRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">First, we determine whether the conduct that the state seeks to regulate or to make the basis of liability is actually or arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA.... [I]f the conduct at issue is arguably prohibited or protected[,] otherwise applicable state law and procedures are ordinarily preempted. When, however, the conduct at issue is only a peripheral concern of the Act or touches on interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, it could not be inferred that Congress intended to deprive the state of the power to act, we refuse to invalidate state regulation or sanction of the conduct. The question of whether regulation should be allowed because of the deeply-rooted nature of the local interest involves a sensitive balancing of any harm to the regulatory scheme established by Congress, either in terms of negating the [NLRBJ\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction or in terms of conflicting substantive rules, and the importance of the asserted cause of action to the state as a protection to its citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Jones, </em>460 U.S. at 676, 103 S.Ct. 1453 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Thus, in cases of arguably protected or prohibited conduct, we begin with the presumption that the conduct is regulated by the NLRA and therefore that state law claims are preempted. However, the presumption is rebutted if either of two exceptions to preemption apply. First, the NLRA does not preempt state law claims if \u201cthe conduct at issue is only a peripheral concern of the [NLRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 243, 79 S.Ct. 773). Second, the NLRA does not preempt state law claims when the conduct at issue \u201ctouches on interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, it could not be inferred that Congress intended to deprive the state of the power to act[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>244, 79 S.Ct. 773). This is known as the \u201clocal interest exception\u201d to the NLRA preemption analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">To determine whether the local interest exception applies in cases of arguably prohibited conduct,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the courts engage in a two-part inquiry. First, the courts must determine whether \u201cthere exist[s] a significant state interest in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. San Diego Cnty. Dist. Council of Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 196, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978). Second, the courts must consider whether \u201cthe exercise of state jurisdiction over the tort claim entail[s] little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the [NLRB].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Regarding this second inquiry, the courts must focus on \u201cwhether the controversy presented to the state court is identical with that which could be presented to the [NLRB].\u201d <em>Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 510, 103 S.Ct. 3172, 77 L.Ed.2d 798 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">UFCW argues that the circuit court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. UFCW asserts that Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance are preempted by the NLRA because they pertain to conduct that is arguably prohibited by the NLRA. Walmart responds that its state law claims are not preempted because the local interest exception to the NLRA preemption analysis applies to trespass and nuisance. Thus, the issue before this Court is whether the local interest exception applies to Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In order to determine whether the local interest exception applies to Walmart\u2019s claims, we first must decide whether there is a significant state interest involved in those claims. In other words, does \u201cthere exist\u00ed ] a significant state interest in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct\u201d? <em>Sears, </em>436 U.S. at 196, 98 S.Ct. 1745. Second, we must consider whether \u201cthe exercise of state jurisdiction over the tort claim entail[s] little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the [NLRB].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Regarding the first inquiry, UFCW asserts that the local interest exception only applies to conduct involving violence, threats of violence, property damage, or malice, none of which occurred here, and therefore there is no \u201csignificant state interest\u201d involved in Walmart\u2019s claims. Walmart responds that <em>Sears </em>held that protecting citizens from \u201cpeaceful trespass\u201d qualifies as a significant state interest, even in the absence of violence or threats of violence. Moreover, Walmart argues that protecting private property rights is a more significant state interest than certain other state interests that have been recognized to support the local interest exception, and therefore protecting private property rights should qualify as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Regarding the second inquiry, UFCW asserts that courts must look to whether the conduct at issue in the state law claims is similar to the conduct at issue in the (actual or hypothetical) NLRB claim. If the conduct is similar, then the state law claims are preempted. In this case, UFCW contends, the conduct at issue in Walmart\u2019s state law trespass and nuisance claims is the same conduct that would have been at issue in the NLRB claim as originally filed, and therefore the state law claims are preempted. Walmart responds that courts must compare the legal elements of the state law claims and the (actual or hypothetical) NLRB claim, not the factual underpinnings of those claims, in order to determine whether there is a risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the NLRB. In this case, Walmart contends, the legal elements of its state law trespass and nuisance claims are distinct from the NLRB claim filed by Walmart: the former is concerned with whether UFCW trespassed on Walmart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>property by exceeding its limited invitation to the public to enter its property for shopping purposes; the latter is concerned with whether UFCW engaged in coercive activities in violation of section 8 of the NLRA. Therefore, Walmart concludes, its state law claims for trespass and coercion are not preempted by the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Both parties recognize that <em>Sears </em>is the leading Supreme Court decision regarding the local interest exception to NLRA preemption, and both parties assert that <em>Sears </em>is controlling here. However, the parties differ on their respective interpretations of the <em>Sears </em>decision. In <em>Sears, </em>a carpenters union picketed on Sears\u2019 exterior private property. 436 U.S. at 182, 98 S.Ct. 1745. \u201cThe picketing was peaceful and orderly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When Sears attempted to remove the pickets from its property through the use of its private security, the union refused to leave. <em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 98 S.Ct. 1745. Thereafter, Sears filed a complaint in state court \u201cseeking an injunction against the continuing trespass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Sears asserted no claim that the picketing itself violated any state or federal law. It sought simply to remove the pickets from its property to the public walkways, and the injunction issued by the state court was strictly confined to the relief sought. Thus, as a matter of state law, the location of the picketing was illegal but the picketing itself was unobjectionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 185, 98 S.Ct. 1745. The union argued that Sears\u2019 state law claim was preempted because the peaceful picketing was both arguably protected and arguably prohibited by the NLRA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by quoting the general rule of NLRA preemption: \u201cWhen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [NLRA], the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the [NLRB] if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187-88, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (quoting <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773). The <em>Sears </em>Court then qualified that general rule with the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>While the <em>Garmon </em>formulation accurately reflects the basic federal concern with potential state interference with national labor policy, the history of the labor pre-emption doctrine in this Court does not support an approach which sweeps away state-court jurisdiction over conduct traditionally subject to state regulation without careful consideration of the relative impact of such a jurisdictional bar on the various interests affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 188, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Court then turned to the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d prong of the preemption analysis, and began by discussing prior cases in which the contested state law claims were held to be preempted by the NLRA. <em>See id. </em>at 191-94, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (citing, <em>inter alia, Garner, </em>346 U.S. 485, 74 S.Ct. 161, 98 L.Ed. 228). Next, the <em>Sears </em>Court contrasted those cases with others in which it had held that the local interest exception applied, and therefore the state law claims at issue were not preempted. <em>See id. </em>at 194-97, 98 S.Ct. 1745. The Court summarized these \u201clocal interest\u201d cases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">Thus, for example, the Court has upheld state-court jurisdiction over conduct that touches \u201cinterests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\u201d [ ] <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 244, 79 S.Ct. 773. <em>See Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., </em>347 U.S. 656, 74 S.Ct. 833, 98 L.Ed. 1025 [ (1954) ] (threats of violence); <em>Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 78 S.Ct. 206, 2 L.Ed.2d 151 [ (1957) ] (violence); <em>Automobile Workers v.

Carpenters, </em>430 U.S. 290, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 [ (1977) ] (intentional infliction of mental distress).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 195, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Next, citing <em>Farmer, </em>the <em>Sears </em>Court identified two factors that \u201cwarranted a departure from the general pre-emption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>guidelines in the \u2018local interest\u2019 cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 98 S.Ct. 1746.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">First, there existed a significant state interest in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct. Second, although the challenged conduct occurred in the course of a labor dispute and an unfair labor practice charge could have been filed, the exercise of state jurisdiction over the tort claim entailed little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the [NLRB]. Although the arguable federal violation and the state tort arose in the same factual setting, the respective controversies presented to the state and federal forums would not have been the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">The critical inquiry, therefore, is not whether the State is enforcing a law relating specifically to labor relations or one of general application but whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to (as in Gamer) or different from (as in Farmer) that which could have been, but was not, presented to the [NLRB]. For it is only in the former situation that a state court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the [NLRB] which the arguably prohibited branch of the <em>Garmon </em>doctrine was designed to avoid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 196-97, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Finally, the <em>Sears </em>Court applied these two factors to Sears\u2019 state law claim and determined that \u201cthe controversy which Sears might have presented to the [NLRB] is not the same as the controversy presented to the state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">If Sears had filed a charge, the federal issue would have been whether the picketing had a recognitional or work-reassignment objective; decision of that issue would have entailed relatively complex factual and legal determinations completely unrelated to the simple question whether a trespass had occurred. Conversely, in the state action, Sears only challenged the location of the picketing; whether the picketing had an objective proscribed by federal law was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>irrelevant to the state claim. Accordingly, permitting the state court to adjudicate Sears\u2019 trespass claim would create no realistic risk of interference with the [NLRB] \u2019s primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Therefore, the Supreme Court concluded that preemption was inappropriate in this situation, because normal preemption considerations were \u201cinsufficient to preclude a State from exercising jurisdiction limited to the trespassory aspects of [the union\u2019s] activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">UFCW insists that <em>Sears </em>did not apply the local interest exception to the union\u2019s picketing, but simply held that Sears\u2019 state law claim for trespass was not preempted because it involved conduct that was distinct from the \u201carguably prohibited\u201d conduct under the NLRA. In addition, UFCW notes that in its summary of local interest cases, the <em>Sears </em>Court specifically enumerated four state interests that qualified for the exception\u2014violence, threats of violence, libel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress\u2014but did not mention trespass. Based on this observation, UFCW concludes that trespass is not a significant state interest to which the local interest exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Walmart responds that the <em>Sears </em>decision did apply the local interest exception to the union\u2019s picketing, and establishes that preventing peaceful trespass is a significant state interest worthy of the exception. Walmart notes that the <em>Sears </em>Court did not mention trespass in its list of examples of <em>prior </em>local interest cases, because that case was the first time the Supreme Court had held that peaceful trespass qualifies for the exception. Walmart also contends that in holding that Sears\u2019 trespass claim entailed little risk of interference with the NLRB, the Supreme Court compared the respective <em>legal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>elements </em>of the state law claim versus the NLRB claim, rather than the underlying <em>conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We agree with Walmart\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Sears </em>decision. UFCW is simply incorrect when it states that <em>Sears </em>did not apply the local interest exception in its \u201carguably prohibited\u201d preemption analysis. The <em>Sears </em>Court made clear that it was applying this exception by summarizing its prior case law regarding the exception, 436 U.S. at 194-95, 98 S.Ct. 1745, identifying the two-part test for analyzing the exception, <em>id. </em>at 196-97, 98 S.Ct. 1745, and then evaluating the facts of the case before it in the context of that two-part inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745, Although the Court did not explicitly state that peaceful trespass supports the local interest exception to NLRA preemption, this was clearly the holding of the case. Indeed, the Supreme Court confirmed this holding when it cited <em>Sears </em>in a later case discussing the local interest exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">This presumption of federal pre-emption, based on the primary jurisdiction rationale, properly admits to exception when unusually \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d local interests are at stake. In such cases, appropriate consideration for the vitality of our federal system and for a rational allocation of functions belies any easy inference that Congress intended to deprive the States of their ability to retain jurisdiction over such matters. We have, therefore, refrained from finding that the NLRA pre-empts state court jurisdiction over state breach of contract actions by strike replacements, <em>Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 U.S. 491, 103 S.Ct. 3172, 77 L.Ed.2d 798 (1983), state trespass actions, <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. [San Diego Cnty. Dist. Council of] Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978), or state tort remedies for intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>Farmer v. Carpenters, </em>430 U.S. 290, 97 S.Ct. 1056, 51 L.Ed.2d 338 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em>Brown v. Hotel &amp; Rest. Emps. &amp; Bartenders Int\u2019l Union Local 54, </em>468 U.S. 491, 502-03, 104 S.Ct. 3179, 82 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Therefore, we reject UFCW\u2019s contention that the local interest exception is strictly limited to cases involving violence, threats of violence, or malicious conduct. The Supreme Court held in <em>Sears </em>(and later confirmed in Brown) that preventing peaceful trespass also qualifies as a significant state interest that is deserving of the local interest exception. Furthermore, we agree with Walmart that the state interest in protecting private property rights is at least as significant as other previously recognized interests falling under the exception (such as protection against libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress), and therefore it would be irrational to conclude that this state interest is not \u201csignificant\u201d enough to qualify for the exception unless it is accompanied by violence, threats of violence, or property damage. <em>See Taggart v. Weinacker\u2019s Inc., </em>397 U.S. 223, 227-28, 90 S.Ct. 876, 25 L.Ed.2d 240 (1970) (Burger, C.J., concurring) (\u201cThe protection of private property, whether a home, factory, or store, through trespass laws is historically a concern of state law. ... Few concepts are more \u2018deeply rooted\u2019 than the power of a State to protect the rights of its citizens.\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that there is a significant state interest involved in Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance\u2014namely, the interest in protecting private property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Turning to the second inquiry under the local interest exception, we agree with Walmart\u2019s contention that courts must look to the legal controversies that would be presented to each tribunal (i.e., the state court and the NLRB), not the conduct underlying those controversies, to determine whether exercising state court jurisdiction would entail little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the NLRB. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sears,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">The critical inquiry, therefore, is ... whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to (as in Gamer) or different from (as in Farmer) that which could have been, but was not, presented to the [NLRB].

Thus, the <em>Sears </em>Court explicitly referenced controversies, not conduct, when discussing the second inquiry under the local interest exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Moreover, when the <em>Sears </em>Court applied this formulation to the case before it, its analysis concerned <em>controversies, </em>or legal issues, not <em>conduct:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">In the present case, the controversy which Sears might have presented to the [NLRB] is not the same as the controversy presented to the state court. If Sears had filed a charge, the federal issue would have been whether the picketing had a reeognitional or work-reassignment objective; decision of that issue would have entailed relatively complex factual and legal determinations completely unrelated to the simple question whether a trespass had occurred. Conversely, in the state action, Sears only challenged the location of the picketing; whether the picketing had an objective proscribed by federal law was irrelevant to the state claim. Accordingly, permitting the state court to adjudicate Sears\u2019 trespass claim would create no realistic risk of interference with the [NLRB] \u2019s primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 198, 98 S.Ct. 1745 (emphases added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Later, in <em>Belknap, </em>the Supreme Court once again utilized the comparison-of-controversies analysis to determine that the contested state law claims were not preempted by the NLRA. In <em>Belknap, </em>employees went on strike when contract negotiations between their collective bargaining representative and the employer broke down. 463 U.S. at 494, 103 S.Ct. 3172. After the strike began, the employer granted a wage increase to union employees who stayed on the job. <em>Id. </em>The employer then hired replacement workers to take the place of the employees who went on strike, and made repeated representations to the replacement workers that their employment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>continue even if the striking employees returned to work. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 103 S.Ct. 3172. Meanwhile, the striking employees filed a complaint against the employer with the NLRB, contesting the unilateral wage increase. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 103 S.Ct. 3172. Following additional negotiations between the employer and the union, the striking employees returned to work pursuant to a settlement agreement resolving the NLRB complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 103 S.Ct. 3172. In order to make room for the return of the striking employees, the employer laid off the replacement workers to whom it had made representations of continued employment. <em>Id. </em>The replacement workers sued the employer in state court for misrepresentation and breach of contract. <em>Id. </em>The employer argued that the state law claims were preempted by the NLRA. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 103 S.Ct. 3172.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">To determine whether the local interest exception applied, the Supreme Court utilized the <em>Sears </em>analysis to compare the state law and NLRB claims. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he focus of [the NLRB\u2019s] determinations ... would be on whether the rights of strikers were being infringed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, 103 S.Ct. 3172. However, \u201c[njeither controversy [presented to the NLRB] would have anything in common with the question whether [the employer] made misrepresentations to replacements that were actionable under state law. The [NLRB] would be concerned with the impact on strikers[,] not with whether the employer deceived replacements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In addition, the Court noted the difference in remedies available pursuant to state law and the NLRA: \u201cthe injury remedied by the state law has no relevance to the [NLRB] \u2019s function and ... the [NLRB] can award no damages, impose no penalty, or give any other relief to the plaintiffs in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 103 S.Ct. 3172 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Linn, </em>383 U.S. at 63, 86 S.Ct. 657); <em>see also id. </em>at 510, 103 S.Ct. 3172 (\u201cThe strikers cannot secure reinstatement, or indeed any relief, by suing for misrepresentation in state court. The state courts in no way offer them an alternative forum for obtaining relief that the [NLRB] can provide.\u201d). Therefore, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he state interests involved in this case clearly outweigh any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>possible interference with the [NLRB] \u2019s function that may result from permitting the action for misrepresentation to proceed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 103 S.Ct. 3172.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">And, if <em>Sears </em>and <em>Belknap </em>left any doubt as to whether courts should compare legal controversies instead of the underlying facts of the respective claims, this Court squarely addressed that issue when it applied the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis to a union\u2019s preemption argument regarding claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aar-dedup-0\">Thus, where the conduct at issue in the state litigation is said to be arguably prohibited by the NLRA and hence within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB, as contended here, the critical inquiry in applying the <em>Garmon </em>rules is \u201cwhether the controversy presented to the state court is identical with that which could be presented to the [NLRB],\u201d not whether there is a similarity of facts to be presented before the NLRB and the state court, or whether the same events and conduct gave rise to both an unfair labor practice claim and a state tort claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajp-dedup-0\"><em>Batson, </em>325 Md. at 714, 602 A.2d 1191 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Therefore, we conclude that, in assessing whether the exercise of state court jurisdiction would entail little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the NLRB, this Court must compare the respective controversies, not the underlying conduct giving rise to those controversies. As exemplified by <em>Sears, Belknap, </em>and <em>Batson, </em>an examination of the respective controversies focuses on the legal elements of the claims, the issues that would be presented to each tribunal, and the remedies that each tribunal is authorized to award to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In this case, the controversies presented to the circuit court\u2014trespass and nuisance\u2014are not identical to the controversy presented to the NLRB. Although the controversies are based on the same conduct (namely, UFCW\u2019s demonstrations at various Walmart stores), the legal elements, issues, and potential remedies of the state law claims are notably distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>from those of the NLRB claim. For example, the primary issue in the state law trespass claim is whether UFCW exceeded the scope of Walmart\u2019s limited invitation to the public to enter its private property for shopping purposes. Similarly, the primary issue in the nuisance claim is whether UFCW invaded Walmart\u2019s interest in the use and enjoyment of its land. In contrast, the primary issue in the NLRB claim is whether UFCW\u2019s demonstrations restrained or coerced Walmart employees into supporting the union, in violation of section 8 of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Resolution of the state law claims is not dependent upon whether UFCW violated the NLRA. Even if UFCW\u2019s demonstrations did not restrain or coerce Walmart employees into supporting the union, UFCW would still be liable for trespass and nuisance as long as it exceeded the scope of Walmart\u2019s limited invitation to the public to enter its property for shopping purposes (trespass), and interfered with Walmart\u2019s use and enjoyment of its land (nuisance). For example, UFCW could be liable for trespass and nuisance if it had entered Walmart\u2019s property for the purpose of soliciting customers and employees to buy a product or service without Walmart\u2019s permission, even if the solicitation was completely unrelated to union activity. Thus, the fact that UFCW may have also violated section 8 of the NLRA when it entered Walmart\u2019s property is immaterial to whether it committed trespass and nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Furthermore, the potential remedy available to Walmart regarding UFCW\u2019s conduct in state court is distinct from the potential remedy available from the NLRB. The state court could (and did) prohibit UFCW from entering Walmart\u2019s property for any non-shopping purpose without Walmart\u2019s permission. The NLRB, by contrast, could prohibit UFCW from coercing Walmart employees to support the union <em>anywhere. </em>For example, if UFCW knew that Walmart employees at a particular store regularly ate lunch at a neighboring restaurant, not on Walmart\u2019s property, and UFCW decided to conduct their demonstrations targeting Walmart employees at the restaurant rather than at the store, Walmart would still be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>able to file a ULP charge with NLRB against UFCW, but Walmart would have no state law cause of action for trespass or nuisance, because the demonstrations did not take place on or interfere with Walmart\u2019s private property. In other words, the relief awarded by the state court is premised upon the <em>location </em>of the objectionable conduct, not its <em>purpose-, </em>the relief awarded by the NLRB is premised upon the <em>purpose </em>of the objectionable conduct, not its <em>location. </em>Simply put, while there is some overlap in the type of conduct that would be covered by the two remedies, including some of UFCW\u2019s conduct in this case, the remedies are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Finally, in considering whether the exercise of state court jurisdiction would entail little risk of interference with the jurisdiction of the NLRB, we agree with the policy concern raised by the Court of Special Appeals below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">[I]n cases such as this, where a labor organization that does not represent the employees enters on the employer\u2019s private property to demonstrate about its labor practices, without any arguably protected right to do so under the NLRA, it would make little sense if, by also engaging in conduct arguably prohibited by the NLRA, it could deprive the employer of the state law claims it otherwise could bring to remedy the conduct. In other words, a labor union cannot fairly say that because it violated the NLRA, it is no longer subject to state trespass and nuisance laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXY\"><em>UFCW, </em>228 Md.App. at 229, 137 A.3d 355 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Therefore, we conclude that, regarding the second inquiry of the local interest exception analysis, the exercise of state court jurisdiction over Walmart\u2019s claims for trespass and nuisance against UFCW would entail little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the NLRB. Having already concluded, regarding the first inquiry of the analysis, that protecting private property rights is a significant state interest that qualifies for the exception, we hold that Walmart\u2019s state law claims satisfy both prongs of the analysis, and therefore the local interest exception applies. Thus, we hold that Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>not preempted by the NLRA, and the circuit court properly denied UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>B.

Walmart responds that the circuit court correctly ruled that this case does not \u201cinvolve or grow out of a labor dispute,\u201d and therefore Walmart was not required to satisfy the heightened requirements of the AIA in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>order to receive an injunction against UFCW. Furthermore, Walmart asserts that, even if the AIA did apply, Walmart submitted sufficient evidence to the circuit court to satisfy the heightened criteria for receiving an injunction under the AIA. The latter argument, however, is not properly before this Court, and therefore we shall address only the former.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The AIA expressly states that it \u201cshall be interpreted and applied in accordance with the policy stated in \u00a7 4-302[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 4-803. That policy provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">(1) negotiation of terms and conditions of employment should result from voluntary agreement between employees and employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>(2) therefore, each individual worker must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">(i) fully free to associate, organize, and designate a representative, as the worker chooses, for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">(ii) free from coercion, interference, or restraint by an employer or an agent of an employer in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">1. designation of a representative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">2. self-organization; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">3. other concerted activity for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">LE \u00a7 4-302. Furthermore, \u201cbecause the [AIA] is in derogation of the law and deprives a court of jurisdiction, it must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Vu, </em>180 Md.App. at 683, 962 A.2d 379 (citing <em>Dist. 1199E, </em>293 Md. at 359-60, 444 A.2d 448).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">With these considerations in mind, we hold that this case does not \u201cinvolve or grow out of a labor dispute\u201d within the meaning of the AIA. This case does not satisfy either of the two definitions of a \u201clabor dispute case\u201d provided in LE \u00a7 4-310. Although UFCW could qualify as \u201cpersons who are engaged in a single industry, trade, craft, or occupation\u201d under LE \u00a7 4-310(1), UFCW was not acting in this capacity during its demonstrations at various Walmart stores. UFCW does not represent Walmart employees, and does not seek to represent them. Instead, the stated purpose of UFCW\u2019s demonstrations was to bring awareness to Walmart\u2019s unsatisfactory employment conditions. In this way, UFCW could more properly be characterized as activists, not representatives. And, because this case does not involve the negotiation of employment conditions, or demonstrations by Walmart employees <em>themselves, </em>none of the policy goals stated in LE \u00a7 4-302 are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">We recognize, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that the ultimate goal of UFCW\u2019s demonstrations was to improve the terms or conditions of employment for Walmart employees, and thus one could argue that this case involves a labor dispute as defined by LE \u00a7 4-301(e)(l). But, because the demonstrations were not conducted by Walmart employees, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>a union representing Walmart employees, or a union seeking to represent employees, in order to improve the terms and conditions of their employment, we do not believe that this case can properly be considered a labor dispute under the AIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In reaching this conclusion, we consider not only the stated policy of the AIA, but also the historical context in which it was enacted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">Historically, employers had sought and obtained the remedy of injunction to thwart workers in organized labor activities, most notably strikes and picketing, that gave them leverage and bargaining power. The anti-injunction statutes of the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s, including the Maryland Act, were designed to limit and, in some circumstances, circumscribe entirely the remedy of injunction as it was being used by employers to suppress labor organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ap1-dedup-0\"><em>Vu, </em>180 Md.App. at 682, 952 A.2d 379. Here, Walmart did not seek an injunction against UFCW \u201cto thwart workers in organized labor activities ... that gave them leverage and bargaining power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, Walmart sought an injunction against UFCW in order to restore peace and order to its stores, and to prevent further disruptions to its business. Thus, the injunction against UFCW not only benefits Wal-mart, but Walmart\u2019s employees as well, by protecting them from the disruptive behavior of UFCW\u2019s demonstrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Therefore, we hold that the circuit court was correct in ruling that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, and thus Walmart was not required to satisfy the AIA\u2019s heightened requirements in order to receive an injunction against UFCW.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">We hold that the local interest exception to NLRA preemption applies to Walmart\u2019s state law claims for trespass and nuisance against UFCW, and therefore those claims are not preempted by the NLRA. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying UFCW\u2019s motion to dismiss Walmart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>claims for lack of jurisdiction. Additionally, we hold that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, and therefore Walmart was not required to satisfy the heightened requirements of the AIA in order to receive an injunction against UFCW. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\">. UFCW\u2019s demonstrations also took place in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. <em>See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union, </em>382 P.3d 1249, 1252 n.2 (Colo. App. 2016) (defining \"flash mob\u201d as \"[a] group of people summoned (such as by e-mail or text messages) to a designated location at a specified time to perform an indicated action before dispersing\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. Walmart also filed state court actions in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Washington.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\">. In its petition for a writ of certiorari, UFCW combined the two issues into a single question presented: \"Did the Court [of Special Appeals] err when it held that this case does not involve a labor dispute and the NLRA does not preempt Walmart\u2019s claims?\" However, in their briefs, both parties addressed the question as two separate issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\">. This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">U.S, Const, art. VI, cl. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">. The Supreme Court has made clear that the preemption analysis for arguably protected conduct under section 7 of the NLRA is distinct from the analysis for arguably prohibited conduct under section 8 of the NLRA. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v, San Diego Cnty. Dist. Council of Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 190, 98 S.Ct. 1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978) (\"While the considerations underlying the two categories overlap, they differ in significant respects and therefore it is useful to review them separately,\u201d). UFCW has not claimed that their conduct was arguably protected by the NLRA, so that branch of the preemption analysis is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Walmart does not argue that the \"merely peripheral concern\u201d exception to NLRA preemption applies to their claims, so we will not address that exception in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. The Supreme Court then went on to consider whether Sears\u2019 state law claim was preempted under the \"arguably protected\u201d prong of the NLRA preemption analysis, and ultimately concluded that it was not. <em>Sears, </em>436 U.S. at 199-207, 98 S.Ct. 1745.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">. Walmart also argues that UFCW waived any claim of error with respect to whether the AIA applies because, in its petition for a writ of certiorari, UFCW did not contest the Court of Special Appeals' alternative holding that, if the AIA did apply, Walmart nonetheless satisfied its heightened requirements for receiving an injunction. After holding that the AIA did not apply to this case, the Court of Special Appeals went on to hold that, \"[e]ven if this case <em>did </em>involve a labor dispute, we nevertheless would affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the Anti-Injunction Act criteria were met.\u201d <em>UFCW, </em>228 Md.App. at 237, 137 A.3d 355. Based on our review of the record, we do not believe the circuit court ever made such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">At the beginning of the hearing on November 25, 2013, the circuit court ruled that this case did not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA. At the conclusion of that hearing, on a motion for reconsideration, the circuit court again ruled that this case did not involve a labor dispute. The circuit court never considered whether Walmart had satisfied the six criteria for receiving an injunction in a labor dispute case under the AIA, and never made any factual findings with respect to those criteria. Instead, after ruling that the case did not involve a labor dispute, the circuit court applied the four factors that a court must consider before granting a preliminary injunction <em>in any case, </em>citing <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 455-56, 654 A.2d 449 (1995). Based on its consideration of those four factors, the circuit court granted the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Because the circuit court did not make factual findings as to whether Walmart satisfied the AIA\u2019s requirements, that question is not properly before us. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d). However, the circuit court's ruling that this case does not involve a labor dispute within the meaning of the AIA, which was raised in UFCW\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, is properly before this Court, and we conclude that the issue has not been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
