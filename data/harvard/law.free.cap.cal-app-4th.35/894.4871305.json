We will ultimately reverse the judgment for the reasons expressed in the unpublished part of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Plaintiff and appellant, Michael Miranda (appellant), filed a medical malpractice action in Kern County Superior Court, based on treatment he received for a laceration to his right ankle during three visits to the Kern Valley Hospital emergency room. He maintains that on all three occasions defendants and respondents, Edward Santoro, M.D., Kevin Chiasson, M.D., and Jennifer Steeper, M.D. (respondents), negligently failed to diagnose his severed Achilles tendon, thereby causing him physical, emotional, and financial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">On March 17, 1994, the trial court granted respondents\u2019 <em>in limine </em>motion to bar plaintiff\u2019s designated expert, Jerrold M. Sherman, M.D., from testifying about relevant standard of care issues. Respondents claimed that Dr. Sherman did not meet the qualifications for expert witnesses set by Health and Safety Code section 1799.110, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court also refused to allow appellant to call Hugh West, M. D., respondents\u2019 designated expert, to testify during appellant\u2019s case-in-chief about the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">According to appellant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>offer of proof, which was based in part upon the deposition testimony of Dr. Sherman, Dr. Sherman served as a consultant to the emergency room at Santa Monica Hospital twice a month, and had, during every week for the last five years, been \u201cin the emergency room\u201d as a consulting orthopedic physician. In connection with this work he had treated \u201cat least two or three lacerated Achilles tendons.\u201d He last \u201ccovered the emergency room\u201d at Santa Monica Hospital the Tuesday preceding the date of the <em>in limine </em>hearing in this case. While he has provided emergency treatment in the Santa Monica Hospital Emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Room since he started his practice 20 years ago, he is not an \u201cemergency room physician\u201d; he is \u201can orthopedic specialist called to the emergency room to take care of orthopedic problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">When appellant told the court that its <em>in limine </em>orders made it impossible for him to satisfy his burden of proof, respondents moved for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court granted respondents\u2019 motion on March 21, 1994. The issues raised by the trial court\u2019s rulings with respect to the two experts have been preserved for appellate review. (See <em>Richaud </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 81, 86 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">A. <em>Appellant\u2019s Designated Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Section 1799.110 reads, in full, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">\u201c(a) In any action for damages involving a claim of negligence against a physician and surgeon arising out of emergency medical services provided in a general acute care hospital emergency department, the trier of fact shall consider, together with all other relevant matters, the circumstances constituting the emergency, as defined herein, and the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised by reputable members of the physician and surgeon\u2019s profession in the same or similar locality, in like cases, and under similar emergency circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">\u201c(b) For the purposes of this section, \u2018emergency medical services\u2019 and \u2018emergency medical care\u2019 means those medical services required for the immediate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions which, if not immediately diagnosed and treated, could lead to serious physical or mental disability or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">\u201c(c) In any action for damages involving a claim of negligence against a physician and surgeon providing <em>emergency medical coverage </em>for a general acute care hospital emergency department, the court shall admit expert medical testimony only from physicians and surgeons who have had substantial professional experience within the last five years while assigned to provide <em>emergency medical coverage </em>in a general acute care hospital emergency department. For purposes of this section, \u2018substantial professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>experience\u2019 shall be determined by the custom and practice of the manner in which <em>emergency medical coverage </em>is provided in general acute care hospital emergency departments in the same or similar localities where the alleged negligence occurred.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it (1) held that his expert medical witness had to qualify under section 1799.110, subdivision (c), and (2) refused to permit Dr. Sherman to testify regarding the standard of care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties stipulated in the trial court that Kern Valley Hospital is a general acute care hospital within the meaning of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110. The issues before us are, therefore: (1) whether any of the respondents were providing \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d for Kern Valley Hospital at the time the asserted negligence occurred; and, if so, (2) whether the record before the trial court established that Dr. Sherman had \u201csubstantial professional experience within the last five years while assigned to provide emergency medical coverage in a general acute care hospital emergency department.\u201d For the reasons expressed, we answer the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> The meaning of the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d has been addressed in two divergent' lines of appellate authority. In <em>Jutzi </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 637, 647 (242 Cal.Rptr. 74], the court referred to the \u201capparently synonymous term \u2018emergency medical care\u2019\u201d which is expressly defined in subdivision (b) of section 1799.110. Under the rationale of <em>Jutzi, </em>\u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d for purposes of the application of subdivision (c) consists of \u201c \u2018those medical services required for the immediate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions which, if not immediately diagnosed and treated, could lead to serious physical . . . disability or death.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jutzi, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 647, original italics omitted; see also <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hospital </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 722, 726 [262 Cal.Rptr. 867].) Appellant asks this court to adopt the <em>Jutzi </em>rationale and conclude that section 1799.110, subdivision (c) is inapplicable to his action against respondents. He takes the position the facts presented to the trial court demonstrated he did not receive \u201cemergency medical care\u201d from any of the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The Sixth District disagreed with <em>Jutzi </em>in <em>Zavala </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1755, 1762 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 768]. Of decisive significance to the <em>Zavala </em>court was the Legislature\u2019s choice of the words \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d in subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>the words \u201cemergency medical services,\u201d which are used in subdivision (a) of the statute. <em>Zavala </em>applied the principle that where different terms appear in two adjoining subdivisions of the same statute, \u201c \u2018the inference is compelling that [different meanings were] intended.\u2019 \u201d (16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1762.) As the <em>Zavala </em>court saw it, \u201c[a] physician \u2018providing emergency medical coverage . . .\u2019 is a physician whose \u2018field of activity\u2019 is the provision of emergency medical services in a hospital\u2019s emergency department. Such a physician is usually described as an emergency room physician. Therefore, when faced with a claim that an expert does not qualify under [subdivision (c) of section 1799.110] the initial question the court must decide is not whether the actual treatment rendered constituted emergency medical care, as <em>Jutzi </em>proclaimed, but whether the defendant physician was acting as an emergency physician in an emergency department when the defendant physician did the allegedly negligent acts.\u201d <em>(Zavala, supra, </em>at pp. 1762-1763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">With considerable further analysis, the Third District \u201cagree[d] with the holding in Zavala\u201d in <em>James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 73, 79 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 372]. <em>James </em>concluded \u201cthat the term \u2018emergency medical coverage\u2019 is broader than the term \u2018emergency medical services,\u2019 and subdivision (c) [of section 1799.110] applies whenever an emergency room physician treats a patient in a general acute care hospital emergency department.\u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>at pp. 79-80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We are convinced the construction given to subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 by <em>James </em>and <em>Zavala </em>is correct. We therefore hold that \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d means treatment provided in the emergency department of a general acute care hospital by a physician who is \u201con-duty\u201d in the emergency department at the time. Thus, a physician who elects, for whatever reason, to treat one of his or her private patients in the emergency room of an acute care hospital, at a time when the physician is not charged with the obligation to provide emergency room professional services, would not have the benefit of subdivision (c) in any malpractice action brought by the patient with respect to such treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Still unanswered explicitly by the case law, however, is the question whether the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d in section 1799.110, subdivision (c), also means treatment by \u201cother physicians\u2014for example, those physicians who respond to requests for assistance in the emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>room but who are not normally \u2018emergency room physicians.\u2019 \u201d <em>(James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 80, fn 4.) <em>Zavala </em>is unclear on the point; <em>James </em>recognized the problem but had no need to address it. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>Sigala </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at page 1453, the expert admitted he had \u201cnever worked as an emergency room physician\u201d and \u201chad not been assigned to provide emergency medical coverage in a general acute care hospital emergency department\u201d within the requisite five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The issue is genuine. Whatever method is selected by a hospital to professionally staff its emergency room,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is common for members of the hospital\u2019s general medical staff who are specialists in a particular field, such as cardiology or orthopedic medicine, to be available (on call) on a rotating basis, either voluntarily or as a requirement of hospital general medical staff membership, to come to the emergency room when requested .by an emergency room physician and provide, as necessary, consultation or assistance to the emergency physician or treatment to a patient in the emergency room. (Rowland, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 334-335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The language of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 does not state in so many words that it does not apply to treatment or services provided in the emergency room by an \u201con-call\u201d specialist. The common definition of \u201ccoverage,\u201d to wit, \u201cthe act or fact of including or treating\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1986) pp. 524-525), would support construing the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d to include services provided by \u201con-call\u201d specialty physicians. Such an interpretation would apparently be consistent with a particular connotation given the word \u201ccoverage\u201d by the medical profession; Dr. Sherman, in describing his qualifications, used \u201ccoverage\u201d to refer to the time he spent \u201con call\u201d to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">On the other hand, the subject of the first segment of section 1799.110, subdivision (c) is a physician who provides \u201cemergency medical coverage <em>for </em>a general acute care hospital emergency department.\u201d (Italics added.) In addition, subdivision (c) authorizes expert medical testimony only from those physicians who are shown to have acquired the requisite experience \u201cwhile <em>assigned </em>to provide emergency medical coverage in\u201d the emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>department of a general acute care hospital. (Italics added.) The highlighted words suggest to us\u2014though the inference is far from overwhelming\u2014that the intended focus of the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d is those physicians who work as the on duty professional staff of an emergency room rather than those specialists who provide services in an emergency room only on an \u201cas needed, as called\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Moreover, a construction of \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d which encompassed \u201con call\u201d specialists would seem to be inconsistent with the thus far accepted legislative purpose underlying section 1799.110, which is to \u201cencourage the provision of emergency medical [services] by preventing malpractice claims based on the assertion that an <em>emergency room physician </em>fell below the standard of care which could have been provided by a specialist in the particular field acting under nonemergency conditions . . . .\u201d <em>(Jutzi </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 651, italics added; accord, <em>James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 81.) However, assuming the words \u201cemergency room physician\u201d in this statement are meant to refer to only the designated professional staff of an acute care hospital\u2019s emergency room, there is no mention in <em>Jutzi, </em>where the statement of legislative intent first appeared, of any specific authority or statutory history to support a conclusion the Legislature wanted subdivision (c) to apply to only those physicians. And, as we explained earlier, we do not believe the words \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d themselves compel a holding that professional services rendered in the emergency room by an \u201con-call\u201d specialist fall outside the scope of the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Having found the express text of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 to be uncertain on the point, it is proper to seek to uncover the relevant intent and purpose behind the subdivision by reference to related statutes or approved extrinsic aids which disclose the relevant legislative history. <em>(O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Dudenhoeffer </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 327, 333 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 826].) Because we find nothing of assistance in the companion statutes to section 1799.110 contained in chapter 9 of division 2.5 of the Health and Safety Code, we turn to the legislative history of section 1799.110.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Section 1799.110 was promulgated in 1983 as a verbatim reenactment of former section 1768, which was contemporaneously repealed. (Stats. 1983, ch. 1246, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 41.) The language of section 1799.110 is unchanged from the original language of former section 1768. (Stats. 1978, ch. 130, \u00a7 8, pp. 345-346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">As first proposed, Assembly Bill No. 1301, which added section 1768 to the Health and Safety Code, sought to limit the civil damages exposure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>certain professionals who provided emergency medical services in defined settings to only that liability which arose out of acts or omissions performed in a grossly negligent or intentional manner. (Legislative Analyst (June 3, 1977) Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1301 (Fazio) as amended May 12, 1977.) Among the intended beneficiaries of the statutory protection were \u201c [physicians . . . providing emergency medical services in a hospital emergency department\u201d and \u201c[physicians assisting emergency room physicians located in hospitals.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, during the legislative process this portion of the bill underwent radical change. (See Sen. Com. Rep. &amp; Digest May 8, 1978.) By virtue of an amendment initiated in the Conference Committee, the segment of proposed section 1768 \u201crelating to consulting physicians [was] deleted from the bill.\u201d (Letter of Assemblyperson Vic Fazio to Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. (May 10, 1978) urging the Governor to sign Assem. Bill No. 1301.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The final version of the bill was considered at an open hearing before the Conference Committee and subsequently adopted by vote of the committee. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, the bill was submitted to and approved by both houses of the Legislature. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As a result, the limited civil liability shield for emergency room physicians and assisting physicians included in the original bill was replaced by provisions that were substantially the same as those contained in former section 1768 as enacted and that now appear in section 1799.110.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The drafting history of former section 1768 is persuasive evidence the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d in the statute (and thus in its successor section 1799.110) to refer only to treatment given by those physicians who serve as the dedicated medical staff of an acute care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>hospital\u2019s emergency room; that is, physicians who have been specifically employed or otherwise engaged by the hospital to furnish medical treatment in the emergency room as \u201cemergency room physicians.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s deletion of the provision relating to consulting and assisting physicians contained in an earlier version of section 1768 is \u201cstrong evidence that the act as adopted should not be construed to incorporate the original provision.\u201d <em>(Central Delta Water Agency </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 621, 634 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 453]; see also <em>Rich </em>v. <em>State Board of Optometry </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 591, 607 [45 Cal.Rptr. 512].) Thus, the history of section 1768 confirms what <em>Jutzi </em>appears to have concluded was the relevant legislative intent\u2014to promote the provision of emergency medical care by giving dedicated emergency room physicians a measure of protection from malpractice claims. <em>(Jutzi </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 651; see also <em>James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">By \u201cemergency room physician\u201d we do not mean only those physicians who are specially trained or board certified in emergency medicine, or who practice exclusively in the field of emergency medicine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither section 1799.110, its legislative history, nor any other statute in chapter 9 of division 2.5 of the Health and Safety Code, suggests the Legislature intended the reach of subdivision (c) to be so circumscribed. To the contrary, the last sentence of subdivision (c), which makes relevant local custom and practice with respect to the operation and staffing of emergency rooms, supports the inference the Legislature did not wish to restrict the application of subdivision (c) to \u201cspecialists\u201d in emergency medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Such a conclusion appears consistent with the purpose of the statute to enhance the availability of emergency medical care. <em>(Jutzi </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 651; see also <em>James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 81.) Some acute care hospitals in this state may not be able to rely entirely or at all upon specialists in emergency medicine to staff their emergency rooms. Moreover, a physician who is assigned to treat patients in the atmosphere of an emergency room, whether or not a specialist in emergency medicine, must regularly \u201cmake instantaneous decisions often without the benefit of medical histories, consultation, or time for reflection.\u201d <em>(James, supra, </em>at p. 81.) Had the Legislature desired to apply section 1799.110, subdivision (c) solely to malpractice actions against specialists in emergency medicine, it could easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>have said so. In the absence of any such indicative language, we will not write the qualification into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In addition, we emphasize that we do not differentiate between emergency and nonemergency afflictions or injuries in applying subdivision (c) of section 1799.110. Hospital emergency rooms are often undoubtedly seen or used as a general medical office with conveniently extended hours. Nevertheless, emergency room patients \u201creceive treatment in a markedly different environment than in the relaxed office confines of a private practitioner\u201d <em>(James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at p. 81) or in a hospital setting outside the emergency room. \u201cNot only is the atmosphere of an emergency room quite different, but so is the typical doctor-patient relationship that is found there.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"> We give the words \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d the same meaning throughout subdivision (c) of section 1799.110. A word or phrase, or its derivatives, accorded a particular meaning in one part or portion of a law, should be accorded the same meaning in other parts or portions of the law, especially if the word is used more than once in the same section of the law. <em>(Stillwell </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 119, 123 [173 P.2d 313]; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1930) 110 Cal.App. 715, 719 [295 P. 59].) Thus, a proposed expert witness satisfies the standard of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 if he or she is a physician who has had \u201csubstantial professional experience,\u201d within the five years preceding the trial, while employed or otherwise engaged by a general acute care hospital to provide treatment in its emergency room as an \u201cemergency room physician.\u201d (See <em>Sigala </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">According to, section 1799.110, subdivision (c), whether the proposed expert has the required \u201c \u2018substantial professional experience\u2019 shall be determined by the custom and practice of the manner in which emergency medical coverage is provided in general acute care hospital emergency departments in the same or similar localities where the alleged negligence occurred.\u201d This command is obviously intended to ensure that the performance of an emergency room physician sued for alleged malpractice in rendering emergency room treatment is evaluated under a standard of care essentially equivalent to that prevailing in emergency rooms at the time in the locality where the alleged negligence took place. The professional expertise required by the express statutory language is therefore skill and knowledge acquired \u201con the job\u201d as an emergency room physician in a locality where hospital emergency care is provided in a manner substantially the same as such care is given in the locale where and when the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>malpractice occurred. In other words, academic credentials, or experience acquired while serving as an \u201con-call\u201d specialist, or emergency room experience gained solely in hospitals or other facilities which do not deliver emergency care in essentially the same manner as it is delivered in the locale where the cause of action arose, are not enough, singly or together, to meet the demands of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The portion of subdivision (c) which addresses expert testimony is logical; it is also consistent with the underlying purpose of section 1799.110, that is, to encourage the provision of emergency medical services. <em>(Jutzi </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 651.) In a professional negligence action against an emergency room physician, an expert called to testify about issues relating to the relevant standard of care ought to be a physician who has had \u201csubstantial professional experience\u201d in treating patients while assigned to duty in an emergency room as an emergency room physician. The statutory objective would appear to be equally fostered by ensuring that the proposed expert be qualified to testify about a standard of care which is substantially the same as the standard of care prevailing in the locale where the emergency room treatment was provided to the plaintiff. Thus, the language of subdivision (c) of section 1799.110, although somewhat awkward, is apparent in its meaning and, when applied literally, \u201cneither results in an absurdity nor contravenes the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>(Sigala </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We recognize that the construction we have placed upon the phrase \u201cemergency medical coverage\u201d renders subdivision (c) of section 1799.110 different in application than subdivision (a) of section 1799.110. The court in <em>James </em>recognized this effect and discussed it in depth. <em>{James </em>v. <em>St. Elizabeth Community Hospital, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 82-83.) We will not speculate about why the Legislature chose to word the statute in such a way as to require, under subdivision (c), that standard of care testimony be given by a \u201clocality\u201d qualified expert in all cases where the treatment in issue was provided in a hospital emergency department by an emergency room physician, but require, under subdivision (a), that a \u201clocality\u201d jury instruction be given only in those cases where emergency room treatment involved potentially disabling or life threatening conditions. For our purposes, it is enough that the Legislature used materially different language in the two subdivisions; we presume it did so consciously. The interpretation effectively given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>section 1799.110 by <em>Zavala, James, </em>and now this court results in a logical and workable scheme. <em>(James, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.4th at pp. 82-83.) If the Legislature had something different in mind it may amend the statute to make that otherwise undisclosed intent manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Applying the foregoing principles to the record before us, it is clear appellant\u2019s malpractice claim arose out of treatment he received from each of the respondent physicians while each was on duty as an emergency room physician in the emergency department of Kern Valley Hospital. However, it is also clear appellant\u2019s offer of proof was insufficient to support a conclusion that Dr. Sherman was qualified to provide expert medical testimony under subdivision (c) of section 1799.110. Nothing in appellant\u2019s offer of proof established that Dr. Sherman had served for the prescribed five-year period as an emergency room physician in the emergency department of a general acute care hospital. In fact, Dr. Sherman frankly admitted he was not, and had not been, an emergency room physician; instead, he was an orthopedic specialist \u201con call\u201d to the emergency room to consult on and treat orthopedic injuries. Thus, the trial court, on the record before it, lacked discretion to allow Dr. Sherman to testify with respect to the standard of care. <em>(Zavala </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th at p. 1763; <em>Sigala </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1455-1456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">B. <em>Respondents\u2019 Designated </em>Expert<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The judgment is reversed.
