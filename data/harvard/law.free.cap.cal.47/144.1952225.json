In proceeding against an absent defendant upon mere constructive service the conditions of the statute must be strictly pursued, or the judgment cannot be supported upon appeal taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">This view renders it unnecessary to consider whether a judgment rendered upon mere appointment by the Court of an attorney for the defendant, and without service of process actual or constructive, could be upheld under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
