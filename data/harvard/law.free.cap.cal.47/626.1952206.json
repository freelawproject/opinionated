The remedy, if any exists, is by motion in the original cause.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b646-8\">Appeal from the District Court, Sixth Judicial District, Sacramento County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">On the sixth day of August, 1866, the people of the State of California obtained a judgment against John Doe, Bichard Boe, Coe 10,434, and the south one third of lot No. three, in the block bounded by O and P, and Front and Second streets, in the city of Sacramento, enforcing a lien for an assessment for grading the street in front of the lot. On the seventeenth day of August, 1866, an order of sale was issued on the judgment, and placed in the hands of the Sheriff, who failed to execute it. His term of office expired on the first Monday in March, 1868, and he then returned the execution to the clerk\u2019s office. It remained in the clerk\u2019s office until the eighteenth day of October, 1872, when, without any order or motion of Court, it was placed in the hands of the Sheriff, who advertised the lot for sale. This action was brought against Bryte, the Sheriff, to enjoin the sale. The Sheriff suffered a default to be taken, and the plaintiff moved for judgment, but the Court refused to grant the motion, and entered an order dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-10\"><em>Hamilton &amp; Dunlap, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-11\">A party in whose favor judgment is given, may, at any time within five years after the entry thereof, issue execution for its enforcement, as prescribed in this chapter.
