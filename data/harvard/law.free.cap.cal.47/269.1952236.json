Secondly: Said conveyances did not contain the recitals required by the laws under which the same were made showing proof of publication of the award therein mentioned according to said laws. Thirdly: Said conveyances did not contain recitals showing that the value of the respective lands was ever ascertained or paid, as prescribed by said laws under which the same were executed. Fourthly: Said conveyances did not contain any recitals showing that the expenses of the respective proceedings before said Commissioners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the Funded Debt, had been paid before said conveyances respectively were executed. Fifthly: That said conveyances did not affect the rights of the said plaintiff in any respect. Sixthly: That if the said conveyances, or any of them in any way affected the rights, of the plaintiff, it was only by conveying to the respective grantees therein an interest in said lands of which they instantly became seized to the sole use of the said plaintiff, which use instantly executed itself, and vested said interest in the said plaintiff solely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The plaintiff having finished his statement of the case, the defendants, by their counsel, demurred to the statement in open Court, and moved for a nonsuit thereon, and insisted, that admitting for the purpose of said motion, that the showing of the plaintiff was, in all respects true, as matter of fact, it did not appear that the plaintiff ought to have judgment against any of the defendants in the action, but that, on the contrary, it did appear that the defendants, and each of them, should have judgment against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">The Court, thereupon, granted the motion, to which decision the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-9\"><em>John W.

The Statutes of Limitation do not apply. The fee of the lands was in the United States until the legislative grant by Congress in 1854. No statute ran against that fee. None began to run until the passage of the Act of 1864. The action was brought within five years from the passage of that Act. The Hawes Act (limitation of one year) never applied to this or any other action. (Const. U. S., Art. I., Sec. 10; Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo; Organic Act of Congress of 1851, admitting California into the Union.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-11\"><em>John W.

S. Statutes at large, Vol. V., page 657), which is as follows: The Act of Congress has this value: that it shows that Congress thought that the United States, being a donor of a trust in public lands, for the benefit of occupants of the same, would be the visitor and controller of that trust, unless it relinquished the right of visitation and control to some other person or authority. It therefore expressly relinquished them, in this instance, to the Legislature of the respective State or Territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">But the inherent defect of the Yan Ness Ordinance was this: that the lands in question were pueblo lands, and that the title to them was to be acquired by confirmation of the city\u2019s claim, by the Courts of the United States, followed by an official survey, and a patent issued by their executives. This vice infected the confirmation of the Van Ness Ordinance by the Legislature (Laws 1858, p. 52.) The Legislature supposed that the city\u2019s title of the lands came through the entry of the same in the United States Land Office, under the Act of Congress cited in the next preceding paragraph, and that the Legislature of California, under and by the very terms of that Act had become the executors of the trust created by it. Whereas the city took nothing by such entry in the Land Office; the Legislature never had any control over the trust; nor had the city even any interest in the lands, except that derived from the confirmation of the Pueblo Claim, by the United States Circuit Court, and the Act of Congress of 1864, which follows it. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Bernal, </em>9 Wallace, U. S. R. 315.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">This confirmation is, first, for \u201clot-holders,\u201d a specific class of persons, namely: those holding lots, building and sowing lots, the only lots which could be granted by the Pueblo authorities, and does not extend to grants made by the city for the payment of its debts, whether funded or otherwise. Secondly, the residue is in trust for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the city. For what trust, and what use and benefit ? The same trust, and use and benefit which had always been stamped upon the residue of the ungranted pueblo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>lands, for the use of the inhabitants, as commons of wood, water and pasture. But, meanwhile, and in anticipation of this decree of* confirmation of its pueblo lands to the city of San Francisco, Congress, by section 5 of \u2018 \u2018 an Act to expedite the settlement of Titles to Lands in the State of California,\u201d approved July 1st, 1864, (U. S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 13, p. 332,) had itself relinquished the lands in question to the city of San Francisco, for the purposes specified in the Van Hess Ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">In confirming the claim of the city of San Francisco to its pueblo lands, Judge Field uses the following language: \u201cIt is difficult to determine with precision the exact character of the right or title held by pueblos to the lands assigned to them. The Government undoubtedly retained a right to control their use and disposition, and to appropriate them to public uses, until they had been vested in private proprietorship. Humerous laws have been cited to show that the title remained absolutely in the Government.\u201d (Col. Hist. Addenda, p. 228; <em>Grisar </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>6 Wallace, 362.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">In the case of <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Bernal, </em>9 Wallace U. S. R. 316, the Supreme Court of the United States made a further application of these principles, by holding that all titles asserted under the Van Hess Ordinance must stand or fall with the pueblo title, to be derived from the United States, and that they became vested in the beneficiaries when that title was in any way confirmed, by relation, as of the date of that ordinance. The case of <em>Merriman </em>v. <em>Bourne, </em>9 Wallace U. S. R. 592, sustains the same doctrine. This last cited case is of great interest and value, as completing a series of decisions to the effect that-Courts of final resort will sustain rights acquired by statute, even if they are acquired for the first time after appeal was taken from the judgment of the Court below. See also <em>Keller </em>v. <em>The State, </em>12 Maryland R. 322, and cases cited; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Day, </em>22 Maryland, 530. The case of <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Bernal </em>is ill point in the case in hand, as deciding that titles go back by relation for the purpose of upholding rights, and for no other purpose; e. <em>g. </em>to vest the fee of lands, and not to defeat it, by setting a statute of limitation in motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>As the order in which events actually takes place, is generally, if not always, the logical order, we shall recapitulate them:</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">First. The city of San Francisco had certain inchoate rights to four square leagues of pueblo lands, which rights were limited upon another inchoate right still more remote, namely: a right to have those lands assigned to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">Secondly. The city of San Francisco applied to the United States, by petition in the Federal Courts, to have those inchoate rights assigned, and finally confirmed to it in fee simple absolute, (Colonial History, Addenda, pages 119-121.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">Thirdly. The city of San Francisco, June 20th, 1855, (See Laws 1858, p. 52, sec. 1,) passed an order, commonly called the Van Ness Ordinance, by which it assented to the pueblo lands being vested in fee in certain classes of persons, therein described.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">Fourthly. The State of California, on March 11th, 1858, assented to the proposition of the city of San Francisco, to convert the right of commons into an estate in fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-10\">Fifthly. The claim of the city of San Francisco to four squares leagues of land, was disposed of by the Circuit Court of the United States, by confirming the claim. But the estate confirmed was not that estate in fee simple absolute which the city claimed in its petition. The result of the confirmation was: First, to give the legislative control of the streets and plazas to the legislature of California. Secondly, to confirm Alcalde grants to \u201clot-holders\u201d in fee. Thirdly, to confirm such grants made within the pueblo four square leagues by Spanish and Mexican Governors and Prefects, as had been or should thereafter be confirmed by the Courts of the United States. Fourthly, to confirm reservations made by the executive authorities of the United States. Fifthly, to confirm the residue to the city in trust, as commons for the use of the inhabitants. Sixthly, Congress, by Act of July 1st, 1864, transferred the fee in the lands to certain classes of persons named in the Van Ness Ordinance, and for the uses and purposes therein specified. Seventhly, the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>in 1865, dismissed their appeal from the decree of the Circuit Court of the United States confirming the claim of the city, and that decree was finally confirmed. Eighthly, the decree of confirmation and the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1863, are to be construed together, and the Act of Congress of J uly 1st, 1864, is to prevail and to control the construction. In none of these Acts is there any assent to the five years limitation supposed to be attempted by the Hawes Act of 1864, which is, therefore, null and void so far as titles, limited upon actual possession on or before January 1st, 1855, are concerned. We talk familiarly of vested rights as pertaining to municipal corporations which the legislature may create or annihilate at its pleasure. But, in fact, such use of the term, when interposed between the inhabitants of the city and the legislative power, is a mere perversion of language. There are no such vested rights. (Const, of Cal. Art. 4, Sec. 31; <em>McLaren </em>v. <em>Pennington, </em>1 Paige, 102; per Currey, J., <em>People </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>28 Cal. 560.) Such rights were created for the first time by the passage of that Act. Those rights were not narrowed by the confirmation in the Federal Courts; but, on the contrary, the scope of the confirmation was enlarged by the statute. The Act of Congress of July 1st, 1864, would have operated without any action of the legislature of California. The United States can grant any portion of the public domain to any class of 'citizens of San Francisco, and for any use they might prescribe, without the consent of the legislature of California. But, in fact, the legislature did consent in advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">The fee, then, was in the United States, at least until the passage of the Act of 1864, and until that time no Statute of Limitation began to run.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-7\"><em>Eugene Lies, </em>for Respondent Grosh.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">As the plaintiff has no written conveyance, it is easy to foresee that he will be driven to make good the following propositions: 1. That he is the beneficiary of the Van Ness Ordinance. 2. That this ordinance, even after ratification by the State Legislature, was insufficient to pass any title which the city had, or might thereafter acquire. 3. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>upon the ratification, in 1864, by Congress, the fee for the first time departed from the United States, whereupon, and not before, his cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">Now the plaintiff\u2019s course of reasoning seems to be this: That whilst, by the Van Ness Ordinance, the municipal authorities granted to himself the lairds described in his complaint, yet, for want of sufficient delegated authority, such grant was originally infirm, and, notwithstanding ratification by the State, remained so until cured by the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1864, when the fee, for the first time, vested in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance, without any backward relation operating to set the statutes of repose in motion as against him. True, he admits, the authors of the ordinance proceeded upon the theory that, in order to have a title to give, entry must be made under a general act of Congressional beneficence, applicable to towns everywhere. But that <em>\u201c </em>theory is false.\u201d The donating municipality was not aware of its true rights under a Mexican grant of superior import to the Congressional act in question\u2014a Mexican grant which conveyed some estate, although it failed to confer the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-7\"><em>Porter, Holladay </em>&amp; <em>Weeks, </em>also, for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">In this case the record shows confirmation to the city, May 18th, 1865, of her claim filed in the U. S. Land Commission, July, 1852. The confirmation relates back to the filing of the claim, and says the claim was true, <em>i. e., </em>that the city was the owner of the land, as asserted by her, by title derived from the Mexican Government, through the pueblo. This doctrine of relation, as a legal proposition, would seem so natural, logical and just, as to require no citation of authorities in its support. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>21 Cal. 220.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">Some of these defendants have title by deeds, from the Commissioners of the Funded Debt, while others rely simply on their possession and the Van Ness Ordinance. The legal title to all the land in this suit passed to the Commissioners of the Funded Debt, under the conveyance thereof to them, under the Act of 1851, (Statutes of that year, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>387.) Those of the defendants who have the conveyances from those Commissioners, rest here on their deeds, which carry the legal title. The other of the defendants who have not the conveyance from the Commissioners, rest upon the fact\u20141st. That the legal title is not in the plaintiff. 2d. That in ejectment he can not recover without it, except as against an immediate trespasser. 3d. That the defendants, \"being in possession at the proper -time, are entitled to the full benefits of the Van Ness Ordinance, which was at the time good and valid as to all except the Commissioners, who do not complain. In other words, the \"Van Ness Ordinance was not invalid even as to land which the city had then lately conveyed to the Fund Commissioners in trust, for as to such lands, it was valid as a license to occupy, subject only to the claim of the Commissioners. <em>(Hubbard </em>v. Sullivan, 18 Cal. 523.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\">Plaintiff says he has the title, because he was in possession first. Defendants all say they have the legal title, because they were in the actual possession at the proper time to bring them within the letter and spirit of the Van Ness Ordinance, while some have deeds of conveyance from- the Commissioners.' The grant in the \"Van Ness Ordinance enures to those in actual possession claiming for themselves. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>37 Cal. 366.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-7\">The so-called Hawes Act, of March 5th, 1864, (Statutes 1863-64, p. 149), is a complete defense to this suit. Plaintiff\u2019s brief is directed to the point that he is the grantee meant under the Van Ness Ordinance. We say no. You did not bring your suit within one year after that Act took effect, and you had no actual possession within five years before your suit was commenced. The Hawes Act says: In such case you get no aid from the Van. Ness Ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-8\"><em>E. B.

That decision has been acquiesced in by the bench and bar ever since. It has been repeatedly affirmed by this Court in innumerable cases, and the principles therein laid down have formed the rule of decision in determining the title to land in the larger portion of the city of San Francisco. If any questions are to be regarded as settled, we are certainly justified in considering this one of them. If the Court should think otherwise, doubtless further opportunity will be given to discuss it. We shall confine ourselves in this brief to a simple review of what has been decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-7\">The plaintiffs right of action is barred by the Statute of Limitations.

He must enforce his right to recover within the period of the Statute of Limitations, and gain possession by that means, in order to toll the title to himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b303-9\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The plaintiff was nonsuited upon his opening statement. It appears therefrom that the plaintiff entered into the actual possession of the premises in controversy in Hovem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>her, 1846, and so remained in possession for about one year; that during his temporary absence a party of \u25a0 soldiers, pretending to act on behalf of the United States, but really without authority, entered upon the premises, destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s house thereon, and the military, in command at San Francisco, retained the possession of the premises; that the plaintiff endeavored to regain the possession, but was always prevented from so doing; that the defendants succeeded to the possession, and were in the actual possession thereof on the first day of January, 1850, claiming the same in their own right, and adversely to the plaintiff, and have ever since remained in such possession. The premises are a portion of the pueblo lands of the pueblo of San Francisco, and are a part of the lands described in the act of March 11th, 1858, ratifying and confirming the Van Hess Ordinance (Stats, of 1858, p. 52), and a part also of the lands mentioned in the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1864, confirming the same ordinance (13 U. S. Stats. 332).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The plaintiff claims that by means of those acts, and the operation of the statutes above referred to, he acquired the title in fee to the premises. By the 5th section of the act of Congress of July 1st, 1864, all the right and title of the United States to the lands within the corporate limits of San Francisco, as defined by the Act of April 15th, 1851, with certain exceptions therein named, were relinquished and granted to the city <em>\u201c </em>for the uses and purposes specified in the ordinances of said city, ratified by an act of the Legislature of the said State, approved on the eleventh of March, 1858, entitled an act concerning the city of San Francisco, and to ratify and confirm certain ordinances \u00f3f the Common Council of the city.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">One of the ordinances referred to in that act is an ordinance which is commonly known as the Van Hess Ordinance. That ordinance having been ratified and confirmed by the Act of March 11th, 1858, took effect by relation, as of the date of its passage. The plaintiff\u2019s position is that he took whatever right, title or interest the city then held, and intended to transfer by the ordinance, and that therefore he is one of the persons for whose use the right and title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the United States was relinquished and granted to the city, by\u00aethe Act of Congress of July 1st, 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The right, title or interest which was transferred by virtue of the ordinance, may, for convenience, be denominated the Van Hess Ordinance title. The beneficiaries provided for by the ordinance may be divided into four classes: First, those who held title by virtue of the grants and conveyances enumerated in the ordinance; second, those who were in the actual possession, by themselves or by their tenants, on the first day of January, 1855, and so continued up to the twentieth day of June, 1855; third, those whose possession had been \u201c interrupted by an intruder or trespasser, \u201d and \u201chad been recovered by legal process;\u201d and fourth, those whose possession had been \u201cinterrupted by an intruder and trespasser,\u201d and \u201cmay be recovered by legal process.\u201d The plaintiff, if entitled to benefits of the ordinance, falls within the fourth class.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The defendants having been in the actual possession of the premises on the first day of January, 1855, claiming adversely to the plaintiff, and having continued in possession from thence up to the 20th day of June, 1855, and up to the commencement of this action, are <em>prima facie </em>entitled to the Van Hess Ordinance title; and the plaintiff, in order to show that he is entitled to the benefits of the ordinance, and acquired that title, must make it appear not only that his possession was \u201cinterrupted by an intruder or trespasser\u201d \u2014that is to say, that he ivas ousted from the possession\u2014 but also that the possession from which he was ousted \u201cmay be recovered by legal process.\u201d The question as to whether he is entitled to the benefits of the ordinance, depends upon the construction to be given to the language of the ordinance, \u201c may be recovered by legal process.\u201d By the words \u201clegal process\u201d is meant an action brought in a Court of competent jurisdiction. The only difficult matter for construction is the words \u201cmay be recovered;\u201d and the question arising upon those words is whether they import a right of recovery only, or a recovery in fact\u2014that is to say, whether the Van Hess Ordinance title devolved upon the person who then possessed the right of recovery as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>an intruder or trespasser, or whether it vests in the person who in fact recovers the possession from such intruder or trespasser. , We are of the opinion that those words mean, when read with the other words of the section, \u201cshall be recovered.\u201d The purpose of the ordinance, as we construe it, was to give the Van Ness Ordinance title to those who had already recovered the possession from an intruder or trespasser, and to those who should thereafter recover the possession from an intruder or trespasser. The recovery contemplated by that provision, was not one which might be had on one of the grants or conveyances, mentioned in the second section of the ordinance, for the persons holding title by virtue of such grants and conveyances, were deemed to be in possession of the lands thereby granted and conveyed, and the Van Ness Ordinance title vested in them immediately upon the taking effect of the ordinance; but the recovery was one which was to be had upon some right or title other than such grants and conveyances. In respect to the first three classes of beneficiaries, as above enumerated, the ordinance makes possession, or that which is declared or would be deemed in law, equivalent to possession, the fact or condition, by virtue of which the Van Ness Ordinance title vests in the grantee; and we are of the opinion that it was contemplated by the ordinance, that those who are comprehended in the fourth class should also have a recovery, by means of which they, like those holding-title by virtue of the grants and conveyances, should be deemed to be in possession of the land recovered. As to the persons of the fourth class, the recovery of the possession occupies the place, and stands in the stead, of the actual possession which those of the second class are required to have\u2014it is the fact, the condition, by virtue of which the Van Ness Ordinance title vests in them. Had it been the intention to give that title to those who then had only the right of recovery, it is unaccountable that it should not have been so expressed in the ordinance, instead of saying that it should vest in those who then had recovered, or those who may recover. The expression, \u201chas been recovered or may be recovered,\u2019\u2019was employed to denote past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>recoveries and future recoveries, but neither in the one sense more than the other, do the words signify merely the right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">If this be the proper construction of the ordinance, the Van Ness Ordinance title has not vested in the plaintiff, and, of course, he cannot rely on it for a recovery in this action. The ordinance declares, in effect, that a person included in the fourth class, who shall recover the possession of the lands from which he was ousted, shall have the Van Ness Ordinance title, but does not declare, nor can it be inferred therefrom, that he shall receive that title not only as the fruits, but also for the purpose, of a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">When such a person has only a prior possession, as the ground upon which to recover the possession from the trespasser or intruder, his rights and his remedies are measured by tlie-same rules that they would be in an action brought for the recovery of the possession of lands situated without said city, and in which the plaintiff relied solely on prior possession. The plaintiff\u2019s opening statement shows only one ground upon which he can claim a right of recovery in this action, and that is his prior possession. The statute of March 11th, 1858, gave him no new or additional ground of recovery. It m\u00e9rely ratified and confirmed the ordinance, leaving it in all respects, so far as regards the matters here involved, as it would have been had the Common Council, at (the time of the passage of the ordinance, possessed competent authority to dispose of the right, title, or interest of the city in or to the lands within its corporate limits, in the mode adopted by the ordinance. Nor does the plaintiff derive any aid in the solution of the question here involved from the Act of Congress of July 1st, 1864. The right, title, interest, or estate in, or power over, those lands which the city held, prior to the passage of the Act of Congress, she held subject to the control of the Legislature of the State alone; and Congress could not control the city in that respect, in any manner, or for any purpose whatsoever. The act of Congress merely relinquished and granted to the city, for the uses and purposes specified in the ordinance, whatever right or title the United States then held in or to the lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>within the corporate limits of the city, etc. It is unnecessary, for the purposes of this case, to determine what right or title the United States then held, or what right, title, interest, estate, or power in or over the lands the city held at the time of the passage of the Act of Congress; but whatever right or title, in any parcel of those lands the United States then held, passed to the city for &amp;e use and benefit of the persons entitled to the Van Ness Ordinance title, if there was any person so entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The sole ground, as already stated, upon which the plaintiff can rely for a recovery, is his prior possession; and if he fails in that, the nonsuit was right. The defendants were in the actual possession of the premises on and before the first day of January, 1855, and so remained from that time up to the time of the commencement of this action\u2014 the seventeenth day of April, 1868\u2014holding adversely to the plaintiff, and they set up the Statute of Limitations. The statute commenced running on the eleventh day of April, 1855, the day of the passage of the amendatory statute, and had fully run when this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">If the construction we have given to the ordinance be maintainable, the Statute of Limitations is as applicable here as to a case in which the controversy turns on the relative right of the parties growing out of the prior possession of one party and the adverse possession of the other party, of lands situated without the city of San Francisco. \"We see nothing in the case which leads to the conclusion that the Statute of Limitations is not applicable. Had the ordinance provided that the YanNess Ordinance title should vest in the person who should recover from an intruder or trespass!\u2019 in an action to be commenced within a designated time, can it be doubted that a person claiming the benefits of the ordinance must have commenced his action within the designated time? There is nothing in the ordinance which gives a further or other time for the commencement of an action than is prescribed by the Statute of Limitations, nor can it be inferred therefrom that it was intended that such statute should not be applicable to actions that might be brought to recover the possession of the lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>from an intruder or trespasser. The Act of Congress of July 1, 1864, does not have the effect to prevent the running of the statute, or to fix a new time from which the statute would begin to rnn in cases of this character. Had the plaintiff acquired the Van Ness Ordinance title before the passage of the Act, then the question might arise whether he could be barred of his action until five years after the passage of the Act; but that question does not arise here, for that Act merely relinquished and granted to the city whatever right and title the United States had, for the uses and purposes specified in the ordinance; and the plaintiff cannot claim the benefit of the Act until he brings himself within the ordinance by a recovery of the possession as therein provided for. In <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Bevans, </em>1 Sawyer, 653, both parties claimed under Alcalde\u2019s grants\u2014 the one issued in 1846, and the other in 1847, and both prior to the treaty, and the Van Ness Ordinance title had vested in the plaintiff; but the question there considered does not arise here, for the plaintiff, as we have seen, must rely for a recovery upon prior possession alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Our conclusion upon this point is, that a person who comes within the fourth class of the beneficiaries provided for by the ordinance, and who at its passage had no other right or title than such as proceeded from prior possession, and who sues an intruder or trespasser to recover the possession of lands, in order to entitle himself to the Tan Ness Ordinance title, must have commenced his action within the time prescribed by the Statute of Limitations; and that the statute commenced running in this case upon the passage of the Statute of Limitations of April 11th, 1855; and that more than five years having elapsed, after that date, before the action was commenced, and the defendants, during all that time, holding the possession adversely to the plaintiff, the action is barred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>McKinstry, J., dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">I cannot agree to the construction placed by the majority of the Court upon the second section of the Van Ness Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">No estate was acquired by any one by means of the ordinance alone; but, in considering its language, it is convenient to regard the ordinance as effecting the purpose intended. That purpose, as I understand it, was to release and grant <em>(in prcesenti), </em>the right and claim of the city to all the classes of persons mentioned in the second section. The section begins: \u201cThe city of San Francisco hereby relinquishes and grants,\u201d etc. Much stress has been placed on the words, \u201chas been or may be recovered by legal process;\u201d \u201cmay\u201d being considered the equivalent of \u201cshall,\u201d and the recovery by legal process held to be a condition precedent to the vesting of the grant. But it is admitted that the rights of such persons as were in possession during the period mentioned, and of those who, having been previously ousted, had recovered the possession before the passage of the order, became fixed\u2014so far as the city could fix them\u2014when the ordinance ivas adopted; and the granting words equally cover those who had not recovered the possession when the ordinance was passed, but who then had the right of possession by virtue of a prior occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The persons included within the last class could ordinarily acquire the enjoyment of their property only by an action for the recovery of the possession\u2014an action which would determine the prior possession and ouster; and the words \u201cmay re'cover,\u201d etc., are simply a declaration of what would have been the legal effect of the grant had these words been omitted. With or without the clause referred to, a proper suit was the mode of ascertaining whether the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits of the ordinance when it took effect. The right and claim of the city was transferred at the date of the ordinance; the result of the legal process, if the plaintiff should be successful, being only to identify, the grantee and place him in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>If this construction is correct, the opening statement of counsel connected the plaintiff with the pueblo title.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">If the plaintiff was connected with the pueblo title, an action by him was not barred by the Statute of Limitations until July 1st, 1869. <em>(Montgomery </em>v. <em>Bevans, </em>1 Sawyer R., 653; <em>Henshaw </em>v. <em>Bissel, </em>Sup.
