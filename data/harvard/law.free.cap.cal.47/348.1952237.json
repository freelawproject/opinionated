Action to restrain the sale of land under execution. The defendant, Anderson, having initiated a homestead claim under the laws of the United States in 18G3, subsequently perfected it, and received a a patent in June, 1869. Prior to the issuance of the patent, and pending the proceedings, he became indebted to defendant Little upon a promissory note. Subsequently, an action was brought upon the note, and a judgment was rendered against him January 19th, 1871. The plaintiff purchased the premises from Anderson in- February, 1871, and afterwards brought this action to enjoin the sale. The plaintiff had judgment and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-7\"><em>Beatty &amp; </em>Denson, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-8\">The patent had issued, and the title vested absolutely in Charles Anderson before the judgment was rendered. After the United States Government has vested an absolute title to any part of the public domain in a private citizen, no Act of Congress can say whether the land so granted shall or shall not be liable to execution. This is a matter completely subject to State control, and Congress has no constitutional power over the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-9\"><em>Wells &amp; Ooghlan, </em>for Eespondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-10\">The statute of the United States has expressly provided that no lands acquired under the provisions of the Homestead Act shall, in any event, become liable to the satisfaction of any debt or debts contracted prior to the issuing of the patent therefor. (Brightley\u2019s Digest, U. S. Laws, vol. 2, p. 288, Sec. 44; 12 U. S. Statutes, 392; Stat. of May 20th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1862, Sec. 4.) It was competent for the sovereign power to grant the land with this restriction, and the State of California is bound by it. <em>(Bagnell </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>13 Peters, 451; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gratiot, </em>14 Peters, 526; <em>Jourdan </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>4 How. 169; <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>20 Howard, U.

If this theory be sound, Congress has made an abortive effort to protect from seizure and sale, for antecedent debts, homesteads granted to actual settlers on the public lands. But we think it is not sound. Under the Federal Constitution, Congress is vested with the exclusive power to manage and dispose of the public lands. It may dispose of them in such a manner, on such terms and conditions, and subject to such restrictions and limitations as in its judgment will best promote the public welfare. In furtherance of what is deem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ed a wise policy, te\u00e1ding to encourage settlement, and to develop the resources of the country, it invites the heads of families to occupy small parcels of the public land, and agrees with them, that if they will reside upon the land for the period of five years, they shall receive the title in fee, discharged of all debts of this character, before then contracted. To deny to Congress the power to make a valid and effective contract of this character with the homestead claimant would materially abridge its power of disposal, and seriously interfere with a favorite policy of the government, which fosters measures tending to a distribution of the lands to actual settlers at a nominal price.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">' Judgment affirmed.
