After issue was joined, the defendant moved for a continuance on account of the absence of certain witnesses, and, in support of his motion, filed an affidavit, in which the only showing of diligence was a statement that, four days before the date of the affidavit, the subpenas for the witnesses had been issued and placed in the hands of the Sheriff, and that the Sheriff had not been able to find the witnesses. The motion was denied. The next day the cause was tried by the Court without a jury, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff. The defendant then moved for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, and filed affidavits tending to show that he had not had undisturbed possession of the leased premises ; but counter-affidavits were presented by the plaintiff, contradicting such statements. The motion was denied, and the defendant appealed from the order denying it. The transcript contains no bill of exceptions. \u2022</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">\n<em>R. T.

But were the affidavit suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cient in this respect, the action of the Court in denying the motion could not be reviewed, because it is not presented by a bill of exceptions. The affidavits are clearly insufficient to entitle the defendant to a. new trial, on the ground of newly-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
