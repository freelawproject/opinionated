The Court found that the plaintiff was the attorney of the defendant in the District Court of the United States, in the case mentioned in the opinion, and that judgment was rendered therein on the eighth day of June, 1869, and that there was no other employment than the original and first employing, and that the value of plaintiff\u2019s services, rendered up to the time of judgment, was three thousand dollars. This action was commenced June 24, 1871. The Court below was of opinion that plaintiff\u2019s claim for services rendered prior to June 8,1869, was barred by the Statute of Limitations, and that as there was no proof of the value of his services after June 23, he was entitled to recover the nominal sum of one dollar, and gave Mm judgment for one dollar.

That the findings of facts warrant a judgment for three thousand dollars in gold coin, and the judgment, as it now stands, is inconsistent with the same, and should, therefore, be modified to conform to the facts as found by the Court. <em>(Lucas </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>28 Cal. 591; <em>James </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>31 Cal. 213; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cushing et al., </em>41 Cal. 97; <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Kensel, </em>41 Cal. 512.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-11\">Second.

Judgment was entered in the case on June 8th, 1869\u2014the defendant having in July following sold out his interest in the San Fernando property \u2014the Court finds that after June 8th, 1869, the plaintiff rendered no other professional service or act except that of being responsible as attorney in the cause, and looking after the case up to the time when his client, the defendant Pico, sold his interest in the land. In other words, the Court below finds that the single employment of the plaintiff extended to and included services rendered in the case as late as July, 1869j and the action here having been commenced in June, 1871, the attempted defense of the Statute of Limitations will not avail the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to render judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $3,000 and costs.
