The election for the removal of the county seat of Kern County was held on the 15th day of February, 1873. The two places voted for were Havilah, the then county seat, and Bakersfield. It was alleged that the Board did not count the votes cast at two precincts for Bakersfield. The Board declared that Havilah had received a majority of votes, and it was claimed that if the votes for the two precincts had been counted, Bakersfield would have received a majority. Notice was given, and filed on the 8th day of September, 1873, that an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>cation for the writ would be made on the 1st day of the following October term of the Supreme Court. The petition presents the following as the reasons why the writ should issue from the Supreme Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\"><em>\u201c </em>1. The Constitution of the State (Art. VI., Sec. 4) gives this Court jurisdiction of such proceeding and does not confer jurisdiction in such cases on any other Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">\u201c2. If the District Court has the jurisdiction, such Court in and for the county of Kern holds no term until the third Monday in November next, and the delay necessarily incident to the trial in that Court and on appeal, if one be taken, is injurious to the petitioners. In the meantime no public improvements can be safely made at Bakersfield or Havilah.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-8\">\u201c3. This is a case where the people are parties, and, by the course of practice o'f this Court, should have precedence in point of time, and a speedy determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-9\">\u201c4. It is \u00e1 case where every elector of the county is interested, most of them having cast their votes at the election contested in this proceeding, and being disqualified as jurors from sitting as such in the trial of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-10\"><em>\u201c5. </em>The Attorney-General, representing the people in this case, resides at the State Capital, and cannot well atteml a term of Court at Havilah, without neglecting his other official duties.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-11\"><em>John L.
