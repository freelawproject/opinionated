The parties were tenants in common, each owning an undivided one half. The defendant occupied the whole property, and the plaintiff claimed that the use of his undivided one half was worth $40 per month, and for sixth months, $240. The Court ordered a sale of the entire property, and gave judgment for $90 rent. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-7\"><em>George P.

The answer admits that the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the re\u00f1\u00ed of the property, but avers that the amount due was only $70. The proof as to the value of the rents was conflicting, and we cannot disturb the judgment on the ground that it was not justified by the evidence, in respect to the amount due. The appeal is frivolous, and was apparently taken for delay. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Judgment affirmed, with fifty per cent, damages. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
