On the eighth day of January, 1873, notice of intention to move for a new trial was given by the respondents, who thereafter, in accordance with the practice prevailing before the taking effect of the codes, filed an agreed statement in support of the motion, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, however, \u201creserving all objections to the said statement based upon the proposition that said notice for a new trial should be upon a bill of exceptions.\u201d The motion was based upon certain alleged errors of law and insufficiences of the evidence to justify the decision. The objection reserved to the form of procedure by statement was overruled by the court below, and the motion for a new trial was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The Code provides (Section 658) that an application for a new trial upon such grounds as these shall be made upon \u201cbills of exception on file.\u201d To maintain that the former practice was applicable to his motion for a new trial, the respondent relies upon the Code of Civil Procedure (Section 8), which is as follows: \u201cNo action or proceeding commenced before this Code takes effect, and no right accrued is affected by its provisions, but the proceedings therein must conform to the requirements of this Code as far as applicable,\u201d and upon the last clause of Section 18 of the same code, by which it is in effect provided that the repeal of the statutes theretofore in force does not \u201caffect any right already existing or accrued, or any action or proceeding already taken, except as in this code provided.\u201d That the Code of Civil Procedure was designed to apply in a measure to actions pending at the time it took effect, is obvious upon the text of Section 8 <em>(supra), </em>where it is in terms provided that the proceedings even in such actions \u201cmust conform to the requirements of this code as far as applicable.\u201d The motion for a new trial afforded by the late Practice Act upon a statement settled in accordance with its provisions was not a right within the intent of the latter clause of Section 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but a remedy merely, and even though notice of the rendition of the judgment be considered to have been given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the plaintiff before the Code took effect, the proceeding upon the part of the defendant to obtain a new trial was not thereby become \u201ca proceeding already taken,\u201d for it cannot be said to have been initiated earlier than the point of time when the notice of intention to move was served by the defendants and filed with the Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We think that the objection taken by the respondent must prevail, and the order granting anew trial must be reversed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
