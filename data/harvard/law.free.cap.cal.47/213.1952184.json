That defendants, by Maurice Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co., agreed in writing to pay the purchase money on receiving the deed, the plaintiff paying one quarter of the taxes then due on the property. That on or about December 15, 1868, the plaintiff, by his agent, tendered to the defendants a deed of the property, and demanded payment, but the defendants refused it. There was a prayer that the defendants be adjudged to specifically perform, and that the plaintiff have judgment for $50,000, and that the Court decree him a vendor\u2019s lien on the lot to secure the purchase price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-9\">The answer denied that the defendants were partners, and denied that they made the contract, but did not specially set up a misjoinder of parties defendant. The answer also denied that the defendants authorized Maurice Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co. to agree to pay the purchase money, or that the agent of the plaintiff was authorized to sell the premises. All the material allegations of the complaint were denied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Court found the allegations of the complaint true, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff according to the prayer. The defendants moved for a new trial, and filed a statement July 21, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">From this statement it appears that the plaintiff, who had been a resident in San Francisco in 1866, went to Germany to reside, and when he left gave a power of attorney to Charles Meinecke to manage his business in San Francisco, and to lease his real estate and collect rents, without power to sell the lot in dispute. There were two stores on the lot in dispute which were rented, and Meinecke collected the rents. August 26, 1868, the plaintiff wrote to Meinecke from Bremen, Germany, in which he said: \u201c Could my property there no more be rented so as to bring one per cent, per month on the value, I am, with the exception of the Clay street property, .which must bring $10,000 before it can be sold, as much inclined to sell the same, than to hold on any longer. * * You valued Spear street property at $15,000, and Battery street property at $50,000. Can the prices be got, you can close the sales. I should confirm per telegraph,, and then send power of attorney as soon as a guarantee deposit would have been made; and if afterwards the purchaser should want a deed, I can send it too.\u201d'In a former letter to Meinecke, dated July 28, 1868, the plaintiff said: \u201cIf you can get a binding offer of over $50,000, I may conclude to sell at once. In this case, please telegraph.\u201d This letter referred to the Battery street lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">Upon the receipt of the letter of July 28th, Meinecke called on Maurice Dore &amp; Co., who were real estate brokers, and informed them that the property was for sale at $50,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">In September, Dore told Meinecke they had a purchaser at $50,000, and called for an abstract of title and the title papers, which were given to him, and he receipted for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">On the twenty-ninth of September, Meinecke executed and delivered to Dore &amp; Co,, a paper called \u201c Exhibit E.\u201d in the opinion, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cI have this day sold to Messrs.

On the ninth of October, Maurice Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co. gave Meinecke the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-11\">\u201cMr. Meinecke\u2014Dear Sir: Messrs.

About the same time Meinecke had conversations with M. &amp; W. about the purchase, and they admitted having made it. About the eleventh of October, Winchester told Meinecke his approval of the title had been finished and accepted, and Winchester requested M. to settle for the rent, which M. had collected on the first of October, and told him Mr. Hayes would settle it at the store of M. <em>&amp; </em>W. Meinecke called at the store and made the settlement, and received the following receipt:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\">\u201c Received from J. H. Rutenberg four hundred dollars, being one month\u2019s rent of two stores, No. 218, 220 and 222, 224, On Battery Street, bought of him on the first of October, 1868, said rent, being in advance from October 1, to November 1, 1868, in accordance with the leases made by him to the present occupants, Messrs. Lewis Brothers and Prosper May.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">\u201cSan Francisco, October 12, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">\u201c$400, gold coin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-10\">\u201c Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-11\">Meinecke did not collect the rents after this. Main &amp; Winchester collected the rent for November and December, 1868, and then some arrangement was made by which the tenants paid the rent to the California Trust Company. Main &amp; Winchester informed Lewis, one of the tenants, that they had purchased the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-12\">When Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester made the deposit referred to in the paper signed by Dore <em>&amp; </em>Go., Dore &amp; Co. informed them that they had signed the document and made the purchase for them. Dore &amp; Go. gave Meinecke a deed of the property to be sent to Bremen, to Rutenberg, to be executed by him. Meinecke forwarded it, and Rutenberg exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>cuted it November 11, 1888, and sent it to Meinecke. He carried it to Winchester and asked for the money. W. said he would submit it to his attorney. A short time afterwards, Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester objected to the form of the acknowledgment of the deed, and refused to accept it.' Meinecke then tendered it. Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester soon after made a tender of the $50,000 to Meinecke and demanded a deed, but he replied he had no deed but the one he had the other day. Main &amp; Winchester then tendered the rent they had collected from the tenants. Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester soon after withdrew $2,000 of the deposit they had made with Dore &amp; Co., allowing Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co. to keep $500, for their commissions. In January, 1859, Rutenberg sent to Meinecke, from Bremen, a power of attorney authorizing him to execute a deed to Main <em>&amp; </em>Winchester for the property. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\"><em>A. J. Gunnison, </em>for Appellants, argued that the agreement was within the 8th Section of the Statute of Frauds, and that there was no mutuality in the contract because Meinecke had no power to bind Rutenberg by a written contract, and cited <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>40 Cal. 243; Browne <em>on </em>Frauds, Sec. 511; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>24 Cal. 127; Fry on Specific Performance, Sec. 286; <em>Parkkurst </em>v. <em>Van Courtland, </em>1 John Ch. 282; <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>2 Md. Ch. 401; and <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>1 Md. Ch. 13. He also argued, that Dore <em>&amp; </em>Go. had no authority to execute any written instrument to bind the appellants, and cited <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>26 Wend. 362, and <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>10 Paige Ch. 537. He further argued that, as the partnership between the defendants was not proved, and a joint contract was not proved, that the decree against the defendants jointly was error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\"><em>McAllisters &amp; Bergin, </em>for Respondents, argued, that the letter of August 26th, 1868, authorized Meinecke <em>to </em>execute the contract, and that if the letter was not clear, the surrounding circumstances showed the intention of the writer, and that intention must prevail, and cited, <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Clark, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>29 Cal. 304; <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>33 Cal. 206; <em>Very </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>13 How. U. S. 358; and <em>Leroy </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>8 How. 451. They also argued that it was not necessary that the authority to Bleineclce should be under seal, and cited, <em>Love </em>v. <em>Sierra Nevada L. &amp; M. M. Co. </em>32 Cal. 654; <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Frink, </em>24 Cal. 171; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 Hill, 112, <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>1 Seld. 241; and Brown on Statute of Frauds, Sec. 370. They also argued that the contract of sale was valid, because the two papers signed by Meinecke and Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co., were parts of the same transaction, and cited, <em>Vanzine </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>18 Ark. 65; <em>Lavering </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>18 Pick. 540; <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>6 Pick. 157; and Brown\u2019s Statute of Frauds, Sec. 550, and that parol authority to either Meinecke or Dore &amp; Co. was sufficient, and cited, Story on Agency, Sec. 50, and <em>Pringle </em>v. <em>Pringle, </em>53 Barb. 20.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-6\">By the Court, McKinstry, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The writing\u2014Exhibit E\u2014signed by Meinecke, as-attomey in fact for the plaintiff, was sufficient in form, and was executed in such manner as complied with the Statute of Frauds. The statute only requires that the memorandum of sale of real property shall be signed by the vendor, or his agent. (Act concerning fraudulent conveyances, Sections 8 and 9.) The writing need not be a specialty, and it is well settled that a power to execute simple parol contracts may be verbal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">It is said Meinecke had power to find a purchaser satisfactory to the plaintiff, but none to make or sign the memorandum. It is true that the power of a mere broker is thus limited, although he be employed \u201cto sell\u201d real estate, because these words are construed with reference to the actual purpose of his employment. But if the language used, regarded in the light of the surrounding circumstances, clearly shows fhat the agency is intended to be more extensive than that of a broker, the Court will so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\"><em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>40 Cal. 243, has been cited as establishing a different rule, but this it does not do, as is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>apparent by the closing words of the opinion in that case: \u201cWhile it is true that the power to sign the name of a principal to a contract of sale may be given verbally, we think that the words used for the purpose should be distinct and clear in their meaning and import, and should with the requisite degree of certainty manifest the intention of the principal to do something more than merely to employ a broker.\u201d That the plaintiff intended and clearly expressed his intention that Meinecke should do more than discharge the functions of a broker is apparent from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In the month of July the plaintiff, who was at Bremen, wrote to Meinecke in respect to the propertyin controversy: \u201c If you can get a binding offer of over $50,000, I may conclude to sell at once. In this case, please telegraph. * * * If you have a good offer, I can simply confirm it by telegraph. You have a deposit made, and I will then send power of attorney,\u201d etc. Upon the' receipt of this, Meinecke placed the lot with Maurice Dore &amp; Co., brokers, for sale at fifty thousand dollars; and about the fifth of September was informed by them that they had a customer who was willing to pay the price demanded. Subsequently, Meinecke received a letter from the plaintiff dated August 26th, which contained the following passage: \u201cYou valued Market street property\u201d (the lot now in question) \u201cat $50,000. Can the price be got, you can el&lt;?se the sale. I should confirm per telegraph, and then send power of attorney as soon as a guarantee deposit would have been made.\u201d September 13th, the plaintiff again writes, acknowledging the receipt of a telegraphic dispatch from Meinecke, and adds: \u201cI at once sent you the following telegram: \u2018At $50,000, the lowest, sale confirmed.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">From the foregoing, and other corroborative circumstances in the record, it clearly appears it was intended that, on the receipt of the dispatch confirming his preliminary action, - Meinecke should be clothed with power to do all the law requires to make the sale binding on' his principal. Whether he was authorized to enter into special covenants on behalf of the plaintiff is not a question arising in this case; he was authorized to execute the memorandum which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>rendered the sale valid under the Statute of Frauds. After-wards, and on the 29th of September, the memorandum (Exhibit E) was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The proof that Maurice Dore &amp; Co. were authorized to complete the purchase on the part of the defendants, is clear and convincing. The defendants paid to Maurice Dore &amp; Go. their commission as brokers; they deposited with them\u2014soon after the memorandum was made\u2014an additional sum of $2,500, to abide the arrival of a deed, as required by the terms of the contract contained in the memorandum; they expressed their willingness to take the deed which .did arrive, except for the recital in it of a \u201cgold coin\u201d consideration, and an informality in the acknowledgment. These facts, and others presented by the testimony, show that the defendants authorized and ratified the conduct of Maurice Dore <em>&amp; </em>Co., and that they knew the contents of the memorandum, and accepted its delivery to the brokers as a delivery to themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">With the exception of that now to be considered, we find no material error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">By the forty-fourth section of the Practice Act it is provided that, if too many persons are joined as defendants and the fact does not appear on the face of the complaint, it must be taken by answer or it will be deemed waived <em>(Gillam </em>v. <em>Sigman, </em>29 Cal, 637.) The section applies equally to actions <em>ex contractu </em>and <em>ex delicto, </em>and to the extent necessary to give it effect controls the principle that the proofs and allegations must correspond. But this only means .that if the evidence does not connect all the defendants (and the misjoinder has not been specially pleaded) the plaintiff shall not fail as against all. Each of the defendants is still entitled to use the joint denial that the contract was made, for his individual protection, and in case there is a failure of evidence as to any one, that one should have a decision or verdict in his favor. In the present case there was no sufficient evidence that the defendant Hayes was a party to the -contract averred in the complaint. It follows that he was entitled to a judgment in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Judgment affirmed as to the defendants Main and Win-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Chester and reversed as to defendant Hayes, who shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Neither Mr. Justice Cbockett, nor Mr. Justice Bhodes, expressed an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
