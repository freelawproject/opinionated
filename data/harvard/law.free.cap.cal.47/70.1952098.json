On the thirteenth day of September following, the District Court, on the application of Coburn, supported by his affidavit, entered an order setting aside the said order of May 26th, and directing that all proceedings under said order be stayed. Upon the entry of this last order in the District Court, the proceedings were brought into this Court by a writ of certiorari, and the only question made is, whether the last order was in excess of the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">We think that the authority of the Court to set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>order of May 26th is as clear as was its authority to enter it in the first instance. The order of May 26th was incidental to the proceedings, and interlocutory in its character, and, during the pendency of the proceedings, was subject to be modified or vacated altogether by the Court, as the circumstances from time to time appearing might seem to require. This is the general rule as to such orders entered in the progress of a cause in court, and we know of no principle of law which excepts proceedings taken in the exercise of the power of eminent domain from the operation of the general rule in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The writ must, therefore, be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
