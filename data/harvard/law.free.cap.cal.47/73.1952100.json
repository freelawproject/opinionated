The child was not born in wedlock, for Josephine had never been married. On said day, she made a declaration of homestead on the premises, and had it recorded. The premises did not exceed five thousand dollars in value. On the 22d day of September, 1869, John Conery obtained a judgment against Miss White, in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco, and filed a certified copy of the transcript of the judgment in the Eecorder\u2019s office of Alameda County, and issued an execution thereon, before the delivery and recording of the mortgage to the plaintiff, Ellis, hereafter mentioned. The sheriff sold the property on the execution; defendant, Walter 0. Dimmick, became the purchaser, and received a sheriff\u2019s deed on the 9th day of July, 1870. On the 16th day of October, 1869, Miss White mortgaged the premises to the plaintiff, Ellis. On the 4th day of November, 1870, he commenced this action to enforce the lien of his mortgage, and made the defendants, other than Miss White, defendants, under an allegation, that they claimed interests in the premises which were subject to the lien of his mortgage. Defendant Dimmick answered; setting up by way of cross-complaint, his title under the execution sale, and asking to have it declared paramount to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage, and to have it quieted. The Court below dismissed this cross-complaint, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and Dimmick appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>George W.

The premises have never exceeded $5,000 in value, and the Court below found as a fact that, in December, 1868, while she was residing on the premises, she made and filed in due form her declaration of homestead thereon. The admission of Dimmick\u2019s counsel, made in order to avoid a continuance of the cause, as to what the defendant Josephine would testify to, if present, places the case, upon this point, in the same attitude as though she had testified at the trial\u2014that, at the time of making and recording the declaration of homestead, she resided on the premises with her child, a boy of about five years, who was supported and maintained by her. The testimony of Street, a witness for Dimmick, to the effect that a short time before the trial he had heard her admit, in a communication with Mrs. Akerson, that she was not, in fact, residing upon the premises at the time she made and filed the declaration of homestead, but that they were then in the possession of a tenant of hers (even if com-' petent to affect the claim of the plaintiff), tended to produce a mere conflict in the evidence upon that point, and the finding will not, under the settled rule, be disturbed by us. Mor is there any doubt that the defendant Josephine was otherwise entitled to select and hold a homestead of the value of $5,000. She was an unmarried person, and had the care and maintenance of her minor child. The fact that she had never been married, and that the child was a bastard child, is of no import upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">An unmarried woman, who has the care of her child, is permitted by the statute to select a homestead not exceeding $5,000 in value. The purpose is to aid her in the proper maintenance of the child as well as herself. Though she has never been married, and her child be a bastard child, the mother and child are neither of them for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>reason without the benefit of the act, nor the less in need of a home it intended to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The judgment and order .denying a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
