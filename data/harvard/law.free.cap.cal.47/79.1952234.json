John Dupuy, executor of Cameto, and Charles Cameto, a minor heir of Cameto, contested the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-17\">At the trial, it appeared that in January, 1864, Martin Cameto and Dupuy jointly purchased the premises described in the petition, and went into possession as partners in the business of blacksmithing, and continued the business until the death of Cameto in 1872. The petitioner was married to Cameto in May, 1864. The house occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Tby them, as a dwelling was the second story of a building in the rear of the blacksmith shop, and beneath it was a store place used by the firm. It appearing that the deceased had other real property than that described in the petition, the petitioner verbally moved that the Court set apart a homestead to her out of such real property, in case the application for the homestead should be denied. The Court refused to set apart the homestead, as asked in the petition, and also denied the verbal application. The petitioner appealed from both orders.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>George W. Tyler </em>and <em>A. A.

The Court, therefore, did not err in refusing to set apart such premises as a homestead. Nor did the Court err in refusing to set apart a homestead to the petitioner from other real estate of the decedent, for no petition was filed therefor, as provided by Sections 1,465 and 1,481, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
