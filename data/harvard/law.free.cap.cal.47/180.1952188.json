The defendant, in his answer, alleged that after the lease was made, he and the plaintiff entered into a co-partnership in keeping the hotel. On the trial, the Court below excluded all evidence on behalf of the defendant of the partnership. The plaintiff recovered judgment, and the defendant appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-11\"><em>Keioen &amp; Howard </em>and <em>Ganahl, </em>for the Appellant.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-12\"><em>Glassed, Chapman &amp; Smith, </em>for the Eespondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-13\">By the Court, Niles, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">The Court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to prove the alleged partnership between the plaintiff and defendant. The evidence, if admitted, would have shown a state of facts almost identical with those presented in the case of <em>Pico </em>v. <em>Cuyas, ante, </em>p. 174, where we held similar evidence admissible in an action to recover the rent claimed to be due upon the lease. It was equally admissible in defense of a summary proceeding for a forfeiture of the lease for non-payment of rent. For this error the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>judgment must be reversed- upon the authority of the case cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Wallace did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
