A.

M. Wilson </em>and <em>W. W. Cope, </em>for the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">The portions of the answer referring to the building used asa jail at, San Leandro, are immaterial. The statements of the petition on the subject are believed to be true, but they were only made for the purpose of showing the reasons acted upon by the Board of Supervisors. It is sufficient that there was no jail at the county seat, and that the Board had full power to provide for the erection of one. (Petition, paragraph 1, 2, 3; 2 Political Code, sec. 4,046, sub. 9.) Indeed, the question of power is the only one to be considered by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-9\">The Board was not required to award the contract to the lowest bidder. The contract was made under a general power conferred upon the Board, without any restriction as to the mode of exercising it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-10\">The objection goes to the discretion of the Board, and not to its power; and it is clear that the action of the Board cannot be questioned in respect to a matter resting in its discretion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-11\">It is alleged in the answer that Hall &amp; Cox put in a bid at forty-one thousand five hundred dollars, and that this bid was withdrawn under an agreement with the relator by which he was to pay them eight hundred dollars. The point of this defense seems to be that the agreement was a fraud upon the county and against public policy,, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>its <em>effect </em>was <em>to invalidate the' </em>contract subsequently made for the erection of the jail. As the relator is only to receive forty-two thousand dollars, the county has not been seriously* injured; and the defense is not interposed in such a form as to entitle it to much consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-6\">\u201cIt does not appear that bids were invited by the Board, nor is there any statement as to the terms of the bid put in by Hall &lt;fe Cox, except its amount. It is not alleged that the relator was a bidder, nor that he obtained the contract in consequence of the withdrawal of the bid by Hall &amp; Cox. There is nothing to show any connection between the contract and the withdrawal of this bid. For aught that appears, the two transactions may have been separate and distinct from each other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">But waiving this objection, the defense is clearly untenable. It is immaterial whether the agreement with Hall &amp; Cox was valid or invalid. The contract for the .erection of the jail is between the relator and the county, and if its validity can be called in question by reason of the agreement, this can only be done at the instance of the county. At most, the contract is only voidable and not void. The county may treat it as a valid contract, and insist upon its performance; and if the relator should fail to perform it, he would be responsible to the county for all the damages resulting from such failure. It will hardly be pretended that the respondent has any power to rescind the contract, or that a judgment in his favor would have that effect. The consequence of such a judgment would be to deprive the relator of any benefit from the contract, without relieving him of its burdens. So gross an injustice would not only be repugnant to common sense, but in violation of established principles of the law of contracts. So long as a contract remains in force, it is equally binding on both parties and must be so treated for all purposes. If any cause exists for rescinding it, and a rescisi\u00f3n is desired by either party, he must restore the other to the same condition he was in before the contract was made. <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>White, </em>13 Cal. 323; <em>Purdy </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>41 Cal. 444; <em>Bohalt v. Diller, </em>41 Cal. 532.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The averment in the answer as to the authority of Case is immaterial. The petition alleges that the contract was made by the Board, and this allegation is not denied. (Pet. par. 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">The point of the averment is that the Board authorized a contract payable in county warrants, without designating the fund for their payment, and that the contract entered into provides for warrants upon the general fund. Admitting this to be so, there was no substantial departure from the authority given. The warrants would have been payable out of the general fund, irrespective of the provision in the contract. All warrants legally drawn are charges upon the treasury, and such as are not payable out of a special fund, must be paid out of the general fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">But in addition to this, the contract has been acted upon and confirmed by the Board. The allowance of the claim presented by the relator was such a recognition of the contract as precludes any question as to its form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">The contract shows that it was intended as the contract of the county and not of the Board. In making it, the Board acted on behalf of the county, and this is sufficient to give character to it as a county obligation. (Pet. Par. 6; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>15 Cal. 456, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\">Ho special tax is necessary to pay for the jail. The power to provide for its erection was given in express terms, and the cost must be paid in the same manner as other indebtedness of the county. The right of the relator to sue the respondent for damages, is no answer to the present applition. <em>(Fremont </em>v. <em>Crippen, </em>10 Cal. 211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Loucks, </em>28 Cal. 68; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Callow, </em>39 Cal. 593.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-10\">The validity of the contract is not affected by the amount of the previous liabilities of the county, nor is it material that there was no money in the treasury to pay the account at the time it was allowed. (2 Pol. C. Sec. 4070, 4148.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-11\">Section 4070, above cited, does not contain any limitation as to the amount of the debts and liabilities which may be created against a county; and in respect to the allowance of accounts, the \u201cdebts.and liabilities\u201d referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to, other than the salaries of officers and the liabilities fixed by law, are evidently such as have been passed upon and allowed by the Board. The object was to prevent accounts from being allowed beyond the revenue for the current year,'and it could not have been intended that the mere existence of debts and liabilities exceeding the amount of such revenue should preclude the allowance of accounts. It is the further allowance which is interdicted, and the plain meaning is that the Board must stop when its allowances equal the revenue. In this view of the provision, a sufficient motive for it may be found in the fact that warrants upon the' treasury bear interest if not paid when presented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">We also think the provision should be treated merely as directory. <em>(Argenti </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>16 Cal. 262.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">The answer is obviously insufficient to present these questions, but we have chosen to notice them for the purpose of showing utter want of any substantial merit in the defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">A contract to pay in warrants, is the same in effect, as a contract to pay in money. The indebtedness of a county can only be paid through the medium of warrants upon the treasury, and if the creditor chooses to accept the warrants in payment, it is certainly competent to make the contract in that form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-9\">The expense incurred is not extraordinary, nor is it necessary to levy a tax for its payment, except as a part of the general indebtedness of the county. In providing for the erection of the jail, the Board acted under a power as full and complete as the Legislature could make it, and the expense must be paid in the same manner as other indebtedness for which no special provision is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-10\">On the whole case, we are unable to perceive any defense in the application. The Board was under no restriction as to the. mode of exercising the power given, and it is clear that the contract in question was a proper mode in which to exercise it. (2 Pol. C. Sec. 4046, sub. 26; <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>14 N. Y. 356).</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-11\">This being so, the claim of the relator was chargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>against the county, and it is not denied that the claim was legally examined, allowed, and ordered paid by the Board. The statute provides that \u201c The Auditor must draw warrants on the County Treasurer in favor of all persons entitled thereto in payment of all claims and demands chargeable against the county, which have been legally examined, allowed, and ordered paid by the Board of Supervisors.\u201d (2 PoL C., Sec. 4215.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">The Auditor has no discretion on the subject. If the claim is of the character specified in the statute, he must draw his warrant as directed. Of course, he may refuse to draw it, if the claim is not chargeable against the county, but this is not the kind of discretion which will prevent the issuing of the writ. The duty imposed is purely ministerial, and if the facts show that its performance has been improperly refused, the writ will issue. <em>(McCauley </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>16 Cal. 11; <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Low, </em>30 Cal. 596; <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>30 How. Pr. 78.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-7\"><em>C. A. Tuttle, </em>for Defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">The writ of mandate lies when there \u201cis not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d (Code of C. P. Sec. 1086.) There is such a remedy at law by action against the Auditor for neglect of official duty. It is a question of damages in money. The refusal of a clerk to issue an execution to collect money would be the same.

San Leandro is the county seat, and if the county buildings are required to be there, no jail was needed. No legal removal is averred. (Political Code, Sec. 3953.) It does not appear that Case is a Supervisor. (Complt. par. 7.) The order did not specify the fund on which the warrant was to be drawn.

Board must advertise that there is a certain amount of money. (Note to Sec. 3234 of Political Code.) This implies that the money must be in the treasury, or must be provided for by a tax. Petition does not aver that there was any money in the treasury, or that any tax had been levied for it.

The case was submitted on demurrer to the petition, and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment upon the pleadings. We think the complaint is sufficiently certain in the particulars to which is addressed, the special demurrer for uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In support of the general demurrer, respondent\u2019s counsel urges that the relator has mistaken his mode of redress; that he has <em>\u201ca </em>plain, speedy and adequate remedy\u201d by action against the Auditor for neglect of official duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The cases of <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Glazier </em>and <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>10 Cal. 333, 40 Cal. 279, are not precisely in point, and we are not disposed to extend the doctrine of those cases. There is no strict analogy between the warrant of the Auditor and an execution on an ordinary money judgment. If the Board of Supervisors has not exceeded its powers, the relator is entitled to the warrant which, it must be presumed, will be paid on presentation, or in due course according to the date of its registration (Pol. Code, 4,076). The drawing of the warrant is an act \u201cspecially enjoined by law.\u201d To supersede the remedy by mandamus, a party must not only have a specific, adequate legal remedy, but one competent to afford relief upon the very subject matter of his application <em>(Fremont </em>v. <em>Crippen, </em>10 Cal. 211). It is clear that an action for damages against the Auditor, for neglect of duty, would not be equally convenient, beneficial and effective as the proceeding by mandate, since it would not compel him to do the specific act which the law requires him to perform. There is no force in the objection that the complaint should show that there was money in the fund. The duty of the Auditor does not depend upon the fact that there is money in the treasury (Sec. 4,076).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Nor. can the point be sustained that the account, as presented to the Board of Supervisors, did not give \u201call the items of the claim,\u201d as required by Section 4,072 of the Political Code. The account refers to the contract and is accompanied by the certificate of the architects, as required by the terms of the contract. The liability, if any, arose upon the certificate of the architects selected by the parties, and we regard the form of the account as a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">-It is urged as an objection, under the general demurrer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that the complaint does not aver thab the \u201c county owns \u201d block <em>22, </em>on which the jail was to be erected. This'is not the proceeding in which to try the title to land, nor is it necessary to decide whether the county authorities have power to build on land in which the county has not the fee. The complaint shows that the relator was placed in possession by the county, and' has partially erected the building on the land described.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The next objection in support of the general demurrer is that the order of the Board allowing the account, did not specify the fund on which the warrant was to be drawn. The statute only requires the Supervisors to examine, settle and allow accounts, and \u201c to order warrants to be drawn on the county treasurer therefor,\u201d etc., while the warrants themselves \u201cmust specify the liabilities for which they are drawn and when they accrued.\u201d (Political Code, 4,046-7.) Sections 4,144 and 4,123 do not impose on the Supervisors the necessity of specifying in each order the fund on which the order is to be drawn. The Auditor is sufficiently informed on what fund to draw, when the order of the Board specifies the liability for which it is to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">It is said by respondent\u2019s counsel, that the contract annexed to and forming part of the complaint, is void, because it does not provide that eight hours shall be a day\u2019s work under it. The Political Code (Sec. 3,245), provides that eight hours\u2019 labor constitutes a legal day\u2019s work in all cases where the same is performed under the authority of any law of the State, and directs: \u201cA stipulation to that effect shall be made part of all contracts to which the State or any municipal corporation therein shall be a party.\u201d It is riot made a consequence of an omission to insert this stipulation that the contract shall be void, and the omission, therefore, does not operate a forfeiture of the rights of the parties under the contract. If a county shall contract directly with the laborer, it will not be contended that the former may refuse to pay the latter his hire, because he had worked too many hours, or had not, by express stipulation, limited the time which should constitute a day\u2019s work. The law was passed for the protection of the laborer; an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of the county cannot refuse to carry out a contract because of an. omission which renders the contract more favorable to the county. Again, it is said that the contract is void, because it is a contract both for labor and materials. The sections of the Political Code cited, seem to apply exclusively to the buildings of the State. (Sections 3233-4.) But if they do not, the Act of April 1st, 1872, which must prevail (Political Code, 4478-9), authorizes a Board of Supervisors to erect a building by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Notwithstanding subdivision 9 of section 4046 of the Political Code, expressly confers the power, it is contended that the Board of Supervisors cannot build a jail, because it has no power to levy a tax for the purpose. We attach little consequence to the circumstance that several Acts of the -Legislature have been passed, authorizing specially a tax for building court-houses and jails. We are discussing a question of mere power, not whether the power may be discreetly exercised, and such special laws may have been passed to relieve the Supervisors of the responsibility of levying a larger tax than that to which the people of a county had been accustomed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In addition to the express power to .erect county buildings the Board has authority \u201c to levy such tax annually on the taxable property of the county as may be necessary to-defray the current expenses thereof, not exceeding $1 for every \u00a7100 of value for any one year, and to levy such taxes as are required to be levied by special or local statutes.\u201d In our view it is not necessary to discuss the question whether the power tb build a jail existing, the power to levy a special tax is \u201c necessary to the full discharge of the duties of the chief executive authority-of the county government.\u201d (Pol. Code, 4046, sub. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Is the expense of building a jail a portion of the current expenses of the year ? We think the expression \u201c current expenses of the year\u201d is equivalent to \u201cthe expenses of the current year.\u201d The adjective can only be made to qualify the latter word, so that, in the absence of any provisions of a statute authorizing special or extraordinary taxation, the Board has power to levy a tax (not exceeding $1 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u00a7100) sufficient to cover any expense they have power to incur as a part of the expenses of the year, or the expenses of the current year. It is claimed, however, that the intention of the Legislature, that a tax should not be levied to cover the erection of public buildings is evidenced by the circumstance that the law specially authorizes the Board to levy a tax for certain other purposes. In section 4046 Political Code, there are twenty-six subdivisions, specifying the powers conferred upon the Board of Supervisors. A careful examination of these satisfies us that the money necessary to carry into effect all of the powers, with certain exceptions, is to be derived from the general tax for \u201ccurrent expenses,\u201d while in the excepted cases the Board is empowered to levy a special tax. Thus the expense of dividing the county into districts; of elections; of providing, in certain cases, rooms for county purposes; of purchasing necessary property, real and personal; of erecting and furnishing public buildings; of adapting to the county the sanitary regulations applicable to Ban Francisco or Sacramento; of providing for the county printing, and furnishing the officers proper books and stationery, and of adopting a county seal, are payable out of the general current expense fund. But, for reasons satisfactory to the law-makers, the power to fix the amount to be raised for laying out roads, etc., was retained by the Legislature, while the Supervisors were authorized to levy a hospital tax not exceeding a certain sum per capita or per centage <em>ad valorem, </em>and were also empowered to levy a special tax to be applied to the destruction of wild animals. This construction gives effect to every portion of the section, and, in connection with other provisions of law, clothes the proper officers of a new county with full power to carry the local government into efficient operation. It would certainly have been a strange omission had the codes, which purport to provide a complete system, failed to furnish the means by which the important power of erecting necessary county buildings can be brought into action. We do not think the. codifiers have neglected to provide for the case. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Our answer to- another objection urged against the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>plaint is, that a contract made with the Supervisors, by which it is stipulated that the other contracting party shall receive his compensation in county warrants, is, in legal effect, a contract that he shall be paid in money. In any event, he can only get warrants which, on presentation to the Treasurer, are to be paid or registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">It is also objected that San Leandro is the county seat. If we take judicial notice that San Leandro was the county seat, we also take notice that it may have been removed to Oakland. The petition avers that it has been legally removed, and the demurrer admits the fact. Even a special demurrer to this portion of the complaint would be overruled. To set out all the acts necessary to a removal would render the pleading very voluminous, without accomplishing any useful end.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Again, it is urged that, on its face, the .contract is not the contract of the Board or of the county. The complaint alleges that the Supervisors, acting for and on behalf of the county, entered into a written contract,' and that \u201csaid contract was signed by Isham Case, Chairman of the said Board, under authority from said Board, and was executed in pursuance of orders and determinations of said Board, in that behalf duly given and made.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. 456.) The same answer applies to the points that the petition does not aver that there was money in the treasury, or that any tax for a jail had been levied, or that debts and liabilities had been created when the account was allowed, which, added to the salaries of the officers, etc. equaled the aggregate revenue. The complaint alleges that the orders allowing the account, and directing the Auditor to draw his warrant for the same, \u201cwere duly given and made.\u201d This was the only averment necessary as to the jurisdiction of the Board. The demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The last objection considered above is also taken, perhaps, by special answer. The answer alleges: \u201cBefore the contract mentioned in the complaint was entered into, the county of Alameda had already incurred liabilities for its current expenses, etc. which equaled all its revenues,\u201d etc. The statute (Pol. Code, 4070) reads: \u201cThe Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>must not for any purpose contract debts or liabilities, except in pursuance of law, or under ordinances of their own, adopted in accordance with the powers herein conferred; and whenever debts and liabilities have been created, which, added to the salaries of county officers and other estimated liabilities fixed by law for the remainder of the year, equal in the aggregate the revenue of the county for current expenses, no further allowance of any accounts must be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Passing the questions suggested by differences in the language employed in the statute and in the answer, we remark : The word revenue, as used in the section recited, cannot mean the actual money which shall be received in the county treasury. To give the word this interpretation would render it impossible for the Board to comply with the direction of the statute, since the amount can never be ascertained until all the assessments have been collected and paid into the treasury. In view of the context, it is no forced interpretation to say that it is the estimated revenue which the lawmakers had in contemplation. Subdivision 13, of section 4046, only requires that the Supervisors shall levy such tax as may be necessary, not exceeding one dollar on every hundred. They are not commanded or directed to make a record of their estimate of what the levy will probably produce. In performing the duty of levying the tax, all of the Supervisors should use their best judgment in estimating what sum it will be necessary and proper to collect, and may (and it is believed ordinarily do) make an allowance for delinquencies in the collection. But this is a moral obligation, addressed to the consciences of the individual members, and the statute itself does not make the estimate, made ivhen the tax was levied, in any sense conclusive upon the Board. The opinion of the members on that subject may vary as the year progresses, and as the payments are made with greater or less promptness. It is their estimate of the revenue at the time an account is presented for allowance which must control the action of the Board in allowing or refusing to allow it. Thus the Supervisors are clothed with a discretion <em>quasi </em>judicial, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>like all discretion, may be abused. But in the absence of charges of fraud, the Courts will not review their action, upon the ground that they were mistaken in a particular instance. Certainly the Auditor, whose duty is to draw warrants, when ordered to do so by the Supervisors (except where the latter have exceeded their powers), cannot assume to set up his judgment against theirs in respect to a matter which the law leaves to their wise and honest discretion. It is not necessary to decide that there can be no debts or liabilities against a county, in the sense of the section quoted, except such as have been allowed by the Board of Supervisors. But it is plain that the Board is the real auditing power under the statute, and not the officer who bears that name. The Board must determine what claims constitute debts and liabilities. And the Auditor, whose duties, as we have seen, are merely ministerial, cannot impose upon this Court, in an action entirely unfitted for such inquiry, the task of trying disputed questions of fact between the county and third persons, who are not parties to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The charge contained in the answer, that the relator paid Hall <em>&amp; </em>Cox to withdraw their bid, does not constitute a defense to this writ. The respondent is not the general representative of the county, and can refuse to draw the warrant only in case the Board has exceeded its jurisdiction. If a fraud has been practiced on the county by the relator, or by the relator and another, the county, perhaps, may claim the contract to be invalid. But the respondent cannot refuse to perform a ministerial act because he suspects or believes he can prove facts, the evidence of which rests <em>in pais, </em>and must be produced in a direct action in which the question is properly involved, to enable a Court to declare the contract void or voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The remaining averments in the answer simply raise issues of law, which have already been sufficiently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Let the writ issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
