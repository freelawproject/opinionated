The motion was denied February 4th, 1874, and he appealed from the order denying it. He then moved that the trial of the action be postponed until the appeal should be determined by the Supreme Court. The Court refused to grant that motion also, and set the cause for trial on the twenty-third of February,' 1874. Thereupon he made this application to the Supreme Court for a writ, to prohibit the District Court from proceeding with the trial during the pendency of the appeal, on the ground that such trial would be without and in excess of the jurisdiction of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-12\"><em>James L.

It might amount to an error for which the judgment would be reversed here, as was done in <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>McCahill, supra, </em>if that ease is to be followed upon that point (a question which we will not now consider), but no case called to our attention would characterize the action of the Court below, in trying the cause under such circumstances, as an excess of jurisdiction in the absolute sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The application for the writ of prohibition is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
