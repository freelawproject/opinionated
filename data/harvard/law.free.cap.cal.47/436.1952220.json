Both patents were issued prior to July 23d, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-13\">The case was tried by a jury, and the only question being as to the character of the land at the date of the passage of the Act granting the swamp and overflowed lands to the State (September 28th, 1850), the Court, against the objection of defendant, gave the instruction quoted in the opinion. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment was rendered accordingly. The defendant, appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-14\"><em>W. C. Belcher, W. W. Pendegast </em>and <em>S. G. Harper, </em>for Appellants, argued that the cultivation might be successful and yet not profitable, by reason of low prices, highways, or want of demand for crops raised, and cited, <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>33 Cal. 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Jo Hamilton </em>and <em>C. P. Sprague, </em>for Respondents, argued that the word \u201c profitably,\u201d as used in the instruction, was equivalent to \u201c successfully.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-6\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Court instructed the jury to the effect, that though the land, at the date of the grant, September 28th, 1850, was or may have been periodically or even annually overflowed, still, if after the subsidence of the waters \u201c it could have been profitably cultivated each year, or for the majority of a series of years, \u201d in any of the staple crops, it was not swamp and overflowed land within the meaning of the Act of Congress. In giving this instruction, the Court, in our opinion, erred. The test by which it may be determined whether land is \u201cswamp and overflowed \u201d land is, not whether it may profitably be cultivated, for the qualities and conditions of the soil may be such that its cultivation would be unprofitable, though the land was in no sense swamp and overflowed land. The word \u201csuccessfully,\u201d in the instruction which was approved in <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>33 Cal. 546, is not the synonym Of \u201c profitably,\u201d as employed in the instruction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
