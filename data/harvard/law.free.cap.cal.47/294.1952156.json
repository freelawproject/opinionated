Hopkins, who testified that he had been for fifteen years, and still was, the official keeper of the Mexican archives in California, in the office of the Surveyor-General of California, and that, as such, he knew the signature of said Francisco De Haro, from having consulted official documents from said De Haro as a Mexico-California official; that the archives in his charge contained several hundred, official documents and signatures of said De Haro; that his correspondence, as an official, had been, as shown by said archives, quite voluminous, and had been carried on with numerous officials of the Mexican Government, and that the correspondence to and from him, and numerous official documents from said De Haro, were contained in and preserved in said archives, by the United State Government, as the genuine documents of said De Haro; and that ever since his connection with the archives, the witness had been familiar with the handwriting and signature of said De Haro; and, also, that he had examined said Blotter B, and had seen and recognized the handwriting of said De Haro therein contained; and that from his knowledge of the. handwriting and signature of said De Haro, so derived from his familiarity with the said Mexican archives, and the documents therein contained, he could tell, and was acquainted with the handwriting and signature of said De Haro.

D. 1843, by Francisco Sanchez to Francisco Guerrero, and that the same was transferred by said Guerrero, in writing, on the fourth day of August, A. n. 1844, to Bobert T. Bidley; and was, on the third day of February, A. d. 1847, transferred by said Bidley to John 0. Davis, John Bose and William J.

Said lot No. 4 stood upon the shore of the said lagoon, and extended \"partly into its waters; and no proof was offered tending to show any claim of said De Haro to, or upon .said lot No. 4, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>lie had, at any time, any connection with lot No. 4; but proof was given, showing that said De Haro never had granted to him, nor had he any title to, or claim upon, any other lot in Yerba Buena, than said lot No. 31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"293\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">The plaintiff insisted and urged to the jury that the word \u201c plaza,\u201d appearing in the said petition to Hinckley, as Alcalde, by Francisco De Haro, being dated March 1st, 1844, was originally written \u201cplaya\u201d (beach), and afterward altered to \u201cplaza,\u201dand that such alteration was perceptible to them by their own ocular inspection, without the aid of experts; but no note of any alteration appeared upon said last mentioned concession, or upon the said petition made therefor, or upon any paper connected therewith, or in evidence in any manner; and no experts were offered upon the same; but the Court permitted the jury to inspect and examine the petition, and to judge for themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"294\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiff asked the Court to give the following instructions to the jury, which the Court declined to give:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"295\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">9. \u201cThat the jury may determine for themselves whether the disputed word in the alleged petition of De Haro to Alcalde Hinckley, in the year 1844, was originally written playa or plaza.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-9\">11. \u201cThat entries of the names of persons upon the lots on the maps produced in evidence are not conclusive evidence of ownership, and are of no effect whatsoever as evidence of ownership, if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the officers placing them there were deceived or mistaken as to the fact of ownership, or that they were placed on such maps by persons other than the official custodians thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">24. \u201c If the jury find that \u2018 Blotter B,\u2019 from the Recorder\u2019s office, constituting what is called a \u2018Book of Possessions of Lots in Yerba Buena,\u2019 or San Francisco, including the year 1844, shows that the Alcalde of that year, William Hinckley, made an entry of fourteen lots only, as granted by him in - that year; and there being no record evidence offered showing that he made any other than the fourteen grants therein named and numbered, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>neither of said fourteen grants is the one in controversy; and that the said Hinckley was not Alcalde in any other year than the said year of 1844, the presumption is that he did not legally make any other grants than the fourteen named, and that he did not, during his official existence as Alcalde, legally make the grant bearing date March 3, 1844.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"298\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">The defendant recovered judgment, and the plaintiff appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion. A reference to the briefs of counsel will be necessary to get a clear explanation of the reasons for admitting and rejecting testimony.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"299\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>John W. Dwinelle </em>and <em>W. W. Chipman, </em>for the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"300\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">The defendant having given in evidence the alleged petition by De Haro, in 1844, in which the disputed word playa or plaza occurred, then offered in evidence a copy of said petition, certified by Guillermo Hinckley.</p>\n<p data-order=\"301\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">This was accompanied with evidence tending to show the genuineness of Hinckley\u2019s handwriting, and was offered \u201cfor the purpose of showing that the same-was in existence during the life-time of the said Hinckley.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"302\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-10\">This was admitted and excepted to. This was error. This does not purport to be an official certificate, nor does it appear, nor is there any presumption that Hinckley was then in office, the election of Alcalde being annual. So that if he were in office March 1st, 1844, it is to be presumed that his term had expired before April 1st, 1845. But even if he had been in office, he had no power to give such a certificate. It was extra official. (<em>Williams </em>v. <em>Merle, </em>11 Wend. 80, 82; <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>1 Overton, 221; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>2 Wash. C. C.

H. 390.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"303\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-11\">The receiving of this paper in evidence was therefore error. It was in fact saying to the jury: \u201cYou may believe that the word was originally written plaza, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Hinckley, who died in 1848, made a copy during his lifetime, in which it appeared as plaza.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"304\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">The Court erred in receiving the books of John C. Davis &amp; Co., in order to show that a blacksmith shop was built on the lot in question for Finch, who was in possession. (1 Greenleaf on Ev. secs. 116 and 123; <em>Higham </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>10 East. 109.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"305\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">The admissibility of books of account cannot be justified beyond the rule laid down in <em>Price </em>v. <em>The Earl of Torrington; </em>1 Smith Lead. Cases, 390 (*139).</p>\n<p data-order=\"306\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">These cases our analysis resolves into two classes: First. Those which are made in discharge of an official, or <em>quasi </em>official duty. Secondly, Those which are made in the course of a party\u2019s own business, or by the agent of one or both parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"307\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">The gradual enlargement of the rule may be seen by comparing the case of <em>Gleadow </em>v. <em>Atkin, </em>1 Crompt. &amp; Meeson, 410, with the cases preceding it in point of time. The cases in this country have not got beyond <em>Augusta </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>1 Appleton, 19 Maine, 317. In this case it is left in doubt whether the decision is put upon the ground first stated, that the breaking of the limb and the services of the physician having been proved, it would be reasonable to expect that the time of performing them would appear from his books (Id. 321); or upon the principle cited from <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 Wheat. 337, that memoranda made by a person in the ordinary course of his business of acts or matters, which his duty in such business requires him to do for others, in case of his death are admissible evidence of the acts or matters so done. (Id. 321.) Either this <em>quasi </em>official duty of a surgeon to go when called, or the other point that the service performed was proved <em>aliunde, </em>affords a solution of the case of <em>Higham </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>10 East. 109, <em>ut supra, </em>which has given so much trouble to courts and commentators. The case of 8 Wheat. 337, cited by the Court in <em>Augusta </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>puts the decision upon this point of official or <em>quasi </em>official duty. But neither of them touch the present case. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>29 Maine, 117, does not go beyond the principle of ordinary agency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"308\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The Court erred in admitting other entries from the account books of John C. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co., to be read in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"309\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">Rye, a witness for plaintiff, had testified that Daniel Sill, senior, had, as a blacksmith, done some work for him in his shop on the.lot in question, in 1843, namely; some bolts and spikes. That the ship Fama was one of witness\u2019s ships, which he sailed into the port of San Francisco. Also that he was not in San Francisco in March, 1844, or January, 1845.</p>\n<p data-order=\"310\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">To contradict this testimony of Rye, the defendants were permitted to read to the jury, under objection and exception of the plaintiff, certain entries from these same books of John C. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co. against \u201c Capt. Rye, Fama,\u201d extending from October 3d to December 9th, 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"311\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">Such entries being admitted on the ground of agency (not of official or semi-official duty), were never received against third persons. (Cow. &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes to Phil. Ev., Part I, Vol. III, 3d Ed. p. 314, under note 201.) The book charges offered must be \u201cbook charges in account with the identical party against whom they are offered in evidence.\u201d <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Old, </em>5 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 404.) \u201cA book kept by a forgemaster for the purpose of settling with his workmen, in which are entered their names, the quantity of iron delivered, the date, and sometimes the price, is not such a book of original entries as is evidence against a purchaser of the iron, though it contains also the names of purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"312\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-9\"><em>Juniata Bank </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 226: \u201cIn a suit between A and B, the original entries of C are not evidence to show a collateral fact, as that A was charged by C as a partner in a certain house.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"313\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">The Court erred in admitting entries from Rathan Spear\u2019s books to be read in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"314\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-11\">The plaintiff had introduced testimony tending to show that Sill, senior, John Finch, and one Francis Westgate were seen working together in a blacksmith\u2019s shop on the lot in question, in 1843 and 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"315\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-12\">To rebut this, the defendants produced on the witness-stand, W. H. Davis, who testified that he was clerk of Ra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>than Spear, deceased, formerly a merchant in Yerba Buena; that he, Davis, kept Spear\u2019s book of accounts, which he produced, and had made the entries therein contained, which were correct; that Westgate, Finch, Sill, and John C. Davis had worked together on Davis\u2019 lot 18, below the lot in question; that Westgate had left San Francisco in 1841, and never returned; that is, had never returned to witness\u2019 knowledge, which, of course, was all he could know about that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"316\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-6\">Defendant then read in evidence certain entries from Spear\u2019s 'books, in order to show that Westgate, Finch, and Sill had been in partnership in the blacksmith business sometime anterior to 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"317\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-7\">This was error. (Cowan <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2019s Notes to Philips\u2019 Ev., vol. 1, note 275; vol. 2, note 377.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"318\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-8\">The testimony of Hopkins, the keeper of the archives, who, after a comparison of the handwriting of Francisco De Haro in the archives with that to the document of March 3, 1844 (his signatures to petition and transfer), purporting to have been made by him, was asked whether he considered the grant to be genuine, should certainly have been excluded. The authorities are many upon this point. A few maybe cited: 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., Secs. 576-7-8; Starkie\u2019s Ev., Part IV, marg. p. 657; <em>Strother </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>6 Peters, 763; <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>U. </em>S., 22 How. 456.</p>\n<p data-order=\"319\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-9\">In <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>52 Maine, p. 15, the Court says: \u201cAs we have clearly seen, no witness, except an expert, is competent to give an opinion simply by comparison of hands by juxtaposition, and this is done- by the production of the standard in open Court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"320\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-10\">How much less, then, we urge, can an expert, after a comparison outside of the Court, and perhaps under the instruction and pay of the adversary, be permitted to give his opinion as to signatures the genuineness of which are controverted, forming his opinions on signatures not admitted or proved in this case. (8 Vesey, 438, 474; <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 490.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"321\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-11\">Disputed writings cannot be used for comparison of handwriting.

Among undisputed writings, ancient writings may be used for comparison of handwriting; but writings are not ancient when there are living witnesses who have seen the party write. <em>(Rowt's Administrator </em>v. <em>Kile's Administrator, </em>1 Leigh, 222; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>8 Wend. 426; S. C., 15 Wend. 111.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"322\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">The Court erred in receiving \u201cBook A of Original Grants\u201d in evidence. The plaintiff\u2019s source of title, the grant from Sanchez to Be Haro, appearing in Blotter B of Original Concessions, where it ought to appear, and the alleged grant from Hinckley to De Haro not appearing at all in Blotter B, the defendants produced \u201c Book A of Original Grants,\u201d in which Alcalde Bartlett entered copies of such alleged grants as were brought to him for that purpose, in order to show that there were original Alcalde grants, which did not appear in Blotter B.</p>\n<p data-order=\"323\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-7\">This was error. These books would doubtless have been <em>prima facie </em>evidence in an action brought upon one of these alleged grants, upon a direct issue as to its genuineness, the loss of the original being first shown. <em>(Touchard </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>21 Cal. 202; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>26 Cal. 45.) But when the issue is upon the genuineness of another alleged grant, the genuineness of these alleged grants are altogether too collateral and remote from the main issue to be brought into the controversy. Still more if the controversy is about originals, the originals should be produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"324\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-8\">The Court erred in admitting in evidence the memorandum kept by Alcalde Bartlett. This does not come within the case of <em>Kyburg </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>6 Cal. 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"325\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-9\">As to plaintiff\u2019s negligence in sleeping on his rights, there was evidence tending to show that Sill, Senior, lost his title papers at least as early as 1847; plaintiff offered to show that when Sill, Senior, returned in 1850 to California (from his trip home in 1840), he made application to an officer in the U. S. army (Capt. Folsom) for advice and aid in getting possession of the lot in controversy as his lot; and which efforts of Sill to procure his lot, we propose to follow up from that date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"326\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>This was offered to rebut the apparent neglect and long acquiescence of Sill, Senior, in that he allowed defendants to remain in possession, as they proved by their witnesses in defense, for so many years, to wit: From 1847 down to the commencement of this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"327\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">Now it nowhere appeared (but on the contrary) that Sill had ever been able to find these lost papers, without which, or a record or copy of them (neither of which had appeared until after his death), the maintaining of an action would have been impossible, and to have commenced it, an idle ceremony, resulting in nonsuit and costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"328\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">The testimony as to plaintiff\u2019s ancestor\u2019s negligence in sleeping on his rights was either relevant or it was irrelevant. If relevant, then the plaintiff had a right to reply to it, by showing why, and under what advice or influences plaintiff\u2019s ancestor had delayed the assertion of his rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"329\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">The Court erred in refusing plaintiff\u2019s ninth instruction. It was very material for the jury to decide whether the word was originally written playa or plaza; for if they found it was originally written playa (beach), they might also find that that portion of the beach was far remote from the north-west corner of Washington and Kearny streets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"330\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-9\">It is too well settled for further discussion, that it is the province of a jury to find whether or not a written instrument has been altered or not, as it is for the Court to determine the effect of the alteration. And this effect is, that the paper will be read as it originally stood, if that can be ascertained by the jury. <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>6 Watt. 266; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>1 How.

John 0. Davis was the bookkeeper; all the entries were in his handwriting. He died in 1848. Thus it was demonstrated that these books could not be fabricated for this trial, but had been kept by a man who, when this suit was commenced, had been sixteen years in his grave. It would be curious if, in the reason and philosophy of the rules of evidence, any objection to such ancient and written memorials of current events, made in the due course of - business and without a motive to deceive, could be found. In the ordinary affairs of life it would be conclusive with us. Upon the most important matters of our welfare we would accept it without doubt. We are happy to be able to say, that the practical and sensible rules of evidence according to the common law, make it also competent in courts of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"336\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">The objections by plaintiff\u2019s counsel are substantially: 1st, That the entries were not in the handwriting of any living witness in attendance on the trial; 2d, That they were inadmissible [for what reason, not stated]; 3d, That the entries are not against the interest of the party making them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"337\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>As we understand the rule, the fact that the witness who made the entries is long since dead is one of the reasons that make such entries admissible, though in many cases that is not now considered indispensable; and that the entries must be against the interest of the party making them is long since exploded. The general objection of inadmissibility is not a sufficient objection. The exact point of the objection should be stated. <em>(Owen </em>v. <em>Frink et </em>al., 24 Cal.

So as to baptism and marriage; the entries by the clergyman in his parish register being competent, though no law requires it to be kept; the proposition acted upon in an enlightened and practical system of jurisprudence being, that entries made by a person in the due course of business, at the time the occurrences happened, are probably true, there being nothing to attach suspicion to the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"344\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">The defendant\u2019s testimony showed that there was no blacksmith shop or other improvement on lot 31 till John C. Davis &amp; Co. built it for Finch in the fall of 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"345\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">In connection with the foregoing facts, and to correct Capt. Nye\u2019s recollection, or, more accurately speaking, to show how mistaken he was, the books of John C. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co. were introduced to prove that the very work Nye referred to was done at the shop of John C. Davis, in October, November, and December, 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"346\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-8\">These books showed that Capt. Nye, with his ship \u201c Fama,\u201d was in this port, and that, on the 3d of October, 1844, the 22d of November, 1844, December 2d, 1844, and December 9th, 1844', the blacksmiths and shipwrights, on the adjoining lot No. 18, had done a series of work, and furnished, among other things, the bolts and spikes referred to, for the ship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"347\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-9\">Capt. Nye had sworn he was not here from March 2d, 1844, to January 1st, 1845, but \u201c was down the coast.\u201d This evidence was like the check-rolls in <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>The Ithaca and Owego R. R. Co., </em>16 Wend. 597-8, and like the entries of the surgeons in the cases above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"348\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-10\">The authorities cited by the learned counsel in their brief, in this connection, were cases where persons were offering in evidence books as books of account between the parties, on the general rule as to merchants\u2019 books. They do not impugn the cases we have above so fully commented upon. Cowen &amp; Hill, in their Notes, entirely sustain our views, and put the case upon the doctrine of Lord Toning-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ton\u2019s case, and the \u201cobvious principle, not only as letting in all books of account kept by a deceased clerk, but all other entries or memoranda made in the course of business or duty, by any one who would at the time have been a competent witness to the facts which he registers.\u201d (See 3 Phil, on Ev., Part I, Cowen <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2019s Notes, p. 292, <em>et seq. </em>(3d ed.), note 200 to p. 317, and the large number of cases there collected.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"349\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">As part of the testimony introduced by the plaintiff, tending to show the possession of said lot 31, was certain parol testimony, to the effect that Finch and one Westgate, were seen working together in a blacksmith\u2019s shop, which the witnesses, testifying in that regard, thought was on lot 31 in the years 1843 and 1844.</p>\n<p data-order=\"350\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-7\">If the defendants could prove that these three persons had once been in partnership in blacksmithing, but that it was several years prior to 1843, and that Westgate had left the country prior to 1843, it would seem that such evidence would show very satisfactorily that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence above cited was incorrect, as to time and locality. It will be remembered that there is no pretence to any grant of this lot before 1843, and that there is, consequently, no pretence of any possession before that year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"351\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-8\">On turning to the account book of Nathan Spear, a very respectable merchant in Yerba Buena, we find under date of October 25th, 1839, that Sill, Finch and Westgate at that date were jointly engaged in blacksmithing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"352\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-9\">John Finch is credited by one third \u201cblacksmith concern;\u201d Daniel Sill is credited by a like one third, and Francis Westgate is credited with his share, and John Davis <em>&amp; </em>Go. are charged in the same connection. Here then, as early as October 25th, 1839, is the most satisfactory evidence that these three persons, having joint interests in a \u201cblacksmith concern,\u201d had transferred their several interests to Nathan Spear at that date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"353\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-10\">There is nothing in the proposition of appellant\u2019s counsel, that as the witness, Wm. H. Davis, was on the stand, and he made the entries, the entries themselves are inadmissible. The entries themselves are not only corroborative, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>original, independent evidence. (1 Green Ev. Sec. 116; <em>Digby </em>v. <em>Stedman, </em>1 Esp. 328.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"354\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\">The fact of the three parties, Finch, Westgate, and Sill, being engaged in blacksmithing together, was proven on both sides. The great question was when it was. The books established that, and with that the place where was clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"355\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">When the defendants came to put in their evidence, they called Mr. Hopkins, the keeper of the Mexican Archives in the Surveyor-General's office, the very papers through which Mr. Li\u00e9s became qualified to testify. If Mr Lies was so qualified, Mr. Hopkins was tenfold better qualified. His testimony shows an extraordinary opportunity of becoming familiar with De Haro\u2019s handwriting. Here were the signatures of De Haro in an official capacity to \u201c several hundred official documents,\u201d kept under circumstances demonstrating their genuineness. For fifteen years Mr. Hopkins had been among them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"356\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-8\">He also had examined, and was familiar with Blotter B, about which Li\u00e9s had testified, and in which De Haro\u2019s handwriting existed. This Blotter B was already in evidence, with the proof by plaintiff that all the entries for the year 1843 were in the handwriting of De Haro. On both these sources of information Mr. Hopkins testified, and gave his opinion as to De Haro\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"357\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-9\">This is clearly not a comparison of handwriting, but is an opinion given by Mr. Hopkins from an exemplar in his own mind existing for many years. The objection to a comparison is mainly that the specimens may be unfairly selected, and calculated to serve the purpose of the parties producing them; and, therefore, not exhibiting a fair example of the general character of the handwriting. (See <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>1 Holt, N. P. Cases, 420.) Here no such danger could exist. The correspondence consisted of several hundred documents of an official nature, preserved by two Governments as genuine. The test of genuineness was perfect. The opinion of Mr. Hopkins was derived from the general character of the mass of writings, running over a space of fifteen years. How much better is this than to have seen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>party write once, or to have- written him a letter and got back a letter in reply? Yet these facts qualify a witness to give an opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"358\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">Gould not the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington acquire a sufficient knowledge of the handwriting of his predecessors, by years of examination in his office, officially? Could not the Hon. Joseph S. Wilson testify as to the handwriting of his predecessor, Hon. Thos. A. Hendricks, whose official signature he has a thousand times had to see and pass on in the Commissioner\u2019s office ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"359\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">This view is fully sustained by two cases in South Carolina, which are more nearly parallel to the case at bar than any other cases found. (See <em>Turnipseed </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>1 McCord, 279; <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Bean, 2 </em>Nott <em>&amp; </em>McC., 406.) \u201cAll evidence of handwriting, except where the witness saw the document written, is in its nature comparison. It is the belief which the Avitness entertains, upon comparing the writing in question with its exemplar in his mind, derived from some previous knowledge.\u201d (1 Greenl. Ev. p. 711, Sec. 576.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"360\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-8\">In England, a deed thirty years old goes in evidence without proof of execution. In this case the paper transfer Avas over tAventy-four years old. And here, that should admit it in evidence, being a greater time, considered in reference to our Statute of Limitations, and other laws in regard to time, than thirty years in England. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Covillaud, </em>10 Cal. 330-1; <em>Grattan </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>23 id. 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"361\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-9\">But independently of this, Mr. Hopkins had seen and examined Blotter B, which Avas already in evidence and admitted to be genuine by plaintiff. Here is the very case mentioned in the authorities where an expert may testify. (1 Greenl. Ev. p. 713, sec. 578; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>7 B. Mon. 269, 270; <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Person, </em>19 Ohio, 426; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>6 Whar. 284, 291; <em>Dupue </em>v. <em>Place, </em>7 Barr. 428; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>1 McMullan, 120, 125; <em>Admrs. of Rogers </em>v. <em>Shaler, </em>Anthony N.

The object of introducing Book A was to show this theory' untrue in fact. The plaintiff put in a large part or all of Blotter B. Defendants put in a good deal of Book A of original grants. The book itself has been frequently held official and received in evidence. <em>(Riee\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>29 Cal. 493; <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Palmer et al. </em>31 id. 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"363\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">This book was proved to be an official book, as well for the entry of grants newly made, as for registering and recording grants previously made. It is now an official record in the office of the County Recorder. Copies from this are now of the same effect as copies from the books of record since the Recording Act. (See <em>Garwood </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>38 Cal.

Defendants gave in evidence the original petition of De Haro, on which the concession last mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was made, the original of the grant by Hinckley, and the original instrument executed by De Haro\u2014and indorsed on the grant\u2014which transferred to George Davis the title, if any, thus acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">These writings were upon one sheet of paper and on the back thereof was mitten a duplicate original of the bill of sale about to be mentioned. To the introduction of these original documents no objection was made by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The defendants having introduced evidence tending to prove that one John Finch had derived title from George Davis, offered an instrument, executed by Finch, which is spoken of in the record as a bill of sale. .This instrument was indorsed on a copy of the De Haro petition, the Hinckley grant, and the transfer from De Hnro to Davis. The offer was accompanied by testimony tending to show that the copy, and the bill of sale, with the-exception of Finch\u2019s signature, were in the handwriting of Hinckley. To the introduction of the copy, and of the duplicate bill of sale indorsed, the plaintiff objected. The action of the Court below, in overruling this objection, is assigned as error. The bill of sale contains no description of the premises, except that in the copy of the petition. It recites: \u201cI, the undersigned, being the legal owner of the lot mentioned in this concession,\u201d etc., and proceeds to declare, \u201cI have sold to John Thompson one half,\u201d etc. The preceding copy of the papers referred to, the original of which constituted the evidence of a \u201ctitle by concession\u201d to a particular lot, was therefore necessary to identify the land sold by Finch to Thompson; it became a part of the instrument executed by the former, and rendered that instrument effectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The defendants claimed under Thompson, and were entitled to show that the bill of sale was delivered to him when it was executed. This was proven <em>prima facie, </em>when the defendants produced it at the trial; but the like consequence did not follow from the production of the original papers. At the time of these transactions no registry law was in operation, and it was necessary and proper for each individual proprietor to keep within his own control, all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>muniments of title. We must presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the parties adopted the natural and reasonable course accordant with the existing law; that Finch retained the originals as evidence of his own right, and delivered the copies (forming a portion of the bill of sale) to Thompson, to whom he sold one half the property; and that Thompson, who afterwards claimed the \u2022whole lot as survivor of Finch under an agreement contemporaneous with the bill of sale, became possessed of the original petition and grant after the death of Finch. The bill of sale, including the copy, therefore, was not immaterial or incompetent as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The bill of sale is dated April 26th, 1845; Hinckley died in 1846. The defendants proved that the copy of the grant and bill of sale attached were in the handwriting of Hinckley; and, when they were offered in evidence, declared that they were offered as evidence tending to establish the existence of the originals during the life-time of Hinckley. We are not prepared to say that counsel is bound by the declaration of a limited purpose, so as to be estopped, after the introduction of evidence, from drawing from it other deductions than that suggested by the terms of the offer. Certainly he should not be, unless injustice has been done to the opposite party by permitting such new inferences; and this cannot be made out by mere assumption or conjecture, unsupported by any fact appearing in the record. Indeed, counsel has no power to limit the effect of evidence; it would hardly be contended that the opposite party cannot use it in any legitimate manner before the jury. The-statement of a \u201cpurpose\u201d is only a reason, addressed to the Court, why the particular evidence should be admitted; the effect of the evidence is to be limited, in proper cases, in the charge to the jury. Besides, the making of the copies and the introduction of them into the bill of sale by Hinckley, when he was called on to prepare that instrument, was in the nature of a contemporaneous act; and the admission of the proof of that act may be vindicated by' similar reasoning to that hereinafter employed with respect to the account-book tendered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The next error assigned is the refusal of the District Court to strike out the answer of the witness Eose, to the question found at folio 212 of the transcript. The answer was responsive to the question, and counsel did not specify the points on which they rested the motion. In such cases the moving party should specify his.objecfcion to the answer, with the like particularity as is required in pointing out an objection to a question. The same reasons render this proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Evidence having been given on the part of the plaintiff, that Finch, while in possession of the disputed premises, declared that he was possessed only as the agent of Sill, senior; the defendants, by way of rebuttal, endeavored to prove that Finch erected upon the premises a building of great value as compared with the then value of the lot. To do this, defendants offered in evidence, among other things, the books of John C. Davis &amp; Co., containing an account against Finch, which was in the handwriting of John C. Davis, who died in 1848. This was accompanied by testimony tending to show that the articles charged went into the building on the lot occupied by Finch, and that ifc was agreed between Finch, John 0. Davis &amp; Co., and Davis, that the articles should be supplied to Finch by John C. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co., and should be paid for by transfer to the firm of an existing demand in favor of Finch against Davis. The plaintiff objected to the entries in the books on the ground that the evidence offered was hearsay and incompetent. The Court overruled the objection, and this is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The gist of the argument against the admissibility of the entries in the books seems to be that they were not against, but for the interest of the party who made them. This does not render them necessarily incompetent. The account was a corroborative circumstance; one of. a series of facts tending to prove that the building was erected by Finch at his own expense. From the transcript it appears that other evidence was given to the point that Davis <em>&amp; </em>Co. did, in the year 1844, provide the materials and build and furnish for Finch a blacksmith shop, etc., on the lot in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>controversy. There are two kinds of admissible entries made by third parties; one consisting of entries against the party\u2019s interest, deriving their admissibility from this circumstance alone. The value of the second class is that it was contemporaneous with the principal fact, forming a link in the chain of events, and being part of the <em>res gestee. </em>It is not merely the declaration of the party, but it is a verbal contemporaneous act,' belonging, not necessarily, indeed, but ordinarily and naturally, to the principal thing. (1 Green. Ev. Sec. 120.) This distinction was taken and clearly expounded by Mr. Justice Parke, in <em>Doe d. Pattershall </em>v. <em>Turford, </em>3 B. &amp; Ad. 890. That learned Judge said: \u201c Counsel for defendant has contended that such an entry is to be received in two classes of cases only-\u2014first, when it is against the interest of a deceased party who made it; and secondly, when it is one of a chain or combination of facts, and the proof of one raises the presumption that another has taken place. I agree in the rule as laid down, but I think that in the second case a necessary and invariable connection of facts is not required. It is enough if one fact is ordinarily and usually connected with another.\u201d The views of Mr. Justice Parke, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Turford, </em>have been cited and approved in many English and American cases; and, upon principle, the distinction there taken should be maintained. In the present ease, evidence having been alreadyintroduced tending to establish the fact that the house was built and the materials furnished by John C. Davis <em>&amp; </em>Go., the contemporaneous charges in their books constitute evidence of some force. It was certainly the \u201c ordinary and natural,\u201d or usual course, for that firm to charge the materials to the person to whom they are alleged to have been furnished. There was no error in admitting the account; and we think the principle just considered also justified the admission of the charges against Gorham H. Nye, as well as those contained in the books of Nathan Spear.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">At the trial below, one B. 0. Hopkins was called as a witness on behalf of the defendants, who (having testified that, for fifteen years, he had been the custodian of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Mexican archives in California, in the office of the Surveyor-General; and further testified as to his familiarity with the documents composing such archives, and particularly with the signature of Francisco Be Haro, from having consulted several hundred official documents therein, with the signature- of said Be Haro thereto as a Mexico-California official, etc.) was asked: Whether, in his judgment and opinion, he considered the said signature of Be Haro to said petition and grant to be genuine ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The question presented by the foregoing is not what writings may properly be employed by an expert, on the witness stand, as the basis of his opinion that a particular writing is or is not genuine. In all such cases, the opinion of the witness is based upon a comparison\u2014within the narrower meaning of the word\u2014of the contested signature with others proven or admitted to be genuine, and introduced in evidence. But if a witness have a proper knowledge of the handwriting of the person' whose writing is in dispute, he may declare his belief in regard to the genuineness of the particular signature in question. In a broad sense, all evidence of handwriting, except where the witness saw the document written, is comparison. But a distinction is recognized between an opinion based upon the juxtaposition, in the presence of the jury, of the disputed and other signatures, and a belief engendered of the witnesses\u2019 previous knowledge of the party\u2019s handwriting; the conscious comparison of the writing in dispute with an exemplar in his own mind\u2014the product of such previous knowledge. In the former case, the expert is required promptly to exercise his skill\", derived from experience and study; in the latter, the ordinary witness recalls the prototype, and without being able perhaps to analyze critically the grounds of his own faith, feels that he knows the handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">There are two modes of acquiring this knowledge, each of which is universally admitted to be sufficient to enable a witness to testify on the subject. The first is from having seen the party write. The second mode is from having seen letters, bills, or other documents purporting to be in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>handwriting of the party; evidence of- the genuineness of such writings and of the identity of the party being, of course, added <em>aliunde. </em>(1 Greenl. Ev., Sec. 577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cIn both these cases,\u201d adds Mr. Greenleaf, \u201cthe witness acquires his knowledge by his own observation of facts, occurring under his own eye, and, which is especially to be remarked, without having regard to any particular person, case or document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">If it can be assumed that the Mexican archives in the - Surveyor-General\u2019s office are genuine, the man who has read these archives and familiarized himself with the official signatures, several hundred in number, of the person whose signature is the subject of inquiry, has certainly as much knowledge of that person\u2019s handwriting as one who has received \u201cletters or bills\u201d purporting to be in the handwriting of a party whom he has never seen. (See in this connection, <em>Turnipseed </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>1 McCord, 279.) The archives referred to are public documents and records guarded by the former Government in California, as evidence. of the facts to which they relate, and which the Secretary of State was directed to preserve in his department. (Acts of 1851, p. 443.) They were afterwards transferred to the care of the Surveyor-General of the United States. (Concurrent resolution, Laws of 1858, p. 270.) These documents and records have remained continuously in official custody, and although it is not impossible that in some instances forged papers have been surreptiously or corruptly placed among them, the- presumption that officers have done their duty in preventing such frauds, applies equally to the public functionaries of Mexico, and to those of our own Government. It was necessary to prove the validity of such documents in the archives where the object was to show title derived by grant from the former Government before such grants were confirmed; but there can be little danger in assuming the genuineness of the signatures from which the witness acquired his knowledge for a collateral purpose like that under consideration. It may happen that these archives are the only source of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">In the progress of the trial, the plaintiff introduced evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>dence tending to prove that Daniel Sill, senior, during the whole of the year 184G, carried on the business of keeping a bowling alley on the lot in controversy; that he alone occupied the lot, and that Finch was his hired hand or servant. The defendants put in evidence tending to show that Finch <em>&amp; </em>Thompson built the bowling alley as their own, and for their own use. Further, after proving that the signatures were -genuine, the defendants offered writings in \u2022 Spanish, on one sheet, which were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">1. A petition to the Justice of the Peace by Finch &amp; Thompson, dated June, 1846, which alleged, \u201cwe have commenced and are about to finish a bowling alley,\u201d etc., and prayed for a license to conduct the said business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\"><em>2. </em>An act or order of the Justice to the effect that \u201cin consideration of the circumstances recommending the petitioners \u201d he had caused to appear before him three villagers (naming them,) whom he had examined, as immediate neighbors, if they approved of the construction which was being made \u201cin the house of Se\u00f1ores Juan Finch and John Thompson,\u201d dr if the same would incommode them, to which they responded they would not be molested thereby, and \u201cfor their security they signed the same with the present Judge; the interested parties being subject to police regulations.\u201d And to this end, \u2018that;the beneficiaries may have the proper security, this document is returned to them,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">We do not think the objections to this paper were well taken. The act of the Justice, Hoe, was the record of an open investigation, judicial in its character. It was not conclusive as a judgment against plaintiff\u2019s ancestor; but it was submitted to the jury whether such a transaction, in the hamlet of Yerba Buena, and in respect to the very property and business which it is alleged Sill, Sr. then occupied exclusively, and was conducting, was not known to him; and, if so, whether his silence, or failure to oppose the license to the others, did not tend-to disprove the assertion that Finch was merely his servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">In the same year Alcalde Bartlett issued his proclamation (which has become historical,) in pursuance of which Finch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and Thompson presented their title papers, and a minute of the same was made by the Alcalde in his \u201cIndex Book.\u2019\u2019 This boob, and the circumstances under which the entries were made in it, also tended to show notice to Sill, senior, of an open and notorious adverse claim to the lot, on which, by plaintiff\u2019s theory, Finch was laboring as a \u201chired hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendant introduced evidence tending to prove that from 1850 Sill, senior, never asserted his title to the persons in possession of the lot under Thompson. In rebuttal, plaintiff offered to prove that, on one occasion, the said Sill advised with an army officer in respect to the mode of recovering the property; the conversation never having been communicated to the parties in possession. The proffered evidence was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As we have seen, when the petition of De Haro, of March, 1844, was offered, it was not objected to. When, however, the counsel for plaintiff came to sum up the case, \u201che insisted and urged to the jury that the word \u2018plaza\u2019 in said petition, was originally playa (beach,) and afterwards altered to plaza, and that such alteration was perceptible to their own ocular inspection.\u201d The Court permitted the jury \u201cto inspect and examine said petition, and to judge for themselves.\u201d This.,was equivalent to the ninth instruction subsequently asked by the plaintiff; and there was no substantial error in refusing the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The plaintiff requested the Court to charge-the jury: \u201cIf the jury find that any material word in said descriptive portion of said petition has been altered since it was first written, and that no memorandum or note of such alteration was made at the foot of either the petition or concession, before the signature of the petitioner, or magistrate, or of the subscribing witnesses, was written, then they will find such alteration to be null and void, and that the word so altered must read at this time as if no alteration had been made, and as the same was originally written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">If we assume (what hardly appears in the transcript) that the petition was altered apparently after it was signed and the grant made, and that the burden was cast upon the defendants of showing \u201cthat the alteration was made with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>consent of the parties affected by it, or otherwise properly or innocently made,\u201d the question still remains: \"Were there any facts or circumstances in evidence tending to show that the alteration was made with such consent, or innocently? If there were, the instruction was properly refused, since, by its terms, it excludes all consideration of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The transcript reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The defendants then introduced testimony tending to \u2019 show that, on or before March 1st, 1844, the said Daniel Sill, ancestor of the plaintiff, as aforesaid, sold all his interest in the said lot 31 to one George Davis, for the sum of fifty dollars, then and there paid by the said George Davis to the said Daniel Sill, and by the said Daniel Sill accepted in that behalf; and that said Sill declared to said George , Davis, at the same time, that the title to said lot was not vested in him, and that he had no paper title to the same, but that the title remained in said Francisco De Haro, and that he would cause said De Haro to make out the proper transfer of the title to said lot to said George Davis; and that therefore the said George Davis and Daniel Sill, together with one Guillermo (William) S. Hinckley, who was then and there First Alcalde of the pueblo of San Francisco, or Yerba Buena, went to the Mission of Dolores, where the said Francisco De Haro resided, for the purpose of having a transfer of said lot executed, in pursuance of said sale by him to said George Davis; and that thereupon, by the advice of said Hinckley, Alcalde as aforesaid, and with the assent of the said Daniel Sill, ancestor as aforesaid, and with a view to extend the time for complying with the conditions of said grant of said lot, made in the year 1843, by said Francisco Sanchez, Justice of the Peace, as aforesaid, the said Francisco De Haro petitioned anew for a concession of said lot; and that the same was thereafter conceded to him by said Hinckley, on March 3d, 1844, being, at the time of said last-mentioned concession, Alcalde as aforesaid, and afterwards granted by said Francisco De Haro to the said George Davis; said last-mentioned petition, concession, and grant, being in writing and in the Spanish language,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>This evidence certainly tended to show that it was the intention of all parties that the lot in controversy (No. 31) should be granted anew to De Haro, and that if the alteration was made after the petition and grant were executed, it was made to conform the papers to the intention of all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The exception to the oral charge of the Court, on the return of the jury for further instructions, was general. The party excepting should specifically point his objection. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Coleman, 25 </em>Cal. p. 122; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Kidd, </em>26 Cal. p. 263.) The Court should have an opportunity to modify or correct any form of expression inadvertently used in its oral charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Another exception is based on the action of the District Court in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the \u201c Book A of Original Grants.\u201d The book was admissible as primary evidence. <em>(Donner </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>31 Cal. p. 500.) It therefore tended to prove that other grants had been made than those noted in <em>\u201c </em>Blotter B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We do not think that if the eleventh instruction, asked by plaintiff, had been given, it could have influenced the verdict of the jury. The plaintiff\u2019s twenty-fourth instruction does not properly state the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Judgment and order denying a new trial affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Mr. .Justice Bhodes did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
