CONCLUSION ... 1068\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Between late 2001 and early 2002, defendants Iouri Mikhel and Jurijus Kadamovas abducted, held hostage, and killed five people, dumping each victim's body in the New Melones Reservoir outside Yosemite National Park. After a five-month trial, a jury convicted them of several federal crimes, including multiple counts of hostage taking resulting in death under the Hostage Taking Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As summarized below, the evidence that Mikhel and Kadamovas did these things-and did them without concern for their victims' suffering-was detailed, comprehensive, and in a word, overwhelming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In subsequent penalty-phase proceedings under the Federal Death Penalty Act (\"FDPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the jury unanimously recommended that both defendants be sentenced to death. Defendants now challenge their convictions and death sentences on direct appeal to this court. After extensive briefing and argument from the parties, and our own careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Hostage-Taking Conspiracy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants are foreign nationals under the Hostage Taking Act: Mikhel is Russian, and Kadamovas is Lithuanian. Both lived in Los Angeles, California, during the events underlying this case. Defendants were assisted at various times by coconspirators Petro Krylov, Ainar Altmanis, Aleksejus Markovskis, and Natalya Solovyeva. Altmanis, Markovskis, and Solovyeva all pleaded guilty and testified for the government. Krylov was tried and convicted in a separate trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1. Death of Meyer Muscatel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In October 2001, Mikhel, Kadamovas, and Altmanis discussed and rehearsed a plan to kidnap local real-estate developer Meyer Muscatel. The plan called for Mikhel to pose as a businessman interested in purchasing real estate. To that end, Mikhel asked Muscatel to view a property with him. Muscatel agreed and drove with Mikhel to the property in question (actually Mikhel's house), where Kadamovas and Altmanis were waiting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When Muscatel entered the house, Altmanis and Kadamovas grabbed him. Altmanis bound Muscatel's legs with plastic ties, and Kadamovas handcuffed his arms behind his back. Mikhel duct-taped Muscatel's eyes and pistol-whipped him in the head, drawing blood. Mikhel and Kadamovas then took Muscatel's wallet and credit cards and questioned him about his finances. They attempted to withdraw money from his bank account, but the bank froze the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   When Mikhel and Kadamovas determined they would get no money out of Muscatel, they injected him with Dimedrol (an antihistamine with sedative properties) and held him down to the ground. Mikhel closed a plastic bag over Muscatel's head and pinched his nose shut, suffocating him to death. Mikhel and Kadamovas then loaded Muscatel's body into Kadamovas's van and drove to the New Melones Reservoir. They carried his body to the edge of the Parrotts Ferry Bridge and accidentally dropped it on a curb-leaving blood stains-before tossing it into the reservoir. Kadamovas later told his friend Markovskis that he had once thrown a \"fat Jew\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (i.e., Muscatel) off a bridge. The incident, Markovskis said, \"was very funny\" to Kadamovas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. Death of Rita Pekler\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Following Muscatel's death, Mikhel and Kadamovas set their sights on kidnapping George Safiev, a wealthy Russian businessman. First, they decided to abduct Safiev's financial advisor, Rita Pekler, to use as bait. In December 2001, Kadamovas contacted Pekler pretending to be interested in her advice on a real estate transaction. Kadamovas had Pekler pick him up and drive him to a property he claimed he was interested in buying (actually his home). Mikhel, Altmanis, and Kadamovas's friend Krylov were already there; Mikhel was carrying a gun with a fake silencer, and Altmanis had a stun gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When Pekler arrived, Mikhel restrained her and told her that, if she brought Safiev to them, they would get her drunk with vodka or inject her with Dimedrol and leave her unharmed in a motel. Pekler told them she was pregnant and afraid alcohol or drugs would harm the baby. Undeterred, defendants persisted in trying to use her to lure Safiev. Pekler eventually contacted Safiev, but he told her he was too busy to meet. Shortly thereafter, Safiev left Los Angeles for Russia. Mikhel and Kadamovas decided Pekler had outlived her usefulness; they injected her with Dimedrol, strangled her, and as with Muscatel, threw her body off the Parrotts Ferry Bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   3. Death of Alexander Umansky\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Later that same month, Krylov suggested abducting his former boss, Alexander Umansky, who owned an automobile shop. Mikhel posed as a customer who needed audio systems installed in two cars and asked Umansky for a ride to one of them. Umansky was excited about the opportunity and agreed to pick up Mikhel. Mikhel directed Umansky to Kadamovas's house, where Kadamovas, Altmanis, and Krylov already lay in wait-Kadamovas with a gun and Altmanis with a stun gun. When Umansky arrived, Kadamovas sat him on a chair, handcuffed his hands behind him, and bound his legs with plastic ties. Mikhel and Kadamovas then took Umansky's keys, telephone, and wallet and questioned him about his finances. Later, Mikhel and Altmanis used Umansky's debit card to withdraw money from an ATM and were captured doing so on a surveillance camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Umansky remained trapped in Kadamovas's home for three days, during which Mikhel and Kadamovas forced him to call his brother and plead for money to secure his release. Eventually, Mikhel and Kadamovas decided they no longer needed Umansky alive. They sent Altmanis to buy weight plates from a used sporting goods store. When Altmanis returned, Mikhel shoved plastic bags in Umansky's mouth, duct-taped his mouth shut, and put a bag over his head, while Kadamovas held him down and pinched his nose shut. When these efforts proved ineffective, Mikhel and Altmanis twisted a rope around Umansky's neck and strangled him from behind. Mikhel, Kadamovas, and Altmanis then tied a weight plate around Umansky's body and put it in Kadamovas's van. They drove to Mikhel's house and-with the body still in the van-had dinner with Mikhel's girlfriend. After dinner, the three of them drove to the New Melones Reservoir, where they threw Umansky's body off the Parrotts Ferry Bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mikhel and Kadamovas had previously sent the Umansky family a ransom note demanding nearly $235,000. The Umansky family contacted the FBI, which advised them to pay just part of the ransom to give the kidnappers a reason to keep Umansky alive. The Umansky family followed the FBI's advice and paid part of the ransom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Later, after receiving a call threatening harm to other family members, they paid the rest of the ransom money. An IRS investigator traced how the ransom payments were laundered abroad before being deposited in accounts held by Mikhel, Kadamovas, and defendants' business, Designed Water World (a fish aquarium store).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   4. Deaths of Nick Kharabadze and George Safiev\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In January 2002, Mikhel and Kadamovas learned Safiev was back in Los Angeles and decided to trap him through his friend and business partner, Nick Kharabadze. They planned for Kadamovas's girlfriend, Solovyeva, to call Kharabadze and tell him she had gotten his phone number from a friend and wanted to meet him. Markovskis was part of the plan and later testified that Mikhel and Kadamovas were in charge and calling all the shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Solovyeva called Kharabadze and asked him to meet her at what she said was a private club but was in fact Designed Water World's office. When Kharabadze arrived, Altmanis and Markovskis were playing pool, Mikhel and Krylov were drinking, and Kadamovas was standing behind a bar. Kadamovas had a revolver hidden under the bar, and Mikhel and Altmanis had guns concealed under their jackets. Solovyeva asked Kharabadze to order her a drink, while Krylov closed the outside door behind him. Mikhel then handcuffed Kharabadze to a chair, took his keys, wallet, and telephone, and explained they wanted him to help them trap Safiev. At their direction, Kharabadze called Safiev and convinced him to come to Designed Water World.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   When Safiev entered Designed Water World, Mikhel, Kadamovas, Altmanis, Krylov, and Markovskis converged on him. Mikhel handcuffed Safiev and took his keys, wallet, and telephone. Mikhel and Kadamovas then transported Kharabadze and Safiev to Kadamovas's house, where they forced Safiev to call his business partner, Konstantinos Tezhik, and beg him to transfer $940,000 to a foreign account. Kharabadze and Safiev remained imprisoned in Kadamovas's house for four days. During this time, Kadamovas recorded Safiev's voice to use to extort more money after he was dead. Kadamovas also told Markovskis that he planned to continue abducting people and throwing their bodies into the reservoir until he had $50 million, even if it meant piling bodies up to the surface of the water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After Mikhel confirmed receipt of the $940,000, he decided Kharabadze and Safiev were no longer necessary. He and the others got Kharabadze and Safiev drunk with vodka and drove them to the New Melones Reservoir in two cars. On the way, a policeman pulled them over for driving too closely together. Mikhel exited his car and had a brief conversation with the policeman, who sent him on his way. Solovyeva later testified that Kadamovas said he would have killed the policeman if he had seen the hostages in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At the New Melones Reservoir, Mikhel killed Kharabadze by placing a plastic bag over his head and tightening a plastic tie around his throat. Altmanis tied a weight around Kharabadze's body and assisted in throwing it off the Stevenot Bridge. Safiev had already been killed and thrown into the reservoir in a similar fashion. Mikhel told Altmanis that Safiev, like Pekler, had been difficult to kill because he was \"strong as a snake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mikhel used Kharabadze's and Safiev's ATM cards to withdraw money and was again captured on surveillance cameras. Kadamovas then gave the ATM cards to his associate, Vladimir Paniouchkine, who traveled to Germany to withdraw more money. Mikhel used one of Safiev's credit\n   cards to order about $9,000 in electronic equipment. In addition, Mikhel called Tezhik in London and faxed him a ransom note-which Safiev had signed before he died-demanding another $4 million in ransom. Tezhik tape-recorded his calls with Mikhel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   All in all, Mikhel and Kadamovas received over $1 million in ransom money from the hostage-taking conspiracy, which they spent on high-end cars, renovations for their homes, lavish presents for their girlfriends, and expensive vacations, among other things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   5. The FBI's investigation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A father and son returning from a fishing trip discovered Muscatel's body near the Parrotts Ferry Bridge. Later, Altmanis learned the FBI was investigating him, decided to confess, and helped the FBI find the last four victims' bodies. The FBI wire-tapped Mikhel's and Kadamovas's phones and recorded them discussing ransom money. The FBI also secured data from their cellphones, which showed them driving north on Highway 99 toward the New Melones Reservoir on the days Muscatel, Pekler, Umansky, Kharabadze, and Safiev died.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The FBI searched Mikhel's house and found extensive physical evidence linking him and Kadamovas to the victims, including the original $4 million ransom note for Safiev, a record of Safiev's and Kharabadze's personal and financial information, four sets of handcuffs, and plastic ties like those found on the victims. Mikhel's and Kadamovas's fingerprints were on many of these items, and Safiev's and Kharabadze's DNA was on the handcuffs. The FBI also found fourteen handguns, handgun parts, ammunition, a silencer, an electric shock baton, a stun gun, and several stolen or fraudulent passports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The FBI searched Kadamovas's two residences and found additional evidence connected to the victims. At Kadamovas's house in Sherman Oaks, the FBI found several weight plates (but no weight bars or other exercise equipment) and an envelope with a phone number written on it-the same number that defendants used to call the Umansky family for ransom. At Kadamovas's house in Encino, the FBI found a distinctive dagger linked to defendants' money-laundering scheme, a handgun, ammunition, and shoes with blood stains. The shoes matched the shoeprints left in Muscatel's blood on the Parrotts Ferry Bridge. The carpet in Kadamovas's house matched carpet fibers retrieved from Kharabadze's clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Escape Conspiracy and Mikhel's Second Escape Attempt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Following their arrests, Mikhel, Kadamovas, and Krylov were detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center-Los Angeles (\"MDC\"). Mikhel devised a plan by which he, Kadamovas, Krylov, and others would smuggle tools into their cells and\n   bore holes through their cell walls to reach an adjacent stairwell. Once in the stairwell, they would use a hydraulic pump to push open the window's bars, climb through the window, and rappel down the side of the building. A motorcycle gang would be waiting for them outside and would spin off in different directions before reuniting at a safe house. In accordance with the plan, Mikhel successfully smuggled a veritable hardware store into his cell, including hacksaw blades, wrenches, screwdrivers, fishing line, paint, work gloves, bolt cutters, and a camcorder. Kadamovas was originally housed elsewhere in the facility but managed to change cells to be next to the stairwell intended for the escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mikhel invited fellow inmate Billy Parker to join the escape conspiracy, offering him the necessary tools (for a price) and warning him they would have to kill any guards they met on their way out. Parker, however, informed MDC officials. In Mikhel's cell, officials found a large hole carved in the wall and his cache of tools. In Krylov's cell, they found a smaller hole, hacksaw blades, and a screwdriver. They did not find any evidence of tunneling or contraband in Kadamovas's cell. Nonetheless, there was extensive evidence linking Kadamovas to the escape conspiracy, as described in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After the first escape attempt, Mikhel was moved to a high security section of San Bernardino County's Central Detention Center (\"SB-CDC\"). There, he was placed under Special Administrative Measures and isolated from other inmates. Despite these measures, Mikhel concocted a detailed escape plan, which he outlined in a letter promising $1 million to an alleged member of the Mexican Mafia in exchange for help. Officials intercepted the letter, and a deputy sheriff assigned to SB-CDC later testified that Mikhel's escape plan was very feasible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A grand jury indicted Mikhel and Kadamovas on one count of Conspiracy to Take Hostages Resulting in Death (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), three counts of Hostage-Taking Resulting in Death (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), Conspiracy to Launder Monetary Instruments (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ), Conspiracy to Escape from Custody (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and Criminal Forfeiture (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ). The government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The guilt phase of trial began in July 2006 and spanned five months. The government's case in chief was detailed and thorough, including scores of witnesses who testified over the course of more than thirty trial days. Defendants initially rested their case after just three trial days, but the district court permitted them to reopen their case when Mikhel unexpectedly chose to testify. Mikhel testified on direct for three days, at the end of which he refused to be cross-examined. On Kadamovas's motion, the district court struck Mikhel's testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it. On January 16, 2007, the jury began its deliberations. The very next day, it returned separate verdicts in each defendant's case, finding both defendants guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The penalty phase began on January 24, 2007. The FDPA requires the jury to make several findings before recommending a sentence of death. Among other things, the jury must find that at least one statutory aggravating factor exists and that all aggravating factors proven by the government\n   \"sufficiently outweigh\" any mitigating factors proven by defendants.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The government argued four statutory aggravating factors against both defendants: (1) death during commission of another crime, (2) procurement of offense by payment, (3) substantial planning and premeditation, and (4) multiple killings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The government also argued five non-statutory aggravating factors against both defendants: (5) future dangerousness, (6) contemporaneous convictions for multiple offenses, (7) witness elimination, (8) emotional suffering of the victims, and (9) victim impact. The government's penalty-phase case incorporated all of its guilt-phase evidence.

The district court charged the jury on February 13, 2007. Later the same day, after a brief three-hour deliberation, the jury returned separate verdicts in each defendant's case. The jury unanimously found every aggravating factor proposed by the government as to both defendants. No juror found any mitigating factor as to either defendant.

In\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Flores\n   </em>\n   , we rejected challenges to the Hostage Taking Act as unconstitutionally vague or as violating the Equal Protection Clause, but we did not address the argument defendants assert here-namely, that the Hostage Taking Act exceeded Congress's constitutionally enumerated powers and violated the Tenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416628\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1468/\">\n    63 F.3d at 1473-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this regard, we are persuaded by the Second Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Tenth Amendment summarizes and, thus, reinforces the relationship between the United States-whose powers are limited and enumerated-and the states whose powers are general, except as limited by the U.S. Constitution and their own constitutions.

Defendants highlight Juror 285's juror questionnaire, on which she wrote \"I am neither for or against the death penalty.\" She explained: \"[T]he death penalty to me is no joke. [L]ife to me is a gift so when it come[s] to taking someone's life a lot of things need to be tak[en] into consideration.\" In response to a question asking whether she felt the death penalty was used too often, too seldomly, or randomly, she wrote: \"[I]f people had any conscious [sic] as to what would happen if they did the wrong, maybe even getting the death penalty, they may think twice about what they are about to do.\" When asked whether her views would cause her \"substantial difficulty in voting for death as the appropriate penalty,\" she checked \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Although these written responses suggested Juror 285 would have been willing to vote for the death penalty under appropriate circumstances, her oral responses during voir dire demonstrated far greater hesitance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   [Government]: .... Ma'am, in the penalty phase, depending on the evidence as you heard it, could you consider either punishment, either life imprisonment or the death penalty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   [Juror 285]: I can't consider it right now because I don't know what it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   [Government]: I'm not asking-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   [Juror 285]: And I can't base my decision on something that I don't know, so I can't answer that question for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [Government]: Absolutely. Could you just consider the evidence presented by both sides?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [Juror 285]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Juror 285's hesitant responses during voir dire-particularly her interruption of the prosecutor and unwillingness to give an unequivocal answer to whether she could\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   imposing the death penalty-would understandably give pause to any prosecutor trying a death penalty case. This concern was reflected in the prosecutor's extemporaneous response to the challenge: \"This has nothing to do with the color of anybody's skin. It has totally to do with their attitudes concerning the death penalty and their ability to be a fair juror and render the verdict that we think is appropriate in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Defendants contend Jurors 67 and 84 (whom the government did not strike) were as hesitant or more hesitant to impose the death penalty as Juror 285. Juror 67, a Hispanic male, stated he was \"fairly neutral\" on the death penalty and wrote in his questionnaire that the death penalty is used \"unfairly\" because \"a great deal depends on your ability to hire a competent lawyer.\" But when the government asked him during voir dire whether he could consider imposing the death penalty, Juror 67 gave an unequivocal response: \"Certainly.\" This prevents him from being an apposite comparison to Juror 285.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Juror 84, a white male, wrote on his juror questionnaire that he was neither 100 percent for nor against the death penalty and that, \"depending on the crime,\" \"the death penalty should be a possible penalty.\" He indicated the death penalty is used \"fairly\" and is generally reserved \"for the most terrible crimes.\" Although defendants correctly quote his statement that he \"really hate[d] to see anybody put to death,\" they ignore the remainder of his response: \"[B]ut I can see the reason for it in today's society.\" When asked if he could consider imposing the death penalty, Juror 84 confirmed, \"I believe so, yes.\" Like Jurors 67 and 84, the other jurors highlighted in defendants' briefs all affirmed they could consider imposing the death penalty-which is precisely what Juror 285 did not do. In short, comparative analysis does not show that the government's concern over Juror 285's willingness to impose the death penalty was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   There is less merit to the government's other stated reason for striking Juror 285: that her father was in prison on drug charges. Juror 285 stated her \"dad ha[d] gone to jail on drug related charges\" but that this would not influence her decisions. Some non-stricken jurors also had family in prison or had been charged with crimes themselves. Juror 67 had pleaded guilty to a DUI, and Juror 8, an Asian male, had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. It is unclear whether either juror was incarcerated, but the government apparently did not follow up with them on the issue. That said, Juror 67's father and cousin were both police officers, and Juror 8 wrote in his questionnaire that he \"believe[d] in the death penalty\" and that it was \"used fairly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Somewhat more troubling, Juror 39, a white male, had a son who was imprisoned after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Juror 39 attested this would not influence his decisions, but when asked whether the incident \"left a bad taste in [his] mouth regarding the criminal justice system[,]\" he responded \"[t]hat's a hard one for me to answer....\" He then provided a lengthy explanation, exhibiting frustration with his son for accepting a plea bargain without consulting him and with the district attorney for charging his son with first-degree murder rather than manslaughter. On the other hand, Juror 39 represented that he had served on several juries,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of which went to verdict. This provided a powerful reason for the government not to strike Juror 39: a prosecutor might assume that, if a prospective juror has served on several juries that all reached a verdict, the juror is unlikely to\n   be a defense-friendly holdout during deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   On balance, even if the government's explanation about Juror 285's father's criminal history seems weak, the comparative analysis here provides little evidence of discriminatory intent, particularly given the government's genuine and compelling reason for striking Juror 285 for being lukewarm on the death penalty, and possible reasons for not striking Jurors 8, 39, and 67 despite their criminal-history responses. Furthermore, although the government applied six of its eighteen exercised peremptory challenges to black jurors, there were two black jurors on the final jury and two black jurors as alternates. The government accepted this outcome, leaving ten peremptory challenges unexercised. Moreover, the final jury's composition fairly resembled the entire jury pool, with white jurors actually making up a smaller percentage of the jury than they did of the pool. After careful review, we cannot say defendants have met their burden of demonstrating race was a \"substantial motivating factor\" in the government's peremptory strike of Juror 285.\n   <em>\n    Currie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325598\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/603/#p605\">\n    825 F.3d at 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   4. The use of an anonymous jury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Empaneling an anonymous jury is permissible only if \"(1) there is a strong reason for concluding that it is necessary to enable the jury to perform its factfinding function, or to ensure juror protection; and (2) reasonable safeguards are adopted by the trial court to minimize any risk of infringement upon the fundamental rights of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Shryock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101362\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/948/#p971\">\n    342 F.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971 (9th Cir. 2003). Defendants did not object to empaneling an anonymous jury, and they do not challenge the district court's determination that an anonymous jury was necessary to ensure juror protection. Rather, they claim specific precautions-a cautionary instruction on the reasons for juror anonymity and the disclosure of potential jurors' names and addresses to defense counsel-were required to minimize the risk of prejudice to their Fifth Amendment right to a presumption of innocence and Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. As defendants raised neither issue below, we review for plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court did not instruct the jury on the reasons for their anonymity but simply informed them they would be referred to by number rather than name. The questionnaire potential jurors completed stated their information would \"be kept confidential\" and that \"[n]either your identities nor your answers will be released to the general public or the media.\" In short, the court treated the jurors' anonymity as routine and suggested through the questionnaires that it was concerned about their privacy and unwanted media attention. The court also repeatedly instructed the jury that defendants were presumed innocent, further mitigating any potential prejudice in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Although we upheld empaneling an anonymous jury in\n   <em>\n    Shryock\n   </em>\n   , where the jury was given a pretextual reason for anonymity, we did not say that giving a\n   pretextual reason was a necessary precaution. Simply treating anonymity as a routine procedure and offering neutral justifications focused on juror confidentiality also sufficiently guard against prejudice.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152797\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1199/#p1245\">\n    388 F.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1245 (9th Cir. 2004) (collecting cases). Indeed, \"the generally accepted practice for minimizing prejudice ... is to downplay (not accentuate) the significance of the juror anonymity procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280404\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/1015/#p1037\">\n    428 F.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (11th Cir. 2005). Had the district court done what defendants now contend was required and given a cautionary instruction on anonymity, the instruction might have drawn more attention to anonymity and led jurors to speculate on the subject. There was no error, let alone plain error, in failing to give a sua sponte cautionary instruction on the reasons for anonymity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Second, the district court took reasonable precautions to safeguard defendants' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Shryock\n   </em>\n   , \"the use of an anonymous jury may interfere with defendants' ability to conduct voir dire and to exercise meaningful peremptory challenges, thereby implicating defendants' Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101362\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/948/#p971\">\n    342 F.3d at 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203432\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires a \"list of the veniremen ... stating the place of abode of each venireman\" to be provided to a capital defendant, unless \"the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that providing the list may jeopardize the life or safety of any person.\" Defendants do not dispute the district court's finding that disclosing jurors' identifying information would have jeopardized their lives or safety. Instead, defendants argue it was plain error for the court not to sua sponte disclose potential jurors' identities to defense counsel under a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The district court sufficiently safeguarded defense counsel's ability to conduct voir dire by providing defendants with an eleven-page questionnaire for each potential juror detailing age, marital status, city of residence, employment history, and education, among other things. None of our cases require, or even suggest, that providing potential jurors' names and addresses to defense counsel is necessary in circumstances such as these. Nor does \u00a7 3432 require disclosing jurors' identifying information to counsel when the \"life or safety\" exception applies, as it undisputedly did here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court committed no error, and certainly no plain error, in empaneling the anonymous jury as it did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Right to a public trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendants claim the district court's exclusion of Armen Harutiunian from trial violated their Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. Harutiunian attended Mikhel's last day of testimony on January 5, 2007. He had been released from federal prison earlier that same day. He had a visible Armenian gang tattoo on his neck, told courtroom staff he was a \"friend\" or \"fan\" of Mikhel, and was observed behaving in a manner that was \"intimidating in nature.\" The next week, the district court informed the parties that Harutiunian would be barred from reentering the courtroom going\n   forward. Neither defendant objected, and neither defendant gave any indication of an acquaintance with Harutiunian. There is also no evidence Harutiunian ever attempted to attend the trial again. Because defendants did not object to the exclusion below, we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \"The right to a public trial entitles a criminal defendant at the very least ... to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The exclusion did not implicate defendants' constitutional rights. The district court therefore did not err, let alone plainly err, by excluding Harutiunian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   6. \"Reasonable doubt\" instruction as to guilt\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Defendants challenge the district court's use of our circuit's model \"reasonable doubt\" instruction in the guilt phase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties dispute whether defendants preserved the objection. We need not resolve that dispute because the instruction was not erroneous even under de novo review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Our model instruction provides that a \"reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense and is not based purely on speculation.\" Model Crim.

Callahan's three-day absence in no way prejudiced Mikhel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Kadamovas raises a similar but distinct argument. He claims the district court violated \u00a7 3005 by denying his requests to continue trial to allow one of his attorneys more time to prepare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming without deciding that denying a\n   continuance could violate \u00a7 3005 under some circumstances, there was no violation here. Trial in this case was originally scheduled for 2002, but was continued several times until it was finally set for July 2006. In November 2005, ten months before trial, one of Kadamovas's attorneys (Brewer) submitted a declaration stating she did not have time to prepare the case to her client's satisfaction. As a result, the district court appointed Sonia Chahin in her stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In March 2006, Kadamovas unsuccessfully moved to continue the trial date to allow Chahin more time to prepare. Less than a week before trial, Kadamovas unsuccessfully moved for a continuance again. Trial began as scheduled on July 11, 2006, with potential jurors completing questionnaires. There was then a month-long break to accommodate Chahin-who had another trial that July-before proceedings resumed on August 15, 2006, with voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Notably, between appointment in November 2005 and the beginning of trial in July 2006, Chahin billed almost 900 hours on this case. And in the four years leading up to trial, Kadamovas's other attorney, Lasting, billed over 4,000 hours. Moreover, we cannot overlook the benefit Chahin derived from Brewer's prior years of work. Chahin was not starting from a blank slate; she had ten months to get up to speed; she billed 900 hours before trial began; and Kadamovas concedes she played a substantial role at trial, taking 30 percent of the witnesses. The district court's denial of Kadamovas's motions for a continuance did not violate \u00a7 3005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, like Mikhel, Kadamovas makes little attempt to explain why he was prejudiced in this regard. At best, he states: \"Chahin went from a six-week murder trial into this grueling trial without reviewing much of the discovery and never traveling to Lithuania to investigate Mr. Kadamovas's background.\" But he does not explain what discovery Chahin failed to review that might have changed the jury's verdict or why traveling to Lithuania was essential to effectively representing him. His contention that Chahin had inadequate time to prepare is also belied by the extensive hours she spent on the case. Thus, even if there were a technical violation of \u00a7 3005, it would be harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   8. Excluded testimony regarding cooperating witnesses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Altmanis, Solovyeva, and Markovskis all testified for the government as cooperating witnesses. On cross-examination, defendants attacked their credibility by questioning them about their plea agreements. On redirect, the government sought to rehabilitate Solovyeva and Markovskis's credibility by eliciting testimony to the effect that their plea agreements would be voided if they committed perjury. Defendants then sought to one-up the government once more, proffering Clifford Smith as an example of a cooperating witness who had committed perjury in a different case without repercussion. The district court held the proffered testimony irrelevant. We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Orm Hieng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876287\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/1131/#p1135\">\n    679 F.3d 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (9th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Smith had no connection to defendants, the crimes, or the investigation. He had merely testified in another case pending in the same courthouse. According to defendants, he committed perjury in that case and suffered no consequence for doing so. Kadamovas argues that the government's efforts to rehabilitate Solovyeva and Markovskis created the misleading impression that the government always controls cooperating witnesses by prosecuting them if they lie. He claims the government thereby opened the door to Smith's \"profile\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   evidence regarding the United States Attorney's Office's modus operandi with respect to cooperating witnesses who commit perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Contrary to Kadamovas's arguments, the proffered testimony was plainly excludable. There is nothing in the record to indicate that any of the cooperating witnesses knew that Smith had committed perjury and not been prosecuted.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Smith's possible history of perjuring himself with impunity was at most minimally probative of Altmanis, Solovyeva, or Markovskis's credibility and threatened to create a distracting trial-within-a-trial regarding events having nothing to do with this case. In this regard, Kadamovas's reliance on our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We begin by reviewing Mikhel's pretrial history of mental illness and then address each trial segment in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   After his first escape attempt, Mikhel was moved to a high security section of SB-CDC and placed under Special Administrative Measures. In January 2004, more than two years before his trial began, he attempted to commit suicide by cutting an artery in his ankle. Mikhel would later explain that this was an impulsive act that he did not plan out and that he was feeling hopeless about his case at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Following the suicide attempt, Mikhel was moved to the West Valley Detention Center (\"WVDC\"), where he received treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Inderpal Dhillon. Dr. Dhillon originally diagnosed Mikhel with major depression and prescribed anti-depressants. Later, she concluded he suffered from bipolar disorder and revised her treatment plan accordingly. During three meetings in early 2004, Dr. Dhillon noted that Mikhel suffered from auditory hallucinations, including speaking to people who were not there and hearing electricity. Mikhel continued to be treated, and nothing indicates that he suffered from any form of hallucination at any later point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   A year passed, and in April 2005, Mikhel attempted to take his life a second time by hoarding his medications and taking them all at once. He reported that his reason was the same as before-that he was feeling hopeless about his case. Afterward, Dr. Dhillon continued to treat Mikhel and noted he was showing signs of hypomania, including increased activity, racing thoughts, and feelings of grandiosity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Another year passed, and in May 2006, Mikhel was transferred back to MDC, where he would be held during trial. The medical staff there diagnosed him with depression and prescribed anti-depressants. Prior to trial, defense counsel had psychiatrist Dr. William Vicary examine Mikhel. In a September 5, 2006, letter, Dr. Vicary opined that Mikhel's demanding and irritable behavior was \"largely due to his untreated Bipolar Disorder.\" He summarily concluded that Mikhel's competency would be \"enhanced\" with proper treatment, but gave no opinion as to Mikhel's competency to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   On the eve of opening statements, Mikhel attempted suicide a third time by trying\n   to hang himself with a sheet. Once again, his stated reason for doing so was hopelessness about his case. The next day he insisted on appearing in court in his jail garb, with a ligature mark visible on his neck. The court addressed the incident with Mikhel's counsel, who stated that \"with [Mikhel's] suicidal frame of mind, I don't know that he's competent.\" Counsel suggested Mikhel should be medically examined but never moved for a competency hearing. The court agreed to another medical examination and ordered an MDC staff psychiatrist to evaluate Mikhel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The following week, MDC's chief forensic psychologist, Dr. Ralph Ihle, completed a full forensic evaluation of Mikhel and submitted a comprehensive report to the court. Dr. Ihle spoke to Mikhel's attorneys and reviewed Mikhel's personal history and prior treatment, including Mikhel's medical records, a declaration from Dr. Dhillon, Dr. Vicary's initial September 5, 2006, letter, and a follow-up letter from Dr. Vicary reiterating his bipolar diagnosis. Dr. Ihle also personally interviewed Mikhel and found that he was able to follow directions and maintain daily routines at MDC; that his demeanor was polite and cooperative; that he engaged in appropriate reciprocal communication; that there was no evidence of him experiencing hallucinations, delusions, or confusion; that he had no significant deficits in attention, concentration, or memory; and that he showed no signs of odd or bizarre behavior, though he was depressed and expressed that he felt hopeless about his case. Dr. Ihle tested Mikhel's intellectual functioning and believed he was \"within the high or above average range\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   Mr. Mikhel's verbal behavior during the evaluation suggested that he was within the high or above average range of intellectual functioning. He demonstrated adequate English grammar for someone educated in a foreign country, and an above average English vocabulary. His speech was well organized and sufficiently goal directed. His logic was easy to follow, and his associations were adequately organized with a normal flow or continuity of ideas. He is also well read in the subject of philosophy. He discussed his views on existential philosophy works by Frankel and Nietzsche, regarding the meaning of life and Nihilism. He had good recall of some of the passages or concepts espoused in the books. In summary, the objective information suggests that Mr. Mikhel is most likely functioning in the high to above average range of intelligence. He does not exhibit any significant signs of cognitive impairment or gross brain damage. His intellectual functioning supports his having the present ability to understand the nature and consequences of the charges brought against him, or to properly assist in his defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   With respect to Mikhel's understanding of the charges against him, Dr. Ihle noted that Mikhel could clearly articulate the charges; that he knew they were serious felonies and that he could face the death penalty; that he understood the different types of pleas and their legal consequences; and that he had an adequate understanding of courtroom participants and procedures, as well as appropriate courtroom behavior. Mikhel told him he was willing to cooperate with an attorney but lacked confidence in his present attorneys because they did not follow his suggestions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Based on the materials he reviewed and his personal examination, Dr. Ihle concluded that Mikhel was competent to stand trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   Based on the information available, there is evidence to indicate that Mr. Mikhel suffers from a Major Depressive Disorder, but the symptoms do not impair his present ability to understand\n   the nature and consequences of the court proceedings against him, or his ability to properly assist counsel in his defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   The presence of a Major Depressive Disorder, or any other disorder, does not, in and of itself, render an individual so compromised as to lack the ability to understand legal materials and to cooperate with defense counsel in a rational manner. Despite the presence of symptoms of a Major Depressive Disorder, the defendant was able to articulate a coherent and comprehensive history, and did not appear to have any difficulties in expressive (i.e., speaking) or receptive (i.e., understanding) language. Overall, the defendant was able to offer relevant and meaningful information to this evaluator regarding both historical data and legal matters. During the competency portion of the evaluation, he provided appropriate responses to the questions posed to him. He did not appear to experience any difficulties in communicating his thoughts to the evaluator, nor did he parrot the information. Any difficulties he exhibits with respect to legal counsel are volitional, and a reflection of his perception that his defense against the charges is hopeless at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Dr. Ihle submitted his report to the court on September 14, 2006, and the court found the same day that Mikhel was \"competent to stand trial.\" Again, we need not decide whether the court's consideration of Dr. Ihle's report amounted to a competency hearing. What matters for our purposes is whether the district court plainly erred in failing sua sponte to order any additional competency proceeding. Dr. Ihle's opinion respecting Mikhel's competency and the absence of any clinical evidence of incompetence distinguish this case from those in which we have found reversible error.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647306\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1242/#p1248\">\n    643 F.3d at 1246-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing denial of a competency hearing where court was faced with five competing expert reports, some finding \"no evidence of psychotic behavior\" and others finding \"severe psychosis\");\n   <em>\n    Odle v.

Mikhel attempts to analogize his case to\n   <em>\n    Loyola-Dominguez\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant also attempted suicide on the eve of trial. But the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Loyola-Dominguez\n   </em>\n   did not elicit adequate information to dispel serious concerns regarding competency. Rather, the trial court inquired how long it would take to get an evaluation and then conducted a brief colloquy with the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1319 (\"Also of concern is [Loyola-Dominguez's] response to the question from the court, 'Do you know what's going on?' Loyola-Dominguez answered, 'I don't know. I've never been like this, so I don't know.' \"). Here, by contrast, the district court ordered a forensic evaluation after Mikhel's third suicide attempt and the resulting report found no impairment to Mikhel's ability to understand the nature and object of trial or to aid in his defense. Every doctor to examine Mikhel after a suicide attempt reported that he tried to take his life because he regarded his future as hopeless. Based on these facts, Mikhel's suicide attempts, although naturally concerning, did not raise a genuine doubt as to his competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   As for Mikhel's decision to wear his jail garb in court, this is the type of \"bizarre action[ ]\" we have said is \"not necessarily sufficient evidence to compel a [competency] hearing\" but is \"a factor to be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres v. Prunty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243363\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1103/#p1109\">\n    223 F.3d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109-10 (9th Cir. 2000). Mikhel later provided a reasoned explanation for his decision, stating he felt it would have been superficial to wear civilian clothes only during the few hours a day he spent in court. His decision to wear his jail garb did not create a genuine doubt as to his competency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Woodford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9183239\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/628/#p645\">\n    384 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645-46 (9th Cir. 2004) (the defendant's \"decision not to wear civilian clothes and to remain in the doorway of the courtroom\" during a capital trial did not mandate reversing for a competency hearing given that he \"was evidently aware of the risks of his behavior ... and rationally weighed those risks\"). Although we acknowledge the confluence of these circumstances is concerning and that a competency hearing might have been prudent, we cannot say the district court plainly erred by failing to sua sponte order a hearing at the outset of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Next, Mikhel asserts the district court should have ordered a competency hearing near the end of the guilt phase. A few months into trial, Mikhel sent the court a handwritten request for new counsel, which complained that his attorneys were unwilling to implement his trial-strategy suggestions. The court rejected Mikhel's request, and defense counsel asked that Dr. Ihle examine Mikhel again. The court refused, stating it was receiving oral reports from MDC keeping it \"fully abreast\" of Mikhel's mental condition and that \"nothing ... indicates [Mikhel is] slipping or failing in any way.\" Mikhel later filed a second request for new counsel based on disagreements with his attorneys over whether he should testify. The court again denied the request. At the very end of the guilt phase, Mikhel testified on direct for three days but refused to be cross-examined. The court struck this testimony, and Mikhel refused to appear in court thereafter (except to hear the guilt-phase verdict).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Mikhel's requests for new counsel did not raise any genuine doubt as to his competency; to the contrary, they evinced his intelligence, his firm grasp of the proceedings and the legal system, and his own strong views on the best strategy for his defense. For instance, in response to Mikhel's allegations that his attorneys were not adequately communicating with him or preparing him to testify, his lead counsel asserted, and the court agreed, that Mikhel was merely \"attempting to put appellate issues into the record.\" Moreover, Mikhel's stricken testimony, though perhaps ill advised, was not irrational. The evidence against him was overwhelming, and he had nothing to lose in this \"Hail Mary\" attempt to exculpate himself and Kadamovas. Throughout his three days of testimony-which we describe in greater detail below-he carefully developed a theme that he was a wealthy white-collar criminal operating at the margins of the law and thus had no reason to engage in the comparatively high-risk, low-reward violent hostage takings he was charged with committing. This testimony clearly demonstrated the native intelligence identified by Dr. Ihle, as well as the ability to understand and respond to questions, convey a narrative, and recall details from events spanning decades.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the final months of the guilt phase provided the\n   district court little or no reason to question Mikhel's competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Finally, we consider the penalty phase. Mikhel refused to be present in court for any of the penalty proceedings. His mitigation case proceeded without him and included testimony from Drs. Vicary and Dhillon regarding his mental health. Dr. Vicary asserted that Mikhel suffered from paranoid delusion and reported that Mikhel said his attorneys, the judge, and the government were \"all working against him.\" Dr. Vicary attributed this in part to Mikhel being kept under special administrative conditions for a long time and believed prescribing a mood-stabilizing medication would reduce these symptoms. He further testified Mikhel was \"faking health\" as patients who want to avoid treatment often do. He explained: \"He's crazy. He's irrational. You cannot sit down with [Mikhel] and spend time with him and ask him questions before he gets into this 'everything is rosy, I have no problems, and it's all just a conspiracy against me.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Days later, Mikhel filed another request for new counsel. In a hearing in which Mikhel was initially absent, his counsel represented that Mikhel wanted to submit to a psychological evaluation \"to show that he has no mental problems\" and \"is totally competent in everything he does.\" Counsel also asserted Mikhel was \"doing everything in his power ... to throw a monkey wrench into [the defense's] ability to put on any kind of a mitigation defense.\" Counsel further stated: \"I have a question as to Mr. Mikhel's competency. I don't object to him being submitted to an independent, psychological or mental evaluation.\" The court responded that, \"based upon all the reports that I have received, he is competent to stand trial.\" Although counsel's statement came close to a request for a competency hearing, counsel himself did not suggest that Mikhel might be incompetent. Rather, counsel's statement that he would not \"object\" to an independent evaluation was an accommodation to Mikhel, who wanted an evaluation to prove he\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   competent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The court then heard from Mikhel, who extensively criticized his counsel. Mikhel took issue with Dr. Vicary referring to him as a \"pathological liar\" on cross-examination and with his counsel's failure to address this testimony on redirect. Mikhel asserted this was an intentional omission by his counsel: \"In my opinion, he's not doing that because he's going to use the very, very same statement to discredit me on the further actions when his performance and his conduct will be put in review later on.\" Mikhel explained he had planned to testify for two weeks in order to counter all of the government's evidence against him. The reason why he refused to be cross-examined or attend the remainder of the trial was because his counsel abandoned this strategy. The court denied Mikhel's request for new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Mikhel now argues that, by the end of trial, the cumulative evidence of his purported incompetency resembled that in\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   . There, the state court was aware from a pretrial psychiatric report that the defendant had difficulty participating in the exam, counting, and telling time; was \"markedly circumstantial and irrelevant in his speech;\" was diagnosed with a borderline mental deficiency and depression; and had a history of purposefully falling down flights of stairs to get attention.\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    420 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165 n.1, 175-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, there was no forensic competency evaluation performed in\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   , and no mental health professional\n   had opined that the defendant in that case\n   <em>\n    was competent\n   </em>\n   to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 180,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the psychiatric report-which called into question the defendant's ability to even comprehend the proceedings and was thus far more drastic than the opinions Drs. Vicary and Dhillon rendered-was the only professional evaluation of the defendant's mental health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendez v.

Secondly, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   was absent from the remainder of trial due to his suicide attempt, and as a result, \"the trial judge and defense counsel were no longer able to observe him in the context of the trial and to gauge\" his competence.\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    420 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Mikhel voluntarily absented himself from the penalty phase, the district court held two hearings with him in lock-up and thus had the ability to observe his demeanor, comprehension of the risks, and ability to respond to questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9183239\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/628/#p645\">\n    384 F.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   based on trial judge's ability to observe defendant on days he decided to sit at defense table rather than courtroom's doorway). Mikhel's attempt to analogize\n   <em>\n    Drope\n   </em>\n   to his case is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Mikhel also cites\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant was convicted of shooting several doctors at a hospital due to delusional beliefs they had injected him with AIDS as part of a conspiracy against him.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243363\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1103/#p1109\">\n    223 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While there are some parallels, this case is not\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   . There, the defendant's delusions were well documented and evident throughout every facet of the case, including his commission of the crime. Though Dr. Vicary testified that Mikhel suffered from paranoid delusions, he did not expound upon any perceived conspiracy. Tellingly, Mikhel himself had many opportunities to express such views through his requests for new counsel and the resulting hearings, but he at most criticized his attorneys' unwillingness to follow his desired trial strategy and expressed his opinion that his counsel was attempting to discredit him in anticipation of a charge of ineffective assistance of counsel. Most notably, Mikhel's own counsel, who presumably had the most contact with Mikhel and had the best opportunity to observe his mental state, never moved for a competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   As we concluded for the trial's guilt phase, this evidence demonstrates Mikhel's understanding of the nature and object of the trial and his familiarity with his appellate rights. He disavowed that he was trying to undermine his own mitigation defense and blamed his absence from trial on his disagreement with his attorneys. This bolsters the district court's conclusion that Mikhel was merely attempting to manufacture issues for appeal. \"Although there is little doubt that [Mikhel] was recalcitrant and acted in ways that were detrimental to his case, his interactions with the trial judge indicated that he understood what was at stake during the penalty phase and could make informed decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9183239\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/628/#p645\">\n    384 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   645 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069203\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/1130/#p1134\">\n    751 F.3d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A defendant who refuses to work with his lawyer out of spite alone is not incompetent even if that defendant has a serious mental disease or defect.\"). Accordingly, the penalty phase yielded no genuine doubt of Mikhel's competency, and the district court did not plainly err in failing to hold a competency hearing sua sponte at any stage of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   10. Kadamovas's Confrontation Clause claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Kadamovas claims Mikhel's testimony and refusal to be cross-examined\n   violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation right and prejudiced him in both the guilt and penalty phases. We review alleged Confrontation Clause violations de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During the first two days, Mikhel testified about his life before the offense conduct at issue here. Much of this testimony concerned his purportedly lavish lifestyle as a successful smuggler and money launderer. For instance, he testified that he purchased a $17 million yacht to smuggle \"big quantities\" of money between countries, that he traveled throughout the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia to advance his illicit enterprises, and that he used a vineyard outside Modesto, California, as a \"safe house\" for paperwork and money. According to Mikhel's counsel, the purpose of this testimony was to proactively raise Mikhel's past misconduct-which did not involve kidnapping or murder-and to \"establish[ ] a foundation for what he did later.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Mikhel had relatively little to say about Kadamovas in his testimony, and what he did say offered innocent explanations for some of the government's evidence tying himself and Kadamovas to the kidnappings. Mikhel testified that Kadamovas once helped him smuggle money out of the United States by strapping bricks of cash to their bodies using plastic ties (thus explaining the plastic ties later found in Mikhel's home). He further testified that Kadamovas participated in smuggling schemes to Cuba and Cyrus. And he testified that Kadamovas assisted him in an extortion scheme, in which they videotaped a meeting with a man who sought their help hiring an assassin and then threatened to publish the tape unless the man paid them $50,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   On his third day of testimony, Mikhel turned to the events underlying this case. He claimed that an unnamed associate wanted Muscatel to be \"taught a lesson\" and that he hired Altmanis for the job, merely instructing Altmanis to \"do whatever you think you're supposed to do\" without wanting him to kill anyone. Mikhel said he told Altmanis, \"I don't want to know what's going to happen after you leave here.\" He also said that his conversation with Altmanis caused him to be concerned about the money in his home, prompting him and Kadamovas to drive to his Modesto safe house the next day (thus explaining the cellphone data showing them making that trip).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Mikhel also testified to some events connected to the Umansky family's ransom payments, asserting that he believed he was only helping Altmanis launder this money and did not know its provenance. With regard to being caught on a surveillance camera using Umansky's ATM card, Mikhel said he purchased the card from Altmanis to facilitate creating shell corporations. As for the Safiev-related plots, Mikhel testified he used Pekler and Kharabadze to lure Safiev into a meeting\n   <em>\n    in order to help\n   </em>\n   Safiev. Mikhel claimed that unnamed individuals were after Safiev for cheating them of $50 million, that he sought a meeting with Safiev to assist him in disappearing to safety, and that he expected several million dollars in compensation for his services. Mikhel wove a complicated story to this effect, which included him and Kadamovas once again making trips to the Modesto safe house. Mikhel ended his testimony by attesting that he did not kill Muscatel, Pekler, Umansky, Kharabadze, or Safiev. When he refused to be cross-examined, the district court struck his testimony and instructed the jury not to consider it \"in any matter against Mr. Mikhel or against Mr. Kadamovas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Kadamovas argues that the district court's instruction could not cure his inability to cross-examine Mikhel under\n   <em>\n    Bruton v.

Most of Mikhel's testimony regarding the offense conduct, including the events underlying Muscatel and Umansky's disappearances, made no mention of Kadamovas. When Mikhel did insert Kadamovas into his narrative, he never claimed Kadamovas seized, detained, threatened, injured, or demanded ransom for any of the victims. Rather, Mikhel's attempt to exculpate himself also extended to Kadamovas, providing Kadamovas, for instance, an explanation for why his cellphone placed him near the reservoir around the times of the victims' deaths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Kadamovas argues that parts of Mikhel's testimony corroborated the government's evidence against him. For example, Mikhel's testimony supported the government's evidence that Kadamovas posed as a potential client to meet with Pekler and that Solovyeva lured Kharabadze to Designed Water World. But none of this evidence,\n   <em>\n    on its own\n   </em>\n   , directly established that Kadamovas committed or conspired to commit hostage taking. Instead, by arguing that Mikhel's testimony corroborated the government's evidence, Kadamovas implicitly acknowledges that the testimony must be\n   <em>\n    linked\n   </em>\n   to other evidence in order\n   to inculpate him. Kadamovas thus asserts the precise type of \"contextual implication\" argument that the Supreme Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   . Because Mikhel's testimony did not facially incriminate Kadamovas, it did not trigger the\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Angwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9465679\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/271/786/#p796\">\n    271 F.3d at 797-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   violation where the codefendant's pretrial statements \"could support\" the government's narrative but were only \"mildly incriminating\").

Although Kadamovas cites Mikhel's testimony as evidence of guilt-phase prejudice, the district court granted Kadamovas's motion to strike that testimony and gave a curative instruction. For the reasons discussed above, we assume that the jury followed the court's instruction and that Mikhel's testimony therefore did not prejudice Kadamovas. Likewise, none of Mikhel's unusual behavior during trial-such as wearing his jail garb, appearing in court with a visible ligature mark from his third suicide attempt, and refusing to attend the final days of trial-demonstrated the kind of manifest prejudice required to reverse a conviction for denial of severance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the court repeatedly instructed the jury not to consider Mikhel's absence against Kadamovas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Kadamovas relies on the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Kadamovas's claim is, if anything, weakened by this comparison. In one of many courtroom incidents in\n   <em>\n    Mannie\n   </em>\n   , the codefendant yelled at defense counsel, \"then stood up, knocked one of his attorneys to the ground, grabbed the other attorney by his necktie, and threw him to the ground as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331141\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/851/#p852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331141\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/851/#p852\">\n    at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Mannie\n   </em>\n   exemplifies the \"truly rare\" case in which jury instructions provide insufficient protection to the right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331141\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/851/#p852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331141\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/851/#p852\">\n    at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance at the guilt phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying Kadamovas's requests for sequential penalty phases. Like a joint trial, a joint penalty phase is favored for efficiency and fairness, even though it raises a potential risk to the individualized consideration due each capital defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tipton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047928\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/861/#p892\">\n    90 F.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 892-93 (4th Cir. 1996) (finding joint penalty hearing was not an abuse of discretion). Kadamovas argues he was prejudiced during the penalty phase by Mikhel's continued absence from court, evidence of Mikhel's suicide attempts, the disparity in his mitigation case versus Mikhel's, and the government's presentation of evidence and arguments as to both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   While it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the court to conduct sequential penalty phases before the same jury, it also was not an abuse of discretion to order a joint penalty phase. None of the issues raised by Kadamovas show the type of manifest prejudice or risk to individualized consideration that would be required to vacate his sentence on this ground. In this regard, we note that the jury rendered\n   separate verdicts and made individualized findings and recommendations as to each defendant. Moreover, the district court's penalty-phase instructions required the jury to give individualized consideration to each defendant, which adequately mitigated any risk of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152797\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/1199/#p1245\">\n    388 F.3d at 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We have repeatedly held that a district court's careful and frequent limiting instructions to the jury ... can reduce or eliminate any possibility of prejudice arising from a joint trial.\");\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047928\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/861/#p892\">\n    90 F.3d at 892-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"frequent instructions on the need to give each defendant's case individualized consideration sufficed to reduce the risk to acceptable levels\" in joint capital penalty hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   12.

The government objected, and the district court ruled the line of cross-examination irrelevant. Mikhel then proffered a letter from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio stating that a member of Jose Avila's family had once threatened an unnamed \"potential witness\" by saying \"We know where you are and where your family lives.\" Mikhel's counsel told the court he \"assume[d]\" the letter was about Walsh. The court again sustained the government's objection to the proffered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) permits cross-examination of a witness on prior conduct bearing on his or her character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.

Kadamovas's theory of the proposed testimony's relevance was speculative, attenuated, and convoluted. Other legitimate interests easily outweighed the testimony's minimal probative value-particularly, legitimate interests in avoiding undue delay and preventing a trial-within-a-trial\n   on unrelated events surrounding Avila's drug trafficking offense and purported threats in connection with proceedings in Ohio. The district court did not err under either Rule 608(b) or the Confrontation Clause in excluding this line of cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Kadamovas also challenges the district court's admittance of a letter concerning Mikhel's escape plans. The escape conspiracy was discovered on March 7, 2003, and Kadamovas withdrew from the conspiracy no later than March 17, 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over a week later, on March 26, 2003, Mikhel asked a prison guard to pass Kadamovas a magazine in which he had hidden the letter now at issue. The guard seized the letter, and Kadamovas never saw it. The letter outlined steps Mikhel wanted Kadamovas to take to communicate with other prisoners and stated: \"[L]et's start putting into motion my big bluff. Out of concern for security, for now I won't describe the details to you. I'm just asking you to do everything exactly as laid out below. We've made enough mistakes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Generally, out-of-court statements are admissible for the truth of the matter asserted if \"made by the party's coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Kadamovas argues Mikhel's letter was inadmissible because \"once a party withdraws from a conspiracy subsequent statements by a coconspirator do not fall within this exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nerlinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825736\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/967/#p974\">\n    862 F.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 974 (2d Cir. 1988). The government responds that the conspiracy had revived by the time of Mikhel's letter. The problem with the government's argument, however, is that there is no proof of the conspiracy reviving other than the contested hearsay. We may consider contested hearsay in determining whether the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) exemption applies, but there must also be \"some evidence, aside from the proffered statements, of the existence of the conspiracy and the defendant's involvement.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gordon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548901\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/1397/#p1402\">\n    844 F.2d 1397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1402 (9th Cir. 1988). Here, Mikhel's letter was the only evidence of an ongoing conspiracy to escape after Kadamovas's withdrawal. The letter was therefore inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   In any five-month trial involving dozens of witnesses and hundreds of exhibits, there is likely to be some evidentiary error. Our question on review is whether that evidentiary error was harmless-i.e., whether, absent the error, it remains \"clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Velarde-Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9472040\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/1023/#p1034\">\n    269 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, we have no doubt the admission of Mikhel's letter was harmless, as the letter was merely cumulative of other evidence linking Kadamovas to the conspiracy. Avila testified he went to Kadamovas's cell in \"Nine South\" to talk with Mikhel through the air vents and that Kadamovas \"pretty much told me a little bit about like one of the plans and he just mentioned that-like behind his pillow that he was supposed to like make a hole and they were supposed to squeeze out of there and they were all supposed to go out into the stairwell and meet at a certain time.\" Parker, a fellow inmate, testified he heard Mikhel communicating through the air vents in a foreign language with someone on \"Nine South.\" Coconspirator Sabrina Tuinan testified she obtained four cellphones, three of which were for Mikhel, her husband, and her brother-in-law. Though she was not certain, she believed the fourth phone was for \"the other Juri,\" i.e., Jurijus Kadamovas. Prison records\n   showed Mikhel had sent money to Krylov, Avila, Cook, and Kadamovas-all members of the conspiracy. And inmate housing records showed that Kadamovas managed to be reassigned to a cell adjacent to the stairway the conspirators intended to use for their escape. In light of this evidence, the erroneous admission of Mikhel's letter did not impact Kadamovas's conviction for conspiring to escape custody. Nor could it have impacted his death sentence for the reasons we explain in our discussion of the penalty phase below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   13. Kadamovas's access to a computer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Kadamovas claims the government breached its stipulation with him regarding his access to discovery materials on a computer. He requests a remand \"for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the stipulation was violated and, if so, the appropriate remedy.\" \"Stipulations freely and voluntarily entered into in criminal trials are as binding and enforceable as those entered into in civil actions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He moved the district court to order that he be granted access to a computer for ten hours a day. The parties entered into a stipulation by which Kadamovas withdrew his motion based on the prison warden's representation that \"Mr. Kadamovas will, to the maximum practicable extent, be granted daily access to his laptop computer, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.\" The stipulation was expressly subject to the MDC's safety, security, management, and operational needs. Significantly, Kadamovas was a high security inmate housed in MDC's Secure Housing Unit and required three guards to be present during all of his movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   In March 2006, Kadamovas filed a renewed motion with the district court claiming he was receiving insufficient computer access and requesting leave to use a computer in his cell. The court heard argument on the motion and denied Kadamovas's request, explaining that Kadamovas \"always had an opportunity to review this material, and he's chosen not to do it.\" Three months into trial, after continued complaints about insufficient computer access, the court ordered that Kadamovas be permitted computer access in his cell fourteen hours a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The district court did not clearly err in finding that Kadamovas was receiving sufficient computer access in accordance with that contemplated by the stipulation. A detailed declaration from Federal Bureau of Prisons Supervisory Attorney Eliezer Ben-Shmuel attested that Kadamovas had regular computer access but was often not using it. The declaration attached prison records approving Kadamovas's various requests to use his computer. Isolated incidents of Kadamovas being denied computer access were consistent with the stipulation's terms providing that access was \"subject to the safety, security, management and operational needs\" of MDC. In short, the record supports the district court's determination that there was no pattern of Kadamovas being denied computer access in violation of the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Penalty Phase\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   As we find no reversible error in the guilt phase, we proceed to considering the penalty phase.

Model Crim. Jury Instr. 9th Cir. 3.5. The court quoted the instruction nearly verbatim, adapting it only slightly to refer to aggravating factors rather than guilt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced that an aggravating factor exists. It is not required that the government prove the existence of an aggravating factor beyond all possible doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason and common sense and is not based purely on speculation. It may arise from a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or from a lack of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Defendants did not object to the instruction in the penalty phase, so we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Defendants contend that using the model instruction to describe the government's burden of proof on aggravating factors-particularly, future dangerousness-was error because aggravating factors inherently contemplate \"speculative inquiries and speculative evidence.\" The Supreme Court recently observed that the future dangerousness inquiry is not a determination of \"historical fact,\" but \"a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Buck v.

The instruction, however, left no room for jurors to unreasonably speculate in making any finding favoring the government. The instruction clearly explained that \"[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced\n   that an aggravating factor exists.\" This correctly stated the government's burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To the extent defendants claim the government's statement erroneously asked jurors to\n   <em>\n    entirely ignore\n   </em>\n   the proffered mitigating factors, their claim is belied by the very statement they quote, which begins \"When you consider each of these mitigating factors....\" If defendants' contention is rather with the government's separation into two steps of whether a mitigating factor \"justif[ies] a lesser sentence\" and what \"weight\" to give that factor, their argument is still unavailing. As explained above, the FDPA requires the jury to determine whether aggravating factors \"sufficiently outweigh\" mitigating factors \"to justify a sentence of death.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

For instance, the government argued that defendants' life in prison must be measured \"against the five lives, the five lifetimes of days that have been ripped away;\" that defendants will \"get three square meals a day,\" while \"[t]he last thing that Meyer Muscatel tasted in his life was that boot cover that was shoved in his mouth;\" that defendants' \"privileges\" of watching cable television or reading books in prison are things the victims \"only wished they could do;\" and that the jury should show no mercy to defendants because defendants showed none to their victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   These statements should never have been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecutor should not have made several comments, such as \"Mitchell gets to come before the jury and say 'Spare my life.' ...

While the government was surely permitted to argue prison life was less dire than defendants made it out to be, the government should not have done so by comparing life in\n   prison to the victims' deaths. The comparison was not necessary to rebut defendants' arguments and appears to have been calculated to unnecessarily inflame the passions of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   That said, we cannot conclude that the government's statements so \"affected the jury's ability to consider the totality of the evidence fairly that it tainted the verdict and deprived [defendants] of a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3840164\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/1252/#p1257\">\n    659 F.3d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , the comments here \"were not, in and of themselves, nearly as inflammatory as the graphic evidence of the murders, or as powerful as the extensive victim impact testimony, which was quite properly before the jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 995-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecutor's comments were not plain error).

Instruction and verdict form on future dangerousness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Defendants claim the jury instruction and verdict form on the non-statutory aggravating factor of future dangerousness violated due process and impermissibly intruded on the jury's role as fact finder.

Defendants initially submitted a proposed future-dangerousness jury instruction that closely tracked the language in the government's notice and specifically referred to the government's three methods of proof. The government submitted a substantially identical proposed jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   At the jury charge conference, however, defense counsel changed course and objected to the district court's future-dangerousness instruction on two grounds. First, defense counsel argued the factor should be limited to future dangerousness\n   <em>\n    in federal prison.\n   </em>\n   The court agreed and altered the factor to read \"Future Dangerousness of Defendant If Confined To A Federal Prison For The Rest Of His Life Without The Possibility Of Release.\" Second, defense counsel argued that the government's three allegations concerning the defendants' future dangerousness-continuing pattern of violence, escape risk and institutional misconduct, and lack of remorse-should not appear anywhere in the instruction or verdict form. The court rejected this argument, and the final verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   <em>\n    Instructions\n   </em>\n   : For each of the following questions, answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the five numbered questions below. (You need not answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the lettered statements contained in question number 1, which merely describe the government's allegation of how the existence of a non-statutory aggravating factor would be demonstrated.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-280\">\n   1. Future Dangerousness of Defendant If Confined To A Federal Prison For The Rest Of His Life Without The Possibility Of Release. Do you, the jury, unanimously find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of\n   others, including one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-281\">\n   a. Continuing Pattern of Violence. The defendant has engaged in a continuing pattern of violence, attempted violence, and threatened violence, including, at least, the crimes charged in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-282\">\n   b. Escape Risk and Institutional Misconduct. The defendant poses a future danger to the lives and safety of other persons, as demonstrated by his escape risk and institutional misconduct, including, at least: defendant's participation in a conspiracy to escape from the Metropolitan Detention Center Los Angeles, California, which was detected by the government on or about March 7, 2003, and charged as Count Six in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   c. Lack of Remorse. The defendant has demonstrated a lack of remorse for the capital offenses committed in this case, as indicated by his statements and actions during the course of and following the offenses alleged in the Second Superseding Indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-284\">\n   ANSWER TO SECTION IV, QUESTION NUMBER 1:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-285\">\n   Yes ____\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   No ____\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   The final jury instruction on future dangerousness used substantially identical language but substituted \"as evidenced by, at least, one or more of the following\" for \"including one or more of the following.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Defendants' challenge on appeal centers on the three lettered subheadings describing the government's future-dangerousness allegations. In the penalty phase, Kadamovas presented Dr. Mark Cunningham as an expert regarding future dangerousness in prison. Dr. Cunningham described several statistical studies of violence in prisons. Among other things, he opined that, even though a conviction for conspiring to escape is \"a warning factor,\" \"[h]istory of escape ... does not seem to be reliably predictive of violence in prison;\" that \"community violence [outside of prison] is not a reliable predictor of prison violence;\" and that given the prevalence of \"antisocial personality disorder\" and repeat offenses among prisoners, \"remorse is not going to tell you anything about who's likely to be violent in prison.\" Dr. Cunningham concluded that Kadamovas was \"quite unlikely to commit acts of serious violence [if] confined for life in federal prison,\" especially in light of his age, his lack of serious violence during pretrial custody, the low rate of serious violence among capital offenders, and the low rate of serious violence in U.S. penitentiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Based on Dr. Cunningham's testimony, defendants argued to the jury that none of the three lettered subheadings listed in the jury instruction and verdict form could predict future dangerousness. Defendants now contend that the instruction and verdict form prevented the jury from crediting their argument and therefore amounted to a \"permissive inference instruction\" that violated due process or, at least, was an abuse of the district court's discretion in formulating instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   \"A permissive inference instruction allows, but does not require, a jury to infer a specified conclusion if the government proves certain predicate facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513670\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/890/#p897\">\n    25 F.3d at 897-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (addressing the instruction \"If it is shown that the defendant used a deadly weapon ..., then you may find, ... the existence of the malice\").

Although defendants claim the government forfeited harmlessness on this issue, the FDPA requires that a \"court of appeals shall not reverse or vacate a sentence of death on account of any error which can be harmless, including any erroneous special finding of an aggravating factor, where the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203595\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). We have held that even where the government does not argue harmlessness, \"we are not foreclosed from considering prejudice ourselves. Indeed, under the FDPA we\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   consider whether error in a sentence of death is harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). In particular, \"we may overlook the government's failure to mount a harmless error argument when ... considerations of length and complexity of the record, certainty of how harmless the error is, and the consequences of reversal ('protracted, costly, and ultimately futile proceedings in the district court') counsel in favor of doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    at 977-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These reasons strongly support a harmlessness inquiry in this case. Furthermore, it is not even clear that the government forfeited harmlessness in this case. Harmlessness was a consistent theme in the government's voluminous answering brief, and though the government did not make a full harmless-error argument with respect to the specific instruction and verdict form at issue here, it correctly noted that any error in this regard was subject \"to a harmless error review.\" \"[T]he rule of waiver is a discretionary one,\"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

The evidence of defendants' future dangerousness was overwhelming and included the brutal manner in which they killed Muscatel, Pekler, Umansky, Kharabadze, and Safiev in four separate incidents over the course of four months; the cold and premeditated nature of their crimes (including stopping for dinner on the way to dispose of Umansky's body); and their demonstrable indifference to their victims' suffering (e.g., Mikhel saying Safiev and Pekler were as difficult to kill as snakes, and Kadamovas laughing about throwing a \"fat Jew\" off a bridge). The evidence showed not only defendants' violent actions but that they had announced their intention to continue taking and killing hostages for financial gain. Once they had been arrested and jailed, Mikhel and Kadamovas carefully plotted their escape from prison-a plan that involved other prisoners and that acknowledged they might have to kill guards on the way out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mikhel later devised a second, solo escape plan despite\n   the Special Administrative Measures used to secure him. That plan showed similar sophistication and a willingness to involve criminal organizations with resources outside the jail.

Four of those factors were statutory: death during commission of another crime, procurement of offense by payment, substantial planning and premeditation, and multiple killings.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). To those the government added five more non-statutory factors: contemporaneous convictions for multiple offenses, witness elimination, emotional suffering of the victims, victim impact, and future dangerousness. Under the FDPA, the jury had to find at least one of the statutory factors to recommend the death penalty, and it had to make a specific and unanimous finding as to any statutory factor found to exist.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   By unanimous vote, the jury found the existence of\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   aggravating factor the government presented, both statutory and non-statutory.

We can be confident that any alleged error in the instruction on the single non-statutory factor of future dangerousness would not have changed the verdicts; even if the jury had not concluded that defendants presented a risk of future danger, it would still have had eight independent reasons (four statutory and four non-statutory) to impose the death penalty and no reasons not to impose it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (claimed error respecting aggravating factor was harmless; \"the jury found five other statutory aggravating factors; only one is required ...

Given the circumstances of this case, we have no question the jury would have returned a finding of future dangerousness and a recommendation of death even if the instruction and verdict had not listed the government's three future-dangerousness allegations. In sum, even if we thought there was some flaw in the instructions, the callous and heinous nature of the defendants' crimes, their disregard for life, and their utter lack of remorse, would \"compel[ ] [us] to conclude ... that it is not reasonably probable that even one juror would have held out for a life sentence over death.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

First, defendants point to the government's statements that they never \"expressed remorse,\" arguing that the jury inevitably understood the government as referring to their failure to express remorse\n   <em>\n    while testifying\n   </em>\n   . Taken in context of the government's entire closing argument, these statements clearly referred not to defendants' failure to testify but to their conduct during, and in the months after, the killings. For example, the government argued: \"You heard about the\n   <em>\n    actions\n   </em>\n   that these defendants took after each of their killings,\n   <em>\n    up to and including the escape attempts\n   </em>\n   . They've never shown remorse.\" Statements such as this did not violate defendants' Fifth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beardslee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294676\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/560/#p586\">\n    358 F.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Second, defendants challenge the government's statements comparing their lack of remorse to Altmanis's decision to confess and cooperate. According to defendants, these statements suggested they lacked remorse by failing to testify. The statements, however, were made in the context of comparing the coconspirators' conduct. For example, the government argued: \"[W]hat I would ask you to do, ladies and gentlemen, is to compare; compare Ainar Altmanis; compare his\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   with that of Jurijus Kadamovas.\" The government also noted that \"[Altmanis] led the FBI to bodies they never would have found in this case.\" This was relevant not only to establishing Mikhel and Kadamovas's lack of remorse but to rebutting one of their proffered mitigating factors-i.e., that Altmanis was \"equally culpable in the crime\" but would not be punished by death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). Because none of the government's statements in this regard would \"naturally and necessarily\" be understood as commenting on defendants' failure to testify, there was no\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   error.\n   <em>\n    Beardslee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294676\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/358/560/#p586\">\n    358 F.3d at 586-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Relatedly, Mikhel claims the same two categories of statements invited the jury to consider his stricken testimony, thereby violating the district court's order striking that testimony and amounting to prosecutorial misconduct. For the same reasons given above, the government's statements regarding Mikhel's lack of remorse and Altmanis's cooperation clearly referred to the coconspirators' respective conduct during and following the killings. The statements did not refer to Mikhel's testimony and thus neither violated the district court's order that the testimony be stricken nor constituted prosecutorial misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   6. Examination of Dr. Mark Cunningham\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Kadamovas presented expert testimony from Dr. Cunningham regarding statistical violence rates in prison. While cross-examining Dr. Cunningham, the government asked the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   Q. I'd like to ask you some questions about the features that you accounted for in your base rate studies in reaching your assessment about Defendant Kadamovas?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   A. Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   Q.

I do not know the ethnic origins of the individuals in these studies....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   The government then proceeded to ask Dr. Cunningham about whether his studies accounted for inmates who committed more than one murder, committed murder with premeditation, or were in their mid-30s. The clear intent of these questions was to suggest that Dr. Cunningham's studies were not tailored to Mikhel or Kadamovas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Kadamovas characterizes the government's question about persons of Russian or Lithuanian origin as an appeal to ethnic prejudice that violated his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial. Although he concedes that Dr. Cunningham did not substantively answer the question, he argues that \"the mere question, with its improper implication, constituted misconduct.\" Neither defendant objected to the question below, so we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Kadamovas relies principally on our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Bains v.

The district court excluded the interview entirely, reasoning that Karagodina was being led by the investigator's questions, lacked first-hand knowledge on some issues, gave irrelevant testimony about Mikhel's arrest and her feelings toward the police, and could have traveled from England to the United States to testify in person. To this list of reasons to exclude the interview, the government adds that much of what Karagodina said in 2002 was no longer true by the time the penalty phase began in 2007. The government cites a 2005 interview in which Karagodina called Mikhel a \"scary man\" and said that he had threatened her, that she had switched phone numbers because of him, and that she had changed her daughter's last name from \"Mikhel\" to \"Karagodina.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Parts of the Karagodina interview spoke to Mikhel's character and background and thus were at least marginally relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203592\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).

As the district court explained, many of Karagodina's statements \"were, at best, gratuitous remarks or coached answers by defense investigators.\" Moreover, had the interview been admitted, the government would have had no opportunity to cross-examine Karagodina on her alleged involvement in Mikhel's crimes and bring to light her changed attitude toward Mikhel.

To be merciful, to be merciful.\" It seems Edward did not know Mikhel well, and defense counsel conceded Edward had not seen Mikhel for years.

Kadamovas's future dangerousness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Kadamovas claims the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find that he presented a risk of future dangerousness if confined to prison. As described above, Kadamovas offered Dr. Cunningham as an expert witness on future dangerousness. Dr. Cunningham presented statistical studies of violence rates in prisons and opined that Kadamovas was \"quite unlikely to commit acts of serious violence [if] confined for life in federal prison,\" given his age, his lack of serious violence during pretrial custody, the low rate of serious violence among capital offenders, and the low rate of serious violence in U.S. penitentiaries. Kadamovas now argues that, in light of Dr. Cunningham's purportedly \"unrebutted\" testimony, there was no basis for the jury to find against him with respect to the non-statutory aggravating factor of future dangerousness. We review for whether any rational trier of fact could have found this factor beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nevils\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221363\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1158/#p1163\">\n    598 F.3d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163-64 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Kadamovas simply overlooks the fact that the government's penalty-phase case incorporated all of its guilt-phase evidence, which included the gruesome means by which Kadamovas participated in killing five people; his callous remarks about the victims; his statement that he would continue taking hostages even if it meant piling bodies up to the surface of the reservoir; and his conviction for conspiring to escape custody. There was no shortage of evidence suggesting that Kadamovas presented a risk of future dangerousness if confined to prison. Although the government did not present its own expert to contradict Dr. Cunningham, it was not required to do so. The jury did not have to find Dr. Cunningham's statistical studies or opinion testimony persuasive. Dr. Cunningham\n   presented statistics related to the probability that persons with certain characteristics would be dangerous in the future. He did not, and could not, testify that Kadamovas would not be dangerous in the future. The jury could certainly have found that Kadamovas's own conduct was more probative of his future dangerousness than Dr. Cunningham's statistics about future dangerousness generally. Thus, the jury could have reasonably relied on the government's guilt-phase evidence to conclude that Kadamovas presented a risk of future dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   9. Nazi and anti-Semitism evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Kadamovas claims the government improperly introduced \"Nazism and anti-Semitism evidence\" and prejudicially portrayed him \"as an anti-Semitic Nazi sympathizer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, he argues the admission of (1) an antique dagger with swastikas on the handle and (2) testimony that he described a victim as a \"fat Jew,\" along with the government's references to that testimony during argument, violated his constitutional and statutory rights. As Kadamovas only objected to the dagger below, we review the first challenge for abuse of discretion, and the second challenge for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5523850\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/931/#p967\">\n    502 F.3d at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Coconspirator Krylov purchased the dagger at Mikhail Gurevich's pawn shop, which defendants used to launder ransom money. Later, the FBI found the dagger at Kadamovas's home. Over Kadamovas's objection, the court ruled the dagger relevant and admissible to connect him to the money-laundering conspiracy. Kadamovas requested that the government \"not focus or highlight the swastika on the dagger,\" and the court agreed the prosecution should not do so. As a result, the prosecution never used the words \"Nazi\" or \"swastika\" before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   The dagger was admitted through the testimony of an FBI agent who referred only to its \"distinct markings.\" Weeks later, Gurevich testified and mentioned the swastikas on the handle in identifying the dagger as the one Krylov had purchased. The court denied Kadamovas's motion for a mistrial based on this testimony, noting there was no risk of prejudice as the dagger had been introduced into evidence and the jurors would see it when given the exhibits. Kadamovas did not ask for a limiting instruction or object to the dagger's consideration during the penalty phase, during which it was never mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   The dagger was relevant to prove the existence of a conspiracy to commit money laundering and admissible under both the Federal Rules of Evidence and the FDPA. The district court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the evidence's probative value against its potential for unfair prejudice, and minimized any potential prejudice by instructing the government not to refer directly to the swastikas-which the government did not do at any time. The only mention of the swastikas to the jury came from Gurevich, who did so in the context of explaining why he was able to identify the knife from Kadamovas's house as the one he had sold years before to Krylov (a fact to which Kadamovas did not stipulate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Kadamovas also argues that admitting the dagger implicated his First Amendment rights. His argument is perplexing because he does not claim to hold any protected belief or association regarding Nazism, but rather denies he is a Nazi sympathizer. Regardless, his argument is\n   without merit. In\n   <em>\n    Dawson v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that admitting evidence relating to the defendant's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood that was \"totally without relevance\" violated the defendant's First Amendment right to association.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223309\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/159/#p165\">\n    503 U.S. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223309\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/159/#p165\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223309\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/159/#p165\">\n    117 L.Ed.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n   <em>\n    Dawson\n   </em>\n   concluded that \"the Constitution does not erect a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment,\" but that such evidence must be relevant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223309\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/159/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the dagger was relevant to Kadamovas's participation in the conspiracy, and Gurevich's testimony was relevant to the dagger's identification. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   We turn next to Kadamovas's challenge to Markovskis's testimony that he referred to a victim as a \"fat Jew.\" In the guilt phase, Markovskis testified that Kadamovas laughingly described throwing a \"fat Jew\" (i.e., Muscatel) off a bridge. Markovskis said Kadamovas \"didn't mention the name of the person, he described him only as a fat Jew, fat, heavy person.\" The government briefly referred to this testimony in its guilt and penalty-phase opening statements and closing arguments. It was not plain error to admit Markovskis's testimony, which was relevant to identifying Muscatel as Kadamovas's unnamed victim. Similarly, the government's reasonable repetition of Kadamovas's words was permissible to argue both Kadamovas's connection to Muscatel's death and his lack of remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Contrary to defendants' assertions, the government did not use Markovskis's testimony to inflame the passions of the jury or as improper propensity evidence. While a prosecutor's \"appeal[ ] to racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice\" against a defendant violates the Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial,\n   <em>\n    Cabrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11242449\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/590/#p594\">\n    222 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , no such appeal was made here in eliciting testimony from a coconspirator that connected Kadamovas to one of the charged acts and bore on an aggravating factor. We have also recognized that \"race or ethnicity is relevant and\n   <em>\n    not prejudicial\n   </em>\n   \" when used for identification purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11242449\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/590/#p594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11242449\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/590/#p594\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It was therefore not plain error to allow Markovskis's testimony or the government's references to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   10. Kadamovas's mitigating factors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Kadamovas proffered nine mitigating factors, including the statutory mitigating factor that he had no prior criminal record (which he claims the government conceded below).

The letter does not prove that Kadamovas had no prior criminal record. It only showed that one agency in his home country had no such record; it said nothing about the reliability of the evidence or its implications for records in other jurisdictions. Furthermore, the government did not concede the point: at most, the prosecutor said it was \"[m]aybe\" true Kadamovas had no record, \"but he sure made up for lost time.\" Defendants bore the burden of proving mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203593\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and a reasonable trier of fact could have found that Kadamovas failed to prove he had no prior criminal record,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722510\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/385/#p426\">\n    735 F.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Speculation is insufficient to show arbitrary influence; there must be some basis for concluding that emotion rather than reason swayed the jury.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   11.
