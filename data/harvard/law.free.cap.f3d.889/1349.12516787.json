First, as the Court held in\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1400(b) itself was not intended to apply to alien defendants. Second, nothing in the 2011 amendments to \u00a7 1391 changed this understanding of \u00a7 1400(b). Third, against the historical background leading up to and including\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   , the 2011 amendments do not sufficiently indicate an intent to make venue protections applicable to alien defendants, with a limited exception not relevant here-applicable to natural persons who are aliens but have been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. Fourth, Petitioner's contrary view would make some foreign corporations that infringe a U.S. patent unamenable to domestic suit even though personal jurisdiction exists-a gap we cannot conclude Congress created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the outset, the patent venue statute was not intended to supplant the longstanding rule that the venue laws do not protect alien defendants.\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    406 U.S. at 711-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For \u00a7 1391(d) is properly regarded, not as a venue restriction at all, but rather as a declaration of the long-established rule that suits against aliens are wholly outside the operation of all the federal venue laws, general and special.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    at 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus held that the alien defendant in that case, a foreign corporation like Petitioner here, could not use \u00a7 1400(b) as a shield against suit in a particular district court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, while \u00a7 1400(b) governs venue in patent cases, it governs only to displace otherwise-applicable venue standards, not where there are no such standards due to the alien-venue rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Given that \u00a7 1400(b) itself does not provide an exception to the alien-venue rule, we next ask whether the 2011 amendments to the general venue statute somehow altered the meaning of \u00a7 1400(b) so as to change how the alien-venue rule applies in patent cases. As Petitioner concedes, \"absent from the House Judiciary Committee report is any discussion or even mention of patent cases such as\n   <em>\n    Fourco\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   and the interplay between those decisions and the amendments to the general venue statute.\" Pet'r's Br. 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no indication Congress intended to modify the alien-venue rule specifically for patent cases. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   's holding that \u00a7 1400(b) does not govern suits against aliens still applies at least where other venue standards remain inapplicable to aliens-which, as we next conclude, is true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Petitioner's final argument is that the reasoning underlying\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   -that aliens fall outside the venue laws entirely-has been abrogated by the 2011 amendments. Pet'r's Br. 22. Therefore, the argument goes, because the set of venue laws, general and special, now apply to alien defendants, and because \u00a7 1400(b) is the sole and exclusive provision governing patent venue, HTC should be able to use \u00a7 1400(b) as a venue defense. In other words, HTC argues that Congress intended to discard the well-established alien-venue rule in favor of generally bringing alien defendants, including foreign corporations like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Hohorst\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   , within the protection of the venue laws. We find no such intent. The textual changes made to \u00a7 1391 in 2011 no more support an inference of the suggested radical displacement of the\n   <em>\n    Hohorst\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   rule than did the textual changes\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   held inadequate to displace the\n   <em>\n    Fourco\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the outset, it is important to note the broad implications of Petitioner's argument. A holding that the 2011 amendments altogether discarded the alien-venue rule would extend far beyond patent law and would impact other types of civil cases. Given that this would be a sea change in federal venue law, we expect Congress would make its intent clear, if indeed this was its intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Congress made only one clear change to the alien-venue rule in 2011. That was only a modest adjustment limited to natural persons. Congress did not clearly make-and did not otherwise express an intent to make-a change to the rule as it affects foreign corporations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In light of certain inconsistencies in how the term \"resides\" had been interpreted,\n   Congress enacted the current versions of \u00a7 1391(c)(1)-(2) to include express definitions of residency for natural persons and for unincorporated entities (in addition to residency for corporations, which had previously been defined).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 112-10, at 20-21 (2011) (\"House Report\") (noting that some courts had extended the definition of a natural person's residence, for venue purposes, beyond the person's domicile to potentially include the location of a summer home; and noting a split of authority regarding venue for unincorporated associations). Congress also made two other specific changes regarding venue as to natural persons. First, Congress altered how permanent residents (who are, nonetheless, \"aliens\") should be treated for venue purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (\"[T]he proposed statute would grant a venue defense to permanent resident aliens who are domiciled in the United States.\"). Second, Congress removed venue protections for U.S. citizens domiciled abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1391(c)(3) ; House Report at 22 (\"This would mean that aliens and United States citizens domiciled abroad could not claim a venue defense to the location of litigation. Prohibiting United States citizens domiciled abroad from raising a venue defense would be a change in current law.\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   14D Charles A. Wright et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3810 (4th ed. Apr. 2018 update).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Congress thus slightly modified the well-established alien-venue rule in one respect. It granted venue protection to alien natural persons having permanent resident status. \u00a7 1391(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, it aligned the venue laws with the already-existing treatment of permanent resident aliens for certain jurisdictional purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Report at 23 (noting that the version of \u00a7 1332(a) in existence at the time already recognized that \"permanent resident aliens may be viewed as citizens of their state of domicile for certain jurisdictional purposes\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1988) ; Wright,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3810 (\"Since 1988, Section 1332(a)(2) has defined permanent resident aliens as citizens of the states in which they are domiciled for purposes of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. It made little sense not to do the same regarding their residence for venue purposes.\"). This minor change with respect to one discrete class of individuals is insufficient to upend the centuries-old rule that the venue laws do not protect alien defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is no comparable change with respect to foreign corporations. Petitioner relies on \u00a7 1391(c)(2) and the fact that it does not expressly limit itself to domestic entities, and on that basis argues that a foreign corporation now is deemed a resident in the United States wherever it is subject to personal jurisdiction. We are not persuaded. The mere absence of an express foreign-corporation exclusion from \u00a7 1391(c)(2) is not enough to infer the sweeping repudiation of the\n   <em>\n    Hohorst\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   rule that Petitioner's position produces. In fact, the conspicuous absence of any reference to aliens in \u00a7 1391(c)(2) is telling, since the immediately preceding paragraph, \u00a7 1391(c)(1), does expressly refer to aliens, extending venue protections to permanent resident aliens. At the same time, the immediately succeeding paragraph, \u00a7 1391(c)(3), uses broad language to\n   <em>\n    deny\n   </em>\n   venue protection to any \"defendant\n   not resident in the United States,\" with no exclusion of foreign corporations. And the accompanying House Report makes no mention of alien defendants being included in \u00a7 1391(c)(2). Quite the contrary-the House Report emphasizes that aliens will remain\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   a venue defense. House Report at 22 (discussing the shift from alienage to residency and stating \"[t]his would mean that aliens and United States citizens domiciled abroad could not claim a venue defense to the location of litigation\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[F]or a party resident abroad, whether a natural person\n   <em>\n    or a corporation\n   </em>\n   , any venue privilege against suit in a particular Federal district court would be eliminated\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, Petitioner contends that former \u00a7 1391(d) was not merely recodified in \u00a7 1391(c)(3). In light of the changes Congress implemented through the 2011 amendments, however, it is evident why former \u00a7 1391(d) had to be reformulated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Report at 23 (\"[T]he deletion of the current language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), combined with the proposed amendment to paragraph 1391(c)(1), would also permit permanent resident aliens domiciled in the United States to raise a venue defense.\").

Pet'r's Br. 9-10. It attempts to gloss over this problem, however, by arguing that no gap would exist in this case, as HTC Corporation's subsidiary, HTC America, is a resident of Washington, and venue for HTC Corporation could reasonably be based on where venue is proper for its subsidiary. Pet'r's Br. 10. But, even assuming we could completely disregard the corporate form in this case, there would still be cases, as Petitioner concedes, where a venue gap exists (because, under Petitioner's theory, \u00a7 1400(b) displaces \u00a7 1391(b), (c) ). While Petitioner contends that abiding by\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   creates a \"loophole\" for a plaintiff to forum shop,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet'r's Br. 11, that has always been the case. Meanwhile, Petitioner's argument\n   creates a far more unsatisfactory loophole-a complete inability for a patent owner to bring its infringement claims against alien defendants that fall outside the non-residence-based clause of \u00a7 1400(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    406 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   710 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173297\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/706/#p706\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps....
