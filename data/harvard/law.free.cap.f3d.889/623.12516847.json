(collectively \"Corona\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sali and Spriggs moved for certification of seven classes of Registered Nurses (\"RNs\") they allege were underpaid by Corona as a result of certain employment policies and practices. The district court denied certification on the basis that (1) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)'s typicality requirement is not satisfied for any of the proposed classes because Sali and Spriggs failed to submit admissible evidence of their injuries; (2) Plaintiff Spriggs and proposed class counsel have not demonstrated they will adequately represent the proposed classes; and (3) several proposed classes fail to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement. Because the district court abused its discretion by relying on each of these reasons to deny class certification, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Corona operates a hospital in Southern California that employs hourly-wage RNs. Sali and Spriggs are RNs formerly employed by Corona. They assert that a number of Corona's employment policies and practices with respect to RNs violate California law and have resulted in underpayment of wages. They filed this putative\n   class action in California State Court on behalf of \"all RNs employed by Defendants in California at any time during the Proposed Class Period who (a) were not paid all wages at their regular rate of pay; (b) not paid time and a-half and/or double time for all overtime hours worked; and (c) denied uninterrupted, 'off-duty' meal-and-rest periods.\" They allege Corona violated California law by (1) failing to pay all regular hourly wages; (2) failing to pay time-and-a-half for all overtime; (3) failing to pay double time for all hours worked in excess of twelve hours in a day; (4) not providing compliant meal and rest breaks; (5) failing to timely pay all wages due to separated former employees within seventy-two hours of separation; and (6) failing to provide accurate itemized wage statements. Corona removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sali and Spriggs moved for certification of the following seven classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Rounding Time Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not paid all wages due them, including straight time, overtime, double time, meal premiums, and rest premiums due to Defendants' rounding time policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Short Shift Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All current and former nurses of Defendants who work or worked pursuant to an Alternative Workweek Schedule (\"AWS\") during the Proposed Class Period who were \"flexed\" between the 8th and 12th hour of work due to low patient census and not paid daily overtime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Meal Period Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All current and former nurses of Defendants who work or worked pursuant to an AWS during the Proposed Class Period who signed an invalid meal period waiver, and (1) not provided a second meal break after 10 hours of work; (2) not provided meal periods before 5 and 10 hours of work; and/or, (3) not provided a second meal period after 12 hours of work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4. Rest Break Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not relieved of all duty and therefore not authorized and permitted to take 10-minute, uninterrupted rest breaks for every four hours worked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Regular Rate Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   All current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not paid at the correct regular rate for overtime, double time, meal premiums, and rest premiums.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   6. Wage Statement Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   All current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not provided pay stubs that complied with Labor Code \u00a7 226.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   7. Waiting Time Class:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   All former nurses who worked for Defendants from August 23, 2010 who were not paid all wages due at the time of separation from their employment with Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court denied certification of each of the proposed classes on multiple grounds. First, the district court concluded that Sali and Spriggs's proposed rounding-time, short-shift, rest-break, and wage-statement classes failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement. Second, the district court held that Rule 23(a)'s typicality requirement was not satisfied for any of the proposed classes because Sali and Spriggs failed to submit admissible evidence of their injuries. Third, the district court concluded that\n   Spriggs was not an adequate class representative because she is not a member of the proposed class she is attempting to represent. Finally, the district court held the attorneys from the law firm Bisnar Chase had not demonstrated they will adequately serve as class counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sali and Spriggs appealed the district court's denial of class certification. Upon Sali and Spriggs's motion, we stayed proceedings in this appeal pending resolution in the California State Courts of\n   <em>\n    Gerard v.

Additionally, a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(3) must demonstrate that \"questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hyundai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275250\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/679/#p690\">\n    881 F.3d at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The issues on appeal here concern only Rule 23's typicality, adequacy, and predominance requirements: Sali and Spriggs appeal the district court's determinations that (1) Sali and Spriggs failed to demonstrate their injuries were typical of the proposed classes; (2) plaintiff Spriggs is not an adequate class representative; (3) attorneys from the firm Bisnar Chase have not demonstrated they will adequately serve as class counsel; and (4) the proposed rounding-time, wage-statement, and waiting-time classes fail Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement. We conclude that the district court abused its discretion\n   in each of these determinations, excluding its finding that Spriggs was not an adequate class representative. And because plaintiff Sali remains as a representative plaintiff, Spriggs's inadequacy alone is not a basis to deny class certification. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion by denying certification of the proposed rounding-time, regular-rate, waiting-time, and wage-statement classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The district court's typicality determination was premised on an error of law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court concluded that Sali and Spriggs \"have not carried their burden of demonstrating that the injuries allegedly inflicted by Defendants on Plaintiffs are similar to the injuries of the putative class members because [they] do not offer any admissible evidence of [their] injuries in their motion for class certification.\" The district court further noted that the \"motion does not contain sworn testimony from either of the named Plaintiffs.\" The district court reached this decision after striking the declaration of Javier Ruiz-upon which Sali and Spriggs relied to demonstrate their individual injuries-on the basis that the declaration contained inadmissible evidence. This was error. At this preliminary stage, a district court may not decline to consider evidence solely on the basis that the evidence is inadmissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The district court's decision to strike the Ruiz declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In support of their motion for class certification, Sali and Spriggs submitted a declaration by Javier Ruiz to demonstrate their injuries. Ruiz, a paralegal at Bisnar Chase, reviewed time and payroll records for the named plaintiffs to determine whether they were fully compensated under Corona's rounding-time pay practice, as well as to address several other questions that are no longer at issue on this appeal. The rounding-time practice itself is not disputed. Corona paid RNs an hourly wage based on the time they punched in and out, rounded to the nearest quarter hour. For example, if an RN clocked in at 6:53 a.m. or at 7:07 a.m., his or her time was rounded to 7:00 a.m. Sali and Spriggs allege that this policy, over time, resulted in failure to pay RNs for all of their time worked. To determine the policy's effect on Sali and Spriggs individually, Ruiz used Excel spreadsheets to compare Sali and Spriggs's rounded times with their actual clock-in and clock-out times using a random sampling of timesheets. Ruiz's analysis demonstrated that on average over hundreds of shifts, Corona's rounded time policy undercounted Sali's clock-in and clock-out times by eight minutes per shift and Spriggs's times by six minutes per shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Corona objected to the Ruiz declaration, arguing that (1) the declaration constituted improper lay opinion testimony and must be excluded under Federal Rules of Evidence 701 and 702 ; (2) Ruiz's opinions were unreliable; (3) the declaration lacked foundation and Ruiz lacked personal knowledge of the information analyzed; and (4) the data underlying Ruiz's analysis was unauthenticated hearsay. In reply, Sali and Spriggs submitted declarations attesting to the authenticity and accuracy of the data and conclusions contained in Ruiz's declaration and the attached exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court agreed with Corona's arguments that the Ruiz declaration was inadmissible and struck the declaration on that basis. First, the district court concluded that \"Ruiz cannot authenticate the manipulated Excel Spreadsheets and other data that he relied upon to conduct his analysis because he does not have personal\n   knowledge to attest to the fact that the data accurately represents Plaintiffs' employment records.\" Second, the district court concluded that Ruiz's declaration offered improper opinion testimony. Third, the district court found that Ruiz's \"manipulation and analysis of raw data to reach cumulative conclusions is the technical or specialized work of an expert witness,\" and that Ruiz lacked the qualifications to conduct this analysis. The district court further concluded that the declarations submitted by Sali and Spriggs were new evidence improperly submitted in reply, and the court declined to consider the declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The district court erred by striking the Ruiz declaration on the basis of inadmissibility.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A plaintiff seeking class certification bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating \"through evidentiary proof that the class meets the prerequisites of Rule 23(a).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hyundai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275250\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/679/#p690\">\n    881 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   690 (citing\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    569 U.S. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697046\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/27/#p33\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Corona did not dispute the authenticity of the payroll data underlying Ruiz's analysis, nor did it directly dispute the accuracy of his calculations. Instead, Corona argued that Ruiz's declaration and spreadsheet were inadmissible because Ruiz extracted data without explaining his methods, and the district court agreed. But by relying on admissibility alone as a basis to strike the Ruiz declaration, the district court rejected evidence that likely could have been presented in an admissible form at trial. In fact, when Sali and Spriggs submitted their own sworn declarations to authenticate the payroll data and vouch for its accuracy, the district court again leaned on evidentiary formalism in striking those declarations as \"new evidence\" submitted in reply. That narrow approach tells us nothing about the satisfaction of the typicality requirement-\"whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanon v.

The district court should have considered the declarations of Ruiz, Sali, and Spriggs in determining whether the typicality prerequisite was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   When conducting its \"rigorous analysis\" into whether the Rule 23(a) requirements are met, the district court need not dispense with the standards of admissibility\n   entirely. The court may consider whether the plaintiff's proof is, or will likely lead to, admissible evidence. Indeed, in evaluating challenged expert testimony in support of class certification, a district court should evaluate admissibility under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834680\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/970/#p982\">\n    657 F.3d at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But admissibility must not be dispositive. Instead, an inquiry into the evidence's ultimate admissibility should go to the weight that evidence is given at the class certification stage. This approach accords with our prior guidance that a district court should analyze the \"persuasiveness of the evidence presented\" at the Rule 23 stage.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The district court abused its discretion here by declining to consider the Ruiz declaration solely on the basis of inadmissibility. Because the district court applied the wrong standard for evaluating the plaintiffs' evidence, we do not reach whether the plaintiffs have in fact demonstrated typicality and leave it to the district court to resolve in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Spriggs is not an adequate class representative, but Sali remains as an adequate representative plaintiff.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The district court concluded that plaintiff Spriggs is not an adequate class representative because she is not a member of any class she seeks to represent.

The district court noted that \"attorneys from Bisnar Chase failed to attend any of the depositions of Plaintiffs' putative class witnesses' (four scheduled depositions), failed to produce Plaintiffs' expert, Falkenhagen, for a deposition\n   despite being ordered to do so by a Magistrate Judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, as detailed in the typicality analysis, failed to submit any sworn testimony from Plaintiffs in support of the class certification motion.\" The court also noted that Bisnar Chase submitted nearly identical declarations from twenty-two putative class members attesting to their personal experiences with Corona's employment practices. The district court found that \"Plaintiffs' counsel's 'lax approach' to personalizing declarations, ensuring that declarants knew and understood what they were signing, and verifying the accuracy of the statements is 'unacceptable' conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The district court did not indicate what legal standard it relied on in evaluating the adequacy of class counsel. Moreover, the district court discussed only the apparent errors by counsel with no mention of the evidence in the record demonstrating class counsel's substantial and competent work on this case. Bisnar Chase attorneys have incurred thousands of dollars in costs and invested significant time in this matter, including preparing dozens of interrogatories and requests for production, taking numerous depositions, retaining experts, defending the named plaintiffs' depositions and the deposition of the plaintiffs' expert economist, reviewing and analyzing thousands of documents, interviewing hundreds of class members, obtaining signed declarations, and preparing and filing a motion for class certification. Additionally, attorney Jerusalem Beligan has extensive experience litigating class-action cases in state and federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At this early stage of the litigation, the district court's decision that attorneys from Bisnar Chase could not adequately serve as class counsel was premature and an abuse of discretion.

The district court's determination that individual questions predominated in the claims of the proposed rounding-time class was based on an error of law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the purpose of class certification, the parties do not dispute how Corona's rounding-time pay system worked. Corona used an electronic timekeeping system that tracked when employees clocked in and clocked out and rounded the time to the nearest quarter hour. Corona paid RNs an hourly wage calculated based on that rounded time. For example, if an RN clocked in at 6:53 a.m. or 7:07 a.m., his or her time was rounded to 7:00 a.m. Kronos recorded both actual clock-in and rounded times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Sali and Spriggs allege that Corona's rounding-time policy resulted in systematic underpayment of RNs. They seek certification of a rounding-time class consisting of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   All current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not paid all wages due them, including straight time, overtime, double time, meal premiums, and rest premiums due to Defendants' rounding time policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The district court concluded that individualized issues predominate in determining Corona's liability with respect to the proposed rounding-time class because \"whether [Corona's] rounding policy resulted in the underpayment of the proposed class members, and was thus against California law, depends on individual findings as to whether RNs were actually working when punched in.\" In support of this conclusion, the district court cited Corona's explanation that \"time records are not a reliable indicator of the time RNs actually spent working because RNs frequently clock-in for work and then perform non-compensable activities, such as waiting in the break room, getting coffee, or chatting with their co-workers, until the start of their scheduled shift.\" Thus, the court reasoned, \"determining whether [Corona] underpaid members of the Rounding Time Class would entail factualized inquiries into whether particular RNs were actually working during the grace period, and whether the rounding of time during this period resulted in the underpayment of hours actually worked-the only conduct that is prohibited under California law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Sali and Spriggs first argue that whether RNs were \"actually working\" is a merits question that should not have been considered at the class certification stage. In the alternative, Sali and Spriggs argue that the district court's analysis was based on an error of California law because compensable time is not measured by time employees spend \"actually working.\" Sali and Spriggs's argument that the district court improperly reached a merits question fails because the district court plainly did not attempt to resolve whether RNs were actually working on the merits. Instead, the court merely concluded that, assuming clock-in times were on average rounded up to the shift-start time, individualized questions would predominate in determining whether RNs were \"actually working\" during any period between their clock-in time and the start of their shift.

But the district court erred by assuming that was the only question to be decided. Under California law, the RNs were also actually working if they were subject to Corona's control even if they were not engaging in work activities-for example, if they were required to remain on the hospital premises during that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguilar,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2337532\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/234/21/\">\n    234 Cal.App.3d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234 Cal.Rptr. at 520.

The types of activities RNs generally engaged in during this period are certainly relevant, but the activities of any particular RN are not dispositive of whether he or she was under Corona's control. Determination of this question does not depend on individualized factual questions and is capable of class-wide resolution. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion by denying certification of the rounding-time class on the basis of predominance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The district court's determination that individual questions predominate in the claims of the proposed wage-statement class was premised on legal error.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Corona issued wage statements to RNs that listed the employer as Corona Regional Medical Center, rather than Corona's corporate name, UHS-Corona, Inc. Sali and Spriggs allege this violated California law and seek certification of a class consisting of \"[a]ll current and former nurses who work or worked for Defendants during the Proposed Class Period who were not provided pay stubs that complied with Labor Code \u00a7 226.\" The district court concluded that this proposed wage-statement class failed Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement because \"demonstrating that each class member was damaged by the claimed inaccuracy in the wage statement is a critical individualized issue in determining liability that is not amenable to common systems of proof.\" In doing so, the district court noted that it agreed with Corona's argument that \"common issues do not predominate 'because, in order to determine liability, each employee must prove for each paystub received during the relevant time period that he/she was damaged by the inadequate pay stub.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The California Labor Code requires that a wage statement include, among other things, \"the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.

The Code specifies the amount of damages for violation of this requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Code further provides that \"[a]n employee is deemed to suffer injury for purposes of this subdivision if the employer fails to provide accurate and complete information as required ... and the employee cannot promptly determine from the wage statement alone ... the name and address of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 226(e)(2)(B)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The district court erred by concluding that damages for members of the wage statement class would require an individualized determination. Because the Code specifies that a violation of \u00a7 226 is a per se injury, there is no individualized issue of damages. If Corona knowingly and intentionally failed to provide the name of the legal entity that was the class members' employer, each class member was injured in precisely the same manner by each paystub in which Corona failed to provide that information.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, even if there is variation in the amount of each class members' damages, this is an insufficient basis by itself to deny certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yokoyama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522317\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/1087/#p1091\">\n    594 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"amount of damages is invariably an individual question and does not defeat class action treatment\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blackie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1100485\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/524/891/#p901\">\n    524 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   905 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The district court abused its discretion by denying certification on the basis that individual questions predominate in the claims of the proposed wage-statement class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the reasons discussed, the district court's denial of class certification is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    We refer to Corona Regional Medical Center and UHS of Delaware, Inc. collectively as the employer or former employer of the named plaintiffs and proposed class members.
