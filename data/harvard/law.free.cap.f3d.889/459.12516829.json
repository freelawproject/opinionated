United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n    880 F.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956 (8th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   My disagreement with the panel opinion boils down to three words: \"prisoner in custody.\" These words, from the first sentence of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , explain\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   falls under the statute. They make clear that only a \"prisoner in custody\" is subject to \u00a7 2255. The statute then uses the word \"prisoner\" five additional times, each time referring back to the \"prisoner in custody\" mentioned in the first sentence. Baranski, however, is no longer in custody, having completed his supervised-release term two years before filing his\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition, so applying any portion of the statute-whether substantive or procedural-to his petition is directly contrary to the statute's text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I do not stand alone in my skepticism. The Sixth Circuit, for example, has concluded that a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition filed by an individual who is \"no longer in custody\" is \"not in substance a motion under \u00a7 2255\" and \"therefore not a second or successive motion\" for \u00a7 2255 relief.\n   <em>\n    Pilla v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048538\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/368/#p372\">\n    668 F.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (6th Cir. 2012). The Ninth Circuit has similarly concluded that AEDPA's certificate-of-appealability requirement does not apply to\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions filed by those who are no longer in custody, explaining that once an individual is no longer in custody, \"he is no longer eligible for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   form of relief governed by AEDPA.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8974743\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/407/1005/#p1011\">\n    407 F.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011 (9th Cir. 2005) (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Even the United States recently conceded that it is erroneous to characterize a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition \"as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\" Memorandum Brief of United States at 5,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12402054\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/697/601/\">\n    697 F.App'x 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2017) (No. 17-6037).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States attempts to distinguish these cases through some exquisite statutory dissection. The first cut carves out the so-called procedural requirement, which bars \"second or successive [ \u00a7 2255 ] motion[s]\" unless they are \"certified\" by a court of appeals panel.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). The second cut slices off the so-called substantive requirement, which calls for \"second or successive motion[s]\" to \"contain\" either \"newly discovered evidence\" or \"a new rule of constitutional law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The government maintains that the cases have addressed only the first cut, leaving the applicability of the substantive requirement to\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions wide open. The panel, though failing to discuss the relevant precedent, apparently endorses this distinction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n    880 F.3d at 955-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The statute cannot be sliced so finely. It is instead one integrated whole: the substantive standard governs the court of appeals'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   consideration of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and would not exist in the absence of the procedural requirement to first obtain authorization for the motion. The panel opinion was no doubt correct when it stated that \"we may not read ... into the statutes\" a requirement that\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions filed by out-of-custody individuals must comply with \u00a7 2255(h) 's procedural demands.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n    at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this line of analysis applies equally to \u00a7 2255(h) 's so-called substantive requirement. After all, the same statutory provision contains both-indeed, within just a single sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The panel opinion therefore both rewrites \u00a7 2255 and alters the standard for\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions. It rewrites \u00a7 2255 by excising the words \"prisoner in custody\" from the first sentence. And it alters the standard for\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petitions by applying \u00a7 2255(h) 's restrictions, rather than Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court has instructed us that the writ of\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   is an \"extraordinary remedy\" for correcting errors of \"the most fundamental character\" when the \"circumstances compel[ ] such action to achieve justice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931559\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/346/502/#p511\">\n    346 U.S. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931559\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/346/502/#p511\">\n    74 S.Ct. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20248\">\n    98 L.Ed. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 511,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931559\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/346/502/#p511\">\n    74 S.Ct. 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a previous version of \u00a7 2255 was no \"bar\" to the filing of a\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   petition). As the panel opinion demonstrates, incorporation of the \u00a7 2255(h) standard means either that we never get to the\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   standard or that, once a petition clears the \u00a7 2255(h) hurdle, satisfying\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   may well be a foregone conclusion. Either way, the standard that we are actually bound to apply does little work under the panel's approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc. Only Congress can rewrite \u00a7 2255, only the Supreme Court can overrule\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , and neither has done so.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    As the panel noted, this issue was \"not addressed by the district court.\"\n    <em>\n     Baranski v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n     880 F.3d 951\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 955 (8th Cir. 2018). Indeed, the parties did not even have an opportunity to address what later became the panel's central holding, except at oral argument through questioning by the court. Reconsideration en banc, accompanied by adversarial briefing on the \u00a7 2255 question, could well lead this court to a different conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    To the extent the United States argues that the panel applied the limitations in \u00a7 2255(h) as an exercise of its discretion over when to grant\n    <em>\n     coram nobis\n    </em>\n    relief-rather than as a matter of statutory interpretation-the United States reads into the panel opinion something that is not there. The panel opinion states that \u00a7 2255(h)\"\n    <em>\n     limit[s]\n    </em>\n    the grant of\n    <em>\n     coram nobis\n    </em>\n    relief\" to petitioners like Baranski, \"Baranski's\n    <em>\n     coram nobis\n    </em>\n    petition\n    <em>\n     is subject\n    </em>\n    to\" those restrictions, and \u00a7 2255(h)(1), in particular, is \"the proper standard\" under which to evaluate Baranski's petition.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266275\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/951/#p956\">\n     880 F.3d at 956-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
