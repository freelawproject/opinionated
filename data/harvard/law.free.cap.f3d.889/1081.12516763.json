Palm claims that his\n   employer, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (\"LADWP\"), terminated his employment in a probationary promotional position without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. We reject Palm's claim because we hold that Palm lacked a constitutionally protected property interest in his probationary position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff-Appellant Palm began working for Defendant-Appellee LADWP as a Steam Plant Assistant in 1987. On December 31, 2012, Palm was promoted to Steam Plant Maintenance Supervisor, which commenced a six-month probationary period in the new position. Palm thereafter allegedly made several complaints to his immediate supervisor, Defendant-Appellee James Graden, about LADWP's noncompliance with state and federal health, safety, and labor laws. Among other things, Palm alleges that Graden unlawfully altered Palm's time records. When Palm confronted Graden, Graden allegedly reproached him and threatened repercussions if Palm did not drop the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After working in his probationary position for five months, Palm was given the choice of either \"forced resignation\" or termination from the probationary position. Palm chose to resign his position as Supervisor, after which he returned to his permanent job as Steam Plant Assistant. Palm then initiated an action against LADWP and Graden in California superior court, claiming whistleblower retaliation in violation of California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The superior court sustained a demurrer on the state law claim, but allowed Palm to amend his complaint to assert a civil rights claim for\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . LADWP then removed the action to federal district court. The district court granted LADWP's motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, but allowed Palm to amend his complaint again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his third amended complaint (\"TAC\"), Palm added Defendant-Appellee Mark Ashford, a Plant Manager, to his action, and introduced another new claim: that LADWP, Graden, and Ashford had retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights. LADWP filed a motion to dismiss the TAC for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted ( Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ), which the court granted with prejudice. The court held that Palm failed to plead a plausible free speech claim because Palm's speech was not a matter of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Palm then sought leave to amend his complaint a fourth time to assert another new theory, and the one that is before us on appeal: that Defendants' threatened termination of Palm from his probationary position violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The district court denied him leave to amend. The court found that amendment would be futile because Palm could not state a due process claim. First, the court summarily dismissed Palm's Fifth Amendment claim on the ground that Defendants are not federal actors. Second, the court determined that Palm could not state a Fourteenth Amendment claim because he lacked a property interest in his probationary position. The court then dismissed Palm's action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Undeterred, Palm filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied because it found no clear error in its decision dismissing the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Indeed, the court deemed it plain that Palm lacked a property interest in his probationary position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Palm timely appealed the district court's orders granting LADWP's motion to dismiss, denying him leave to amend his TAC, and denying his motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We review an order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo.\n   <em>\n    Faulkner v.

Section 1016(a) of the Los Angeles Charter provides that \"[n]o person in the classified civil service shall be discharged ... except for cause....\" Los Angeles Charter &amp; Admin. Code \u00a7 1016(a) (effective Apr. 8, 2011). At first blush, the \"for cause\" condition rings of a property interest in civil service positions. But not all civil service positions are alike, as reflected by the section titled \"Termination During Probation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20722\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1011(b). That provision, \u00a7 1011(b), establishes a distinct procedure for probationary employment. It provides that \"[a]t or before the expiration of the probationary period, the appointing authority may terminate the probationary employee by delivering written notice of termination to the employee assigning in writing the reasons for the termination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Critically, \u00a7 1011(b) does not require that \"discharge can only be for 'just cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dorr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596218\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/875/#p878\">\n    795 F.2d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, it allows LADWP to terminate probationary employment based only on a subjective finding that the employee has demonstrated unsatisfactory performance-a fact that cuts sharply against a finding of a property interest in the probationary position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596218\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/875/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596218\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/875/#p878\">\n    at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Dorr\n   </em>\n   , we observed that \"[t]he power of the appointing authority to determine,\n   <em>\n    on a purely subjective basis\n   </em>\n   , whether a probationary employee has performed satisfactorily undercuts any expectation of continued employment that might otherwise arise by virtue of the requirement that disciplinary dismissal be grounded upon objectively reasonable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596218\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/875/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 1.26 of the Civil Service Rules similarly explains that \"PROBATIONARY PERIOD means the working test period during which an employee is required to demonstrate his/her fitness by the actual performance of the duties and responsibilities of his/her position and during which he/she may be terminated\n   <em>\n    without right of appeal\n   </em>\n   to the Board of Civil Service Commissioners.\" Rules of the Board of Civil Service Commissioners \u00a7 1.26 (revised through Aug. 2012) (emphasis added) (\"Los Angeles Civil Service Rules\"). We have previously found that termination procedures lacking any right to an appeal proceeding demonstrate a lack of a property\n   interest in a probationary position. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Fleisher v. City of Signal Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758505\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/1491/#p1494\">\n    829 F.2d 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1494-95 (9th Cir. 1987), we held that a probationary employee lacked a property interest because the city personnel rules \"provide[d] that a probationary employee may be rejected at any time without right of appeal or hearing.\" (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Palm does not argue that his probationary position as Steam Plant Maintenance Supervisor, standing alone, is vested with a protected property interest. Instead, he asserts that his prior permanent employment as Steam Plant Assistant means that the rules governing probationary employees do not apply to him-regardless of the probationary nature of his new position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We reject Palm's argument based on the text and structure of the Los Angeles Charter, the Los Angeles Civil Service Rules, and our own precedent. As discussed, \u00a7 1011(b) of the Charter explains that one who serves, as Palm did, a \"probationary period\"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a \"probationary employee.\" Moreover, \u00a7 7.7 of the Civil Service Rules makes clear that a permanent employee in one capacity may be a probationary employee in another: employees who are on probation are \"considered automatically on leave of absence from his/her former position while serving the probationary period.\" That provision also states that an employee who fails probation \"shall ... be returned to the [permanent] position from which he/she is on leave.\" Los Angeles Civil Service Rules \u00a7 7.7. Putting it all together, if a probationary employee is by definition one who is serving a probationary period, and if a permanent employee in one capacity may serve a probationary period in another position, then the rules that apply to probationary employees govern a permanent employee's probationary term. Accordingly, contrary to Palm's contention, an employee's permanent status in one position has no effect upon his probationary status in another position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our decision today is consistent with our approach in\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   . That case involved an employee, Patrice McGraw, who, like Palm, held a permanent position in local government within the State of California and was later promoted to a probationary position.\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821028\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/384/#p387\">\n    882 F.2d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also like our case, the local personnel rules provided that a probationary employee \"may be rejected at any time by the department head without cause and without the right of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/384/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821028\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/384/#p387\">\n    at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). However, unlike Palm, McGraw was terminated from\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   her probationary position\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   her permanent position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821028\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/384/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821028\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/384/#p387\">\n    at 385, 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the contrary, we indicated that McGraw's property interest was limited to her permanent employ: we held that an employee who has achieved permanent status in one position has \"retained reasonable expectations of continued employment,\n   <em>\n    at least to continued employment in the [pre-probationary] position from which [he or she] had been promoted.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .
