Before a hearing was held on the seizure, a City of Los Angeles (the \"City\") veterinarian euthanized all but two of the birds. Recchia then sued the City and the Officers (collectively, \"Defendants\"), bringing claims for violations of the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, as well as claims for state law tort violations. Recchia also asserted a claim for municipal liability against the City on the constitutional claims pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), and against the City on the state law claims based on California Government Code \u00a7 815.2. The district court granted summary judgment for the Defendants on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm in part on issues including dismissal of the Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against the Officers and dismissal of the state law claims. But on the Fourth Amendment claim challenging the seizure of Recchia's birds, we vacate and remand because we conclude that genuine\n   disputes of material fact now preclude summary judgment on the question of whether there was a constitutional violation. We instruct the district court to consider in the first instance whether the Officers are nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity because any constitutional violation was not clearly established at the time it was committed. We also vacate summary judgment on the Fourteenth Amendment claim against the City and instruct the district court to consider in the first instance whether Recchia should be allowed to add a new theory of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In late 2011, Martino Recchia was homeless and living on the streets of Los Angeles with his twenty pet birds. Eighteen of the birds were pigeons and Recchia also had a crow and a seagull. Recchia kept these birds in twelve to fourteen cardboard boxes and cages, which were covered with blankets and towels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 3, 2011, Los Angeles County Animal Control Officer Robert Weekley came to investigate Recchia's campsite in response to complaints about a homeless man with birds. Officer Weekley told Recchia that he was going to look through Recchia's boxes and containers. Recchia agreed to the inspection and admitted to the Officer that he was keeping some pigeons and a crow in the boxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Weekley then looked through the boxes. Los Angeles County Animal Control Officer Yvonne Rodriguez soon arrived to assist him. All the birds had food and water. However, the birds were maintained in areas too small for them to be able to fly around, the newspaper lining the floors was wet, and the cages and boxes were covered with feces.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several birds were in dire physical condition. One pigeon had a baseball-sized tumor protruding from its abdomen and extensive feather loss. Another pigeon had tremors and continually walked in circles. Another pigeon had a shriveled, non-functional right eye. Still another pigeon had contorted legs, feather loss, and could not walk or fly. Some birds had wobbling necks or necks in unusual positions. Several birds were missing toes or toenails, or had very long toenails that were curled in circles. Many birds had overgrown beaks. Recchia states that he rescued many of these birds and kept them in the same or better condition than that in which he had found them. However, it cannot be doubted on this record that many of the birds were deformed, distressed or diseased. On the other hand, eight of the pigeons showed no signs of injury or disease, and outwardly appeared to be healthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Rodriguez photographed the birds and their living conditions, while Officer Weekley spoke with Recchia. Officer Weekley told Recchia that he was going to impound all of the sick or injured birds, and asked Recchia if there was somewhere Recchia could take the pigeons without visible injuries or illnesses to get them off the street. Recchia told Officer Weekley that he had a friend in the Silverlake neighborhood of Los Angeles and that he could take the birds to that friend's house. However, Recchia could not provide his friend's name or address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Weekley then decided to impound all of the birds, given that Recchia\n   could not verify that the friend's home in Silverlake would meet the municipal code requirement that unpermitted wild birds must be housed at least 50 feet from the bird owner's dwelling and 150 feet from all other dwellings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAMC \u00a7\u00a7 53.59, 53.71. Officer Weekley was also concerned, given the lack of detail Recchia had provided, that the birds would remain in squalor on the public sidewalk if left with Recchia. And Officer Weekley did not think that Recchia could adequately care for the birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Animal Control Officers then impounded the birds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recchia was also given a \"Post-Seizure Hearing Notice,\" which informed him that he had ten days to request a post-seizure hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Animal Control Officers then took the birds to the North Central Care Center (the \"Care Center\"). The next day, a city veterinarian, Dr. Steven Feldman, examined the birds. He determined that the crow and the seagull should be sent to wildlife rescue organizations. But he decided all of the pigeons needed to be euthanized: He determined that many of the birds had serious and incurable illnesses, including symptoms of various bacterial or viral diseases, and that it was likely that even those birds without outward signs of illness carried pathogens. However, Dr. Feldman did not perform blood tests on the birds because the Care Center had a policy of not testing birds for illness unless it was a matter of public health importance. And he determined that the present circumstances did not rise to that threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 7, 2011, four days after the seizure, Recchia filed a request for a post-seizure hearing. The hearing was held the next day. The hearing officer found that the seizure was justified under California Penal Code \u00a7 597.1(a)(1), which requires officers to seize animals kept in public spaces without proper care and attention if the officers have a \"reasonable\" belief that \"very prompt\" action is required to protect the health and safety of the animal or others. At this hearing, Recchia learned for the first time that all of his pigeons had been euthanized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Recchia then sued the Animal Control Officers and the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , alleging Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the Department of Animal Services,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and state tort law claims for conversion, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and granted summary judgment to the Defendants. Through the report and recommendation, the district court noted that Recchia had offered no medical or veterinary evidence as to the birds' condition. It stated that exigent circumstances justified the seizure and destruction of the birds, and so found no violation of Recchia's constitutional rights. The district court granted\n   summary judgment to the City, finding Recchia had failed to show there was any City policy that had led the Animal Control Officers to act in a manner that injured Recchia. Finally, the court granted summary judgment to the Defendants on Recchia's state tort law claims, holding that there was no evidence that the Defendants had acted wrongfully. Finding for the Defendants on other grounds, the district court did not reach the Defendants' qualified immunity defense or their other affirmative defenses. Recchia appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And Defendants have agreed for the purposes of this appeal that Recchia had a property interest in his pigeons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The seizure of a homeless person's property implicates important Fourth Amendment concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Recchia argues that in seizing his birds without a warrant, the Officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights. At oral argument and in his briefing on appeal, Recchia argued only that the seizure of his healthy birds was a violation of his constitutional rights, although in his complaint Recchia sought damages for the seizure of all of his birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Because warrantless searches and seizures are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable, the government bears the burden of showing that a warrantless search or seizure falls within an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The defendants here invoke the exigent or emergency circumstances exception to justify the seizure. The exigent circumstances exception allows warrantless searches and seizures when an emergency leaves police insufficient time to seek a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2173\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2173,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2173\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Under this exception, for example, the police need not wait to get a warrant if there is an urgent need to provide aid or if there is concern evidence might be destroyed in the time it would take to get a warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In evaluating whether the circumstances justified an official in acting without a warrant, we review the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , 569 U.S. at 151,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697040\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/141/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the City argues that the seizure was justified because the birds were being held in unsanitary conditions, and it was \"untenable\" for both the birds' health and for the health of other animals and the public for the birds to remain on the street in those conditions. Recchia argues that any public health threat was too speculative to justify seizing the birds, and that Officer Weekley's initial willingness to allow Recchia to take the healthy birds to a friend's house demonstrates that there was no emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There is no question about whether the emergency exception can be applied to animal workers who seize an animal in a true emergency setting. For example, if animal workers in an urban setting confront an obviously diseased or ill animal living in foul conditions that may be causing or compounding the animal's suffering, whether a bird or a dog or a cat, those workers have the right to seize the animal without getting a warrant. There is little preexisting judicial precedent on this subject. But, in the Sixth Circuit case of\n   <em>\n    United Pet Supply, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265009\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/464/\">\n    768 F.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2014), animal control workers were confronted with a situation where a pet store owner had maintained premises so hot and so unventilated that a puppy had died.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265009\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/464/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265009\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/464/\">\n    at 473-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that context, the court held that the workers could seize animals from the pet store without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265009\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/464/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265009\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/464/\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Other obvious examples come to mind. For example, if workers saw a dog foaming at the mouth, they would not have to pause to get a warrant before trying to get the dog off the street because of the risks of a rabid dog biting another animal or a person. Though less dramatic, there are similar issues with diseased cats or birds. There will always be the problem that if a diseased animal with a communicable disease is allowed to mingle with other animals, it may transmit disease to them. A disease can spread quickly, maybe as fast as lightning, leaving human health care or animal control workers with only a limited ability to control it. Officers concerned with human or animal safety should not have to pause to obtain a warrant if they are reasonably concerned that a significant spread of illness might be caused by an infected animal. Similarly, if health inspection workers see evidence of rodent infestation in a restaurant, they need not pause to get a warrant before taking corrective action to protect the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   If all the birds maintained by Recchia had been unhealthy or sick in appearance, we think their entire seizure would pose no significant constitutional issue, and clearly would not offend the Fourth Amendment because of the scope of the emergency exception to the warrant requirement and the need to seize the birds to end their suffering and prevent transmission of illness. However, the crux of the problem here is that not all of the birds appeared to be sick, in fact eight birds appeared outwardly healthy. And so we are confronted with a factual issue about whether the exigent circumstances exception applies as to the seizure of the healthy-looking birds kept by Recchia in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the one hand, as to considerations suggesting there was no urgent need to seize the birds, there was substantial evidence that the healthy looking birds should have been no cause for concern. Officer Weekley's initial willingness to leave the healthy birds with Recchia, if Recchia could relocate them in a way that complied with municipal law, counsels against finding that an emergency existed here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Cty. of San Joaquin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046099\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1288/#p1295\">\n    487 F.3d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that an official's initial determination there was no need for a seizure \"militates against a finding of exigency.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the City argues that Dr. Feldman's conclusion that the birds potentially carried disease demonstrates that there was a grave risk that required the birds' seizure, we note that Dr. Feldman explained that if birds \"may be harboring a potentially dangerous human contagious disease or may be exhibiting signs indicative of an epidemic,\" \"the Care Centers will then incur the expense of performing blood work and lab tests\" on the birds. But here Dr. Feldman \"did not feel that the pathology manifested in [Recchia's] pigeons was of a most serious caliber to warrant that.\" Also, in assessing reasonableness, we look at what was known to the officers at the time of seizure.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Licata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29522\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/537/#p543\">\n    761 F.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (9th Cir. 1985). Here, at that time, the Officers did not have the benefit of Dr. Feldman's opinion and there is no evidence that the Officers knew facts supporting the view that the healthy-looking pigeons carried a disease that was dangerous to humans, such as avian influenza or bubonic plague, or carried a pathogen that might lead to an epidemic in the Los Angeles bird population.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the other hand, as to considerations suggesting a degree of urgency, there was evidence from which a jury might have determined that all the birds posed some hazard or were in immediate danger justifying a seizure. We observe that the birds were kept in living spaces inadequate for them to fly, spaces that were dirty and covered with feces. And Dr. Feldman was concerned that even the healthy birds might have pathogens or viruses that might spread to other birds in the wild-although it is unclear what sort of illness they might have had, as Dr. Feldman appears to have just generally listed illnesses that may afflict birds without any analysis to show how Recchia's birds' symptoms linked them to those illnesses. Further, Officer Weekly did not think Recchia was capable of caring for the birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because of these competing lines of evidence, we hold that there is a genuine factual dispute about whether the healthy-looking birds posed any meaningful risk to other birds or humans at the time they were seized. Therefore, although we affirm the dismissal in part as to the seizure of the birds that appeared sick, we vacate and remand in part as to the seizure of any birds that were wholly healthy in outward appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On remand, we instruct the district court to consider in the first instance whether the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity for any potential constitutional violation because it was not \"clearly established\" at the time of the seizure that the warrantless seizure of the birds could be a violation of Recchia's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San JoseCharter of Hells Angels Motorcycle Club v. City of San Jose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9180529\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/962/#p971\">\n    402 F.3d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971 (9th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Recchia also argues that the Officers violated his Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights by denying\n   him a hearing before taking and destroying his outwardly healthy-looking birds. Recchia appears to be challenging the denial of both a pre- and a post-seizure hearing. However, Recchia alleges a Fourteenth Amendment violation against only the Officers, not the veterinarian. To the extent that Recchia argues he was denied a meaningful post-seizure hearing due to the euthanization of the birds, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the Officers because neither of the Officers was involved in the decision to euthanize the birds. Accordingly, the relevant question is whether the Officers violated Recchia's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights because they seized Recchia's birds without a pre-seizure hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Again, the parties agree, for purposes of this appeal, that Recchia had a property interest in his birds. Once a court has determined that there is a protected interest at stake, the court \"must apply the three-part balancing test established in\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.
