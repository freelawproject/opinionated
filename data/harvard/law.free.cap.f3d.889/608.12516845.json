The Department officials also appeal the district court's denial of their motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity. We affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction, but reverse the denial of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Daniels is an Illinois based corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells reusable sharps container systems for the disposal of needle-inclusive biohazardous medical products. Those medical products include waste syringes, blood collection devices, and IVs. Daniels also handles the transport and treatment of the medical waste. In California, that waste is handled by Daniels' Medical Waste Treatment Facility and Transfer Station in Fresno. As a medical waste treatment facility in California, it is subject to regulation under California's MWMA. Therefore, when it received its medical waste treatment facility and transfer station permit from the Department, Daniels agreed to \"comply with all applicable provisions of the Medical Waste Management Act.\" Daniels also agreed to operate its facility in conformance with the plans approved by the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In general, under the MWMA, California-generated medical waste must be incinerated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20118215\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 118215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A). Furthermore, \"[m]edical waste transported out of state shall be consigned to a permitted medical waste treatment facility in the receiving state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20118215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 118000(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As of 2014, there were no locations within the State of California that had incinerators to treat Daniels' biohazardous medical waste.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Daniels transported the waste from the Fresno facility to other states. For some time, Daniels had the waste incinerated at a facility in Baltimore, Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, in 2014, Daniels decided to transport its medical waste to locations in Kentucky and Indiana, where the waste would be treated by means other than incineration which were consistent with those states' regulations. In Kentucky, the waste was treated by a method called autoclave, while in Indiana the waste was treated by a technique known as thermal\n   deactivation. Treating the waste in Indiana and Kentucky was more cost effective for Daniels than having the waste incinerated in some other state. From September 11, 2014, to December 1, 2014, Daniels transported roughly 320,000 pounds of medical waste to facilities in Indiana and Kentucky. After a November 20, 2014, inspection of Daniels' facility in Fresno, California, the Department, through Hilton, told Daniels that all biohazardous medical waste originating in California must be treated by incineration, even if the law of another state permitted an alternative method. The Department further indicated that Daniels would be penalized if it did not incinerate all of its biohazardous medical waste. Daniels responded that the Department could not dictate the method by which Daniels treated the waste outside of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2015, the Department conducted another inspection of Daniels' facility, and Daniels received a letter from Hilton, which stated that California law governed Daniels' treatment of medical waste in other states. Then, on August 10, 2015, the Department issued a notice of violation to Daniels for using methods other than incineration to treat its biohazardous medical waste outside of California. The notice imposed a $618,000 penalty for the 618 violations of law it identified. In order to avoid further penalties, Daniels began transporting its medical waste to incinerators located in other states, at a significantly higher cost to Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, Daniels filed a complaint in the district court, and alleged that the Department officials violated the dormant Commerce Clause by their extraterritorial application of the MWMA. Daniels then filed a motion for preliminary injunction, and the Department officials, claiming entitlement to qualified immunity, filed a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court granted Daniels' motion for a preliminary injunction and denied the Department officials' motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   JURISDICTION AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"We have jurisdiction to review the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Meredith v.

The district court agreed with that assessment, as do we. If permitted, that kind of action would attack the cement that holds this nation together. As the Supreme Court has said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Commerce Clause provides that \"[t]he Congress shall have Power ... [t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\" Though phrased as a grant of regulatory power to Congress, the Clause has long been understood to have a \"negative\" aspect that denies the States the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce. The Framers granted Congress plenary authority over interstate commerce in \"the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Confederation.\" \"This principle that our economic unit is the Nation, which alone has the gamut of powers necessary to control of the economy, ... has as its corollary that the states are not separable economic units.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl.

The Court has pointed out that \"[w]hen a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p579\">\n    476 U.S. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p579\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2084,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12427\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/573/#p579\">\n    90 L.Ed. 2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). While many cases deal with the discrimination emanation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   this case deals with the direct regulation emanation. \"Direct regulation occurs when a state law directly affects transactions that take place across state lines or entirely outside of the state's borders.\"\n   <em>\n    S.D. Myers, Inc. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1269260\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/253/461/#p467\">\n    253 F.3d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). As the Court has put it: \"the 'Commerce Clause ... precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State's borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State.' \"\n   <em>\n    Healy v. Beer Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n    491 U.S. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2499,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n    105 L.Ed. 2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). Indeed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [A] statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State's authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute's extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature. The critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Court further pointed out that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]he practical effect of the statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate\n   regulatory regimes of other States and what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We will apply these general principles to the issues raised in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v. Nat. Res. Def.

We have explained that the first and third of the factors interact so that \" 'serious questions going to the merits' and a balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1135\">\n    632 F.3d 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (9th Cir. 2011). The Department officials do not contest the district court's determinations regarding the balance of equities, irreparable injury, and public interest factors, but do insist that Daniels is not likely to succeed on the merits. In short, they essentially state that because it is plain that there was no redressable constitutional violation, Daniels cannot succeed. In that they are plainly incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties do not dispute that a Commerce Clause action can be brought by an individual pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

Thus, we need only consider whether Daniels is likely to succeed on the merits under the facts and circumstances of this case. It is. We are not concerned here with an attempt by the Department officials to protect California and its residents by applying the MWMA to products that are brought into or are otherwise within the borders of the State.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain Farmers Union v.

Rather, we are faced with an attempt to reach beyond the borders of California and control transactions that occur wholly outside of the State after the material in question-medical waste-has been removed from the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The mere fact that some nexus to a state exists will not justify regulation of wholly out-of-state transactions.
