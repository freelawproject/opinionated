FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this case, the government presented evidence at trial that U.S. Border Patrol agents had observed three men on a mountaintop in the Vaiva Hills area of Arizona. Two of them were communicating with one another. The third man, Espinoza-Valdez, was initially observed some distance away sitting under a tree. Later, he was observed walking behind one of the other men and carrying a backpack. Upon seeing the agents, Espinoza-Valdez dropped the Motorola radio he was carrying and ran. The agents apprehended him and found a Motorola battery clip, radio batteries, toilet paper, wet wipes, and food in his backpack, to which carpet shoes were attached. One of the agents testified that carpet shoes are used by both drug couriers and undocumented immigrants to avoid leaving footprints while passing through the area. The agents also located a nearby campsite with sleeping bags, water jugs, and additional food supplies. They did not find any drugs in the area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Bobby Garcia testified as an expert on drug trafficking organizations as follows: Drug trafficking organizations smuggle marijuana into the United States using groups of five to ten men who hike across the desert carrying marijuana in backpacks. These backpackers are led by guides who communicate by cell phone or radio with scouts who camp along the route and monitor law enforcement movements. Drug smugglers often use Motorola brand radios with sophisticated encryption capabilities and carry carpet shoes to disguise their footprints. The month of October-when Espinoza-Valdez was apprehended-is part of the fall \"drug-smuggling season,\" and the Vaiva Hills area is a known drug-smuggling corridor. Drug traffickers control the area and would not allow others to move through it, and the circumstances surrounding Espinoza-Valdez's apprehension were consistent with him being a drug trafficking scout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The government also presented evidence that, approximately four months prior to the events giving rise to the instant case, U.S. Border Patrol agents had apprehended Espinoza-Valdez in the same Vaiva Hills area. At that time, Espinoza-Valdez told the agents that he and others had entered the United States and were backpacking marijuana across the desert. The agents did not locate any backpacks of marijuana. Espinoza-Valdez was released and not charged with any criminal offense. This evidence was admitted at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), and the court gave a limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite the evidence of Espinoza-Valdez's presence with two unknown men\n   in a known drug-smuggling corridor close to the Mexican border near what appeared to be a camp for drug trafficking scouts, as well as the seizure of items that were suspicious in this context, there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Espinoza-Valdez entered into a conspiratorial agreement to import or distribute marijuana. The government's case rested almost exclusively on the expert testimony regarding drug traffickers' use of scouts to facilitate the transportation of marijuana through the Vaiva Hills area. The government presented no evidence of drugs that actually passed through or were intended to pass through that area under Espinoza-Valdez's watch. Nor did the government present evidence of any specific individuals with whom Espinoza-Valdez allegedly conspired. There simply is no evidence as to what (if anything) was specifically agreed to, who agreed to it, or what any agreement was intended to accomplish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the dearth of evidence of an agreement to import or distribute marijuana between Espinoza-Valdez and the two unknown men observed on the mountain-or anyone else-the government has not met its burden of proving his participation in a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325796\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/555/#p559\">\n    825 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   557 ;\n   <em>\n    Lapier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5770507\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1090/#p1095\">\n    796 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1095 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government may not rely on expert testimony of drug courier profiles alone to establish guilt.

Here, it was not: Viewing the entirety of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, there was insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly find the existence of a conspiracy to import or distribute marijuana-or of Espinoza-Valdez's agreement to join such a conspiracy-beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grovo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324902\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1207/#p1213\">\n    826 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1213-14 ;\n   <em>\n    Nevils\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221363\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1158/#p1163\">\n    598 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1163-64 ;\n   <em>\n    Egge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243392\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/1128/#p1131\">\n    223 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court's judgment with respect to the convictions for conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute marijuana is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Because we find it necessary to reverse on this ground, we need not reach Espinoza-Valdez's other arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Fact witnesses also testified as to their opinions that a footprint observed at a nearby scout encampment matched the sneaker print of the shoes Espinoza-Valdez was wearing at the time of his arrest.
