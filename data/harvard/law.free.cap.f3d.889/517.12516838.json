During his recovery, Barnes received some monetary assistance from either Sea Hawaii Rafting, LLC (\"SHR\"), which owned the Tehani, or Kris Henry, SHR's owner and manager, but those payments soon stopped. Seeking the ancient maritime remedy of maintenance and cure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   among other relief, Barnes sued the Tehani in rem and SHR and Henry in personam to enforce his seaman's lien against the vessel. Although admiralty courts normally\n   handle such matters expeditiously, that did not happen here for two reasons.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, the district court rejected Barnes's pretrial requests to enforce SHR's obligation to pay maintenance and cure. The court concluded that Barnes was entitled to maintenance and cure and had demonstrated his actual maintenance expenses. Nonetheless, despite undisputed evidence that Barnes was entitled to at least some of his actual expenses, the district court declined to award Barnes any maintenance until trial.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, when SHR declared bankruptcy after fifteen months of litigation and shortly before trial, the district court stayed Barnes's action. The district court concluded that the Tehani was an asset of the debtor's estate and that the automatic bankruptcy stay barred proceedings to enforce Barnes's maritime lien against the vessel. The bankruptcy court partially lifted the bankruptcy stay to allow the district court to evaluate Barnes's claims against SHR but expressly prohibited the district court from issuing any ruling that would affect the maritime lien's status.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ultimately, the district court dismissed Barnes's claims against the Tehani. The court reasoned that it lacked in rem jurisdiction because, even though Barnes verified his original complaint, he failed to verify the amended complaint. Then, while Barnes's appeal was pending, the bankruptcy trustee-with the bankruptcy court's approval-sold the Tehani purportedly free and clear of Barnes's maritime lien. The trustee subsequently moved to dismiss this appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">\n   We conclude that the district court erred by denying Barnes's maintenance requests in full, staying the action, and dismissing the Tehani. The district court obtained jurisdiction over the vessel Tehani when Barnes filed a verified complaint and the defendants appeared generally and litigated without contesting in rem jurisdiction. The district court did not lose in rem jurisdiction while the Tehani remained in its constructive custody. And the court's control over the vessel, once obtained, was exclusive. SHR's later-filed bankruptcy petition did not divest the district court of in rem jurisdiction. Moreover, the automatic bankruptcy stay did not affect Barnes's maritime lien against the Tehani, and the bankruptcy court had no authority to dispose of the lien through the application of bankruptcy law.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   When, as here, a seaman establishes his entitlement to maintenance and provides some evidence of his actual living expenses, the burden shifts to the vessel's owner to produce evidence that the seaman's actual costs were unreasonable. Whether or not the vessel's owner provides such evidence, the seaman is entitled to a maintenance award in the amount of his actual costs up to the reasonable rate in his locality. Over three years after concluding that Barnes was entitled to maintenance and had sufficiently proven his actual costs, the district court has yet to award him any maintenance.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, we deny the trustee's motion to dismiss, reverse the district court's dismissal of the Tehani, and issue a writ of mandamus to the district court to award Barnes maintenance for his undisputed actual and reasonable expenses-$34 per day-subject to a potential increase after trial.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n<strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n<strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-27\">\n   Barnes worked for SHR for six years as a captain and crew member of the Tehani, a 25-foot rigid hull inflatable boat powered by twin outboard engines. Barnes took passengers from Honokohau Harbor on sightseeing and snorkeling trips along the\n   Kona coast. Henry paid Barnes under the table with personal checks made out to \"cash.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 3, 2012, Henry and Barnes were launching the Tehani for a night snorkeling trip. Henry was in his truck, towing the Tehani on an attached trailer, and Barnes was onboard the boat. Henry backed the trailer down the launch ramp until the vessel was in the water. When Barnes started the starboard engine, the Tehani exploded. The hatch struck Barnes on his back and head, propelling him into the ocean.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n   A Coast Guard investigation found that the explosion was caused by a fuel tank with a missing screw in the fuel tank sender. Fuel leaked into the bilge, where vapors accumulated and ignited when Barnes started the engine. The investigator concluded that the incident might have been avoided if Henry had installed the required flammable vapor detector and mechanical exhaust system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20182.460\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 182.460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182.480. The boat, which was insured, was subsequently repaired and returned to service.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-30\">\n   Barnes was less fortunate. SHR lacked insurance to cover his medical expenses for physical, psychological, and neurological treatment. Barnes required approximately 12 staples to reattach parts of his scalp. Due to his head injuries, he can no longer drive a car or swim. He cannot afford rent and has been living on friends' couches. He receives approximately $300 per month in disability income from the State of Hawaii.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-31\">\n<strong>\n    B. Litigation in the District and Bankruptcy Courts\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-32\">\n   On January 1, 2013, Barnes filed a verified complaint in admiralty against Henry, SHR, and the Tehani, claiming unseaworthiness, various theories of negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Barnes sought maintenance and cure, damages, and attorney's fees. The three defendants answered the complaint. Despite denying Barnes's allegation that the Tehani was subject to the district court's in rem jurisdiction, they did not move to dismiss the Tehani on that basis but instead proceeded to litigate the dispute.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-33\">\n   Barnes moved for \"summary judgment for payment of maintenance and cure,\" requesting that the district court order defendants to pay his \"reasonable, actual costs of food and lodging\" and medical costs since the date of his injury until he reached \"maximum medical cure.\" The district court granted Barnes's motion in part. Noting that defendants did not dispute that Barnes was injured in the service of the Tehani, the district court ruled that Barnes was entitled to maintenance and cure and had not yet reached maximum cure. Applying the standard for determining a maintenance rate from\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Noble Drilling (U.S.) Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126136\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/582/\">\n    242 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2001), the district court concluded that Barnes had shown his actual food and lodging costs but not the reasonable amount for such costs in his locality or his actual medical expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court therefore declined to award either maintenance or cure.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-34\">\n   About four months after the district court's order, Henry volunteered to pay\n   Barnes $962.83 per month towards maintenance but stopped after making two payments. Barnes moved two more times for summary judgment to determine a daily maintenance rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court denied both motions, concluding that there were triable issues of fact regarding reasonable food and lodging costs in Hawaii. The district court also denied Barnes's separate motion for summary judgment for payment of cure.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">\n   Meanwhile, Barnes filed an unverified amended complaint, adding a claim for negligence per se. In answering the amended complaint, defendants again stated a general denial of Barnes's allegation that the Tehani was subject to the district court's in rem jurisdiction but did not specifically challenge jurisdiction by filing a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) or otherwise bringing the issue to the district court's attention.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-36\">\n   In yet another summary judgment motion, Barnes asked the district court to grant relief on his claims for unseaworthiness, negligence per se, and Jones Act negligence. Two weeks before the hearing on this motion and just over a month before the scheduled trial, SHR and Henry filed for bankruptcy relief-Henry for reorganization under Chapter 13 and SHR for dissolution under Chapter 7. Pursuant to the automatic bankruptcy stay,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the district court stayed the proceedings against all three defendants.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">\n   The bankruptcy court, recognizing the district court's \"experience and expertise ... in matters in admiralty,\" partially lifted the stay as to Henry and SHR so that the district court could \"adjudicate the validity, extent, amount, and date of perfection of any maritime lien claim by ... Barnes against the [Tehani].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the bankruptcy court expressly kept the stay in place \"to bar the enforcement of any maritime lien.\" The bankruptcy court expressed concern that the \"limited assets\" of SHR's estate did not warrant the bankruptcy trustee's \"participat[ion] in extended or unlimited litigation in the District Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the bankruptcy court partially lifted the stay, the district court reopened the case. In a subsequent minute order addressing Barnes's outstanding summary judgment motions, the district court noted-sua sponte and parenthetically-that \"it lack[ed] jurisdiction over the [Tehani], as [the vessel] was never arrested.\" Thereafter, Barnes attempted several times to verify the amended complaint-a verified complaint being a precondition of arrest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. Supp. Adm. &amp; Mar. Cl. R. C(2)(a)-though Barnes made no attempt to arrest the Tehani. The trustee in SHR's bankruptcy case conceded to the district court that defendants' \"pre-petition answer subjected [them] to the [district\n   court's] jurisdiction.\" The trustee acknowledged the district court's previous statement that it lacked in rem jurisdiction but did not seek dismissal on that ground. Rather, the trustee argued that Barnes had lost any maritime lien he had in the vessel through his failure to verify the amended complaint and invoke the district court's in rem jurisdiction. Henry also did not seek dismissal for lack of in rem jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court nonetheless dismissed the Tehani for lack of in rem jurisdiction and, in the same order, granted Barnes partial summary judgment on his claim for negligence per se. In dismissing the Tehani, the district court reasoned that Barnes's unverified amended complaint-filed after more than 15 months of litigation-superseded the original verified complaint; Barnes's attempts to verify the amended complaint while the bankruptcy stay was in effect were invalid; verification of the amended complaint was necessary for his maritime lien against the Tehani to attach; and Barnes's failure to verify the amended complaint deprived the district court of in rem jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   Barnes appeals the district court's orders dismissing the Tehani and denying his request to set a maintenance amount. While his appeal was pending, the bankruptcy court approved, and SHR's bankruptcy trustee executed, the sale of the Tehani and its trailer to Henry's new company, Aloha Ocean Excursions, LLC, for $35,000.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-41\">\n<strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">\n<strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-43\">\n   We begin by considering our own jurisdiction as to each issue raised on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Ashcroft v.

We agree with\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   and expressly adopt\n   <em>\n    Incandela\n   </em>\n   's burden-shifting framework for determining a maintenance amount.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-112\">\n<strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-113\">\n   In ruling on Barnes's first motion for summary judgment, the district court found that he established both his entitlement to maintenance and his actual living expenses of $68 per day. Under\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , a decision which has gained widespread acceptance outside this circuit and which the district court purported to apply, defendants had the burden of showing that $68 per day was\n   <em>\n    un\n   </em>\n   reasonable.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendants submitted no such evidence. Therefore, Barnes carried his summary judgment burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the reasonableness of his actual expenses. The district court should have awarded Barnes $68 per day unless it independently determined that that amount was unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126136\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/582/\">\n    242 F.3d at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the district court faulted Barnes for \"fail[ing] ... to provide ... evidence regarding the current costs of food and lodging in [his locality] such that the Court can make a determination as to the reasonable costs in the area.\" This was clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Incandela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186343\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/659/11/#p14\">\n    659 F.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]o require every injured seaman seeking a court award for maintenance to go to the expense of putting on expert witnesses before he will be permitted to recover more than a fixed nominal maintenance rate would be to place an unfair burden on those whom the idea of maintenance was designed to assist.\").\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-115\">\n   After the district court denied Barnes's motion for reconsideration, Barnes moved for summary judgment a second time. This time, defendants produced evidence that the reasonable cost of living in Barnes's locality was between $24 and $34 per day. Barnes, in contrast, produced evidence that the reasonable rate was between $43 and $61 per day. Citing\n   <em>\n    Glynn\n   </em>\n   , the district court concluded that the dispute over a reasonable daily maintenance rate precluded summary judgment. The court subsequently denied Barnes's motion for reconsideration, in which he requested maintenance at the rate of $24 per day-the lowest end of the range of reasonable rates offered by defendants-subject to modification after trial. Barnes repeated this request in his third motion for summary judgment, but the district court again denied it.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-116\">\n   Like the denial of Barnes's first motion for summary judgment, these later denials of summary judgment constituted clear error. The district court reasoned that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether Barnes was entitled to maintenance at a rate of at least $24 per day because Barnes did not agree that $24 per day was reasonable. But\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , which provided the applicable substantive standard at summary judgment, held that \"seamen are entitled to maintenance in the amount of their actual expenses on food and lodging\n   <em>\n    up to\n   </em>\n   the reasonable amount for their locality.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11126136\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/582/\">\n    242 F.3d at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Regardless of whether $24 per day is ultimately proven to be reasonable at trial, there is no dispute that the reasonable rate is at least $24 per day. Because Barnes is entitled to maintenance up to the reasonable rate, there is no dispute, let alone a genuine dispute, that he is entitled to maintenance at a rate of at least $24 per day.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-117\">\n   In fact, Barnes is entitled to more than $24 per day. As we have explained, defendants had the burden of demonstrating that his actual expenses were unreasonable. Defendants produced evidence that the reasonable daily rate for living expenses in Barnes's locality ranges from $24 per day to $34 per day. Thus, defendants produced\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence disputing the reasonableness of a maintenance award in the amount of $34 per day; to the contrary, the evidence produced by defendants supported the reasonableness of a $34 daily rate. Accordingly, there is no genuine issue of fact as to Barnes's entitlement to maintenance in the amount of at least $34 per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-118\">\n<em>\n    Glynn\n   </em>\n   is not to the contrary.

Such a predicament is antithetical to the admiralty policies underlying the seaman's right to maintenance and cure.
