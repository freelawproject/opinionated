Under Arpaio's leadership, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) routinely targeted Latino drivers and passengers for pretextual traffic stops aimed at detecting violations of federal immigration law. Based on that and other unlawful conduct, the United States sued Arpaio, MCSO, and the County of Maricopa under two statutes: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (formerly codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014141\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on the claims relating to the unlawful traffic stops; the parties settled the remaining claims. Maricopa County is the lone appellant here. Its main contention is that it cannot be held liable for the unlawful traffic-stop policies implemented by Arpaio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We begin with a summary of the lengthy legal proceedings involving Arpaio's unlawful policing policies. In an earlier class action lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Melendres v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   , a group of plaintiffs representing a class of Latino drivers and passengers sued Arpaio, MCSO, and the County of Maricopa under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Title VI. They alleged that execution of Arpaio's racially\n   discriminatory traffic-stop policies violated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Following a bench trial, the district court ruled in the plaintiffs' favor and granted broad injunctive relief, which we largely upheld on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melendres v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528147\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/990/\">\n    695 F.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Melendres v.

Among other things, the United States challenged the legality of the same traffic-stop policies at issue in\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   . The United States named as defendants Arpaio, in his official capacity as Sheriff of Maricopa County; MCSO; and Maricopa County. Early on, the district court dismissed MCSO from the action in light of the Arizona Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Braillard v. Maricopa County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054210\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/481/\">\n    224 Ariz. 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054210\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/481/\">\n    232 P.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. App. 2010), which held that MCSO is a non-jural entity that cannot be sued in its own name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Throughout the proceedings below, the County argued that it too should be dismissed as a defendant, on two different grounds. First, the County argued that when a sheriff in Arizona adopts policies relating to law-enforcement matters, such as the traffic-stop policies at issue here, he does not act as a policymaker for the county. He instead acts as a policymaker for his own office, or perhaps for the State. The County contended that, because Arpaio's policies were not policies of the County, it could not be held liable for the constitutional violations caused by execution of them. Second, the County argued that, even if Arpaio acted as a policymaker for the County, neither Title VI nor\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   permits a local government to be held liable for the actions of its policymakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court rejected both of the County's arguments. The court then granted the United States' motion for summary judgment with respect to claims predicated on the traffic-stop policies found unlawful in\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   . The court held that the County was barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion from relitigating the issues decided in the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   action, which by that point had reached final judgment. The County does not contest that if the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   findings are binding here, they establish violations of Title VI and \u00a7 12601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Maricopa County advances three arguments: (1) Arpaio did not act as a final policymaker for the County; (2) neither Title VI nor \u00a7 12601 renders the County liable for the actions of its policymakers; and (3) the County is not bound by the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   findings. We address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We have already rejected Maricopa County's first argument-that Arpaio was not a final policymaker for the County. In\n   <em>\n    Melendres v. Maricopa County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n    815 F.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016) (\n   <em>\n    Melendres III\n   </em>\n   ), we noted that \"Arizona state law makes clear that Sheriff Arpaio's law-enforcement acts constitute Maricopa County policy since he 'has final policymaking authority.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n    at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flanders v.

Those\n   sources confirm that, with respect to law-enforcement matters, sheriffs in Arizona act as final policymakers for their respective counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Arizona's Constitution and statutes designate sheriffs as officers of the county. The Arizona Constitution states: \"There are hereby created\n   <em>\n    in and for each organized county of the state\n   </em>\n   the following officers who shall be elected by the qualified electors thereof: a sheriff, a county attorney, a recorder, a treasurer, an assessor, a superintendent of schools and at least three supervisors....\" Ariz. Const. Art. 12, \u00a7 3 (emphasis added).

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 11-441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(5) ). That same provision also lists a wide array of law-enforcement functions that fall within the sheriff's powers and duties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2011-441\">\n    Ariz.

Maricopa County does not explain why the Sheriff would be a final policymaker for the County with respect to jail administration but not with respect to the law-enforcement functions assigned to him in the same provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is true that sheriffs in Arizona are independently elected and that a county board of supervisors does not exercise complete control over a sheriff's actions. Nonetheless, \"the weight of the evidence\" strongly supports the conclusion that sheriffs in Arizona act as final policymakers for their respective counties on law-enforcement matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652975\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/781/#p786\">\n    520 U.S. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652975\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/781/#p786\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the traffic-stop policies at issue fall within the scope of a sheriff's law-enforcement duties, we conclude that Arpaio acted as a final policymaker for Maricopa County when he instituted those policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Maricopa County next argues that, even if Arpaio acted as the County's final policymaker, neither Title VI nor\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   permits the County to be held liable for his acts. Whether either\n   statute authorizes policymaker liability is an issue of first impression. We conclude, informed by precedent governing the liability of local governments under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that both statutes authorize policymaker liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The concept of policymaker liability under \u00a7 1983 is well developed. Section 1983 imposes liability on any \"person\" who, while acting under color of law, deprives someone of a right protected by the Constitution or federal law. In\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

In essence, policymaker liability helps determine when an act can properly be deemed a government's own act, such that the government may be held liable for deprivations of federal rights stemming from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We think this same concept of policymaker liability applies under both Title VI and \u00a7 12601.

Because this form of \"official policy\" liability resembles \u00a7 1983 policymaker liability, we think the proper standard for determining which employees have the power to establish an entity's \"official policy\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   under Title VI is the standard that governs under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We reach the same conclusion with respect to \u00a7 12601. As relevant here, the statute provides: \"It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority, to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers ... that deprives persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 12601 shares important similarities with \u00a7 1983. Section 1983 was enacted to create \"a broad remedy for violations of federally protected civil rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 12601 was also enacted as a remedy for violations of federal civil rights, specifically for violations that are systematically perpetrated by local police departments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barbara E. Armacost,\n   <em>\n    Organizational Culture and Police Misconduct\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Geo.%20Wash.%20L.%20Rev.%20453\">\n    72 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527-28 (2004). And, like \u00a7 1983, \u00a7 12601 imposes liability on local governments. Indeed, the language of \u00a7 12601 goes even further than \u00a7 1983, making it unlawful for \"any governmental authority, or any agent thereof, or any person acting on behalf of a governmental authority\" to engage in the prohibited conduct.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012601\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 12601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We need not decide whether the language of \u00a7 12601 imposes liability on the basis of general agency principles, as the United States urges here. It is enough for us to conclude, as we do, that \u00a7 12601 at least imposes liability on a governmental authority whose own official policy causes it to engage in \"a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\" that deprives persons of federally protected rights.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Because of the similarity between \u00a7 12601 and \u00a7 1983, we again see no reason to create a new standard for determining which officials have the power to establish a governmental authority's official policy. The same standard that governs under \u00a7 1983 applies here as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, Maricopa County is liable for violations of Title VI and \u00a7 12601 stemming from its own official policies. As discussed above, when Arpaio adopted the racially discriminatory traffic-stop policies at issue, he acted as a final policymaker for the County. Those policies were therefore the County's own, and the district court correctly held the County liable for the violations of Title VI and \u00a7 12601 caused by those policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lastly, Maricopa County challenges the district court's application of issue preclusion, which precluded the County from relitigating the lawfulness of Arpaio's traffic-stop policies. Given the nature of the County's involvement in the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   action, we conclude that the County is bound by the adverse findings rendered in that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The County was originally named as a defendant in the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   action, along with then-Sheriff Arpaio and MCSO. Early in the litigation, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the County as a named defendant, without prejudice to the County's being rejoined as a defendant later in the litigation if that became necessary to afford the plaintiffs full relief.\n   <em>\n    Melendres III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n    815 F.3d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In effect, the County agreed to delegate responsibility for defense of the action to Arpaio and MCSO, knowing that it could be bound by the judgment later despite its formal absence as a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The case proceeded to trial against Arpaio and MCSO and resulted in judgment against them. On appeal, we concluded that MCSO had been improperly named as a defendant because it could not be sued in its own name following the Arizona Court\n   of Appeals' intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Braillard\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Melendres II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180252\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1254/\">\n    784 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1260 (citing\n   <em>\n    Braillard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054210\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/481/\">\n    232 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1269 ). Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, we ordered that the County be rejoined as a defendant in lieu of MCSO.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054210\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/481/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We later explained that we did so \"[t]o assure a meaningful remedy for the plaintiffs despite MCSO's dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Melendres III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n    815 F.3d at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The County challenged this ruling in a petition for rehearing en banc and a petition for writ of certiorari, both of which were denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147984\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/645/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Given this history, the district court properly applied issue preclusion to bar the County from relitigating the\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   findings. Each of the elements of offensive non-mutual issue preclusion is satisfied: There was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the identical issues in the prior action; the issues were actually litigated in the prior action; the issues were decided in a final judgment; and the County was a party to the prior action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syverson v. International Business Machines Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5200327\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/472/1072/#p1078\">\n    472 F.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (9th Cir. 2007). Indeed, the County contests only the last element, arguing that it was not in fact a party to\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   . That is not accurate as a factual matter, because the County was originally named as a defendant in\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   and is now one of the parties bound by the judgment in that action. Moreover, even though the County did not remain a party to\n   <em>\n    Melendres\n   </em>\n   throughout the litigation, it effectively agreed to be bound by the judgment in that action. Such an agreement is one of the recognized exceptions to non-party preclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.
