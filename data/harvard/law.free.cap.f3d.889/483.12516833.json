They assert the City automatically issues\n   an arrest warrant whenever someone ticketed for violating its traffic and vehicle laws fails to pay a fine or appear in court. Once arrested, the motorist is allegedly presented with a Hobson's choice: Either pay a bond the amount of which was set in advance without any determination of his ability to pay it, or sit in jail possibly for days. The plaintiffs further contend that once a warrant has been issued, a motorist cannot avoid it by voluntarily returning to the municipal court or paying the outstanding fine, but must either submit to a custodial arrest or retain a lawyer to argue a motion before the municipal judge to vacate the warrant. If the court does not grant the motion, the motorist, whose presence in court the judge allegedly demands, will be arrested and jailed. Jail, the plaintiffs assert, is the means by which the City attempts to coerce the motorist into paying the bond to secure his release. The complaint indicates that the City's policy or custom involves additional steps that can ensnare motorists in repeated cycles of arrest, jailing, and pressure to pay a bond irrespective of their ability to do so. The plaintiffs maintain that since their poverty makes it difficult if not impossible to pay the bond, the City thereby violates, among other things, their due-process and equal-protection rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The City moved the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to dismiss the complaint on several grounds, including that the City is immune from suit and that the complaint fails to state a claim against the City. The district court dismissed a single count from the complaint on the consent of both parties but otherwise denied the motion, ruling that the City is not immune from suit and that the complaint sufficiently states a claim of municipal liability. The City appeals from the order denying it immunity, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We review a district court's decision about whether a party is immune from suit de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sample v.

The City argues that it enjoys immunity for two reasons: first, under the Eleventh Amendment since the municipal court, which is an arm of the State of Missouri, is responsible for most of the disputed practices and is thus the real party in interest here; and second, because the absolute immunity of the responsible officials renders the City immune as well.

As the City conceded at oral argument, it cannot identify a single case that has used the test to find that a municipality itself had immunity. We believe the reason is clear: The Supreme Court \"has consistently refused to construe the Amendment to afford protection to political subdivisions such as counties and municipalities, even though such entities exercise a 'slice of state power.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake Country Estates, Inc. v.

But if the municipal court rather than the City is responsible for the practices, the City will have a defense on the merits but not immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leatherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224800\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/163/#p166\">\n    507 U.S. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224800\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/163/#p166\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the court were entitled to immunity-an issue we do not opine on-that immunity would not shield the City from its separate liability if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City argues that it is also immune from suit since all of the individuals the complaint identifies as participating in the contested practices are personally immune from suit. \"[I]f individual officials are immune from liability on the acts that allegedly constitute a municipality's policy or custom,\" the City asserts, \"there are no unlawful acts which may form an unlawful policy or custom in the first place, precluding municipal liability.\" But even if we accepted the City's premise that its officials all enjoy personal immunity from suit, it hardly follows that they did not engage in any unlawful acts or that the City is thereby immune as well.

But in\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   we used that language to explain why a city could not be held liable \"on either an unconstitutional policy or custom theory or on a failure to train or supervise theory\" once it has been determined that the underlying official conduct was \"objectively reasonable\" and\n   thus did not violate the plaintiff's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955260\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/920/#p922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   we cited six cases that allegedly applied the \"general rule\"; in five of them we simply held that because the challenged official conduct was not unconstitutional, the municipality had nothing to be liable for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McVay v.

Scott-Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n    523 U.S. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), although a municipality's legislators are all absolutely immune from suit for their legislative activities, the victims of their \"legislative abuse\" are not without recourse since under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   the municipality itself can still \"be held liable for constitutional violations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n    at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503146\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/44/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is now clear that the absolute immunity of its policymakers does not shield a city from liability for its policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonough v. Anoka Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340998\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/931/#p941\">\n    799 F.3d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941-42 (8th Cir. 2015). We have indicated, moreover, that our statements in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   on absolute immunity and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability were dicta: Since the plaintiff had \"claimed only that [the county] was liable because of its 'authorization and ratification ... of the acts of its agents,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11961554\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1235/\">\n    999 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1238 n.2., we \"relied on a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   theory to find the county not liable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sample\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355473\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/913/#p915\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   917 n.3. Our musings on whether the county could have been held liable under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   instead were thus not binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   So despite our occasional use of overbroad language, our case law has been clear since\n   <em>\n    Praprotnik\n   </em>\n   that although \"there must be an unconstitutional act by a municipal employee\" before a municipality can be held liable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russell v. Hennepin Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8940903\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/841/#p846\">\n    420 F.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846 (8th Cir. 2005), there \"need not be a finding that a municipal employee is liable in his or her individual capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moyle v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667878\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/814/#p818\">\n    571 F.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818 (8th Cir. 2009). The City's\n   contrary rule conflicts not only with our longstanding precedent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mader v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5875868\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/794/#p800\">\n    654 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc), but with one of the Supreme Court's reasons for denying municipalities immunity under \u00a7 1983 : The need to provide \"victims of municipal malfeasance\" with a remedy, especially since the officials responsible for the injury may enjoy personal immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777480\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/622/#p657\">\n    445 U.S. at 651, 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777480\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/622/#p657\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At oral argument, the City raised for the first time its concern that if the City is not granted immunity, the plaintiffs may use this suit to obtain discovery from the State of Missouri and its officials. We normally do not consider issues raised for the first time at oral argument,\n   <em>\n    Bennie v. Munn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282728\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/392/\">\n    822 F.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 n.3 (8th Cir. 2016), but will observe that any State official or entity the plaintiffs subpoena for discovery may raise a claim of sovereign immunity at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alltel Commc'ns, LLC v. DeJordy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752528,7338895\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/1100/\">\n    675 F.3d 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1104-05 (8th Cir. 2012). The district court may address in the first instance whether the subpoena can be quashed on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City maintains finally that we may exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court's order declining to dismiss the complaint on the basis of the insufficiency of its allegations of municipal liability. Unlike the district court's denial of the City's defense of immunity, the question of whether the complaint states a claim of municipal liability cannot normally be reviewed on interlocutory appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hafley v. Lohman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044252\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/264/#p266\">\n    90 F.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266 (8th Cir. 1996). We may review that issue only if it is \"coterminous with, or subsumed in,\" the issue of the City's immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    Manning v. Cotton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275956\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/663/#p671\">\n    862 F.3d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 671 (8th Cir. 2017). The issues are not inextricably intertwined here, however, since we have determined that the district court correctly denied the City immunity without having found it necessary to decide whether the complaint sufficiently pleads the City's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Since the issues are separate, we do not have jurisdiction to review whether the complaint states a claim of municipal liability, and we express no view on that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The Honorable Catherine D.
