Now before the court is appellees' motion for an award of sanctions against appellant pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellees ask the court to impose attorney's fees, double costs, or both on Appellant Shmuel Erde.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 38 provides that \"[i]f a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\" Rule 38 does not prescribe a time limit within which to file such a motion. This court has not specifically addressed the time limit for filing a motion seeking sanctions pursuant to Rule 38 if the motion is brought after the court issues a disposition on the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Rule 38 provides a basis for an award of attorney's fees, we find that a motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 38 should be filed within the time limits for filing a request for attorney's fees under Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.6(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blixseth v.

R. 39-1.6(a). Having concluded that the motion for sanctions is timely, we now turn to the merits of the motion.

Appellant's motion to strike the motion for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"An appeal is frivolous if the result is obvious or if the claims of error are wholly without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Malhiot v.

The appeal of the district court's orders was wholly without merit, and sought review of multiple district court orders over which this court lacked jurisdiction. Moreover, we note that the underlying district court action and burdensome post-judgment motions are part of appellant's ongoing\n   efforts to alter or amend a bankruptcy court order entered on October 2, 1984, dismissing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trohimovich v.
