We conclude that the district court did not err in overruling those objections, because \u00a7 554 does not require the government to prove that the defendant knew the nature of the \"merchandise, article, or object\" that the defendant was exporting contrary to law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 11, 2016, Gabriel Rivero was driving a pickup truck from the United States into Mexico at the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona. When his truck passed a speed bump approximately 300 meters from the border, a spare tire fell from the back of his vehicle. Rivero attempted to load the tire back into the truck, but he eventually moved it to the side of the road instead and drove away, entering Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cameras captured the incident. Officers dispatched to the abandoned tire observed ammunition on the ground next to the tire and more ammunition visible through a rupture in the tire. In total, officers recovered 5,441 rounds of ammunition from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Approximately one hour after the officers were notified of the tire, Gabriel Rivero's brother, Sergio, drove the same truck through the same port of entry, coming from Mexico, and officers seized the vehicle. While officers were interviewing Sergio, Gabriel Rivero, returning to the United States on foot, was identified through security camera footage. Officers found that Gabriel lacked authority to export the ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2016, Gabriel Rivero entered the United States again and was detained by law enforcement. Rivero initially invoked his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, but later asked to speak with the officers as they were preparing to transport him to county jail. Officers showed Rivero pictures of the truck, the tire, and the ammunition. Rivero admitted that he had been driving the truck when the incident occurred. One of the officers, investigator Daniel Chaves asked, \"Why would you choose to transport weapons and ammunition?\" Rivero responded, \"It was ammo.\" Chaves then asked Rivero, \"Why did you choose to\n   transport ammo?\" Rivero responded that he \"couldn't find a job,\" and was offered $500 to transport the ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 6, 2016, the government charged Rivero on two counts: (1) smuggling goods from the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20121.1\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 121.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123.1 ; and (2) possession of ammunition by a convicted felon under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2). Count 1 alleged that Rivero had \"knowingly attempted to export and send from the United States any merchandise, article, or object contrary to any law or regulation of the United States,\" and listed the various types of ammunition recovered. Count 1 further alleged that the export of such ammunition was contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20121.1\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 121.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123.1 and therefore in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Rivero moved to sever Count 2 and the district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A three-day jury trial on Count 1 was held in December 2016. At trial, Rivero presented evidence to show that he lacked \"knowledge prior to transporting [the truck] that there was ammunition in the vehicle,\" but rather \"only learned that there was ammunition in the vehicle once the wheel fell out\" and ruptured. At the close of the evidence, Rivero moved for a directed verdict, which the district court denied. The district court then outlined the proposed jury instructions, to which Rivero did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In closing argument, the government argued that the evidence showed that Rivero knew he was smuggling something that was illegal. Rivero's counsel objected on the ground that Count 1 required that a person \"kn[o]w he was transporting weaponry, armaments, munitions across the line,\" and that the government had to prove that Rivero knew he was smuggling ammunition. The district court overruled this objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court then instructed the jury that the elements of the offense for\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the defendant knowingly attempted to export and send from the United States any item, or received, concealed, bought, sold, or in any manner facilitated the transportation, concealment or sale of the item prior to exportation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the defendant knew the item was intended for exportation, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the exportation of the item is contrary to any law or regulation of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rivero's counsel objected to this instruction on the same ground, and the district court again overruled it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count 1 and the government dismissed Count 2. Rivero was sentenced to 92 months imprisonment, followed by 3 years of supervised release. Because Rivero's conviction violated the terms of supervised release from a prior felony conviction, his supervised release from that conviction was revoked and he was given a 10-month sentence for the prior conviction, to run concurrently with his sentence for his violation of \u00a7 554(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Rivero argues that when the government prosecutes a defendant under \u00a7 554(a) for exporting items contrary to \u00a7 2778, the government must prove that the defendant knew that the exported items were arms, munitions, or military equipment as specified in \u00a7 2778 and the associated regulations. Second, Rivero argues that in such a prosecution, \u00a7 554(a) incorporates the mens rea of \u00a7 2778(c), such that the government must prove that the defendant smuggled such items \"willfully,\" not just \"knowingly\" as stated in \u00a7 554(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Supreme Court has provided guidance on how to interpret and apply the term \"knowingly\" in a criminal statute such as \u00a7 554(a).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Nothing in the language of the\n   statute requires knowledge of the nature of the merchandise, article, or object. If Rivero knew that the truck contained merchandise that was unlawful to export, but elected not to look in the truck, he would meet the requirements of \u00a7 554(a) of knowing that he was exporting \"merchandise ... contrary to law.\" Second, applying \"knowingly\" in this manner does not \"criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Liparota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204090\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/419/#p426\">\n    471 U.S. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204090\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/419/#p426\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By contrast, interpreting \u00a7 554(a) to require the government to prove that the defendant knew the nature of the \"merchandise, article or object\" would lead to the absurd result that individuals could avoid criminal liability simply by being willfully blind to the precise nature of the goods they were unlawfully exporting or attempting to export.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Cardenas\n   </em>\n   provides no support for Rivero's argument that the government had to prove he knew he was exporting or attempting to export ammunition; rather, it supports our conclusion that the government need not prove that a defendant had specific intent to violate \u00a7 2778.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We also reject Rivero's argument that \u00a7 554(a) incorporates the mens rea of\n   \"willfully\" from \u00a7 2778(c). Although \u00a7 2778(c) imposes criminal penalties on \"[a]ny person who\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   violates\" the registration and licensing requirements applicable to persons intending to export certain munitions,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added), Rivero was not charged with violating \u00a7 2778. Rather, Rivero was charged with violating \u00a7 554(a) by exporting items contrary to law, which requires the mens rea of\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   exporting such items. The government proved this element of the \u00a7 554(a) offense by establishing that Rivero knowingly exported ammunition without a license, in violation of \u00a7 2778(b). The government did not have to prove the elements necessary to convict Rivero under \u00a7 2778(c), because conviction under \u00a7 2778(c) is not an element of the offense of violating \u00a7 554(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm both Rivero's conviction and his revocation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Section 554(a) provides in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    Whoever fraudulently or knowingly exports or sends from the United States, or attempts to export or send from the United States, any merchandise, article, or object contrary to any law or regulation of the United States, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise, article or object, prior to exportation, knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or regulation of the United States, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Rivero does not argue that the district court erred in instructing the jury that he did not need to know that exporting the \"merchandise, article or object\" was unlawful, so we do not reach this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
