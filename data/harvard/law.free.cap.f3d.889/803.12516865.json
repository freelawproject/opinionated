The district court granted Lang a Certificate of Appealability (COA) on his first and second grounds for relief, and we granted an expansion of the COA to include three additional claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These claims can be reduced to two main issues. The first involves a juror who was related through marriage to one of the victims of the homicide, whom the trial court removed from the jury prior to deliberations. The second concerns the nature and volume of mitigation evidence presented by Lang's defense counsel. For the reasons that follow, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the denial of relief by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2006, Lang shot and killed Jaron Burditte and Marnell Cheek during a botched drug deal turned robbery in Canton, Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lang was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder and one count of aggravated robbery with firearm\n   specifications. In 2007, the case was tried before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror 386\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the jury had been empaneled and the first two witnesses had testified, the prosecutor notified the trial court that Cheek's father recognized Juror 386 as the daughter of the woman married to Cheek's brother. The trial court decided to address the issue at the next break, after two more witnesses testified. The court later noted that, because the jurors were in the courtroom, they did not have the opportunity to interact with each other. During the break, the trial court and counsel questioned Juror 386 outside the presence of the other jurors. Juror 386 acknowledged her connection to Cheek and said she had met her once and had attended her funeral. The juror said she learned of Cheek's death from her grandfather and from what she had read in the newspaper; however, she denied talking to her mother, step-father, or family members about the case or learning anything about it. The trial court also questioned Juror 386 about her contact with the other jurors. She denied telling any of them about her connection to Cheek. Juror 386 was excused by agreement of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before dismissing her, the trial court confirmed that Juror 386 had not spoken with other jurors and instructed her to have no contact with other jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court:\n   </strong>\n   You cannot discuss this at all with any of the other jurors. You have not done so. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror 386:\n   </strong>\n   No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court:\n   </strong>\n   No? You cannot discuss this with them. You cannot call them on the phone and talk to them about this. If you would see them on the street or at a store while this case is still going on, you can't discuss with them why you were removed from jury service or anything else about this case whatsoever. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror 386:\n   </strong>\n   Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court:\n   </strong>\n   Have you talked to any of them about this whatsoever up until this very moment? Have you talked to any of the other jurors about this at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror 386:\n   </strong>\n   No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court:\n   </strong>\n   Okay thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court then summoned the jurors and told them that Juror 386 was excused because \"it was determined that she may have had a relationship with either a witness or a party or somebody that was involved in the case.\" The trial court asked the jurors as a group whether Juror 386 had talked to them about knowing someone involved in the case. The judge stated: \"I take it by your silence that she did not.\" Neither Lang's counsel nor the prosecutor asked to question the jurors individually. Juror 386 was replaced, and the trial resumed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lang\n   </em>\n   , 954 N.E.2d at 613. Lang does not claim a motion for a mistrial was made. When the prosecution rested, Lang presented no evidence. The jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. Thereafter, the trial court held a separate hearing for mitigation evidence and sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Mitigation Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the mitigation hearing, the jury heard evidence, chiefly from Lang's mother and half-sister, about Lang's difficult and dysfunctional childhood. In his opening statement, Lang's defense counsel, Anthony Koukoutas, said, \"I am not here to make excuses.\" He continued to say, \"I want to show you that [Lang] [i]s not just a name on a case file or a name that appears in the newspaper, that he's an actual human being.\" Counsel then previewed what he expected Lang's mother, Tracie Carter, and Lang's half-sister, Yahnene Robinson, to testify. He emphasized\n   Lang's father's negative qualities and how he abducted, abused, and neglected Lang. He also referred to evidence of Lang's psychiatric problems and the fact that Lang was severely withdrawn and emotionally scarred after living with his father for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Ohio Court of Appeals summarized Carter's and Robinson's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 315} Yahnena Robinson, the defendant's half-sister, had a close relationship with Lang before he was ten years old. She described it as a \"typical brother sister relationship.\" Lang was also a \"good student.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 316} Robinson testified that Lang's father, Edward Lang Sr., abused their mother and was on drugs. Their mother would not allow Edward to visit Lang very often because of \"his history and his anger problems.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 317} After Lang graduated from elementary school, Lang visited his father in Delaware. The visit was supposed to last for two weeks, but Edward did not allow Lang to return home. Two years later, their mother found Lang and brought him home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 318} Lang was happy when he first came home, but later, his mood changed. According to Robinson, \"he would be sad sometimes, quiet * * * [and] other times he would look real hurt or be angry.\" Subsequently, Lang received counseling, went to a psychiatric facility, and spent time in a residential facility for his mental-health problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 319} Robinson also testified that Lang has a two-year-old daughter whose name is Kanela Lang.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 320} Tracy Carter, the defendant's mother, testified that Lang is the third of her four children. Carter met Edward Lang Sr. when he was her landlord. Carter did not have money to pay the rent, and she slept with him in exchange for lodging. Carter and Edward then developed a relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 321} Carter stated that Edward became violently abusive when he was intoxicated and using drugs. After Lang was born, Edward went to jail for stabbing Carter and setting her apartment on fire. Edward was also incarcerated for child molestation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 322} Carter would not allow Lang to visit his father until a court order ordered her to do so. Carter lived in Baltimore, Maryland, and Edward lived in Delaware. When he was ten years old, Lang went to see his father in Delaware for a two-week visit. However, Edward did not allow Lang to return home after the two weeks ended, and Carter did not see her son for the next two years. Carter made repeated attempts to find Lang in Delaware, but was unsuccessful. Finally, Carter found Lang and brought him home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 323} Carter stated that her son was malnourished when she found him and was wearing the same clothing that he had been wearing when he left. Lang also had a burn on his shoulder, a gash on his hand, and other bruises. Lang told his mother that the burn was a cigarette burn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 324} Before he saw his father, Lang had been treated with Depakote, Lithium, and Risperdal for depression and other conditions. Carter made sure that he took these medications on a regular basis. However, Lang did not continue to take them when he was with his father, because Edward did not obtain refills for the prescriptions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 325} After returning home, Lang was withdrawn. Lang told Carter that he was fine and did not want to talk to her about what had happened. But Carter learned from her son, Mendez, that Edward had sexually abused Lang.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 326} Lang has received extensive psychiatric and other treatment. Carter testified, \"He stayed in the Bridges Program twice for 90 days. He stayed at Woodburn Respiratory [sic] Treatment Center for a year. And he stayed off and on at * * * [the] Sheppard Pratt Center [a crisis center] 28 times.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 327} Lang has one child, Kanela. Carter states, \"He has taken care of his daughter ever since the mother was pregnant. * * * [There] was nothing that he wouldn't do for her and for the baby.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 328} Lang did not finish high school. He dropped out of the 11th grade and \"went to take care of his baby's mother.\" Lang got a job working for the census department. In June 2006, Lang moved to Canton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 329} As a final matter, Carter told the jury, \"We all are suffering. * * * I never sat here and said my son was a perfect child. I never sat here and said that my child had a good life or a bad life. But I am asking you not to kill my child.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   , 954 N.E.2d at 643-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After Carter and Robinson testified, the prosecutor began his closing argument. He attempted to minimize the testimony of Lang's mother and half-sister, stating, \"We know now that Eddie was born in Baltimore, Maryland, that until the age of 10 life seemed to be pretty good. From 10 to 12 his life was allegedly not so good.\" The prosecutor continued to discredit Lang's mitigation narrative, \"[W]e know that his mother on numerous occasions sought help for Eddie, but Eddie didn't take his medication.\" In his charge to the jury, the prosecutor stated that the \"aggravating circumstances that you found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt now outweigh those mitigating factors by that same burden.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In response, Koukoutas started his closing argument by reminding the jury of the seriousness of the death penalty. He returned to his theme that the jurors had learned about Lang as a person. \"You learned that he had siblings, that what like the prosecutor said, pretty normal childhood up until he was ten.\" Koukoutas depicted Lang's mother in a relatively positive light, in contrast to Lang's abusive father. He asked the jury to consider how she was ashamed to testify that she had exchanged sex for rent to Lang's father-a drug user and a convicted child molester who beat her while she was pregnant with Lang. Koukoutas said no one would ever know exactly what happened to Lang during the two years he was with his father, but he speculated that Lang's father may have \"molested him or even pimped him out to get drugs.\" Koukoutas stressed the impact, both physical and psychological, on Lang of those two years when he was kept away from his mother. In conclusion, Lang's counsel acknowledged the loss to the victims' families, and he urged the jury to consider the consequences to Lang and his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The jury deliberated for approximately eleven hours before recommending that Lang be sentenced to death for the aggravated murder of Cheek and to life imprisonment for the aggravated murder of Burditte. The trial court adopted this recommendation and sentenced Lang accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On direct appeal, Lang presented twenty-one propositions of law, arguing among other things: juror bias and ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to\n   adequately prepare and present mitigation evidence. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Lang's convictions and sentence of death.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4113423\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/129/512/\">\n    129 Ohio St.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    954 N.E.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Thereafter, Lang filed an application to reopen his direct appeal under Ohio App. R. 26(B), alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but the Ohio Supreme Court denied this application in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In 2008, while his direct appeal was pending, Lang filed a state post-conviction petition, which raised fourteen claims, including several that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The trial court dismissed Lang's petition and denied his requests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of the post-conviction petition.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lang\n   </em>\n   , No. 2009 CA 00187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203314494\">\n    2010 WL 3314494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ohio Ct. App. Aug. 23, 2010). The Ohio Supreme Court declined Lang's post-conviction appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lang's new counsel filed a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition, alleging seventeen grounds for relief. In 2015, the district court denied Lang's habeas petition.\n   <em>\n    Lang v. Bobby\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:12 CV 2923,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205393574\">\n    2014 WL 5393574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 23, 2014). The district court concluded that the decisions of the Ohio courts were neither contrary to, nor unreasonable applications of, clearly established federal law and were not unreasonable determinations of the facts. However, the district court granted Lang a COA on Ground One, ineffective assistance of trial counsel regarding mitigating evidence, and Ground Two, juror bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We granted Lang an expansion of the COA to include three additional claims: Ground Three, ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to question individual jurors about their conversations with a biased juror; Ground Four, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on counsel's failure to raise claims of juror bias on direct appeal;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ground Fourteen, ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on trial counsel's characterization of Lang's childhood as \"normal.\" Therefore, the questions before us in this appeal are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) Whether Lang's due process rights and rights to an unbiased jury were violated when a juror who was related to one of the victims was seated on the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) Whether trial counsel were ineffective for failing to question individual jurors about their conversations with the allegedly biased juror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (3) Whether Lang's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately and properly investigate, develop, and present significant mitigation evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (4) Whether Lang's trial counsel were ineffective for characterizing Lang's childhood as \"normal.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Juror Bias\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lang first claims that his constitutional right to an unbiased jury was violated because Juror 386 was seated, albeit briefly. Lang argues that \"Juror 386 never should have been on the jury or given the opportunity to taint Appellant's jury. The most basic disqualification of a juror occurs when the juror has a familial connection to the case.\" He contends that the trial court erred by failing to immediately remove Juror 386 and instead waiting for the next break in the trial, permitting two witnesses to testify in the interim. Lang also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to individually voir dire the other jurors after Juror 386 was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Lang raised the juror bias claim and the related claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. The Ohio Supreme Court held that Juror 386's presence on the jury before being excused did not taint the jury because Juror 386 assured the trial court that she had not talked to any of the other jurors about her relationship to Cheek, and the other jurors indicated that they had had no conversations with her about the matter.\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    954 N.E.2d at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mitigation Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing were certified for appeal.

In this case, Lang raised essentially the same claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in his post-conviction proceedings. Because the Ohio Court of Appeals issued the last reasoned opinion on Lang's post-conviction claims, we begin by reviewing that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of Lang's post-conviction petition.\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203314494\">\n    2010 WL 3314494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Shortly after Lang was indicted, his counsel requested discovery, moved for funds for an investigator, a psychological expert, and a mitigation expert, and filed\n   over eighty-two motions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Therefore, the Ohio Court of Appeals rejected Lang's argument that counsel waited until the last minute to gather mitigating evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. Holding that that counsel's strategy was to treat Lang's mother sympathetically, to humanize Lang, and to present his mental health issues in lay, rather than detailed, scientific terms, the Ohio Court of Appeals concluded that Lang's counsel performed reasonably in the mitigation phase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The state court also held that even if counsel's performance was deficient, Lang was not prejudiced by counsel's performance. The court found that Lang's mother and half-sister presented a detailed picture of his youth, mental health problems, and abuse by his father.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Summarizing Lang's additional, post-conviction evidence, the Ohio Court of Appeals recounted Lang's father's physical and sexual abuse of Lang's mother, Lang's brother's physical and sexual abuse of Lang and his sister, and Lang's father's sexual, physical, and emotional abuse of Lang.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7. The court also found that, after the two years spent with his father, Lang began using drugs, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and attempted suicide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Moreover, Lang's mother abandoned him at times and did not ensure that he took his mood disorder medications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the Ohio Court of Appeals was unpersuaded that this \"additional and more detailed evidence about the [Lang]'s upbringing and mental health issues would have created a reasonable probability that the jury would have recommended a life sentence, rather than the death penalty, for the Marnell Cheek killing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The district court agreed, holding that the Ohio Court of Appeals' denial of Lang's claims was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons articulated by the district court, we also find that the Ohio court reasonably determined that defense counsel's performance at the mitigation hearing was not ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a threshold matter, Lang did not submit affidavits from his trial counsel, and both the post-conviction trial court and the district court denied Lang an evidentiary hearing. Thus, there is no direct evidence of Lang's trial counsel's mitigation strategy. However, invoices filed with the trial court indicate that counsel began preparing for the mitigation hearing soon after taking Lang's case. Counsel hired a mitigation investigator and a psychologist and spent several hundred hours preparing for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Lang's post-conviction materials suggest that counsel either chose not to present or perhaps overlooked other evidence about Lang and his family, but there are reasonable strategic reasons for counsel to have chosen not to present these materials. This additional evidence could have opened the door to evidence of bad character on cross-examination and rebuttal. Reports from various social services agencies documented how Lang's mother neglected, abused, and abandoned Lang and his siblings. A psychologist's expert report filed by Lang in his post-conviction materials indicated that Lang had no friends, threatened people, set fires, made improper sexual advances, was too violent to be placed in juvenile detention, and did not comply with mental health treatment. Thus, counsel's choice to have only Lang's mother and sister testify at the mitigation hearing and to not call a psychologist may have been strategic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   There is a strong presumption that an attorney's attention to some issues at the exclusion of others reflects tactics rather than neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yarborough\n   </em>\n   , 540 U.S. at 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896672\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/1/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic\n   choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 690-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the post-conviction evidence revealed, Lang's childhood prior to age ten was anything but normal. However, Lang's mitigation evidence centered on Lang's experiences at the hands of his father who, as Lang's mother testified, was absent until Lang was ten years old. Lang's counsel echoed the prosecutor's characterization of Lang's early life as \"normal\" presumably to avoid blaming Lang's mother-his primary mitigation witness-for his client's difficulties. Therefore, the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded that counsel's approach did not result in ineffective assistance of counsel because it \"allowed the defense to focus the jury's attention on defense counsel's argument that addressed Lang's abuse after his father abducted him.\"\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    954 N.E.2d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   undertook a far more detailed investigation into potential juror bias than the inquiry in the case at bar, because it examined both the scope of the impermissible extraneous information and its potential impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The investigations in\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   varied in degree and kind from what occurred in this case. A sufficient investigation\n   into potential juror bias must proceed along multiple dependent axes. A trial court cannot determine the prejudicial impact of potential extraneous influence upon a juror until it discovers all the means by which that extraneous influence may have touched the juror. It would be akin to a doctor trying to determine if a patient had caught an infectious disease from an afflicted acquaintance by asking only if the patient had shared a drink with that person, and not determining whether the two individuals had other interactions through which the disease could be communicated. Here, the trial court's one question directed to the entire panel did not sufficiently determine the potential scope of the extraneous influence on the remaining jurors, because it was such a limited question. Juror 386 may not have mentioned her relationship to the victim Cheek, but she could have made other prejudicial comments. The remaining jurors were not even aware to whom Juror 386 was related, so may not have realized that any other comments she may have made were inappropriate. The remaining jurors' silence to the trial court's one question leaves us unable to determine anything about the true extent of Juror 386's prejudicial impact. Therefore, the trial court could not have sufficiently investigated the effect of the tainted Juror 386 on the remaining jurors' ability to remain impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   hearings in\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   may have satisfied the Supreme Court's requirement that a trial court \"should determine the circumstances, the impact thereof upon the juror, and whether or not it was prejudicial, in a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate,\"\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300100\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/227/\">\n    347 U.S. at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300100\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/227/\">\n    74 S.Ct. 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but the trial court's inquiry in Lang's case into the potential bias caused by having his victim's niece by marriage empaneled on his jury and serving for a day on the jury before being excused falls far below this minimum threshold. I believe, therefore, that the Supreme Court of Ohio unreasonably determined that the trial court's one-question \"hearing\" was sufficient, because the one question asked was erroneously focused on only one means by which Juror 386 could have biased the jury. It was thus unreasonable to conclude that this one-question \"hearing\" could determine the potential prejudicial impact on the remaining jurors as required by\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that the Supreme Court of Ohio deemed the one-question hearing sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   because \"[n]either the state nor the defense counsel objected to the questioning or requested an additional inquiry,\"\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    954 N.E.2d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as the Supreme Court has held that the trial court has an independent duty to ensure an impartial jury and conduct an adequate\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   hearing if required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/#p217\">\n    455 U.S. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/#p217\">\n    102 S.Ct. 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Due process means ... a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\").

R. 22-3 (App'x Vol. 29 at 339-71) (Page ID #8015-47). His half-sister, Yahnena Robinson, testified that Lang's father, known as Coffee, abused their mother and was a drug addict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 341 (Page ID #8017).

After their mother found Lang and brought him back to Maryland, Robinson described Lang's emotional state as noticeably different.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 344-45 (Page ID #8020-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   After Robinson testified, Lang's trial counsel called Lang's mother, Tracy Carter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 348 (Page ID #8024). She told the jury that she met Coffee when she was eighteen; he was her landlord and, because she was a single, teenage mother with no money, she traded sex for free rent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349 (Page ID #8025). Carter testified that Coffee was a violent drug addict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-50 (Page ID #8025-26). According to Carter, Coffee was around for some period of time after Lang was born, but he did not reconnect with his son until Lang was ten.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 350 (Page ID #8026). In the interim, Coffee was incarcerated for setting Carter's apartment on fire, raping Carter, and molesting a child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Lang was ten, his father gained court-ordered visitation rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 351 (Page ID #8027).

When Carter was finally reunited with Lang, he was wearing the same clothes and shoes he had worn when he left her two years prior and weighed less than ninety pounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 355 (Page ID #8031). Lang had a cigarette burn on his shoulder, a gash on his hand, and bruises on his body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 356 (Page ID #8032). Furthermore, his emotional problems-which he had suffered from prior to this period-were exacerbated, and Carter testified that Lang visited a psychiatric facility twenty-eight times, including multiple times as an inpatient, during his childhood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 356-60 (Page ID #8032-36). Carter suspected that Coffee had sexually abused Lang, but testified that Lang had never admitted this to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 361-61 (Page ID #8037-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Although Lang's mother and sister painted a fairly dire picture of Lang's childhood, their testimony did not accurately portray the extraordinary extent of the abuse and deprivation Lang endured as a child. In its decision on Lang's post-conviction appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals summarized much of the mitigation evidence not presented by Lang's trial counsel.\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   , No. 2009 CA 00187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203314494\">\n    2010 WL 3314494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-*7. Contrary to the testimony presented and the arguments made at the mitigation phase, Coffee had substantial interactions with his son during Lang's early years. Coffee sexually and physically abused Lang when he was a toddler.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. \"During that same time period, appellant and his siblings also 'witnessed Coffee tying their mother up [for] 3-4 days, ordering her to perform fellatio, stabbing her in [the] chest with a pair of scissors, shooting her in the back of her leg, shooting windows out, cursing at her, beating her up, and attempting to set the house on fire with them in it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original). Lang and his siblings\n   also \"witnessed Coffee raping [their mother] on several occasions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Furthermore, trial counsel did not develop the facts of Lang's abduction by Coffee during Carter's testimony. \"During the time [Lang] lived with his father, he endured physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. [Lang] was forced to stay in his bedroom for days at a time, and he was repeatedly beaten with anything in reach. In addition to enduring the physical abuse, [Lang] was falsely told by Coffee that his mother was dead.

Lang's brother hit Lang in the head with a baseball bat, and \"acted out sexually towards [Lang and his sister], ordering them to perform oral sex on him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Lastly, Lang's trial counsel did not present to the jury evidence that Carter frequently abandoned Lang and his siblings, leaving her children to care for themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Ineffective Investigation, Development, and Presentation of Mitigation Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Lang first argues that his trial counsel's investigation, development, and presentation of mitigation investigation was constitutionally inadequate. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Trial counsel began preparing for the mitigation phase in December 2006, requesting funds for a private investigator, psychological expert, and defense mitigation expert. R. 17-1 (App'x Vol. 1 at 1-23) (Page ID #195-217). However, the record shows that trial counsel did not obtain much of the corroborating documentary mitigation evidence until too late. On July 9, 2007, the expert psychologist sent a fax to trial counsel inquiring whether they had obtained Lang's records yet. R. 19-3 (App'x Vol. 13 at 69) (Page ID #2852) (\"No Lang records yet, I gather ... ? ? ?\" (ellipses in original) ). The record indicates that the psychologist did not receive the relevant records until the day after the mitigation phase, when the jury had already recommended that Lang be executed for the murder of Cheek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70 (Page ID #2853). Additionally, the private investigator for the defense received only three-quarters of Lang's foster care records less than a week before the mitigation phase and it appears he may not have received the remaining records prior to the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68 (Page ID #2851). The investigation and preparation of mitigation witnesses was similarly sparse. His mother Carter-the supposed lynchpin of the mitigation strategy-had one twenty-five minute meeting with the mitigation specialist less than ten days before trial and met substantively with trial counsel only once: the day before she testified. R. 18-4 (App'x Vol. 9 at 98) (Page ID #2451). Despite these deficiencies, trial counsel repeatedly represented to the trial court that the investigation into mitigation evidence was proceeding or had proceeded smoothly. R. 22-1 (App'x Vol. 27 at 124) (Page ID #6448); R. 22-3 (App'x Vol. 29 at 378) (Page ID #8054);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 22-1 (App'x Vol. 27 at 92) (Page ID #6416).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As the majority recognizes, \"Lang's post-conviction materials suggest that counsel either chose not to present or perhaps overlooked other evidence about Lang and his family.\" Maj.

Lang argues that, by making this statement, his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because they misrepresented the evidence. Appellant Br. at 53. On direct review, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that this statement was not a misrepresentation of the evidence and that it \"maintained defense credibility and allowed the defense to focus the jury's attention on defense counsel's argument that addressed Lang's abuse after his father abducted him.\"\n   <em>\n    Lang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    954 N.E.2d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even considering the paucity of evidence presented regarding Lang's life prior to age ten, the state court's conclusion that the description of Lang's early childhood as \"normal\" was true strains credulity-as the majority recognizes, Maj. Op. at 816. Lang's mother, Carter, testified that Coffee was physically abusive towards her when she was pregnant with Lang. R. 22-3 (App'x Vol. 29 at 350) (Page ID #8026).

There is a reasonable probability that one juror would have weighed the balance of the mitigation evidence and aggravating circumstances differently if Lang's trial counsel had not misrepresented Lang's early childhood during closing argument.\n   <em>\n    Wiggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p524\">\n    539 U.S. at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p524\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Lang has satisfied both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   : He has demonstrated that his counsel's erroneous characterization of his early childhood during closing arguments fell below an objectively reasonable standard, and there is a reasonable probability a juror would have reached the opposite decision with regards to the imposition of the death penalty in the absence of this deficiency.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Although our habeas review is deferential,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and our review of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims especially so,\n   <em>\n    Pinholster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    563 U.S. at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12458282,5943445\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/170/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I believe that Lang has overcome this high threshold and proven that he is entitled to relief on three of the five grounds presented. To take a step back: A relative of Lang's victim was empaneled on his jury. We have no record evidence of how this affected the jury's verdict of guilt because the trial court's one-question inquiry allowing a response via silence was less than minimal. Furthermore, trial counsel's investigation into mitigation evidence was so haphazard that they did not receive records until after Lang was sentenced to death and barely engaged with Lang's mother, the key mitigation witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   And in trial counsel's final argument to the jury prior to this sentence of death, counsel falsely described Lang's horrific childhood as \"normal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   If the majority is correct that our constitutional rights to an impartial jury and legal representation are so minimal that Lang's trial was constitutionally acceptable, then this case is more about the parsimonious interpretation of our constitutional protections than about the reasonableness of executing a person following this paucity of due process.\n   <em>\n    Caudill v.

I do not believe, however, that the protections guaranteed by our Constitution are so minimal, or our review so constrained by the standard of review, that we are forced to condone the egregious mistakes that occurred during Lang's trial.

Maj. Op. at 815-16. This conclusion is puzzling. If Carter's credibility was not impugned by her failure to protect Lang from Coffee's abduction and rescue him, why would her credibility be hurt by her failure to protect Lang from the repeated physical and mental trauma to which he was exposed prior to his abduction? Alternatively, if the concern is that the jury would blame Carter for Coffee's abuse of Lang, then this potential opprobrium was already triggered by introducing some evidence of the abuse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    That some of this evidence may have opened the door to the state's introduction of adverse evidence in response does not alter this conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harries v.
