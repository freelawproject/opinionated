They were convicted at trial and now appeal. Although we agree with the district court's observation that \"[i]t certainly was not a perfect trial,\" J.A. 1080, the issues raised by Saint Louis and Tulin ultimately do not warrant reversal. For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early June 2012, Yvroseline Fergile, a U.S. citizen, was kidnapped in Haiti. A group of men forced her at gunpoint into her car, beat her severely, and drove her to a house where they held her for seven days before she escaped. While in captivity, Fergile was able to speak with and see her kidnappers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Fergile escaped, Haitian police showed her a poster of a rap group, \"Misyon Skwad,\" that was recovered during their search of the house where she was held. Fergile identified two individuals in the poster who she claimed were involved in her kidnapping: (1) defendant Saint Louis, also known as \"Top,\" who was pictured in the poster next to the name \"Top M.S.T,\" and (2) an individual identified as \"Kwason\" in the poster. Defendant Tulin was also pictured in the poster (shown with the nickname \"Blade\"), but Fergile did not identify him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later that summer, Ariante Marcelin-also a U.S. citizen-was abducted from her home at gunpoint by a group of men. One of the men assaulted and raped Marcelin's niece, who was at Marcelin's home when the kidnapping occurred. The men held Marcelin for four days. She was freed after one of her captors, Samson Jolibois, was arrested and led police to the house where she was being held. Jolibois implicated Saint Louis in the kidnapping, and police arrested Saint Louis later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several weeks later, FBI agent Alfred Watson traveled to Haiti to investigate the Marcelin kidnapping. After arriving in Haiti, Watson learned of Fergile's kidnapping and also began investigating that matter. Watson interviewed Jolibois, who told him that he, Saint Louis, and Tulin were among Fergile's kidnappers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In mid-September 2012-approximately three months after Fergile's kidnapping-Watson interviewed Fergile in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   He showed her three separate six-person photo arrays and asked if she recognized anyone. The first array contained a photo of Jolibois, which the FBI took while he was in Haitian custody. Fergile was unable to identify Jolibois. The second array contained a photo of Saint Louis, also taken by the FBI while he was in Haitian custody. Fergile identified Saint Louis, and added that she remembered that during the kidnapping, he had bragged about driving the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The third array contained a photo of Tulin, which had been extracted from a scanned image of the \"Misyon Skwad\" rap poster that Haitian authorities had previously shown Fergile. Tulin was not in custody in Haiti when the FBI prepared the array, and the rap poster photo of Tulin was the only one the FBI had available. Tulin's photo was dark, appeared blurry, and showed a jagged, pixelated border from having been cropped and lifted from the rap poster. The other five filler photos showed individuals with hairstyles similar to Tulin's, and several were taken against a dark background and had rough, pixelated borders to make them appear cropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fergile identified Tulin in the array. She recalled that Tulin had told her that he needed money because he was poor and she was rich. Fergile also told Watson that the Haitian police had shown her a rap poster and that Tulin's photo had been in the poster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Saint Louis and Tulin were each charged with conspiracy and two substantive counts of hostage-taking under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201203\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and use of a firearm during a crime of violence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They were tried together in December 2016. We briefly recount the events surrounding each of the issues they raise on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before trial, Tulin sought to suppress all identification evidence and testimony related to Fergile's identification of him in the FBI's photo array. He argued that the array was unnecessarily suggestive and violated due process because (1) it recycled Tulin's photo from the rap poster that Fergile had already seen in Haiti in a suggestive show-up procedure, and (2) Tulin's photo was darker and of a lower quality compared to the others in the array. The district court denied the motion, concluding that the array was not unduly suggestive. But the court noted that it would revisit the issue after Fergile testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, Fergile failed to identify Tulin in the courtroom. She could recall only that she had identified two individuals when Watson showed her the three photo arrays over four years earlier. She also confirmed that she had identified only Saint Louis and Kwason in the rap poster just after her escape. Nonetheless, evidence of Fergile's later identification of Tulin came in through Agent Watson's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the close of the government's case and in a later motion for a new trial, Tulin again asked the district court to exclude evidence of Fergile's identification. The court denied both motions based on its view that the photo arrays were done \"professionally\" and \"resulted in the identification of Mr. Tulin.\" J.A. 1116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Saint Louis and Tulin moved in limine to exclude evidence relating to the rape of Marcelin's niece. Instead of excluding the evidence entirely, the court ruled that it would only allow testimony that Marcelin's niece was assaulted, without reference to\n   the sexual nature of the incident. But when Jolibois testified at trial, he let slip that one of the kidnappers had raped Marcelin's niece. J.A. 658. The district court struck the answer, instructed the jury not to consider it, and denied the defendants' subsequent motion to declare a mistrial. Then, on cross-examination, Jolibois mentioned that the perpetrator was \"pulling up his pants.\" J.A. 685. The district court struck this answer, too. Before the jurors retired, the district court instructed them to disregard the stricken testimony and reminded them that \"[t]he defendants are not on trial for any act or any conduct not specifically charged in the indictment.\" J.A. 775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Marcelin testified for the government, recounting her experience as a kidnapping victim. She confirmed (corroborating Jolibois's testimony) that she knew Tulin personally because she had employed him as a security guard at her home. According to Tulin, Marcelin waved and smiled at him as she stepped down from the witness stand after testifying. Tulin's counsel sought to mention Marcelin's alleged conduct in her closing argument as evidence favorable to her client, but the district court refused, calling any such reference \"purely speculation\" and \"prejudicial to the Government.\" J.A. 749.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During closing arguments, Tulin's counsel speculated about the existence of cell phone records not in evidence that would have shown where Tulin was after the kidnappings, and questioned why the government failed to present such evidence. In rebuttal, the government observed that the defense could have presented that evidence, if it existed and was so important to the trial. The government immediately clarified that it bore the burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt, not the defense. Counsel for Saint Louis objected to the government's remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The jury convicted Saint Louis and Tulin on all counts. Tulin moved for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, arguing that, without Fergile's identification of him, his conviction could not possibly rest on the thoroughly impeached testimony of the government's cooperator, Jolibois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Tulin also moved for a new trial based on the issues he and Saint Louis had raised earlier, including the introduction of identification evidence, the court's limitation on Tulin's counsel's closing argument, the introduction of prejudicial sexual assault testimony, and the government's burden-shifting arguments during closing. Saint Louis moved for a new trial based only on the introduction of the sexual assault testimony. The district court denied both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Saint Louis and Tulin were each sentenced to 240 months in prison. At the sentencing hearing, Tulin objected to a two-level guidelines enhancement he received for causing serious bodily injury, arguing that Fergile's injuries were not of a serious nature. The district court overruled the objection, finding ample factual support for the enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, Tulin argues that (1) the district court erred in refusing to suppress evidence of Fergile's out-of-court identification of him; (2) the introduction of prejudicial sexual assault testimony requires a new trial; (3) the district court's ruling\n   preventing counsel from commenting on a witness's demeanor violated Tulin's rights under the Confrontation Clause; (4) the prosecutor's burden-shifting comment during closing denied him a fair trial; (5) the district court erred in determining that the weight of the evidence did not warrant a new trial; and (6) the two-level sentencing enhancement for inflicting serious bodily injury was improper. Saint Louis joins Tulin as to the second issue only. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Tulin contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress Fergile's out-of-court identification of him, which was admitted via Agent Watson's testimony. He argues that his right to due process was violated because the FBI's photo array was impermissibly suggestive, which in turn resulted in an unreliable identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review de novo the district court's legal conclusion as to whether the identification violated the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Put differently, \"due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    565 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Yet even where unnecessarily suggestive procedures are used, due process does not require exclusion of the evidence if the \"identification was sufficiently reliable to preclude the substantial likelihood of misidentification.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405425\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/435/#p442\">\n    114 F.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (4th Cir. 1997). Thus, our analysis proceeds in two steps: (1) \"the defendant must show that the photo identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive,\" and (2) \"if the defendant meets this burden, a court considers whether the identification was nevertheless reliable in the context of all of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706257\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/384/#p389\">\n    501 F.3d at 389-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tulin argues first that his photo suggestively stood out in the array because it was darker and blurrier than the others. Although Tulin is right that his photo was dark and blurry, it didn't look \"strikingly different\" from the five filler photos in a way that would implicate due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706257\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/384/#p389\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706257\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/384/#p389\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding suggestiveness where defendant's photo \"stood out sharply from the others in the array\"). Rather, the FBI did an acceptable job creating a photo array that contained similar-looking photos. The headshot of Tulin that was lifted from the rap poster was cropped so that it showed only his head and neck against a dark background, removing any indication of the context of the rap poster that might have been gleaned from including Tulin's clothing or the text from the original image. Further, Tulin's neutral expression in the photo is similar to those of the individuals pictured alongside\n   him in the array. The filler photos show men of similar age, build, and complexion, with similar hairstyles. Several of the photos were also cropped and set against dark backgrounds. And, as the district court noted, at least one other photo had the \"same kind of glossy look to it as Mr. Tulin's.\" J.A. 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tulin also contends that the FBI's use of his photo from the rap poster that was shown to Fergile a few months earlier by Haitian police impermissibly suggested to Fergile that she should select Tulin's photo from the array. But an array is not unduly suggestive merely because it includes a photo of the suspect that the witness has already seen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maguire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532921\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/254/#p263\">\n    918 F.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"A suspect's inclusion in two photospreads, even with the same photo, is not constitutionally impermissible.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In that case, a witness was shown an array of mugshots including the suspect and five others, but the witness was unable to select the suspect from the spread.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644275\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/369/\">\n    983 F.2d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When presented with a second photo array, which also included the suspect's photograph, the witness selected the suspect's picture after studying the array for half an hour.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644275\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court there concluded that \"the fact that a suspect's picture was placed in a second array after a witness has failed to select anyone from the first array [does not] automatically make the second array unduly suggestive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644275\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/369/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644275\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/983/369/\">\n    at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We think the same can be said of the use of Tulin's photo from the rap poster in the FBI's photo array. But even assuming that the array was impermissibly suggestive, Fergile's identification of Tulin in the photo array was nonetheless reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We evaluate reliability considering the totality of the circumstances, including factors such as: (1) \"the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime\"; (2) \"the witness' degree of attention\"; (3) \"the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal\"; (4) \"the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation\"; and (5) \"the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\"\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p198\">\n    409 U.S. at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p198\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Fergile was able to see her\n   captors and speak with them during the seven days she was held. She was also able to recall specific details about her captivity, showing a high degree of attention during that time. Meanwhile, the third factor-the accuracy of any prior description of the criminal-doesn't assist our analysis here because Watson didn't ask Fergile to describe Tulin before he showed her the photo array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to the fourth factor (the witness's level of certainty at the confrontation), Fergile showed a high level of certainty when she picked Tulin's photo from the array. Watson's interview report noted that she \"positively identified\" Tulin and that she went on to offer additional information about him, including his role in the kidnapping and statements he made to her during her captivity. J.A. 88. Although we are mindful that a \"lack of confidence is certainly a reliable warning sign, while the presence of confidence is probably closer to a neutral factor,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found an identification reliable where seven months had elapsed between the crime and the confrontation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p198\">\n    409 U.S. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p198\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court there noted that such a lengthy time period would be \"a seriously negative factor in most cases,\" but it credited the witness's record for reliability because she had made no identifications at previous show-ups, lineups, or photographic showings, despite their suggestiveness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/#p198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In this case, we have a more complicated scenario.

Generally, \"when one codefendant objects and thereby brings the matter to the attention of the court, further objections by other defendants are unnecessary.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Brown\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"885924\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/562/1144/#p1147\">\n     562 F.2d 1144\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1147 (9th Cir. 1977). Regardless, we need not resolve this issue because Tulin's claim fails under either standard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
