The deputies followed Johnson to a residence in the nearby town of Gladstone and called Portland Police Bureau (PPB) Officers Joseph Corona and Jerry Ables for assistance in arresting him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers did not approach Johnson at the residence, but instead waited outside. After about 20 minutes, Johnson left, and again the officers followed him. At a nearby intersection, the officers finally stopped Johnson by loosely boxing in his car; one car approached Johnson from behind while another approached from the front, effectively blocking Johnson's ability to drive away. The cars all came to a stop within a few feet of each other, and although there was enough room for Johnson to pull his car to the side of the road, he instead parked in the lane of traffic, disrupting the flow of passing cars. When approached by the officers, Johnson could not provide proof of insurance for the car, which he was borrowing, nor could he give anything other than the first name of the car's owner. Johnson did not know how the police could contact the owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The officers arrested Johnson on the outstanding warrant. Incident to the arrest, the officers searched Johnson and found a folding knife in his front pocket, $7,100 in cash in $20 and $100 denominations in his rear pants pocket, and $150 in cash in his wallet. Johnson said that he had recently inherited the $7,100 and that he planned to purchase a car with it (though he did not know what kind of car he intended to buy or where he would purchase it).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Johnson's car was blocking traffic and because Johnson could not provide contact information for the car's owner, the officers ordered it to be towed and impounded, pursuant to PPB policy. Prior to the tow, the officers conducted an inventory search of the car, again pursuant to local policy. From the interior of the car, the officers collected a combination stun gun and flashlight, a glass pipe with white residue, a jacket, and two cellphones. From the trunk, the officers collected a backpack and a duffel bag. Officer Corona testified that, when he moved the backpack and duffel in order to search for other items in the trunk, the bags felt heavy and the backpack made a metallic\n   \"clink\" when he set it down on the pavement. PPB stored each of the seized pieces of property in the County property and evidence warehouse, and the $7,100 was taken into custody by the County Sherriff's Office. Officer Corona recorded each item seized on an accompanying arrest report; the Sheriff's Office prepared a property receipt for the $7,100 in seized cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A week later, Officer Corona submitted an affidavit to secure a warrant to search the seized backpack, duffel bag, and cell phones. The affidavit referred to a 2009 police report (which Corona read after arresting Johnson) that stated Johnson had previously been found with cash, weapons, and drugs in a safe concealed in his vehicle. Officer Corona's affidavit stated that, based on the circumstances of Johnson's recent arrest, he had probable cause to believe the bags seized from the trunk would contain similar lockboxes, and that the phones would contain evidence of drug dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A warrant was duly signed by a local magistrate judge, and a search of the backpack revealed a small safe containing two bags of methamphetamine, drug-packaging materials, syringes, and a digital scale. The backpack also contained paperwork with notes on court cases that corresponded to several criminal prosecutions of Johnson. The duffel bag contained Johnson's personal items, and one of the cellphones contained text messages regarding drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Johnson was indicted on one charge of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in an amount of 50 grams or more, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(viii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before trial, Johnson moved to suppress the evidence found in the car and on his person at arrest. Primarily, Johnson challenged the evidence supporting the warrant to search the backpack and cellphones, arguing that it did not amount to probable cause. Johnson also argued that the officers unlawfully manipulated the bags they seized from the car in order to get a sense for what they might contain and that the inventory search of his car was invalid. The district court denied the motion, concluding that there was probable cause to stop and to arrest Johnson on the outstanding warrant, the officers validly impounded Johnson's car because it was blocking traffic, the subsequent inventory of the vehicle was \"lawful because [PPB] mandates officers to conduct an inventory of impounded vehicles,\" and the search warrant was supported by probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial, the government introduced the evidence found in Johnson's car and on his person, with a particular focus on the items of evidence found in the backpack, the messages from the cellphone, and the $7,100 in cash. The jury found him guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Approximately four months later, Johnson filed a motion for new trial on the basis of, among other things, two pieces of supposedly newly discovered evidence: (1) evidence showing that Johnson had indeed recently received an inheritance; and (2) a receipt from the private company that towed and impounded his car, which stated that they found various additional items of property in the car that were not listed in Officer Corona's arrest report. After a hearing, the district court denied the motion for a new trial upon the conclusion that none of the supposedly new evidence would have resulted in a likely acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Johnson was sentenced to 188 months in prison, and he now timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Johnson argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress, because the officers' inspection of his car\n   exceeded the constitutionally permissible bounds for an inventory search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \"police may, without a warrant, impound and search a motor vehicle so long as they do so in conformance with the standardized procedures of the local police department and in furtherance of a community caretaking purpose, such as promoting public safety or the efficient flow of traffic.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336238\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1113/#p1118\">\n    828 F.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1118 (9th Cir. 2016). The purpose of such a search is to \"produce an inventory\" of the items in the car, in order \"to protect an owner's property while it is in the custody of the police, to insure against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property, and to guard the police from danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v. Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633863\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/1/#p4\">\n    495 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633863\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/1/#p4\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633863\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/1/#p4\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the purpose of the search must be non-investigative; it must be \"conducted on the basis of something\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336238\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1113/#p1118\">\n    828 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).

He urges that both the officers' actions leading up to the stop and search of his car and their conduct in carrying out that search show that they were subjectively motivated by an improper desire to find incriminating evidence against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government argues that, regardless what the officers' personal motivations were for searching Johnson's car, such motivations are simply not relevant to our Fourth Amendment inquiry. In most contexts, that is true. The Supreme Court has emphasized time and again that \"[a]n action is 'reasonable' under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer's state of mind, as long as the circumstances, viewed\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   , justify the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Brigham City v.

However, the mere \"presence of a criminal investigatory motive\" or a \"dual motive-one valid, and one impermissible-\" does not render an administrative stop or search invalid; instead, we ask whether the challenged search or seizure \"would ... have occurred in the absence of an impermissible reason.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276704\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1204/#p1210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We thus must determine whether Johnson has produced evidence that demonstrates the officers would not have searched and seized items from the car he was driving but for an impermissible motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Johnson first argues that the very manner of his arrest was a pretext to conduct the inventory search that followed; he argues that the officers orchestrated his traffic stop specifically so that they would be able to impound and to search the car he was driving. There is no doubt that, after stopping Johnson's car, the officers had an objectively sound reason to order the car towed: Johnson had stopped the car in the middle of the street, blocking the flow of traffic, and he was unable to put the officers in contact with the vehicle's owner so that it could be retrieved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336238\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1113/#p1118\">\n    828 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"promoting public safety or the efficient flow of traffic\" is a valid community caretaking purpose). Johnson argues, however, that the officers intentionally and illegitimately stopped him in a way that forced him to leave the car in such a position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Specifically, Johnson challenges the officers' decision not to arrest him as he exited the residence they were staking out, but instead to wait and to stop his car in the street-and to do so by physically boxing him in. He adds that the officers then approached his car with guns drawn, making it even more unlikely that he would feel free to move his car to the side of the road. Although Johnson doubts the need for such maneuvers, the officers offered valid explanations for these actions, namely that the box-in technique was used to prevent flight and the timing and manner of Johnson's arrest were coordinated to minimize risks to officer safety. Moreover, even if the box-in tactic might have made it harder for Johnson to pull to the side, Johnson does not claim that it\n   <em>\n    prevented\n   </em>\n   him from doing so. Indeed, one of the arresting officers offered unrebutted testimony that there was enough space for Johnson to have pulled closer to the curb when he initially stopped the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Johnson's argument overlooks another critical fact that created the need to impound the car: Johnson could not provide the contact information for the car's owner. Johnson's inability to contact the owner could not have been orchestrated by the police, and without it, they may not have had reason to tow the car (as opposed to releasing it to its owner). In other words, the officers' chosen method of stopping Johnson would seem to be a poor way to orchestrate a scenario in which they would get to tow his car unless they could have somehow known ahead of time that the car's true owner would be unavailable to retrieve it. There is no evidence that the officers were aware of such fact when they chose to pull him over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Altogether, Johnson has failed to show that the officers' decision to pull him over\n   and to impound his car \"would not have occurred in the absence of an impermissible reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Orozco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276704\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1204/#p1210\">\n    858 F.3d at 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Johnson also argues that, even if the stop and impoundment of the car were valid, the officers improperly searched the car in an effort to find evidence of criminal activity. Johnson does not dispute that, before impounding the car, the officers were required by PPB policy to complete an inventory of the \"personal property and contents of open containers\" found within it and were authorized to seize the items found for safekeeping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Portland City Code \u00a7 14C.10.030(C); Portland Police Bureau Policy 650.000. And indeed, we have previously held that PPB's inventory-search policies are valid for Fourth Amendment purposes, and that evidence found or seized in compliance with them may be admitted against a criminal defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Penn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11180796\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/1111/#p1115\">\n    233 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115-16 (9th Cir. 2000). Johnson argues, however, that the officers in fact used this administrative inventory process not to identify and to safeguard his possessions, but instead merely as a pretext to gather evidence of crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Johnson raises a number of points in support of his argument, including that the officers' improper motivations are evidenced by their purported failure to comply with various provisions of PPB's inventory policy (for example by failing to list items in an appropriate manner and by failing to provide property receipts for all items seized). However, we need not consider the merits of those arguments-or whether any such violations of PPB policy would require suppression of the evidence found-because the officers themselves\n   <em>\n    explicitly admitted\n   </em>\n   that they seized items from the car in an effort to search for evidence of criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, the arrest report prepared by Officer Corona stated that he \"believed it likely that the bags [seized from the trunk] contained evidence of restricted weapons and drug possession/sales,\" that he believed the seized cell phones may have been \"used to facilitate criminal activity and evidence [may] be found stored on the phones,\" and that all of the seized items \"were placed into evidence.\" The affidavit Officer Corona submitted in support of his application for a search warrant further confirmed that the items had been \"seized pending further investigation,\" rather than for safekeeping. And at the suppression hearing, Officer Corona specifically testified that he seized the two bags from the car's trunk to hold onto them until he could secure a search warrant, because he \"believe[d] that likely there was evidence of a crime inside the two bags.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Likewise, Multnomah County Deputy Adam Swail, who prepared the property receipt for the $7,100, testified that he assisted with taking that money \"as evidence.\" He explained that his office held the money to help facilitate any civil forfeiture proceedings against it (presumably because it was believed to be the proceeds of a drug crime).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Indeed, the prosecution's own arguments before the district court emphasized the evidentiary motives behind these seizures. In both its brief in opposition to the motion to suppress and at the accompanying hearing, the government insisted that the money, the bags, and the cell phones were all seized from the car as \"evidence\" of a suspected crime.

For example, two bags from the trunk were seized-each of which contained incriminating evidence-while a third bag was left behind.

Yet, the court held that even if the officers' suspicion-based search were invalid, the car\n    <em>\n     could hypothetically\n    </em>\n    have been searched anyway pursuant to the applicable inventory policy and thus upheld the trial court's refusal to suppress the evidence found inside.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069533\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/1268/#p1274\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069533\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/1268/#p1274\">\n     at 1274\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
