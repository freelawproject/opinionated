When Manuel Campos-Hernandez applied for NACARA special rule cancellation, the BIA interpreted the physical presence requirement as running from Campos-Hernandez's most recent disqualifying conviction, rather than his earliest, and so held him ineligible for NACARA cancellation of removal. We conclude that the BIA's interpretation of NACARA is reasonable and is therefore entitled to deference. Accordingly, we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Campos-Hernandez, a citizen and native of El Salvador, entered the United States in 1990 or 1991 without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. He is 41 years old and married to a U.S. citizen. Since 2009, he has worked as a mechanic. Campos-Hernandez was convicted of drug-related offenses in California in 2003, 2005, and 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) served Campos-Hernandez with a Notice to Appear (NTA) at a removal hearing. The NTA alleged that Campos-Hernandez arrived in the United States without being admitted or paroled after inspection, and charged him with removability both on that basis and on the basis of his drug convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Campos-Hernandez admitted the allegations against him and conceded his removability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 10, 2012, Campos-Hernandez filed a NACARA application. That same day, an immigration judge (IJ) found that Campos-Hernandez was ineligible for NACARA special rule cancellation of removal and denied his application for relief. Specifically, the IJ determined that, because the drug convictions rendering him inadmissible occurred within the previous ten years, Campos-Hernandez could not satisfy NACARA's requirement of \"10 years [of continuous physical presence] immediately following the commission of an act, or the assumption of a status constituting\n   a ground for removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.66\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The BIA dismissed Campos-Hernandez's appeal in a non-precedential, single-member opinion.

Campos-Hernandez timely filed a petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the briefing of this appeal, a three-member panel of the BIA held, in a precedential opinion in a different immigration appeal, that \"for purposes of special rule cancellation of removal under the NACARA, ... continuous physical presence should be measured from the alien's\n   <em>\n    most recently incurred\n   </em>\n   ground of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Castro-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20693\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

For example, under the opposite reading, an applicant who was convicted of a drug offense in 2000, but not again until 2010, could thereafter accumulate any number of disqualifying convictions and statuses while still remaining eligible for cancellation of removal under NACARA. The ten-year crime-free requirement would then serve a perverse purpose, as the individuals most\n   likely to continue committing crimes, as evidenced by their very recent behavior, would be eligible to stay in the country, but individuals who had not committed any crime for eight or nine years would not.
