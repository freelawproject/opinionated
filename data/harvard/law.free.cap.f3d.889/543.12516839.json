We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ruth Thrower died on July 30, 2015, after a stay at a nursing facility operated by GranCare LLC. On September 14,\n   2015, Thrower's estate and her successors (\"Thrower's heirs\") filed suit in California state court naming as defendants, among others, GranCare and a GranCare administrator, Remy Rhodes. The complaint alleged that Thrower suffered a fall while residing at the facility, which could have been prevented by the adoption of an adequate care plan, and that GranCare staff delayed before sending Thrower to a hospital for treatment. The complaint alleged claims under California law against all defendants for elder abuse, negligence, negligent hiring and supervision, and wrongful death, and an additional claim against GranCare only for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 7, 2015, defendants removed to federal court, even though the named parties are not completely diverse. Thrower's heirs and defendant Rhodes are all California citizens. The remaining defendants contended that Rhodes is a sham defendant who was fraudulently joined to the lawsuit for the purpose of defeating diversity. They also contended that the complaint was \"devoid of allegations that Defendant Rhodes herself committed any specific wrongdoing\" and failed to \"ascrib[e] any particular act or omission by Rhodes.\" Finally, they contended that Rhodes, as a non-clinician administrator, owed no duty of care to Thrower under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants relied on a district court order in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Grancare LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-03585-RS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206865876\">\n    2015 WL 6865876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. Nov. 9, 2015) as supporting removal. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the heirs of a different resident who died at a GranCare facility sued the same set of defendants in California state court for elder abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. As in this case, defendants removed to federal court on the basis of diversity, asserting that Rhodes had been fraudulently joined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   concluded that \"[t]he standard for determining whether a defendant is fraudulently joined is similar to that of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Under that standard, the court held that the complaint failed to plead viable claims against Rhodes and denied plaintiffs' motion to remand. GranCare argued in the district court that the reasoning and result in the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   order compelled the same outcome in this case because plaintiffs \"[did] not plead a viable cause of action against Rhodes.\" At a hearing in this case, GranCare conceded that there was \"some possibility, if plaintiff[s] properly pleaded such,\" that Thrower's heirs could state a cause of action against Rhodes, but GranCare emphasized that the complaint contained \"no allegations\" against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted plaintiffs' motion to remand. In the court's view,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   improperly conflated the test for fraudulent joinder with the test under Rule 12(b)(6). The court observed that no appellate decision has \"explicitly established how [the] standard [for fraudulent joinder] interacts with the 'plausibility' standard used in evaluating motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),\" but concluded that fraudulent joinder should not be found if there is \"any possibility\" that a plaintiff could state a claim against the defendant, even if the complaint actually fails to state a claim. Applying this standard, the district court remanded. The district court granted plaintiffs' request for costs and attorney's fees after finding that removal was \"patently unreasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   GranCare now appeals the award of costs and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   GranCare makes two arguments on appeal. First, it argues that the award is improper because the district court's remand order is legally incorrect. Second, it argues that, even if incorrect, removal was objectively reasonable. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.

Specifically, it argues that the district court's standard incorrectly requires a removing party to show that there is no possibility that the plaintiff could demonstrate a viable claim against the allegedly fraudulently joined defendant. GranCare argues that the correct standard is close to that of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, as applied by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We agree with GranCare's contention that the fraudulent joinder standard shares some similarities with the analysis under Rule 12(b)(6). Both require some assessment of the plaintiff's lawsuit. Indeed, we have previously framed the test in terms of an \"obvious\" failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1164926\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/811/1336/#p1339\">\n    811 F.2d at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that fraudulent joinder is established when a plaintiff \"fails to state a cause of action against a resident defendant, and the failure is obvious according to the settled rules of the state[.]\"). And while the party seeking removal is entitled to present additional facts that demonstrate that a defendant has been fraudulently joined,\n   <em>\n    Ritchey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11851261\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/1313/#p1318\">\n    139 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in many cases, the complaint will be the most helpful guide in determining whether a defendant has been fraudulently joined,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1164926\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/811/1336/#p1339\">\n    811 F.2d at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   But the test for fraudulent joinder and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) are not equivalent.

It specifically alleges that Rhodes violated \u00a7 72513(f) by failing to conduct a preadmission personal interview with Thrower's physician, and by failing to update screening assessments. The complaint alleges further that Thrower's fall could have been prevented had Rhodes and GranCare adopted an adequate care plan prior to her arrival, although the precise details are unclear.

Specifically, GranCare argues that the heirs erred in \"lumping\" Rhodes with other defendants by alleging misconduct against all defendants collectively, that the heirs did not plead their claims with sufficient particularity, and that the heirs did not sufficiently allege negligence.

It contends that it reasonably relied on the order in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   in which a district court in the same district determined that Rhodes was a fraudulently joined defendant-in deciding to remove this case. We agree with GranCare that the degree of clarity in the relevant law at the time of removal is a relevant factor in determining whether a defendant's decision to remove was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lussier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556815\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1062/#p1065\">\n    518 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We are willing to assume,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that at the time of removal, no appellate decision in this circuit had yet clarified the relationship between Rule 12(b)(6) and the standard for fraudulent joinder. Further, we recognize two district courts in the same jurisdiction, faced with our precedents, came to different conclusions as to the governing standard. Without agreeing that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's standard was legally correct, we conclude that GranCare had a reasonable basis for relying on the standard articulated in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, the district court correctly determined that GranCare's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was unreasonable due to clear factual distinctions between the cases. The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   complaint identified Rhodes as the nursing home administrator, but did not mention her elsewhere, leaving the basis for plaintiffs' claims entirely unclear. The failure to do anything other than identify Rhodes as the administrator was the primary reason for the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion that Rhodes had been fraudulently joined. Unlike the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the complaint in this case contained detailed allegations against Rhodes, and it is obvious that GranCare would not have been entitled to removal in this case even if the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   standard had been applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the district court's award of costs and attorney's fees was not premised on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
