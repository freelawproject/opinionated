Problematically, HH's proposed store was located in a zoning district that prohibited \"adult entertainment businesses,\" as defined under the Indianapolis-Marion County Zoning Ordinance (\"the Ordinance\"). Upon review, the Department of Business and Neighborhood Services (DBNS) determined that HH was an adult entertainment business, a decision which the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   HH filed this lawsuit against the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and County of Marion, Indiana, the DBNS, and the BZA (collectively, \"the City\") seeking a declaratory judgment that the Ordinance violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and violated state administrative law, as well as asking for an injunction against the City's enforcement of the Ordinance against HH. HH challenged the Ordinance under the First Amendment both as applied to it, as well as facially for overbreadth and vagueness. The district court denied HH's motion for a preliminary injunction, and HH filed this interlocutory appeal challenging that decision only with respect to its as-applied First Amendment claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   HH-Entertainment, Inc., the parent company of HH, operates retail stores under the name \"Hustler Hollywood\" throughout the United States in over twenty locations. HH was incorporated in Indianapolis in order to open a store that would sell a variety of merchandise, including lingerie, gag-gifts, instructional DVDs and literature, marital aids, and sexual devices, such as dildos and vibrators. According to HH, when it seeks to open a new retail store, it studies the city's municipal ordinance in order to avoid being classified as an \"adult\" store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Ordinance, which went into effect on April 1, 2016, establishes six different Commercial Zoning Districts. City of Indianapolis and Marion County Consolidated Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance, \u00a7 742-104(B)-(G) (April 1, 2016). \"The C-3 District (Neighborhood Commercial District) is for the development of an extensive range of retail sales and personal, professional and business services required to meet the demands of a fully developed residential neighborhood, regardless of its size.\" \u00a7 742-104(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Ordinance also regulates \"adult entertainment businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 743-305(A). An adult entertainment business is prohibited from operating in a C-3 district as a right, although it may obtain a variance to operate in a C-3 district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 743-305(A)(3)(b). However, an adult entertainment business may operate as a right in three of the six districts: C-4 (Community-Regional District); C-5 (General Commercial District); and C-7 (High-Intensity Commercial District).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The various types of adult entertainment businesses are defined under the Ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 740-202(A). Relevant to this appeal, an \"adult bookstore\" is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   An establishment having at least 25% of its:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Retail floor space used for the display of adult products; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Stock in trade consisting of adult products; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Weekly revenue derived from adult products.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Adult products\" means any media (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , books, films, magazines, photographs) \"that are distinguished or characterized by their emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas;\" as well as any device \"designed or marketed\n   as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs, or for sadomasochistic use or abuse,\" including, but not limited to, chains, dildos, muzzles, phallic shaped vibrators, and whips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Ordinance defines an \"adult service establishment\" as \"[a]ny building, premises, structure or other facility, or part thereof, under common ownership or control which provides a preponderance of services involving specified sexual activities\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or display of specified anatomical areas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In early 2016, HH began exploring the possibility of opening a store in Indianapolis. HH identified a vacant commercial property at 5505 E. 82nd Street, on Indianapolis' northeast side. The Property is located in a C-3 district,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a driveway separates the Property from a Chuck E. Cheese's, a kid-friendly restaurant and entertainment center. Notably, directly across 82nd Street to the north of the Property is a C-4 district where HH could operate freely as an adult entertainment business as a right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   HH was aware that the City was revising the then-existing zoning ordinance, and preemptively contacted City officials in order to apprise themselves of the revised Ordinance, particularly the \"adult\" provisions. According to HH, it entered into a ten-year lease at the Property on July 14, 2016, in reliance on the communications it had with City officials. Shortly thereafter, HH applied for a structural permit to remodel the Property, and for a sign permit to hang exterior signs. The DBNS flagged the applications after noticing that the proposed signs stated \"Hustler Hollywood,\" and advertised such things as \"erotica.\" Given that the Property is located in a C-3 district, the DBNS was concerned HH was intending to operate an adult entertainment business. HH's applications were put on hold, and the DBNS requested additional information in order to verify that HH was permitted to operate in a C-3 district. In response, HH submitted a weekly inventory and sales projection, which projected the stock and sales of adult products, a floor plan with square footage designations, and a description of the business. After reviewing this information, which the DBNS described\n   as \"imprecise and contradictory,\" the DBNS concluded that HH was either an adult bookstore or an adult service establishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Instead of electing to seek a variance with the DBNS, HH appealed to the BZA. Prior to the hearing before the BZA, the DBNS staff submitted a report explaining its decision. In explaining the adult bookstore classification, the DBNS noted the inventory and sales projection provided by HH indicated that only 16.1% of their inventory and 23.9% of their sales would derive from \"adult products.\" However, the DBNS pointed to other projections that rendered those figures imprecise: 32.2% of inventory and 12.8% of sales were broadly categorized as \"general merchandise;\" and \"toys\" accounted for 13.1% of inventory and 28.8% of sales. Adding either of these figures to the adult products figures would put HH above the 25% threshold for adult bookstores under the Ordinance. Moreover, \"sensual care\" products were to be sold behind a separation wall along with adult products; yet, sensual care products were not included in the adult products projection. HH stated in their business description that sensual care products included gels, oils, lotions and marital aids, and the DBNS noted that \"[m]arital aids, by definition, are sex toys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, the DBNS found that even if HH was not an adult bookstore, it would be classified as an adult service establishment. Under the Ordinance, providing \"a preponderance of services involving specified sexual activities or display of specified anatomical areas\" means any combination of two or more specified categories of services. According to the DBNS, the two categories that applied to HH were (1) \"[t]he sale or display\" of media \"characterized by an emphasis upon the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas;\" and (2) the presentation of such media for observation by patrons. The DBNS concluded that HH plainly fit under the first category based on the products it intended to sell, as well as the presentation-of-media category since other Hustler Hollywood locations offered workshops and classes involving live demonstrations or videos, with titles such as \"Masturbation Workshop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The BZA held a hearing on December 6, 2016. HH appeared by counsel and presented a revised inventory and sales projection. HH claimed that the initial projections had mistakenly included figures from nationwide-stores and online sales. In the new projections, only 8.7% of inventory and 12.4% of sales would be \"adult products.\" HH insisted that it did not intend to operate an adult bookstore or an adult service establishment, and that it would not offer any workshops or classes that are offered at other Hustler Hollywood stores. Finally, HH invited City officials to inspect the Property once it was ready to open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Remonstrators, a group composed of community members, property owners, and tenants, appeared by counsel in opposition to HH's proposed store. They submitted evidence to counter HH's argument that it did not intend to operate an adult entertainment business, including photographs from other Hustler Hollywood locations showing adult products visibly displayed throughout the store, as well as advertisements from the Hustler Hollywood website for workshops and classes at their stores. The Remonstrators also emphasized that the Property was situated next to Chuck E. Cheese's, as well as a bus stop frequented by school children. A City councillor also appeared at the hearing and argued that HH-Entertainment had a history of deception in opening stores nationwide. At the conclusion of the hearing, the BZA voted unanimously, 5-0, to affirm the decision of the DBNS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rather than seek judicial review of that decision in an Indiana state court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-4-1614\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 36-7-4-1614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), HH filed this lawsuit against the City on January 5, 2017. HH sought declaratory and injunctive relief under three different First Amendment theories: (1) an as-applied challenge to the City's determination that HH is an adult entertainment business; (2) a facial challenge for vagueness to the definition of an \"adult service establishment;\" and (3) a facial challenge for overbreadth to the definition of an \"adult service establishment.\" HH also sought relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and challenged the City's determination as arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence under Indiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 6, 2017, HH filed for a preliminary injunction. After briefing and a hearing, the court denied HH's motion on September 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    HH-Indianapolis LLC v. Consol.

The court found that HH was unlikely to succeed on the merits under any of the First Amendment theories, or under the Equal Protection claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266478\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266478\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/873/\">\n    at 881-891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the court concluded that HH had not alleged an irreparable injury in its state law claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266478\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266478\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/873/\">\n    at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A party seeking a preliminary injunction must satisfy all three requirements in the \"threshold phase\" by showing that (1) it will suffer irreparable harm in the period before the resolution of its claim; (2) traditional legal remedies are inadequate; and (3) there is some likelihood of success on the merits of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v.

HH directs us to a number of cases where courts have performed some heightened level of scrutiny in analyzing an as-applied First Amendment challenge.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Primus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490524\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/412/#p432\">\n    436 U.S. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490524\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/412/#p432\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490524\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/412/#p432\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) (applying \"exacting scrutiny\" to South Carolina's attorney regulatory scheme as applied to an attorney soliciting a prospective client by mail);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The City's application of the Ordinance has resulted only in an incidental restriction on HH's speech in a particular location. HH has not been deprived of\n   their First Amendment right to operate in Indianapolis. The City has simply told HH that it cannot operate in a C-3 district, while also providing numerous other avenues for speech in C-4, C-5, and C-7 districts, including a C-4 district directly across the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The City acknowledges that the Ordinance functions as a form of prior restraint, and in fact, did so in this case.

As we have already found, the Ordinance is a constitutional time, place, and manner regulation. Moreover, HH does not allege a lack of procedural safeguards in the City's zoning scheme that the Supreme Court has noted may result in unconstitutional prior restraint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FW/PBS, Inc. v.

However, an erroneous application of a zoning ordinance is unlikely to be a First Amendment violation.

The BZA did not have to believe HH when it stated it would not offer workshops or classes, nor did it have to ignore evidence from other Hustler Hollywood stores. Additionally, the BZA was not required to disregard HH's initial inventory and sales projections which contradicted their second projections. HH presented no evidence in the district court or on appeal that officials from the DBNS or BZA displayed any bias or censorial intent in their determinations. Furthermore, the City was under no constitutional obligation to inspect the Property or allow HH to open conditionally before making its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ultimately, the question of whether the City's determination rested on a sufficient evidentiary basis is properly suited for state court review.
