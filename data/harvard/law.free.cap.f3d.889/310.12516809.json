But his lights were the least of his worries. The handgun found under Malone's seat prompted a federal grand jury indictment on felon-in-possession charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).

He pleaded guilty to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Presentence Report classified Malone as an armed career criminal under the ACCA based on three prior convictions for \"violent felonies\" or \"serious drug offenses\"-Tennessee aggravated assault, federal drug trafficking, and Kentucky second-degree burglary.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e). He contested the classification, arguing only that his Kentucky conviction was incorrectly considered an ACCA predicate offense because the crime's elements are broader than generic burglary's. Overruling Malone's objection, the district court sentenced him to the ACCA-minimum 15 years' imprisonment for violating \u00a7 922(g).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Malone appeals the determination that his Kentucky second-degree burglary conviction qualifies as an ACCA \"violent felony.\" We review the issue de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 511.010(1) (emphasis added). So \"building\" ordinarily means something different than its statutory definition. This makes sense, given that \"premises\" specifically\n   incorporates \" 'building'\n   <em>\n    as defined herein\n   </em>\n   \" but \"dwelling\" does not.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350936\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/671/#p678\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 511.010(3) (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350936\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/671/#p678\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 511.010(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The conclusion we must draw from these distinctions is that \"dwelling\" incorporates only the \"ordinary meaning\" of \"building.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

Construing the interplay between the definitions of \"building,\" \"dwelling,\" and \"premises\" differently would render portions of \u00a7 511.010 meaningless. And just as revising a statute by addition is outside our province, so too is revising by subtraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   What's more, caselaw corroborates this conclusion. The Government identifies two Kentucky Supreme Court decisions \"confirm[ing] that the definition of 'dwelling' uses the term 'building' in its ordinary sense.\" One,\n   <em>\n    Soto v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , states that the statutory definitions of \"building\" and \"dwelling\" \"indicat[e] that 'building' encompasses a broader category of structures than 'dwelling.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9200248\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/139/827/#p869\">\n    139 S.W.3d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869 (Ky. 2004). The other,\n   <em>\n    Colwell v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   concludes per the statutory definitions that \"every dwelling is a building, but every building is not a dwelling.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11138549\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/37/721/#p726\">\n    37 S.W.3d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726 (Ky. 2000). These mesh well with the Government's interpretation-\"dwellings\" are \"buildings\" in the ordinary sense, not the definitional sense, and so \"buildings\" in the definitional sense are not necessarily \"dwellings.\" Plus, we have consistently held that a conviction under \u00a7 511.030 ticks the ACCA's \"violent felony\" box as an enumerated offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
