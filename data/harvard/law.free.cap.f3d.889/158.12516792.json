The jury rejected plaintiffs' unfair and deceptive trade practices claim, and the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to defendants on the abuse of process claim. In a second trial solely on punitive damages, another jury awarded $3 million in punitive damages. In response to numerous post-trial motions, the district court reduced compensatory and punitive damages, awarded attorneys' fees to plaintiffs, and otherwise denied the remaining motions. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the district court as to conversion and punitive damages, remand for a new trial on damages for breach of contract, vacate the attorneys' fees award, and affirm as to the abuse of process and unfair and deceptive trade practices claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Legacy Data Access, Inc. (\"Legacy Georgia\") and its owner Dianne Peters (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") agreed to sell certain assets to Cadrillion, LLC (\"the Agreement\"). Cadrillion formed a subsidiary, Legacy Data Access, LLC (\"Legacy North Carolina\"), to own the assets and operate the business acquired from Legacy Georgia. Cadrillion also hired Peters to manage Legacy North Carolina for three years. The parties expected that Cadrillion, with Peters's help, would grow Legacy North Carolina's business and sell it in three to five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In exchange for Legacy Georgia's assets, Cadrillion agreed to make two separate payments: first, $513,000, which Cadrillion paid on the closing date of the Agreement, and second, a \"Deferred Purchase Price,\" which Cadrillion was to pay upon certain specified events, such as if Cadrillion sold Legacy North Carolina. In the event that Peters resigned from her position at Legacy North Carolina after her initial three-year term, but before Cadrillion was able to sell Legacy North Carolina, Cadrillion retained \"the right, but not the obligation,\" to \"purchase ... the rights to the Deferred Purchase Price.\" In other words, Cadrillion could choose to purchase Legacy Georgia's remaining interest in the value of Legacy North Carolina at that time. The Agreement called this \"right\" the \"Call Option.\" To exercise this Call Option, Cadrillion had to provide \"written notice to such effect\" within 90 days of Peters's resignation. The Agreement included a complex formula to calculate the Deferred Purchase Price at the\n   time Cadrillion exercised the Call Option, also known as the \"Call Price.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Peters resigned after her three-year term but before Cadrillion could sell Legacy North Carolina, Cadrillion timely provided written notice that it was exercising the Call Option. However, Cadrillion did not pay the Call Price to Legacy Georgia as the Agreement required. Instead, Cadrillion filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court, seeking a declaration that the Call Price was no more than $460,406, along with a motion to deposit that amount with the court. Plaintiffs countered that Cadrillion had incorrectly calculated the Call Price, and that depositing the funds with the court would not satisfy the Agreement. Cadrillion then decided to dismiss its action voluntarily, now taking the position that it had never exercised its Call Option in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 14, 2015, Plaintiffs initiated this action against Cadrillion, Legacy North Carolina, and James Yuhas, a manager at Cadrillion. Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, conversion, abuse of process, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. The district court bifurcated the trial into a first trial on liability and compensatory damages, and a second trial on punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Plaintiffs' presented their evidence, the court granted judgment as a matter of law to Defendants on the abuse of process claim. The jury returned a verdict finding Cadrillion liable for breach of contract and awarding $256,500 in compensatory damages. The jury also found Cadrillion and Yuhas liable for conversion and awarded $1,499,999 in damages. The jury rejected Plaintiffs' claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A separate jury later awarded Peters $3 million in punitive damages: $2 million against Cadrillion, and $1 million against Yuhas. The jury did not award punitive damages to Legacy Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both sides filed post-trial motions. In response, the district court reduced the compensatory damages for conversion to $460,406, eliminated compensatory damages for breach of contract as a double recovery, and reduced punitive damages to $1.38 million total. The court also granted Plaintiffs' request for pre- and post-judgment interest, and awarded Plaintiffs $743,297 in attorneys' fees against Cadrillion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cadrillion and Yuhas timely noted this appeal, challenging their liability for conversion, the jury's award of punitive damages, and the district court's award of attorneys' fees. However, Cadrillion now concedes its liability for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants/Cross-Appellees Br. at 17. Plaintiffs cross-appeal, contending they are entitled to a new trial on breach of contract damages, that the district court erred in ruling against them on their abuse of process claim, and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their unfair and deceptive trade practices claim. The parties agree that North Carolina law governs this diversity case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We first address Cadrillion and Yuhas's challenge to the conversion claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury found Cadrillion liable for conversion, and the district court denied\n   its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Cadrillion promised in the Agreement to pay the Call Price, then broke that promise by failing to pay. Therefore, as in\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   , the \"crux of this matter is and always has been a contract dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527486\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/327/#p330\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The record provides undeniable support for this conclusion. It is undisputed that Cadrillion had a duty to pay the Call Price\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   as a result of the parties' Agreement. Moreover, the Agreement itself provided for the measure of appropriate damages for this contractual breach by specifying the formula for calculating the Call Price. In other words, the Agreement fully allocated the risk of the injury that Plaintiffs suffered here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court reached a contrary conclusion by reasoning that \"Defendants did more than simply fail to perform under the contract,\" because they \"filed an action against Plaintiffs in which they sought to deposit $460,406.\" But the peculiar\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which Cadrillion breached the Agreement does not amount to a breach of some duty independent of Cadrillion's contractual duty. To the contrary, Plaintiffs alleged that Cadrillion converted \"the Call Price\" by \"failing and refusing to tender\" the Call Price as the Agreement required. Similarly, the special verdict form asked, \"Did the Defendants convert the Call Price?\" In other words, under Plaintiffs' theory, Cadrillion's breach of its contractual duty was the conversion. (At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs even conceded that if Cadrillion had not breached the contract, Plaintiffs would have no claim for conversion. Oral Arg. at 27:40-28:06.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because Cadrillion only breached a contractual duty owed to Plaintiffs, the economic loss rule applies and bars Plaintiffs' conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, Plaintiffs principally contend that North Carolina has exempted conversion from the economic loss rule.

The evidence certainly did not compel this conclusion. After all, Cadrillion is a private equity firm with business activities that might well include purchasing other companies. But Plaintiffs' allegations of unfair conduct did focus narrowly on Cadrillion's decision to exercise the Call Option and the manner in which it refused to pay the Call Price to Legacy Georgia, the company owned by Cadrillion's former employee, Dianne Peters. And it is not clear how this decision and Cadrillion's subsequent conduct impacted the marketplace at large. Moreover, the Call Option was specifically crafted to address the situation where Peters left her employment after her three-year term expired but before Cadrillion could sell Legacy North Carolina-something arguably akin to an \"extraordinary event.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=691%20S.E.2d%20676\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given this record, although reasonable minds could differ about this issue, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find as it did.

Plaintiffs requested that the jury consider the commerce element and proposed a jury instruction to that effect, which the district court adopted. That forecloses Plaintiffs from now arguing that the district court erred in complying with their request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, suggests Cadrillion, the jury likely extrapolated from $513,000 and awarded what would be the remaining one-third, or $256,500. The critical problem with this notion, however, is that the parties' contract did not state that Cadrillion would pay $256,500. It stated that Cadrillion would pay the Call Price.
