California law also permits that consumer to seek a court order requiring the manufacturer of the product to halt its\n   false advertising. California has decided that its consumers have a right, while shopping in a store selling consumer goods, to rely upon the statements made on a product's packaging. Today, we hold that misled consumers may properly allege a threat of imminent or actual harm sufficient to confer standing to seek injunctive relief. A consumer's inability to rely on a representation made on a package, even if the consumer knows or believes the same representation was false in the past, is an ongoing injury that may justify an order barring the false advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this case, Jennifer Davidson paid extra for wipes labeled as \"flushable\" because she believed that flushable wipes would be better for the environment, and more sanitary, than non-flushable wipes. Davidson alleges that the wipes she purchased, which were manufactured and marketed by Kimberly-Clark Corporation, were not, in fact, flushable. Davidson seeks to recover the premium she paid for the allegedly flushable wipes, as well as an order requiring Kimberly-Clark to stop marketing their wipes as \"flushable.\" Davidson has plausibly alleged that Kimberly-Clark engaged in false advertising. Davidson has also plausibly alleged that she will suffer further harm in the absence of an injunction. We therefore reverse the district court and remand this case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants-appellees Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., and Kimberly-Clark Global Sales, LLC (collectively \"Kimberly-Clark\") manufacture and market four types of pre-moistened wipes: Cottonelle Wipes, Scott Wipes, Huggies Wipes, and Kotex Wipes. Each of the four products is marketed and sold as \"flushable.\" Kimberly-Clark charges a premium for these flushable wipes, as compared to toilet paper or wipes that are not marketed as \"flushable.\" Each of the four flushable wipes products contains a statement on the package (or on the website associated with the product) stating, in various ways, that the product \"breaks up after flushing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2013, Davidson was shopping at a Safeway in San Francisco when she came across Scott Wipes. Davidson saw the word \"flushable\" on the Scott Wipes package and noticed that the Scott Wipes were more expensive than wipes that did not have the word \"flushable\" on the package. According to Davidson, flushable ordinarily means \"\n   <em>\n    suitable\n   </em>\n   for disposal down a toilet,\" not simply \"\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of passing from a toilet to the pipes after one flushes.\" Davidson maintains that this ordinary meaning of flushable is understood by reasonable consumers, who expect a flushable product to be suitable for disposal down a toilet. Consistent with that understanding, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines flushable as \"suitable for disposal by flushing down a toilet,\" and a nonprofit organization of water quality professionals states that a flushable item must completely disperse within five minutes of flushing. In other words, \"truly flushable products, such as toilet paper, ... disperse within seconds or minutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Davidson was concerned about products that were not suitable for flushing because she remembered hearing stories about people flushing items that should not be flushed, which then caused problems with home plumbing systems and municipal\n   wastewater treatment facilities. Davidson did not want to cause such damage to her plumbing or to San Francisco's wastewater treatment facilities. Davidson reviewed the front and back of the Scott Wipes package and did not see anything indicating that the wipes were not suitable for flushing. Believing it would be easier and more sanitary to flush wipes than to throw them in the garbage, Davidson purchased the Scott Wipes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Once Davidson began using the Scott Wipes, she noticed that each wipe felt sturdy and thick, unlike toilet paper. Davidson also noticed that the wipes did not disperse in the toilet bowl like toilet paper. After using the wipes several times, Davidson became concerned that the wipes were not truly flushable, so she stopped using the Scott Wipes altogether. Davidson investigated the matter further and learned that flushable wipes caused widespread damage to home plumbing and municipal sewer systems. This research \"further[ed ] her concerns that the [Scott] Wipes were not in fact appropriate for disposal by flushing down a toilet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Davidson has never again purchased flushable wipes. Yet Davidson \"continues to desire to purchase wipes that are suitable for disposal in a household toilet,\" and \"would purchase truly flushable wipes manufactured by [Kimberly-Clark] if it were possible to determine prior to purchase if the wipes were suitable to be flushed.\" Davidson regularly visits stores that sell Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes but is unable to determine, based on the packaging, whether the wipes are truly flushable. Davidson would not have purchased the Scott Wipes, or would have paid less for the Scott Wipes, had Kimberly-Clark not \"misrepresented (by omission and commission) the true nature of their Flushable Wipes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to her experience with the Scott Wipes she purchased, Davidson alleges more broadly that all four flushable wipes products Kimberly-Clark manufactured and marketed \"are not in fact flushable, because the wipes are not suitable for disposal by flushing down a household toilet.\" Kimberly-Clark manufactures these products with strong fibers that do not efficiently disperse when placed in a toilet. Kimberly-Clark's own testing demonstrates that the flushable wipes products break down in water at a significantly lower rate than toilet paper. Numerous news stories describe how flushable wipes have clogged municipal sewage systems, thereby requiring costly repairs. Consumers who have purchased some of the Kimberly-Clark flushable wipes products have lodged complaints on Kimberly-Clark's website that the flushable wipes damaged their septic tanks or plumbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on these allegations, Davidson brought four California state law causes of action against Kimberly-Clark, including for common law fraud and for violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"), California Civil Code \u00a7 1750,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , False Advertising Law (\"FAL\"), California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17500,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 17200,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Davidson sought restitution, injunctive relief, and actual, punitive, and statutory damages on her CLRA claim; restitution and injunctive relief on her FAL and UCL claims; and compensatory and punitive damages on her common law fraud claim. Davidson sought to certify a class of all persons who purchased Cottonelle Wipes, Scott Wipes, Huggies Wipes, and Kotex Wipes in California between March 13, 2010 and the filing of the FAC on September 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Davidson initially filed this case in state court, but Kimberly-Clark removed it to\n   federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). The district court denied in part and granted in part Kimberly-Clark's motion to dismiss the original complaint. In response, Davidson filed the operative FAC. Kimberly-Clark moved to dismiss the FAC, and the district court granted the motion, this time with prejudice. First, the district court granted Kimberly-Clark's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss Davidson's injunctive relief claims, finding that Davidson lacked standing to seek injunctive relief because she was unlikely to purchase Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes in the future. Second, the district court granted Kimberly-Clark's motion to dismiss the FAC pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6), concluding that Davidson had failed to adequately allege why the representation \"flushable\" on the package was false. Finally, the district court concluded that Davidson \"failed to allege damage under the UCL/FAL/CLRA or common law fraud\" causes of action, because Davidson had not alleged that she suffered any harm due to her use of the Scott Wipes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Davidson filed a motion for reconsideration under Rules 59(e) and 60(b), which the district court denied. First, the district court rejected Davidson's argument that it should have remanded the injunctive relief claims to state court. Second, the district court rejected Davidson's argument that it should have dismissed the FAC without prejudice so that Davidson could file a second amended complaint curing the alleged defects in the FAC. Third, the district court rejected Davidson's argument that the district court erred by ruling that Davidson had not adequately pled damages. Davidson timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Davidson appeals six of the district court's rulings. First, Davidson argues that the district court erred by dismissing the FAC pursuant to Rule 9(b) for failure to adequately allege why the representation \"flushable\" was false. Second, Davidson argues that the district court erred by dismissing the FAC pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the basis that Davidson had not suffered any damages. Third, Davidson argues that the district court erred by dismissing the original complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to plead how she came to believe the wipes were not flushable. Fourth, Davidson argues that the district court abused its discretion in striking, pursuant to Rule 12(f), references to newspaper reports in the original complaint. Fifth, Davidson argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying Davidson leave to amend her FAC. Finally, Davidson argues that the district court erred by dismissing her injunctive relief claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Theory of Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court dismissed the FAC pursuant to Rule 9(b) because it concluded that Davidson failed to adequately allege \"why\" the representation that the wipes were flushable was false. Davidson argues that the district court overlooked the FAC's \"numerous, detailed factual allegations establishing that Defendants' wipes fail to disperse and therefore cause clogs and problems with sewer and septic systems.\" Kimberly-Clark argues that Davidson must allege that she experienced problems with her home plumbing or the relevant water treatment plant-allegations that are indisputably lacking in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because Davidson's common law fraud, CLRA, FAL, and UCL causes of action are all grounded in fraud, the FAC must satisfy the traditional plausibility standard of Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6), as well as the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    Kearns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652195\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/1120/#p1124\">\n    567 F.3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e have specifically ruled that Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards apply to claims for violations of the CLRA and UCL.\");\n   <em>\n    Vess v.

Davidson alleged that flushable means \"suitable for being flushed,\" which requires an item to be capable of dispersing within a short amount of time. This definition of flushable is supported by multiple allegations in the FAC, including dictionary definitions and Kimberly-Clark's own\n   statement on its website that its flushable wipes \"are flushable due to patented technology that allows them to lose strength and\n   <em>\n    break up when moving through the system after flushing\n   </em>\n   .\" In contrast to truly flushable or dispersible products, Davidson alleged, Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes \"take hours to begin to break down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Importantly, Davidson alleged that the actual wipes she purchased failed to \"disperse and disintegrate within seconds or minutes.\" For example, Davidson alleged that after using the wipes, she \"noticed that each individual wipe felt very sturdy and thick, unlike toilet paper\" and that \"[s]he also noticed that the wipes did not break up in the toilet bowl like toilet paper but rather remained in one piece.\" Her personal experience is supported by additional allegations, including Kimberly-Clark's own testing of the wipes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Kimberly-Clark argues that Davidson was required to allege damage to her pipes or her sewage system because \"suitable for flushing\" means that the wipes \"would not cause problems in her plumbing or at the water treatment plant.\" But Kimberly-Clark justifies this theory by taking a single allegation in the FAC out of context. The FAC admittedly contains many allegations about how Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes and other wipes marketed as \"flushable\" can cause damage to pipes and sewage systems. But these allegations are extraneous and do not detract from Davidson's basic theory of fraud: that \"truly flushable products ... disperse and disintegrate within seconds or minutes,\" and Kimberly-Clark's flushable wipes do not \"disperse and disintegrate within seconds or minutes.\" Since \"[d ]ismissal is proper only where there is no cognizable legal theory or an absence of sufficient facts alleged to support a cognizable legal theory,\"\n   <em>\n    Navarro v.

Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court also dismissed Davidson's FAC in part because Davidson had not alleged that she suffered any damages. When Davidson questioned this conclusion in her motion for reconsideration, the district court clarified that Davidson \"had not pled facts showing that her use of the wipes damaged her plumping, pipes, or septic system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, Davidson was not required to allege damage to her plumbing or pipes.

To the extent the district court dismissed the original complaint because Davidson failed to allege facts \"showing how she came to believe that the [Scott Wipes] were not 'flushable,' \" the district court erred.

We hold that Davidson properly alleged that she faces a threat of imminent or actual harm by not being able to rely on Kimberly-Clark's labels in the future, and that this harm is sufficient to confer standing to seek injunctive relief. We therefore do not reach Davidson's alternative statutory standing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Article III of the U.S. Constitution authorizes the judiciary to adjudicate only \"cases\" and \"controversies.\" The doctrine of standing is \"an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Furthermore, although later Supreme Court cases have cited\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that standing is relief-specific, none has actually found a lack of standing to pursue a particular form of relief where there was otherwise Article III standing over the same claim advanced by the same party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Supreme Court has had no occasion to consider the logic of relief-specific standing. But in a state-law case such as this, adhering to the proper scope of the standing inquiry is uniquely important. For here, collapsing the standing and relief inquiries threatens to impose substantive limits on the availability of relief under state law in the service of constitutional interests that aren't actually under threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Despite these concerns, I nonetheless concur fully in the majority opinion. The Supreme Court has read\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   as requiring a separate standing analysis with regard to prospective injunctive relief, even when a party otherwise has standing to advance a claim.
