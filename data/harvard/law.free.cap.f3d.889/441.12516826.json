ZW USA, Inc. entered the dog-bag market first and registered the mark ONEPUL. PWD, LLC entered the market after ZW under the trade name BagSpot. On its website, PWD uses the phrase \"one-pull\" to describe some of its products. ZW sued PWD for infringement of its ONEPUL trademark, and PWD countersued claiming that the ONEPUL trademark is invalid. The district court granted summary judgment to PWD on the infringement claim, and to ZW on the validity claim. Both parties appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ZW and PWD sell plastic bags that customers use to pick up after their dogs. Both companies sell \"wicket\" bags (also called \"header\" bags). Like plastic grocery bags, wicket bags are sold stacked on top of one another and connected to some sort of header strip. Also like grocery bags, wicket bags are dispensed by tearing the bag off the header strip. Wicket bags are designed to be dispensed one at a time, with a single pull of the hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ZW, a California company, began selling bags first. ZW stands for \"zero waste.\" At some point, ZW began using the marks \"ONEPUL\" and \"SINGLPUL\" with its wicket bags. These marks, of course, are misspelled truncations of the phrases \"one-pull\" and \"single-pull.\" In 2013, ZW applied for trademarks for ONEPUL and SINGLPUL, which the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) granted in 2014. The PTO did not ask ZW for proof that the marks had acquired distinctiveness in the dog-bag marketplace. Since 2010, ZW has spent some $1.5 million on advertising for all of its products; it is unclear what portion of that sum was spent on advertising ONEPUL wicket bags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PWD is a Missouri company that began selling wicket bags in 2012. It markets its products under the trade name BagSpot, and competes with ZW for customers. PWD's website identifies its wicket bags using the phrases \"one-pull\" and \"one pull.\" As part of its marketing strategy, PWD purchased the term \"zerowaste\" from Google Adwords. As a result, when a person uses Google to search for \"zerowaste,\" PWD's site appears near the top of the results page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ZW filed suit alleging infringement of its ONEPUL and SINGLPUL trademarks. PWD countersued, claiming that both trademarks were invalid. At summary judgment, the district court determined that, while PWD had not infringed on ZW's marks, PWD had not presented evidence sufficient to overcome the strong presumption that ZW's registered marks were valid. It therefore granted PWD summary judgment on the infringement claim, and granted ZW summary judgment on the validity claim. On appeal, the parties raise the same issues that were before the district court. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Trademark Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ZW contends that PWD's description of its wicket bags as \"one-pull\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   infringes on its ONEPUL trademark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review this claim de novo.\n   <em>\n    Frosty Treats Inc. v.

That is the case here: PWD's \"one-pull\" bags are sold from a website that prominently displays its trade name, BagSpot. ZW does not contest this. Instead, ZW argues that the district court erred procedurally by requiring expert testimony-which ZW did not present- on similarity. But that is not what the district court did. The court merely explained that ZW\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have offered expert evidence to bolster its claim that ONEPUL and \"one-pull\" are similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As to the degree of competition between ZW and PWD's wicket bags, we agree with the district court that ZW and PWD compete in the market for dog-waste disposal products, which renders confusion more likely.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kemp v.

ZW cites two pieces of evidence to show intent. First, it says that PWD was aware of the details of ZW's business because PWD's founders are relatives of ZW's principals. That is evidence of knowledge only. Second, ZW cites PWD's purchase of the Google Adword \"zerowaste\" as evidence that PWD had bad intent. That might be relevant if we were analyzing a \"zerowaste\" trademark, but the issue in this case is the likelihood of confusion between ZW's ONEPUL mark and PWD's product description. Accordingly, ZW has introduced only minimal evidence that PWD intended to do anything but fairly compete with ZW in the dog-waste disposal industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the \"actual confusion\" factor, we agree with the district court that ZW introduced no evidence that any consumer had ever actually confused ZW's ONEPUL mark with PWD's description of its \"one-pull\" bags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, we consider \"the kind of product, its cost and the conditions of purchase\" to determine \"whether the degree of care exercised by the purchaser can eliminate the likelihood of confusion which would otherwise exist.\"\n   <em>\n    SquirtCo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292734\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1086/#p1091\">\n    628 F.2d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th.

The content of that evidence depends on how the PTO registered the mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have explained that, when the PTO registers a mark without asking the registrant to show the mark has acquired secondary meaning, the registration is evidence that the mark is inherently distinctive (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aromatique, Inc. v.

In this case, it is undisputed that the PTO registered ONEPUL without requiring ZW to show that it had acquired secondary meaning. Accordingly, ZW's registration certificate is evidence that the ONEPUL mark is inherently distinctive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Lanham Act tells us what a mark's registration means, but the ordinary rules of civil procedure tell us what to do with that information. At summary judgment, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, mark owner ZW), and summary judgment is withheld if there are genuine disputes of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The court considers the whole record, and refrains from weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.\n   <em>\n    Torgerson v. City of Rochester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n    643 F.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, PWD submitted evidence to show that ONEPUL was either generic or descriptive without secondary meaning. On genericness, PWD submitted printouts from several websites where competitors use the phrases \"one pull\" or \"one-pull\" to describe their dog bags,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which PWD contends establishes that \"one-pull\" is just a type of dog bag. On descriptiveness, PWD submitted ZW's product descriptions to show that ONEPUL is a variant of the phrase \"one-pull,\" which PWD argues immediately conveys the manner in which ZW's bags are dispensed: with one pull of the hand. ZW replied with its certificate of registration, and argued that the PTO found ONEPUL to be inherently distinctive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Viewing the record as a whole, there is a fact dispute as to whether the ONEPUL mark is generic or descriptive. On this record, the only way to grant ZW summary judgment on PWD's validity claims was to decide that ZW's evidence was stronger or more credible than PWD's evidence. Such a determination is improper at summary judgment, and must be left to the trier of fact. We must therefore reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to ZW on the validity claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    PWD argues that its use of the phrase \"one-pull\" was not a \"use in commerce\" that would subject it to suit for infringement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sensient Techs.
