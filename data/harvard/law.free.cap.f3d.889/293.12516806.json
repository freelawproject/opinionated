He worked in the coal-mining industry for over twenty years and developed severe respiratory issues. Raymond filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, but he died while his claim was still pending. Raymond's claim was consolidated with a claim for survivor's benefits submitted by his widow, Joanna Duncan. The administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") awarded benefits to Joanna, on both Raymond's behalf and as his surviving spouse. The Benefits Review Board (\"Board\") affirmed. Zurich American Insurance Group (\"Zurich American\"), the insurer of Straight Creek Coal Resources, now petitions this court to review the award.

Again nobody contends otherwise. Thus, an ordinary citizen would readily understand that, for two things to be \"substantially similar,\" they must largely share the same essential characteristics. Hence the meaning of that phrase is neither ambiguous nor vague, but straightforward and plain. And as used in \u00a7 921(c)(4) the phrase means simply that, to count toward the 15-year presumption, the conditions of a miner's work aboveground must largely share the essential characteristics of \"conditions in an underground mine.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nor is the essential characteristic of \"conditions in an underground mine\" hard to fathom for purposes of \u00a7 921(c)(4).

The underground condition that matters, for purposes of a presumption about causation of that disease, is exposure to coal dust. Of course, every \"miner\" under the Act is \"exposed to coal dust[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20902\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Thus, as the agency itself correctly points out, a showing that \"the miner was exposed to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   coal-mine dust in non-underground coal mining\" is not enough to show substantial similarity to underground conditions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2059%2C102\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. 59,102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,104 (Sept. 25, 2013) (emphasis added). Instead, the miner's exposure to coal dust must approximate that in an underground mine, where dust is relatively hard to escape because the mine is not open-air the way an aboveground mine is. Sporadic or intermittent exposure therefore is not enough; rather, to establish substantial similarity for purposes of \u00a7 921(c)(4), a miner must show that exposure to coal dust was the rule rather than the exception during his aboveground work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The agency's interpretation of \u00a7 921(c)(4) is no different than mine, since the agency would require an aboveground miner to show that he \"was regularly exposed to coal-mine dust while working there.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20718.305\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). (One might say the two interpretations are substantially similar.) Indeed the agency's interpretation of \u00a7 921(c)(4) is both thoughtful and well-reasoned. For the narrow purpose of deciding this case, therefore, it makes little difference whether we agree with the agency's interpretation (as I do) or defer to it (as the majority does).

This argument collapses multiple regulatory sections. Section 725.202(b) defines when a coal mine construction or transportation worker is considered a miner: They are a miner to the extent they are exposed to coal dust. This is consistent with the focus of the BLBA: exposure to coal dust. Underground-coal miners are presumed by Congress to be exposed to coal dust.\n    <em>\n     Midland Coal Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529365\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/509/#p511\">\n     855 F.2d at 512\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Their working conditions are the baseline to which others' working conditions are compared. Construction and transportation workers-who are not actually miners-are considered miners for the purposes of benefits under the BLBA to the extent their working conditions duplicate those of miners, i.e. regular exposure to coal dust.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.202\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).

But the mere fact that the regulations allow construction and transportation workers to claim benefits to the extent their employment resembles that of miners does not mean the regulations automatically allow surface miners to take advantage of a presumption crafted for underground miners without a further evidentiary showing.

It is true that the Department of Labor has limited the scope of the comparison necessary to determine whether a surface mine has \"substantially similar\" conditions to those of an underground mine by directing the inquiry to whether the dust exposure is similar.

Imagine a chef wants to bake a peach pie to enter into a stone-fruit pie contest. She tells her sous-chef to go to the market and purchase peaches but, if peaches are unavailable, to purchase fruit that is \"substantially similar.\" The sous-chef goes to the market and cannot find peaches. He then has to decide what the chef meant by \"substantially similar\" fruit. The sous-chef knows his boss is baking the pie to enter a stone-fruit pie contest. Thus, although peaches have many different characteristics that could be used as a point of comparison (i.e., color, flavor, texture, etc.), the sous-chef reasonably limits his search to only stone fruits. Put differently, his conclusion that fruit that is \"substantially similar\" to peaches are other stone fruits is a reasonable interpretation of the chef's requirements because the chef is baking to enter this contest. Here, the Department of Labor is the sous-chef to the Congressional chef, and has reasonably decided that regular exposure to coal dust is the key point of comparison that makes surface mining \"substantially similar\" to underground mining.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Dr. Westerfield was also incorrect in determining the amount of time that had elapsed, because he erroneously believed that Raymond had not worked in the coal industry since 1990, rather than 1999.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Pet'r App'x at A414 (Dr. Westerfield Op. at 10),\n    <em>\n     with\n     <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2059%2C102\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at A105 (Emp't Hist. at 1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
