His girlfriend, Ms. Andrea Smith, advised Omaha police officers that she and her boyfriend, Mr. Hill, were arguing about who she could be friends with on social media. Mr. Hill eventually threw her onto the floor and slapped her face, leaving a bruise on her right cheek. Mr. Hill is being charged with misdemeanor third degree domestic assault for this incident. A warrant was issued out of Douglas County Court on October 26, 2016 for this offense. A pretrial hearing is set for December 9, 2016 at 10 A.M. at the Douglas County Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hill denied the allegation. The government produced no evidence of domestic assault. On the government's motion, the court dismissed the allegation. (The charge also was dismissed in state court). Hill has no other documented history of violence, domestic or otherwise. Still, in the probation officer's \"Adjustment Report and Recommendation for Offender Under Supervision,\" it recommended a condition of supervision for \"Mr. Hill to complete domestic violence programming.\" The government repeated this recommendation at sentencing: \"And also the probation officer is recommending that he participate in a domestic violence programming as part of that term of supervised release.\" The district court adopted the recommendation without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The dismissed domestic assault allegation \"fail[s] to establish the factual or evidentiary basis necessary to impose [domestic violence] counseling.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
