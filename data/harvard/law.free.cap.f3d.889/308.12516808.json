His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Woods\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-CV-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205334601\">\n    2016 WL 5334601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D. Mich. Sept. 23, 2016). The Western District dismissed the first petition as untimely, and we denied Stevenson a certificate of appealability. Eleven days before the Western District dismissed the first petition, Stevenson filed another \u00a7 2254 petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The Eastern District, upon learning of Stevenson's earlier petition, dismissed the second as \"duplicative,\" finding that it \"raise[d] the same claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Noting that the second petition sought to raise three grounds not mentioned in the first petition, we granted a certificate of appealability to consider whether the Eastern District should have construed the second petition as a motion to amend the first petition. By order dated September 18, 2017, we determined that the Eastern District abused its discretion by failing to transfer the second petition to the Western District because a subsequent \u00a7 2254 petition filed while the petitioner's initial petition is still pending should be construed as a motion to amend the initial petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15.\n   <em>\n    See In re Deal\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-6023 (6th Cir.

We thus vacated the Eastern District's dismissal order and remanded the case for transfer to the Western District of Michigan with instructions to consider the second petition as a motion to amend Stevenson's first petition.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v. Woods\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-2577 (6th Cir. Sept. 18, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Eastern District transferred the case to the Western District as directed by our September 18, 2017, order. The Western District did not follow our instructions, however, and instead transferred the case back to this court for consideration as an application to file a second or successive habeas petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11909353\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/45/#p47\">\n    111 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (6th Cir. 1997).\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v. Horton\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:17-CV-177 (W.D. Mich. Jan. 9, 2018). Because we have already determined that the second petition was not second or successive-but instead should be construed as a motion to amend the first petition-the proper disposition is to remand the case to the Western District for consideration in accordance with our September 18, 2017, order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, Stevenson's motion for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as unnecessary.
