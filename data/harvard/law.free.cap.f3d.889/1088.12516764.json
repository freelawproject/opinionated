A jury returned a defense verdict, and Snapp appeals. At trial, the parties disputed whether Snapp had requested an accommodation. In addition, the parties disagreed as to whether and how the jury instructions should address the \"interactive process,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the statutorily required collaborative effort for identifying an employee's abilities and an employer's possibly reasonable accommodations. Snapp argues the district court improperly rejected a proposed instruction that would have imposed liability on BNSF merely for failing to engage in the interactive process, regardless of the availability of a reasonable accommodation. Snapp also argues the district court improperly rejected a proposed jury instruction that would have described his overall burden of proof as a mere burden of production rather than as an ultimate burden\n   of persuasion. Finally, Snapp argues the district court erred by refusing to treat statements by BNSF's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) corporate representative as binding admissions. We find no error and affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Snapp worked for BNSF from 1971 through 1999. He rose through the ranks, becoming a Division Trainmaster in 1986. Due to tiredness and low energy, he went to a doctor in 1994. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and had surgeries in 1996 and 1998 in unsuccessful attempts to correct his condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1999, BNSF received a report from Snapp's physician. Snapp's supervisor told Snapp he did not believe Snapp could work in a safe manner. In 1999, Snapp took a \"fitness for duty\" evaluation, was determined to be totally disabled, and went on short-term disability leave. He applied for long-term disability benefits through CIGNA, the third-party administrator for BNSF's disability plan. In February 2000, BNSF's medical director told Snapp that CIGNA had approved Snapp's claim for disability benefits and that, should CIGNA later find him ineligible, he should contact BNSF's medical director to plan a \"return to work.\" Snapp began a period of long-term disability leave and received payments from CIGNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, CIGNA requested a sleep study to verify Snapp's continuing disability. When Snapp arrived at a clinic for the study, the clinic asked him to sign a release accepting personal financial responsibility for the test. He refused and did not complete the study. In November 2005, CIGNA terminated Snapp's disability benefits citing an absence of evidence of continuing disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that time, Snapp did not request an accommodation or apply to return to work. Rather, he appealed CIGNA's denial of benefits, filed complaints with governmental entities, and copied BNSF on his appeal letter. CIGNA notified BNSF in November 2007 that it had denied Snapp's appeal and Snapp was no longer eligible for long-term disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also in November 2007, Snapp wrote to BNSF demanding reinstatement of his disability payments, demanding reimbursement for overpayment of life-insurance premiums, and threatening to sue BNSF. He called to follow up on the letter. He did not ask to return to employment in either the letter or the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 2, 2008, BNSF representative Lori Emery sent Snapp a letter telling him that, in accordance with the BNSF Long-Term Disability Plan, he had sixty days to secure a position with BNSF or he would be dismissed. The letter stated, \"BNSF is under no obligation to provide you with a salaried position if you are released to return to work by your physician.\" Emery invited Snapp to contact her directly and copied Dane Freshour, BNSF's Regional Director of Human Resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 6, 2008, Snapp wrote back a letter addressing primarily the denial of disability benefits and attaching several documents. Snapp's letter stated, \"Your letter does nothing to address my letter dated November 10, 2007! ... I was in hopes that BNSF Railway would assist me in my endeavor with CIGNA .... For several years I have attempted to get BNSF Railway to correct the ongoing malicious administration of the Disability contract(s) ....\" Snapp also stated he would \"more than welcome your offer to return to BNSF employment without discrimination of my situation ....\" He attached to his letter several pages related to the CIGNA policy regarding CIGNA's payment for rehabilitation and reasonable accommodation\n   costs. He also attached a doctor's note dated April 2007 in which the doctor stated, \"I do not feel ... it is safe for you to return to work.\" In the alternative, Snapp asked for \"[a] continued and on going Long Term Disability leave of Absence until this is presented in a court of law regarding CIGNA discontinued benefits through malicious administration and breach of the BNSF ... Welfare Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Emery wrote to Snapp on January 10. She confirmed receipt of his November 2007 and January 2008 letters and reported having resolved the life-insurance-premium overpayment issue, stating a refund check was on its way. Regarding disability benefits, she reiterated that CIGNA was solely responsible for plan administration and he should deal with CIGNA directly. In doing so, she referenced a 2006 communication from BNSF to Snapp's attorney conveying the same information. Emery reported that BNSF was standing by the sixty-day window to secure employment, cited a website for accessing current openings, and identified Freshour as the human resources representative for Snapp's geographic region.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Snapp neither visited the website nor contacted Freshour. Before the end of the sixty-day period, however, Snapp contacted the Union to ask about his seniority for a yardmaster position. The Union told him he lacked the requisite seniority. Notwithstanding this information, he sent a letter dated February 28, 2008, to a BNSF facility in Vancouver, Washington, seeking to displace a senior yardmaster for a position and asking for an immediate ninety-day medical leave beginning March 2 \"to finalize medical testing with the slight possibility of surgery for correction of my long and existing condition.\" Snapp attached to his February 28 letter a note from a Veterans Affairs neurologist who stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Thank you for your recent correspondence and request for clarification of my recommendations from January 14, 2008. As I stated previously,\n   <em>\n    light-duty work can be considered after treatment is further optimized\n   </em>\n   (oral appliance therapy) but the following restrictions would need to apply: daytime work only (no shift work); restriction to 8 hours of duty at the maximum (no mandated overtime)[;] and no working with heavy equipment. An office job that didn't involve any activity during which time if you [fell] asleep you could cause injury to yourself or other[s] is what I would recommend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   BNSF checked with the Union regarding Snapp's seniority and discovered he lacked the requisite seniority. Because the sixty-day window had expired, BNSF terminated his employment. Snapp challenged the Union's determination, and the Union explained he had not been a member since 1982. Snapp continued to communicate with BNSF through at least Spring 2009, seeking to exercise seniority rights for a brakeman position. BNSF directed him to the company website to apply for open positions. Snapp then pursued a claim against BNSF through the Public Law Board concerning his attempted exercise of seniority rights. The Board ruled in favor of BNSF. Snapp did not apply for any positions with BNSF other than the Vancouver yardmaster job in 2008 and the brakemaster job in 2009 (his post-termination attempt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Snapp sued BNSF in August 2010 alleging a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. BNSF moved for and was granted summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Snapp requested an accommodation so as to trigger BNSF's duty to engage in the interactive process.\n   <em>\n    Snapp v. United Transp. Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20Fed.%20Appx.%20824\">\n    547 Fed.Appx. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 (9th Cir. 2013)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (unpublished memorandum disposition). On remand, BNSF and Snapp each moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the motions. As relevant to the present appeal, Snapp argued that, in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 30(b)(6) corporate-designee deposition, Freshour admitted Snapp had requested an accommodation and also admitted BNSF failed to engage in the interactive process in response to the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, Snapp repeatedly addressed the issue of BNSF's duty to engage in the interactive process. Snapp requested jury instructions that the district court rejected. In particular, Snapp sought an instruction that would have relieved him entirely of showing the availability of a reasonable accommodation. He sought to impose liability on BNSF simply for failing to engage in the interactive process\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   BNSF could prove an affirmative defense, which he argued BNSF had waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, Snapp characterized the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation as an affirmative defense. Further, and regardless of BNSF's participation in an interactive process, Snapp sought an instruction that would have described Snapp's burden of proof as to the availability of a reasonable accommodation in terms equivalent to a slight burden of production. The instructions as actually given to the jury placed the burden of proof on Snapp as to all issues other than the statutory defense of \"undue hardship,\" which the instructions placed on BNSF. The district court did not give the jury an instruction regarding the duty to engage in the interactive process. The instructions the district court gave were based on the Ninth Circuit Model Instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Snapp moved at the end of trial for judgment as a matter of law, reasserting the arguments from his unsuccessful summary judgment motion. The district court denied the motion, and the jury returned a verdict for BNSF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Snapp alleges the district court erred in formulating the jury instructions and in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Snapp also seeks review of the denial of his motion for summary judgment. Post-trial, however, a denial of summary judgment generally is not separately reviewable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escriba v. Foster Poultry Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116042\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/1236/#p1243\">\n    743 F.3d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (9th Cir. 2014). In any event, we address issues raised in that motion to the extent Snapp reasserted his arguments in his later motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4116042\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/1236/#p1243\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties agree de novo review applies to the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law. The parties disagree as to the standard of review we are to apply to the alleged instructional error. \"A district court's formulation of the jury instructions is reviewed for 'abuse of discretion.' If, however, 'the instructions are challenged as a misstatement of the law, they are then reviewed de novo.' \"\n   <em>\n    Duran v. City of Maywood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11246983\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/1127/#p1130\">\n    221 F.3d 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gilbrook v.

In this instance, we conclude de novo review applies because an improper allocation of the burden of proof or an improper articulation of the elements of a\n   cause of action necessarily would be errors at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. ADA Interactive Process, Generally\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The ADA treats the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation as an act of discrimination if the employee is a \"qualified individual,\" the employer receives adequate notice, and a reasonable accommodation is available that would not place an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5)(A) (\"[T ]he term 'discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability' includes-not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity[.]\"). The statute itself places on the employer the burden to demonstrate an undue hardship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that notifying an employer of a need for an accommodation triggers a duty to engage in an \"interactive process\" through which the employer and employee can come to understand the employee's abilities and limitations, the employer's needs for various positions, and a possible middle ground for accommodating the employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnett v.

In\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that if an employer receives notice and fails to engage in the interactive process in good faith, the employer will face liability \"\n   <em>\n    if a reasonable accommodation would have been possible\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230930\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/1105/#p1111\">\n    228 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, there exists no stand-alone claim for failing to engage in the interactive process. Rather, discrimination results from denying an available and reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Recognizing the importance of the interactive process, the Ninth Circuit also held that if an employer fails to engage in good faith in the interactive process, the burden at the summary-judgment phase shifts to the employer to prove the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morton v.

We further hold that an employer cannot prevail at the summary judgment stage if there is a genuine dispute as to whether the employer engaged in good faith in the interactive process.\"). The rationale for shifting this burden arises from EEOC regulations and the ADA's legislative history that characterize the interactive process as at the heart of the accommodation process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230930\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/1105/#p1111\">\n    228 F.3d at 1110-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   were summary-judgment cases. No Ninth Circuit case has actually held that the shifted burden as to the availability of a reasonable accommodation carries over into trial and must be expressed in jury instructions. In\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   , however, the court used expansive language that Snapp relies upon to argue that this burden shifting should apply at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1953014\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1249/#p1256\">\n    272 F.3d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The question whether this failure should be excused because there would in any event have been no reasonable accommodation available is one as to which the employer, not the employee, should bear the burden of persuasion\n   <em>\n    throughout the litigation\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis\n   added) ). The main question in the present appeal turns on whether the burden shifting announced in\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   applies also at trial or should be cabined to the summary-judgment context. Snapp also presents an argument concerning the \"law of the case\" based on the memorandum disposition in the first appeal, a more general challenge to the jury instructions, and an argument concerning testimony from a corporate-designee deponent. We address these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B. Jury Instructions-Interactive Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   i. Law of the Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Snapp requested an instruction that would have provided, \"If plaintiff proves defendant failed to initiate the interactive process or to participate in good faith in the interactive process, your verdict should be for plaintiff [unless defendant proves an affirmative defense.]\" Plaintiff's Proposed Inst. No. 27. Snapp then characterized \"reasonable accommodation,\" \"undue hardship,\" and \"direct threat of harm\" as affirmative defenses and argued BNSF waived all of these defenses. Through this request, including his labeling of \"reasonable accommodation\" as an affirmative defense that BNSF allegedly had waived, Snapp sought in the alternative (1) direct liability on BNSF for failing to engage in the interactive process, and (2) an instruction that would have applied burden shifting as a remedy for BNSF's alleged failure to engage (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , would have imposed on BNSF a burden to prove the unavailability of a reasonable accommodation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Snapp argues that his exact proposed instruction was proper because, in the memorandum disposition from the first appeal in this case, the Ninth Circuit stated, \"Consequently, there is a genuine dispute over whether BNSF engaged in good faith in a required interactive process, and failure to do so would constitute discrimination under the ADA.\"\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20Fed.%20Appx.%20824\">\n    547 Fed.Appx. at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, we find no indication that the prior panel intended the quoted statement to serve as a full statement of the law or that the quoted statement was necessary for resolution of the appeal. That panel was reviewing a grant of summary judgment and did not purport to articulate instructions for trial. Moreover, as explained below, a denial of summary judgment is appropriate where there has been a failure to engage in the interactive process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1953014\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1249/#p1256\">\n    272 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1256 ;\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230930\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/1105/#p1111\">\n    228 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prior panel's statement, therefore, is not the law of the case.

It is the primary vehicle for identifying and achieving effective adjustments which allow disabled employees to continue working without placing an \"undue burden\" on employers. Employees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have.

Nor did the court suggest it was contemplating the complexities that would arise from such an instructional issue at trial. In fact, these complexities militate strongly against taking\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   out of context and extending its holding to trial. As a practical matter, the jury would need instructions\n   asking if the employer participated in the interactive process in good faith. Then, the jury would need alternative instructions telling them how to allocate the burden of proof if they found an employer had failed to engage in good faith, and as a contingency, how to allocate the burden if the employer did engage in the interactive process. All the while, the court would need to ensure the jury did not impose liability on the employer simply for failing to engage-the risk of prejudicial juror confusion would be high. District judges dealing with motions for summary judgment, with the benefit of briefing, are well-equipped to cut through such thickets. It is less clear such complexity is appropriate for jury instructions. In fact, courts often reject attempts to charge jurors with complicated burden-shifting frameworks, asking jurors, instead, to weigh in on the ultimate question of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanghvi v.

This outcome alone would seem to contradict\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   . And it would place the jury in the difficult situation of assessing damages for a failure-to-accommodate claim with nothing but speculation to guide the analysis of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yonemoto v.

Regardless, in an accompanying footnote, the court continued its discussion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   can be read as holding that an employer who has not engaged in the interactive process is not entitled to summary judgment no matter what the evidence on summary judgment shows concerning the actual availability of a reasonable accommodation.

We therefore understand\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   as holding, instead, that the task of proving the negative-that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   reasonable accommodation was available-rests with an offending employer\n   throughout the litigation, and that, given the difficulty of proving such a negative, it is not likely that an employer will be able to establish on summary judgment the absence of a disputed fact as to this question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1953014\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/1249/#p1256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1256 n.7.

First, the Court in\n   <em>\n    US Airways\n   </em>\n   was addressing a summary-judgment ruling, not a trial issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    535 U.S. at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And second, the Court was not addressing a general question regarding the allocation of the burden of proof. Rather, in\n   <em>\n    US Airways\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed how a court should consider the existence of an employer's otherwise non-discriminatory seniority-preference system when assessing a reasonable-accommodation claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    at 395-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Far from concluding a plaintiff carries only some minimal burden at trial, the Court concluded, instead, that a plaintiff at summary judgment must show \"special circumstances\" to justify an accommodation that would violate a seniority-preference system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    at 405-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352250\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/391/#p406\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e do mean to say that the plaintiff must bear the burden of showing special circumstances that make an exception from the seniority system reasonable in the particular case.\"). The Court, therefore, in no manner suggested it was lessening a burden or shifting more general burden of proof at trial\n   <em>\n    away from\n   </em>\n   an ADA reasonable-accommodation plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We conclude, based upon\n   <em>\n    Dark\n   </em>\n   , that the district court properly described Snapp's burden as a burden of proof and properly refused Snapp's requested instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   D. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, as a separate matter, Snapp argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for judgment as a matter of law. Specifically, Snapp argues that a corporate designee for BNSF made binding admissions that should have resulted in a determination, as a matter of law, that Snapp requested an accommodation and BNSF failed to engage in the interactive process. We find no error in the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   During discovery, BNSF designated Human Resources Director Dane Freshour as its Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) corporate representative. During Freshour's deposition, counsel for Snapp read isolated sentences from Snapp's letters to BNSF and elicited responses from Freshour. Snapp correctly notes that, in these responses, Freshour appeared to indicate Snapp had requested a reasonable accommodation and BNSF had failed to engage in the interactive process. Snapp argues these statements conclusively bind BNSF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Apart from Freshour's answers to these questions in the depositions, however, the record contains a full history of communications between the parties showing that Snapp communicated repeatedly with BNSF, sought reinstatement of his long-term disability benefits, and accused BNSF, CIGNA, and his doctors of conspiring against him to deny him benefits. Moreover, two of Snapp's letters included doctor's notes that did not release him to work. Rather, the doctor's notes stated (1) it would not be safe for Snapp to return to work, and (2) he might be able to return to work in the future if treatment is \"further optimized.\" The sentences Snapp's attorney asked Freshour about in the deposition were taken from these same letters-letters that were long and dense and primarily addressed Snapp's grievances about his terminated disability-insurance payments. At trial, the BNSF employee who had been communicating with Snapp through these letters, Emery, testified that she believed Snapp's letters were an attempt to reinstate his disability-insurance benefits. She also testified that she understood a reference by Snapp to \"reasonable accommodation\" to be a reference to CIGNA policy provisions that he had attached to his letter and that concerned rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, BNSF's reply letters directed Snapp to review open positions and contact human resources, neither of which he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At trial, Freshour was questioned about his deposition responses. Snapp, therefore, was not limited in his ability to use the corporate designee's deposition as evidence. And his letters were admitted into evidence for the jury to consider. Taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, the record amply supports the view that Snapp neither requested an accommodation nor took advantage of resources that could have opened the door for the interactive process or a possible accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The only issue meriting discussion as to the motion for judgment as a matter of law, then, is whether BNSF was bound by Freshour's deposition responses such that the jury should not have been allowed to consider other evidence. \"[A ] corporation\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   cannot present a theory of the facts that differs from that articulated by the designated Rule 30(b)(6) representative.\" 7 James Wm.
