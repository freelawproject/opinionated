In November 2012, after almost ten years of studies, expert reports, meetings, and other regulatory processing, the BIA agreed to the acquisition. Immediately following the BIA's decision, several entities, including the Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians of the Colusa Indian Community (\"Colusa\"), a nearby Indian Tribe with a casino of its own, and various citizens' groups and individuals opposed to the construction of the Enterprise Casino (together, \"Citizens\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleged a host of errors in the lengthy regulatory process and sued to enjoin the trust acquisition. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Enterprise. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1915, a representative of the United States Indian Service visited Enterprise, California, and completed a census of fifty-one Indians \"in and near Enterprise in Butte County, California.\" That same year, the United States purchased two forty-acre parcels of land in trust for Indians living in Enterprise: (1) Enterprise 1, located approximately ten miles northeast of Oroville, and (2) Enterprise 2, located closer to Oroville (together, the \"Enterprise Rancheria\"). The United States continues to hold Enterprise 1 in trust; however, in 1965, the State of California purchased Enterprise 2 and flooded it to allow the construction of the Oroville dam. The parties agree that since 1915 Indians have been living on the Enterprise Rancheria, and the Enterprise Rancheria is an Indian Reservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1934, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205108\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., (the \"IRA\"). Section 18 of the IRA states that the Act \"shall not apply to any reservation wherein a majority of the adult Indians, voting at a special election duly called by the Secretary of the Interior, shall vote against its application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5125. In due course, so-called Section 18 elections were held on Indian reservations around the country, including on Enterprise Rancheria on June 16, 1935.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1979, the Department of the Interior began to publish lists of federally recognized tribes in the Federal Register. The \"Enterprise Rancheria of Maidu Indians\" has appeared on each list from 1979 to the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 13, 2002, Enterprise submitted a \"fee-to-trust\" application to the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the IRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205108\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which authorizes the Secretary to take lands in trust for the benefit of \"the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired.\" The application asked the Secretary to accept into trust forty acres of land owned by Yuba County Entertainment, L.L.C., (the \"Yuba Site\"), located in Yuba County, California, so Enterprise could develop an off-reservation casino and hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There are a number of regulatory hurdles which must be vaulted to take land into trust for off-reservation gaming. While the IRA allows for the Secretary to take land into trust for the benefit of Indians, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"IGRA\") generally prohibits gaming on such lands taken into trust after October 17, 1988. However, gaming is permitted if the Secretary determines, after consulting with the \"Indian tribe and appropriate State and local officials, including officials of other nearby Indian tribes,\" that the gaming would \"not be detrimental to the surrounding community,\" and if the Governor of the relevant state agrees with the Secretary's determination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). This is referred to as the Secretarial two-part determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to satisfying IGRA, more regulatory hurdles remain. The Department of the Interior and the applicant Tribe must satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   , (\"NEPA\"). NEPA requires that all federal agencies considering actions \"significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\" prepare a \"detailed statement\" describing the \"environmental impact of the proposed action,\" \"any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,\" \"alternatives to the proposed action,\" \"the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity,\" and \"any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4332(C). The \"detailed statement\" is referred to as an Environmental Impact Statement (an \"EIS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These various statutory and regulatory requirements created a lengthy administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, on August 13, 2002, Enterprise submitted its \"fee-to-trust\" application to the Secretary of the Interior. The application requested that Interior take title to the Yuba Site in trust so that the Tribe\n   could build a 207,760 square foot casino and accompanying hotel. The application included a December 2001 document entitled \"Gaming and Hotel Market Assessment: Marysville, California,\" prepared by The Innovation Group. The assessment evaluated ten market areas in northern California, analyzed the characteristics of other existing tribal casinos, and estimated revenues and expenses for a casino/hotel for 2004-2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, Enterprise retained a consultant, Analytical Environmental Services (\"AES\"), to submit a draft Environmental Assessment (an \"EA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The draft EA was submitted to the BIA on July 15, 2003. The BIA reviewed the draft EA and suggested numerous revisions. In May 2004, the EA was finalized. The BIA made the EA available for public review and comment by publishing a Notice of Availability in a Marysville newspaper and mailing the EA to local, State, and tribal governments. On July 7, 2004, the BIA sent a copy of the EA to Colusa. Although NEPA and administrative regulations provide for the receipt of comments as to the EA, Colusa did not comment on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, after receipt of comments by others than Colusa on the EA, the BIA decided to prepare an EIS to analyze further the possible environmental effects of the proposed fee-to-trust acquisition. Toward that end, the BIA entered into a \"Professional Services Third-Party Agreement\" with AES on January 6, 2005. The Agreement states that the BIA would \"provide AES the technical direction, review, and quality control for the preparation of the Scoping Report, EIS, technical studies, and other NEPA-related documents\" and that AES would be the \"project manager on behalf of [the] BIA.\" Enterprise would pay AES's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fourth, after having hired AES, the BIA engaged in a \"scoping\" process. \"Scoping is a process that continues throughout the planning and early stages of preparation of an [EIS] ... to engage State, local and tribal governments and the public in the early identification of concerns, potential impacts, relevant effects of past actions and possible alternative actions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.235\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A \"scoping\" meeting was held on June 9, 2005 in Marysville. The BIA also published a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on May 20, 2005, and in Marysville and Sacramento newspapers shortly thereafter. Comments to the scoping process were submitted in writing and at the public meeting. Colusa did not comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fifth, having engaged in the scoping process, AES prepared a draft EIS (\"DEIS\"), which it completed under the BIA's supervision in February 2008. The DEIS analyzed five potential alternatives to the regulatory action: A) Enterprise Rancheria's proposed facility on the Yuba Site; B) a smaller casino without a hotel on the Yuba Site; C) a water park on the Yuba Site; D) a small casino on another site in Butte County; and E) no action. The DEIS recognized that while the proposed facility on the Yuba Site would benefit Enterprise, \"the surrounding tribes that operate casinos could experience decreases in winnings, and potentially be adversely impacted by the decreases,\" with the proposed casino/hotel project expected to capture \"approximately $77 million [per year] in total gaming win[nings] from the local market.\" The analysis was based on a study by the company Gaming Market\n   Advisors from June 2006 contained in Appendix M of the DEIS, entitled \"Socio-Economic, Growth Inducing and Environmental Justice Impact Study.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The DEIS was made available for review and comment was invited through publication in the Federal Register, and in Chico, Marysville, Oroville, and Sacramento newspapers. A public hearing was held on April 9, 2008. While multiple comments on the project were submitted, including by Indian Tribes who were opposed to the project,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   again, Colusa did not submit any comments on the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sixth, in addition to complying with the regulatory steps required by NEPA, Enterprise and the BIA took the steps required under IGRA's Secretarial two-part determination. In Part 1 of the Secretarial two-part determination, the Secretary of the Interior determines whether \"a gaming establishment on newly acquired lands would be in the best interest of the Indian tribe and its members, and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). In making his determination that the project will not be \"detrimental\" to the surrounding community, the Secretary is required to seek the consultation of State and local officials, including officials of nearby Indian tribes and other communities surrounding the proposed site.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.13\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The regulations specify that the \"surrounding community means local governments and nearby Indian tribes located within a twenty-five-mile radius of the site of the proposed gaming establishment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 292.2. However, a local government or Indian tribe \"located beyond the [twenty-five]-mile radius may petition for consultation if it can establish that its governmental functions, infrastructure or services will be directly, immediately and significantly impacted by the proposed gaming establishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The BIA commenced the consultation on January 16, 2009, and sent letters to State and local officials within a twenty-five-mile radius of the Yuba Site soliciting their input on the proposed project. Colusa is not located within twenty-five miles of the proposed casino project. Colusa wrote to the BIA on June 23, 2009, and stated that Colusa should be consulted and that, given the potential impact of the proposed casino on Colusa's own casino revenues, the BIA should not \"slavish[ly] adhere[ ] to the arbitrary [twenty-five]-mile standard.\" In response, the BIA provided Colusa with Enterprise's fee-to-trust application and the two-part determination request. Colusa did not respond to the BIA's letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Seventh, in May 2010 the BIA completed the final EIS (the \"FEIS\"). The FEIS retained the same five alternatives which were contained in the DEIS, and incorporated the same analysis as included in the DEIS with respect to the casino alternatives' effects on other tribal casinos. The BIA made the FEIS available for public review and comment by publishing a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register and Chico, Marysville, and Oroville newspapers. Colusa then submitted a comment letter dated September 7, 2010. The comment letter complained that the FEIS's Purpose and Need Statement was unduly restrictive; the FEIS failed to consider reasonable alternatives; and Appendix M, which analyzed the effect of the proposed casino on other tribal casinos, relies on \"conjecture rather than data.\" The BIA responded to each of the comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Eighth, having published the FEIS and considered comments, the BIA published its Record of Decision under IGRA (the \"IGRA ROD\") in September 2011. The IGRA ROD concluded that the project would \"1) be in the best interest of the Tribe and its members; and 2) that it would not be detrimental to the surrounding community.\" Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), the BIA sought the concurrence of California Governor Jerry Brown in its decision. Governor Brown concurred by letter dated August 30, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the BIA issued a Record of Decision under the IRA (\"IRA ROD\") in November 2012 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205108\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The IRA ROD concluded the trust acquisition on the Yuba Site would \"provide the Tribe with the best opportunity for attracting and maintaining a significant, stable, long-term source of governmental revenue, and accordingly, the best prospects for maintaining and expanding tribal governmental programs to provide a wide range of health, education, housing, social, cultural, environmental, and other programs, as well as employment and career development opportunities for its members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The lawsuits began immediately following the IRA ROD's publication. The United Auburn Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria (the \"UAIC\") filed a complaint in the District of Columbia on December 12, 2012. Colusa filed a complaint in the Eastern District of California a few days later. On December 20, 2012, Citizens filed a complaint in the District of Columbia as well. The Citizens and UAIC cases were consolidated and transferred to the Eastern District of California. On January 23, 2013, the Citizens/UAIC case was further consolidated with Colusa's into a single case. Enterprise intervened as a defendant. Citizens, Colusa, and UAIC immediately moved for injunctive relief to prevent the BIA from taking the land into trust for Enterprise. The motion for injunctive relief was denied. The Yuba Site was taken into trust on May 15, 2013. The lawsuit, however, continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before the district court, the UAIC, Citizens, and Colusa alleged that Interior violated NEPA, IGRA, the IRA, and the Clean Air Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207506\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. In support of their motion for summary judgment, Colusa submitted a Declaration by economist Alan Meister, dated October 9, 2014, along with a two-page summary of a study Meister oversaw entitled \"Economic Impacts of the Proposed Enterprise Rancheria Casino on the Colusa Indian Community &amp; Colusa Casino Resort,\" (together the \"Meister Declaration\"), which purports to demonstrate that Enterprise's proposed casino will have a devastating economic impact on Colusa. As a result, the Meister Declaration is particularly relevant to Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants violated IGRA, as IGRA requires the Secretary to determine that the proposed casino will not be \"detrimental to the surrounding community.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202719\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The regulatory process ended when the IRA ROD was issued on November 21, 2012. However, the Meister Declaration first appeared as an exhibit in support of Colusa's 2014 motion for summary judgment, and therefore was not in the Administrative Record considered by the Agency. Interior moved to strike the Meister Declaration from the district court record. The district court granted the motion to strike the Meister Declaration because it post-dates the Agency decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary\n   judgment on each of plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied on January 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Both Colusa and Citizens timely appealed the district court's decision, and those appeals were consolidated into this action. The UAIC is not a plaintiff in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schneider v.

Citizens reasons that contemporaneous accounts from the Department of Interior show that Indians with differing tribal ancestries often lived together on the same reservation, and that in any event the voting record from the Section 18 election does not describe any specific tribal affiliation of those Indians who voted. Taken together, Citizens concludes that, while the Section 18 election may be evidence that individual Indians were living at the reservation, the election does not demonstrate that those Indians were part of a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   recognized tribe. The individuals who voted in that election may have had multiple tribal affiliations, or no affiliation at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Citizens' argument ignores the expansive definition of \"tribe\" contained in the IRA.

The posture of that case is nearly identical to this one. In\n   <em>\n    Stand Up for California!\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff objected to Interior's acquisition of a tract of land for the benefit of the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians (the \"North Fork\") so that the North Fork could build a casino. As in this case, the North Fork Record of Decision cited a Section 18 election held on the North Fork reservation shortly after the passage of the IRA as evidence the North Fork Indians were a \"tribe\" \"under federal jurisdiction\" in 1934.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266842\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1177/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266842\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1177/\">\n    at 1182-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The D.C. Circuit therefore concluded that a Section 18 election held on a reservation represents adequate evidence of the tribe's existence, as \" 'nothing in the text of [the IRA] requires a tribe' within the meaning of the statute 'to be \"single,\" \"unified,\" or comprised of members of the same historically cohesive or ethnographically homogenous tribe.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To summarize, Citizens is correct that the BIA has an affirmative obligation to show that Enterprise was a \"tribe\" under\n   federal jurisdiction in 1934. But because of the IRA's expansive definition of \"tribe,\" evidence demonstrating that a group of Indians was \"residing on one reservation\" in 1934 would suffice to demonstrate that those Indians were in a \"tribe\" pursuant to the IRA. The parties do not dispute that Indians have been residing on Enterprise Rancheria, a reservation, since the Rancheria was established in 1915.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Section 18 election further demonstrates the \"tribe\" was under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted. The Interior therefore had authority to take land into trust for Enterprise's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    2. \"Need\" for the land\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The implementing regulations for the IRA, which are contained in 25 C.F.R. Part 151, explain that the Secretary may take land into trust for tribes if \"the acquisition of the land is necessary to facilitate tribal self-determination, economic development, or Indian housing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20151.3\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Among other things, the Secretary must specifically consider \"[t]he need of the individual Indian or the tribe for additional land.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20151.11\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IRA ROD explained that Enterprise had limited land holdings, and with such limited holdings, \"the Tribe has been unable to exercise many of its sovereign powers. The Tribe's office is located on non-Indian fee land, and there is no usable land base for tribal housing programs of any kind or economic development. The Tribe needs the subject parcel held in trust in order to better exercise its sovereign responsibility to provide economic development to its tribal citizens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Colusa argues in their opening brief that the IRA ROD \"did not find that Enterprise had a 'need' for the Yuba Parcel ... so much as a 'desire' for it.\" In other words, this\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   parcel is not essential for Enterprise's economic development, and Enterprise therefore does not need it, as other parcels might provide adequate opportunity for economic development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Colusa asks the impossible. It is unclear how any trust application can prove a negative and demonstrate that a single parcel of land-and only that particular parcel-will suffice. Colusa points to no case, and we are aware of none, where a court has mandated such an undertaking. By contrast, in\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v. United States Department of the Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928199\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/790/#p801\">\n    423 F.3d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801 (8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit rejected a similar argument. In that case, the court considered the State of South Dakota's appeal of Interior's decision to take certain land into trust for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928199\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/790/#p801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928199\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/790/#p801\">\n    at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One of the plaintiff's arguments was that the Secretary did not describe sufficiently the tribe's \"need\" for the land.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928199\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/790/#p801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928199\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/790/#p801\">\n    at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel determined that it is \"sufficient for the Department's analysis to express the Tribe's needs and conclude generally that IRA purposes were served.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree. Interior determined that Enterprise needed economic development; the Yuba Site provides an opportunity for Enterprise to engage in that development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, Colusa argues that the existence of other parcels owned by Enterprise somehow undercuts Enterprise's need for the land. Colusa notes that Enterprise previously purchased land in Butte County, with funds granted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and one of the authorized uses for that land is economic development. But the existence of other land does not undercut Enterprise's \"need\" for the Yuba parcel. Indeed, Colusa had recognized in its 2010 comments on the FEIS that Enterprise intends to use the sixty-three-acre parcel for tribal member housing purposes. Enterprise secured a place for its members to live. That does not render arbitrary or capricious its acquisition of a place for them to work as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    3. Mis-description of the Parcel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On December 3, 2012, Interior published in the Federal Register a Notice of Final Agency Determination to take land into trust for the benefit of Enterprise Rancheria,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071612\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 71612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Notice included a description of the land to be taken into trust. However, the notice provided an incorrect legal description of an eighty-acre parcel-the parcel which would be divided prior to the transfer of forty acres into trust for Enterprise's benefit. Interior corrected this error in the legal description the following month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%20114\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 2, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Colusa infers from this mis-description that Interior did not actually know what piece of land was being taken into trust, thereby rendering the final ROD arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, the administrative record is replete with descriptions of the correct forty-acre parcel, including detailed maps. The mis-description was a trivial error that was quickly corrected. Colusa cites no case law, and we are aware of none, indicating that such trivial errors require the invalidation of an ROD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Citizens asserts that the mitigation measures to which Enterprise agreed, and which the IGRA ROD acknowledges are necessary to prevent detrimental harm to the surrounding community, are not enforceable. Citizens argues that as a result it was arbitrary and capricious for the BIA to rely on such \"illusory\" mitigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In the IGRA ROD, Interior states that it has \"considered potential effects to the environment, including potential impacts to local governments and other tribes, has adopted all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm, and has determined that potentially significant effects will be adequately addressed by ... mitigation measures.\" The IGRA ROD further states that the \"Preferred Alternative\"-i.e., the selection of the Yuba Site for the casino project-would be implemented \"subject to implementation of the mitigation measures.\" The IGRA ROD contains approximately twenty pages of detailed mitigation measures, ranging from the requirement that Enterprise \"install a trash compactor for cardboard and paper products,\" to the requirement that Enterprise implement water conservation measures. The mitigation measures also include less specific requirements; for example, Enterprise is told to \"enter into [a Memorandum of Understanding] or provide for a similar agreement to reimburse the affected law enforcement department for the provision of law enforcement services [which would] include compensation for increased equipment or staffing needs.\" In addition, the IGRA ROD adopted by reference the mitigation measures listed in the FEIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Again, Citizens concedes that the many mitigation measures listed, if implemented, would be adequate.

But the BIA considered five possible alternatives: Alternative A, the hotel casino project that was ultimately accepted on the Yuba Site; Alternative B, a smaller casino on the Yuba Site; Alternative C, a water park on the Yuba Site; Alternative D, a casino on an alternate site in Butte County; and Alternative E, no action. The FEIS considered in detail the environmental and economic consequences of each alternative. Based on the analysis of the possible alternatives in the FEIS, the Interior concluded that the best alternative was the one selected-Alternative A, the casino/hotel project on the Yuba Site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The range of alternatives was not \"illusory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In addition, Colusa argues that the FEIS should have analyzed two additional sites-1) a site in Oroville purchased by Enterprise in 2006, and 2) an unspecified site on federal land near Enterprise 1.

Analysis of Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Next, Colusa argues that the FEIS failed adequately to analyze the effect of the proposed project on the local environment, because some of the data on which the FEIS relied was inadequate. First, Colusa argues that the \"biological data\" on which the FEIS relied was \"stale.\" Second, Colusa argues that Appendix M-which analyzed the socio-economic impacts of the Yuba Site casino project-was based on insufficient data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    i.

For example, Appendix D contains a \"Water and Wastewater Feasibility Study\" prepared in July 2008, approximately two years before the publication of the FEIS, and Appendix H contains a \"Biological Resources Assessment\" of the site of the trust acquisition prepared in 2007, three years before the completion of the FEIS. Colusa does not explain why the data in the Appendices are unreliable. The data in the various Appendices were generally compiled after 2006, two years prior to the publication of the DEIS, and four years prior to the publication of the FEIS. Colusa has pointed to no authority, and provided no argument, indicating that data which is four years old is inherently suspect. Colusa assigns a 2003 date to Appendix L, which contains correspondence with the State of California's Office of Historic Preservation indicating that no historic properties will be impacted. However, that Appendix contains two letters-one from 2003, and another from 2007, the latter of which similarly concurred that no historic properties would be affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Apart from Appendix L, only one Appendix contains data older than 2006: Appendix E, a 2000 declaration that a proposed wastewater treatment plant on the Yuba Site would not have a significant environmental impact. This document is historic and not subject to updating, and Colusa has not alleged that this historic document was the basis of any specific conclusions drawn in the FEIS. Colusa is therefore unable to support its generalized statement that the unspecified \"biological data\" contained in the FEIS is \"stale.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Economic Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Colusa next argues that the economic data on which Enterprise relied was flawed. As noted above, Appendix M of the FEIS contains a study authored by Gaming Market Advisors entitled \"Socio-Economic, Growth Inducing and Environmental Justice Impact Study.\" That study\n   described the likely economic impact of the proposed casino on other competing casinos, including that of plaintiff Colusa. Colusa argues that Appendix M relied on stale data and made improper economic assumptions. By contrast, Colusa insists that the Meister Declaration contained a more accurate accounting of the effect Enterprise's casino would have on Colusa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Colusa's argument is misplaced. The Meister Declaration was properly struck as extra-record evidence which post-dated the FEIS and the IGRA and IRA RODs. It also was based on proprietary data which Colusa did not provide to the BIA during the regulatory process and which Colusa still has not disclosed. Colusa cannot now rely on it here.\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Colusa argues that the FEIS should have discussed whether or not the canals near the Yuba parcel are \"screened\" in order to protect the migratory fish. Colusa does not proffer any evidence that there is an actual danger to these species of fish, or otherwise describe a likely effect of the casino project on the fish.

Colusa also argues that AES had an impermissible \"financial interest\" in the outcome of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   First, Colusa provides no evidence that the BIA did not make an independent choice to contract with AES. As noted above, Enterprise contracted with AES under the BIA's supervision to create a draft EA, a document which the BIA evaluated prior to deciding whether to proceed with an EIS. Having decided to create an EIS, the BIA then entered into a Professional Services Third-Party Agreement with AES. The Professional Services Third-Party Agreement states that \"[t]his Agreement constitutes the required disclosure statement and the BIA's selection of AES as the primary EIS contractor.\" Colusa points to nothing in the Agreement, or to anything else in the record, which calls into question the BIA's representation that it chose to contract with AES for the creation of the EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, Colusa has not shown an impermissible conflict of interest.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.5\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) states that a contractor which prepares an EIS \"shall execute a disclosure statement prepared by the lead agency ... specifying that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project.\" AES executed such a disclosure statement. However, Colusa argues that AES in reality had an impermissible financial interest in the outcome of the project: the same Agreement containing AES's disclosure statement states that \"AES ... will supply environmental consulting services to prepare the environmental documentation and assist with obtaining permit approvals necessary to construct the project.\" Colusa reasons that AES will aid in helping obtain the \"permit approvals necessary to construct the project\" only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the approval of the FEIS. In other words, AES has a \"financial ... interest in the outcome of the project\" per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.5\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   However, Colusa fails to allege that any financial stake AES has in aiding with permit approvals is significant. Moreover, the agency made a factual determination that there was no conflict of interest, and absent proof that this finding lacks substantial evidence to support it, the court should defer to the agency's factual determination.\n   <em>\n    Markair, Inc. v.

First, Colusa cites to \"[Interior's] failure to require a sufficiently broad analysis of alternatives.\" But, as we have already found, the alternatives selected were facially reasonable, and Colusa provides no specific argument explaining why they are not. Second, Colusa argues that the Interior's \"acceptance of pure guesswork as to the impacts on Colusa\" of the proposed project shows a lack of supervision over the project. However, Colusa's alleged experience of a purely economic harm is not cognizable under NEPA, so it is unclear how, under NEPA, a failure properly to analyze that harm is evidence of improper supervision of the NEPA process. In any event, Colusa's contention that the economic harm analysis was \"based on pure guesswork\" is inaccurate: Appendix M to the FEIS contains a rigorous economic analysis. Finally, Colusa argues that the failure to require AES to make a certification \"under penalty of perjury\" demonstrates a failure of oversight. No such requirement for a statement under penalty of perjury exists in the regulations. The failure to include such a non-required statement proves nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Colusa has not presented any evidence that the BIA failed to engage in adequate independent oversight over the preparation of either the DEIS or the FEIS, or that the \"consulting services\" AES may perform are in any way significant. As a result, Colusa is incorrect that a technical violation of the conflict of interest provision-if such a violation occurred-mandates the withdrawal of the FEIS and invalidation of the decade-plus long regulatory process. If a violation is but \"trivial,\" it does \"not give rise to any independent cause of action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201500.3\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    This group of concerned citizens includes the groups Citizens for a Better Way, Stand Up For California!, and Grass Valley Neighbors; individuals William F.

The reduced revenue anticipated from Alternatives B and C would limit the Tribe's ability to fund both Tribal programs and mitigation measures. Additionally, without the development of the hotel and the rural location of the Butte site, Alternative D would provide further limited opportunities for capital development to fund Tribal programs. A non-gaming entertainment development on the Yuba [S]ite would have limited competitive ability to draw patrons from the greater population centers within Yuba County and the Highway 65 corridor compared to the gaming alternatives. In addition, based on peak-hour traffic patterns for retail centers compared to gaming operations, Alternative C also would likely have equal to and in certain instances greater traffic impacts during peak hours than would Alternative A.
