Unlike certain other states that have opted out of the federal exemption scheme, Louisiana does not restrict the application of its exemption statutes to in-state residents or property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Put another way, a former Louisiana resident is ostensibly permitted to utilize Louisiana's exemption scheme to protect property located in another state, such as in West Virginia. The propriety of such a so-called \"extraterritorial application\" of state law underlies this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When the Ashes filed their bankruptcy petition in the Northern District of West Virginia, they submitted a bankruptcy form called a Schedule C, which identified their claims to exempt property. The Ashes were asked on their Schedule C to specify whether they would utilize the federal exemption scheme or a comparable state scheme. They selected the state exemption scheme, seeking to apply the state law of Louisiana and claiming exemptions for property located in both West Virginia and Louisiana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2015, Sheehan-as the trustee-filed his objection to the Ashes' bankruptcy petition, seeking to bar application\n   of the Louisiana exemption scheme to the Ashes' property in West Virginia. Sheehan conceded, however, that the Ashes could utilize the Louisiana exemption scheme for their property in Louisiana. On May 24, 2016, the bankruptcy court overruled Sheehan's objection, concluding that the federal bankruptcy statutes authorized the exemptions claimed by the Ashes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 102. Sheehan appealed that ruling to the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his appeal to the district court, Sheehan argued that traditional limits on state sovereignty bar Louisiana from enacting a law that exempts property located in another state from being included in a bankruptcy estate. In advancing that contention, Sheehan acknowledged that almost all the courts that have addressed the issue have ruled against the proposition he pursues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Arrol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11589009,11636508\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/934/\">\n    170 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1999) (ruling that recently relocated debtor was entitled to utilize homestead exemption laws of California, his former domicile, to exempt property located in Michigan, where he lived);\n   <em>\n    In re Jevne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564351\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/387/301/#p305\">\n    387 B.R. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305-06 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2008) (concluding that recently relocated debtor could utilize homestead exemption of Rhode Island, his former domicile, to claim exemption for property located in Florida, where he then resided). Sheehan argued to the district court that those adverse decisions were distinguishable and, in any event, wrongly decided. More specifically, he maintained that those decisions contravene the \"presumption against extraterritoriality\" recognized by the Supreme Court in a non-bankruptcy setting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p115\">\n    569 U.S. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p115\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p115\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (explaining that, in an alien tort case, \"when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none\" (citations omitted) ). Sheehan thus asked the district court to overrule the bankruptcy court and apply a presumption against extraterritorial application to the Ashes' exemption claims with respect to their West Virginia property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 27, 2017, the district court Opinion that underlies this appeal rejected Sheehan's appeal from the bankruptcy court. As recognized therein, several federal courts have addressed the proposition sponsored by Sheehan, and the overwhelming majority of those courts have rejected it. The majority approach-which the district court approved and called the \"state-specific\" approach-is that a \"state's exemption laws may be used by out-of-state debtors for out-of-state property to the extent that each state's exemption law permits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 595 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Fernandez\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-cv-123, slip op. at 20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203423373\">\n    2011 WL 3423373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Tex. Aug. 5, 2011), ECF No. 9). Thus, when a state exemption scheme does not \"explicitly limit the use of the exemptions to in-state residents or to in-state property,\" it is permissible to apply the state scheme to the debtor's property \"wherever located.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203423373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Consistent with its approval of the state-specific approach, the court concluded that the Ashes had properly utilized Louisiana law to exempt their West Virginia property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 597.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having been unsuccessful in his appeal to the district court, Sheehan has now appealed to our Court. We review de novo a district court's disposition of an appeal from a bankruptcy court, applying the standard of review applied in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Litton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123803,9127159\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/636/\">\n    330 F.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (4th Cir. 2003). With that de novo standard in mind, we turn to an assessment of Sheehan's appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Put simply, we agree with the well-reasoned analysis of the district court. In its comprehensive Opinion, the court characterized the issue as, \"when Congress [pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A) ] directed particular debtors to exempt property according to the law of their prior domicile, how did it intend for that state's law to apply?\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 590. The courts that have assessed that issue have identified three potential interpretations of \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A), which the district court's Opinion denominated as (1) the \"anti-extraterritoriality\" approach, (2) the \"preemption\" approach, and (3) the \"state-specific\" approach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    at 591-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Opinion then carefully evaluated each of those approaches to the issue. Sheehan advocated the anti-extraterritoriality approach, under which \"bankruptcy courts may not give extraterritorial effect to any state's exemption laws.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 591 (citations omitted). In other words, if a debtor claims exemptions under the laws of a former domicile, \"the bankruptcy court should apply them as if it were a state court of the forum state where the bankruptcy court were located.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The Opinion readily rejected that approach, however, explaining that Sheehan's interpretation of \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A) would lead to nonsensical results.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    at 591-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the Opinion emphasized that the anti-extraterritoriality approach would nullify a substantial portion of the federal exemption statute, explaining that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   selecting the appropriate law under \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A) would be a fruitless exercise for most relocated debtors to whom the selection applies. Such debtors likely have no property in their prior domicile, would be categorically ineligible for its exemptions, and would take advantage of the hanging paragraph. Had Congress intended this result, it simply could have directed application of the [federal exemption scheme].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court observed that only one bankruptcy court in the entire country has ever adopted and applied the anti-extraterritoriality approach. And that bankruptcy court was promptly overturned on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 591-93 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713026\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/445/790/\">\n    445 B.R. 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Tex. Aug. 5, 2011), ECF No. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court then considered and rejected a second minority view concerning the issue, which it called the preemption approach, i.e., that \"a state's exemption laws may be applied to non-residents and to out-of-state property, regardless of whether that state's laws allow for such extraterritorial effect or not.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 596 (citation omitted). As the Opinion emphasized, if Congress had intended to override state laws limiting the use of exemption schemes to in-state residents or in-state property, it would not have placed the hanging paragraph in \u00a7 522(b)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203423373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 597 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955395\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/470/186/#p190\">\n    470 B.R. 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (D.

No one other than people who had been domiciled in foreign countries would need the [hanging paragraph].\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the Opinion turned to the majority approach-the state-specific interpretation of \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A) sponsored by the Ashes-and ruled that the bankruptcy court had correctly adopted that approach. In the district court's view, the state-specific approach \"best embodies congressional intent,\" in that it treats \u00a7 522(b)(3)(A) as a \"straightforward ... choice-of-law\n   provision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 591, 595. That approach also comports with the established principle that bankruptcy exemptions are entitled to the most liberal construction in favor of the debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955395\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/470/186/#p190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 595-96 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743444,11519502\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/105/\">\n    211 F.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (4th Cir. 2000) ).

For example, the Ninth Circuit in 1999 was tasked with assessing whether California's homestead exemption statute applied-pursuant to \u00a7 522(b) -to the Michigan residence of a debtor who had moved there shortly before filing for bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Arrol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11589009,11636508\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/934/\">\n    170 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). The Ninth Circuit ruled that California's exemption statute applied extraterritorially because California law did not limit its exemptions to in-state property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11589009,11636508\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11589009,11636508\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/934/\">\n    at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We find nothing in the California exemption statutory scheme, its legislative history, or its interpretation in California case law to limit the application of the homestead exemption to dwellings within California.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2005, the Eighth Circuit reached the very same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Drenttel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9016891,9019886\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/611/\">\n    403 F.3d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2005).
