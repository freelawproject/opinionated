A few months later, Lara-Aguilar returned and attempted another unlawful border crossing but was caught in the act once again. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") opted to reinstate his prior order of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). This time, Lara-Aguilar sought various forms of relief from removal, including asylum and withholding of removal. Although Lara-Aguilar was granted withholding of removal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") concluded that he was ineligible for asylum under \u00a7 1231(a)(5) based on his reinstated order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This court recently held that an alien subject to a reinstated order of removal may not apply for asylum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mejia v.

In September 2013, he unlawfully entered the United States without inspection near Laredo, Texas. Lara-Aguilar was apprehended and placed in expedited removal proceedings; he did not express a fear of returning to El Salvador at that time and he did not apply for asylum. In November 2013, Lara-Aguilar was removed to El Salvador pursuant to an Order of Expedited Removal. In February 2014, approximately three months after having been removed, Lara-Aguilar returned and once again unlawfully crossed into the United States without inspection. He was apprehended by border patrol agents near Hidalgo, Texas, and placed in detention. On February 12, 2014, DHS notified Lara-Aguilar it intended to reinstate his prior order of removal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This time, however, Lara-Aguilar indicated that he feared political persecution were he to return to El Salvador. A DHS asylum officer therefore conducted a reasonable fear interview, during which Lara-Aguilar stated that because he supported and worked on behalf of the ARENA political party during El Salvador's presidential election campaign in January 2014, supporters of the ruling FMLN party physically assaulted him on two occasions. On January 19, 2014, Lara-Aguilar was campaigning \"house to house\" for the ARENA party when he was accosted by FMLN supporters who told him to leave, punched him in \"the stomach and the face,\" struck him in the back \"with a long knife,\" and threatened to \"chop [his] hands off.\" J.A. 395-96. Lara-Aguilar tried to report the incident to the police, but the police responded dismissively. Nonetheless, according to Lara-Aguilar, he continued his house-to-house campaigning activity until he had a second run-in with FMLN supporters. On January 23, 2014, FMLN campaigners stopped Lara-Aguilar and his colleagues-at gunpoint, this time-and tied their hands using the victims' own shoelaces. The FMLN supporters warned Lara-Aguilar and his friends not to return, beat them, and discharged a round of ammunition near the group. Lara-Aguilar did not report this incident to local police \"[b]ecause they had not listened to us the first time\" and he \"realized [reporting] it would be a waste of time.\" J.A. 398. Finally, Lara-Aguilar told the interviewing asylum officer that he could not safely live anywhere in El Salvador because \"the FMLN is everywhere,\" J.A. 401, and that he therefore fled El Salvador for the United States, crossing the border without inspection on February 9, 2014. His wife and sons remain in El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The asylum officer conducting the reasonable fear interview found Lara-Aguilar to be credible and concluded that he had \"established that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion,\" J.A. 386, and that the government of El Salvador is \"unable or unwilling to control FMLN party [members'] activities,\" J.A. 387. And, based on Lara-Aguilar's credible testimony regarding his past persecution, the asylum officer determined that Lara-Aguilar had established \"a reasonable fear of persecution\n   in the future\" because of his association with the ARENA party. J.A. 387.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the reasonable fear interview, Lara-Aguilar's claim was referred to an immigration judge (\"IJ\") for withholding of removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"If an asylum officer determines that an alien described in this section has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, the officer shall so inform the alien and issue a Form I-863, Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge, for full consideration of the request\n   <em>\n    for withholding of removal only\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). Even though the immigration regulations provided for withholding-only proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.31\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), 208.16, Lara-Aguilar sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The IJ concluded that \u00a7 1231(a)(5) precluded Lara-Aguilar from seeking asylum. The IJ did not provide an in-depth analysis of this issue, stating only that, \"based on the regulatory framework,\" he did \"not have the authority to consider an application for asylum.\" J.A. 127.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IJ did, however, grant Lara-Aguilar withholding of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A), ordering that he \"be removed to any country other than El Salvador.\" J.A. 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lara-Aguilar appealed the IJ's conclusion that he lacked the authority to consider the asylum claim to the BIA. Lara-Aguilar argued that \"any bar that may exist due to the reinstatement of a prior order of removal does not apply where, as here, the asylum claim is\n   <em>\n    based on events arising after the prior order of removal was effected.\n   </em>\n   \" J.A. 3 (emphasis added). Rejecting this argument, the BIA concluded that the relevant statutory provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), \"unambiguously states that an alien whose former removal order has been reinstated is not eligible, and therefore may not apply, for any relief from removal under the Act.\" J.A. 4. This provision, the BIA explained, \"is intended to have an expansive meaning\" and therefore cannot be read to foreclose only \"asylum claims that arose prior to an alien's removal,\" as \"[n]either the statute nor the regulations address such an exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision that Lara-Aguilar is ineligible for asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lara-Aguilar petitioned this court for review of the BIA's asylum decision.

Calla Mejia subsequently contradicted herself and stated she did, in fact, fear returning to Peru; accordingly, she was referred to an asylum officer for a reasonable fear interview. Calla Mejia told the asylum officer that she had been physically abused by her husband for years and that, because her husband was a police officer, law enforcement never afforded her any assistance or protection. The asylum officer determined that Calla Mejia had demonstrated a credible fear of persecution in Peru on account of her membership in a particular social group and placed her in full removal proceedings before an immigration judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275555\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/573/#p584\">\n    866 F.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At a master calendar hearing, the IJ advised Calla Mejia of her \"right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 577. However, the IJ also explained to Calla Mejia that because she initially told agents she was here simply to work, she had a significant credibility issue: \"[I]f you want to apply for asylum, withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture relief, I will allow it, but I should tell you, you have a credibility problem. A serious one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275555\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/573/#p584\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Calla Mejia did not apply for relief. The IJ issued an order of removal, and Calla Mejia was removed to Peru in June 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Approximately two months later, Calla Mejia was again apprehended by border patrol agents as she attempted to enter the United States unlawfully. DHS reinstated Calla Mejia's June 2015 order of removal pursuant to \u00a7 1231(a)(5). Calla Mejia again expressed a fear of returning to Peru and was referred for another reasonable fear interview. Once again, the asylum officer conducting the interview concluded that Calla Mejia \"established that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering harm constituting persecution in the country to which [she] has been ordered removed ... on account of ... membership in a particular social group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 592 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration and ellipses in original).

Lara-Aguilar contends that Congress did not intend for the reinstatement bar to prohibit aliens who are subject to reinstated orders of removal from applying for asylum based on circumstances that arose\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the alien's initial removal. Lara-Aguilar grounds his argument in \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), which he reads to permit aliens to apply for asylum, notwithstanding any other statutory provision, based on materially changed circumstances. To resolve what he believes is a direct conflict between \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) and \u00a7 1231(a)(5), Lara-Aguilar would apply the general-specific canon of statutory interpretation, as did the court in\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   . Lara-Aguilar reaches the conclusion that \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) 's changed circumstances provision is more specific than \u00a7 1231(a)(5) 's reinstatement bar and therefore controls. He further argues that the Attorney General's contrary interpretation that \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) does not override \u00a7 1231(a)(5) 's reinstatement bar effectively reads the changed circumstances provision out of the statute and leads to absurd results.

Seizing on\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   's classification of \u00a7 1231(a)(5) as a \"specific exception to \u00a7 1158(a)(1),\" Lara-Aguilar's argument equates \u00a7 1231(a)(5) with the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 1158(a)(2) -he reads\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   as treating \u00a7 1231(a)(5) as if it were a fourth exception enumerated by \u00a7 1158(a)(2). As such, Lara-Aguilar argues, \u00a7 1231(a)(5) must be subject to \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) 's changed circumstances provision, just like the other exceptions included in \u00a7 1158(a)(2). We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, Lara-Aguilar ignores the language and structure of \u00a7 1158(a)(2). The changed circumstances provision does not apply to every statutory exception listed in \u00a7 1158(a)(2). Rather, by its express terms, \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D)\n   <em>\n    applies only to two of the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    three exceptions enumerated in\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1158(a)(2) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   An application for asylum of an alien may be considered,\n   <em>\n    notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C)\n   </em>\n   , if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of\n   <em>\n    changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility\n   </em>\n   for asylum or\n   <em>\n    extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay\n   </em>\n   in filing an application within the period\n   <em>\n    specified in subparagraph (B)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(D) (emphasis added). The changed circumstances provision refers only to subparagraphs (a)(2)(B) and (C)-not to subparagraph (A). By the same token, subparagraphs (B) and (C) expressly note that \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) applies-subparagraph (A) does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B) (\"\n   <em>\n    Subject to subparagraph (D)\n   </em>\n   , paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.\" (emphasis added) );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C) (\"\n   <em>\n    Subject to subparagraph (D)\n   </em>\n   , paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the alien has previously applied for asylum and had such application denied.\" (emphasis added) ). The changed circumstances provision therefore does not apply to every exception listed by Congress in \u00a7 1158(a)(2), but only the ones explicitly cross-referenced. Even if under\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(5) 's reinstatement bar should be slotted in under \u00a7 1158(a)(2) as a fourth exception to \u00a7 1158(a)(1) 's general grant of eligibility to apply for asylum, \u00a7 1231(a)(5) would not be subject to \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Obviously, subparagraph (D) does not reference \u00a7 1231(a)(5), nor does \u00a7 1231(a)(5) indicate that it is subject to the changed circumstances provision in \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(2)(D), by its own terms, simply does not apply. Accordingly, there is no irremediable conflict requiring us to invoke the general-specific rule of interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lara-Aguilar next argues that the Attorney General's interpretation, as a practical matter, reads \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) out of the statute. Courts have an interpretive \"duty to give effect,\" whenever possible, to a statute's \"every clause and word.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    533 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the \"rule against superfluities,\" \"[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\"\n   <em>\n    Hibbs v. Winn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    542 U.S. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lara-Aguilar's argument rests on the premise that the \"likely consequence\" of an unsuccessful or untimely asylum application is removal and then, should that alien return, a reinstated order of removal under \u00a7 1231(a)(5). Under the Attorney General's reading of the statute, the reinstated order of removal would then preclude the alien, even if he could demonstrate changed circumstances under \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), from applying for asylum. Thus, Lara-Aguilar reasons that because this is the likely chain of events, it would be a practical impossibility, under the Attorney General's interpretation, for aliens to ever seek asylum based on changed circumstances under \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For Lara-Aguilar's superfluity argument to hold water, every alien covered by \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) must necessarily be subject to a reinstated order of removal under \u00a7 1231(a)(5). But this is not the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez-Guzman v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353650\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/1066/#p1082\">\n    835 F.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (9th Cir. 2016) (rejecting\n   the \"incorrect\" assumption \"that any individual to whom \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) applies will\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   be subject to a reinstated removal order\"). \"The reinstatement of a prior removal order is neither automatic nor obligatory, and the Attorney General has discretion not to reinstate an individual's earlier removal order and instead place him in ordinary removal proceedings,\" which would permit a \"second asylum claim in light of his changed circumstances-something that would ordinarily be precluded by \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(C).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353650\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/1066/#p1082\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Lara-Aguilar's position also assumes that any alien in his position has no choice but to reenter the United States illegally after having been removed. Illegal reentry, however, is not the only option for an alien who wishes to avail himself of \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) 's changed circumstances provision. Rather, \"aliens subject to removal orders may continue to apply for asylum by\n   <em>\n    lawfully\n   </em>\n   approaching a port of entry without illegally crossing the border.\"\n   <em>\n    Cazun v. Att'y Gen. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276696\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/249/\">\n    856 F.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 n.20 (3d Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Lara-Aguilar argues that the Attorney General's interpretation of the statute will produce an absurd result that Congress could not have intended. An alien who is successfully removed from the United States-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an alien who, in a sense, \"cooperates\" with a removal order-is barred by \u00a7 1231(a)(5) from applying for asylum upon illegal reentry. But, an alien who evades a removal order and remains in the United States unlawfully may be able to apply for asylum under our reading of \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) based on changed circumstances because he was\n   <em>\n    never actually removed\n   </em>\n   . In other words, an alien can avoid the reinstatement bar by remaining unlawfully rather than returning illegally. Lara-Aguilar urges us to adopt his preferred reading of the statute to eliminate this anomalous result and ensure that both groups of aliens-those that remain unlawfully and those that reenter illegally-may seek asylum based on changed circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We are to avoid \"interpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results ... if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    458 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). However, a statutory interpretation that produces surprising or anomalous results is not the same as one producing\n   <em>\n    absurd\n   </em>\n   results. Indeed, to \"truly be characterized as absurd,\" the interpretation of a statute must result in an outcome \"that is so gross as to shock the general moral or common sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Sigmon Coal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231413\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/291/#p302\">\n    226 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).
