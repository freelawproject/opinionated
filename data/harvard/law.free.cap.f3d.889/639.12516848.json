The trustee successfully brought an adversary proceeding to set aside Lee's transfers of those interests. When the trustee sought a turnover order to compel Lee to relinquish possession of the properties, Lee resisted. He argued that the trustee had failed to make a timely objection to the exemptions under Rule 4003 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, and therefore Lee's exemptions were valid notwithstanding the court's avoidance of the transfer. The bankruptcy court disagreed. It granted the turnover order, thus denying the claimed exemptions. We hold that the trustee's adversary complaint contesting the basis for Lee's exemptions qualified as an objection to those exemptions under Rule 4003. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We begin by setting out the applicable bankruptcy law.

Lee, a real estate developer operating on Oahu, experienced various financial difficulties beginning in 2008. In September 2010, Lee met with a bankruptcy attorney, Chuck Choi, and discussed filing for a possible bankruptcy. A few days later, Lee conveyed his 90 percent interest in 4014 Palua Place #1 (Palua 1) and his 75 percent interest in 4014 Palua Place #2 (Palua 2) to himself and his spouse, Yuka Yahagi Lee, as tenants by the entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Lee filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on August 12, 2013. Shortly thereafter, Lee filed his schedules, listing debts of\n   approximately $4 million ($2.9 million to unsecured creditors and $1.1 million to secured creditors). In his Schedule A, listing his real property interests, Lee included his tenancy-by-the-entirety interests in Palua 1 and Palua 2. In his Schedule C, Lee elected to claim state-law exemptions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) and claimed exemptions under Hawaii state law for his tenancy-by-the-entirety interests in both Palua 1 ($669,000) and Palua 2 ($262,848).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the trustee held a meeting of creditors that concluded on December 19, 2013. During the meeting, the trustee confirmed that Lee's spouse did not pay anything for the interest that she received in the transfer to the tenancy-by-the-entirety estate, and the trustee then suggested to Lee's counsel that the trustee was \"probably looking at a fraudulent transfer case on that.\" At the conclusion of the meeting, Lee testified that he transferred his interests in Palua 1 and Palua 2 to the tenancy-by-the-entirety estate for \"exemption planning,\" after meeting with his attorney to discuss a possible bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 14, 2014, the trustee filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court against Lee and his spouse. The complaint asked the court to set aside Lee's transfers of his interests in Palua 1 and Palua 2 to his tenancy-by-the-entirety estate as a fraudulent transfer, but did not cite\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) or ask the court to deny Lee's claimed state-law exemptions in his Schedule C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After a three-day trial in February 2015, the bankruptcy court found that the trustee had \"proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Lee transferred his interest in the Palua Place properties to himself and his wife with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his existing and future creditors.\" The bankruptcy court cited Lee's own testimony that he had made the transfers in order to protect his interest in the properties, as well as the \"powerful circumstantial evidence\" of Lee's financial difficulties at the time of the transfers. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court avoided the transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and Hawaii law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 10, 2015, the bankruptcy court issued a final judgment avoiding the transfers, but did not expressly state that it was denying the exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lee appealed this ruling to district court and moved for a stay pending appeal. The district court denied the stay on May 6, 2015, and affirmed the bankruptcy court's judgment on September 21, 2015. We dismissed Lee's appeal of the district court's order for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While Lee's appeal of the bankruptcy court's judgment in the fraudulent transfer proceeding was pending in district court, the trustee filed a motion in bankruptcy court on May 18, 2015, seeking the turnover of various records and assets of Lee, including Palua 1 and Palua 2, so that the trustee could convert those assets into money for the estate. The trustee argued that an order requiring Lee to turn over the Palua properties was necessary because Lee had been interfering with efforts to liquidate the properties for the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his opposition to the trustee's motion for a turnover of property, Lee argued\n   that he was not required to turn over Palua 1 and Palua 2 because he had claimed exemptions in both properties and the trustee had failed to file a timely objection within 30 days of the conclusion of the creditor's meeting, as required by Rule 4003(b)(1). Lee further contended that absent the property interests listed on his Schedule C (as well as other costs contested by the trustee), there was insufficient value remaining in the Palua 1 and 2 properties to merit a sale and that the bankruptcy estate should instead abandon its interest in the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The bankruptcy court granted the trustee's turnover motion, concluding that the complaint filed in the adversary proceeding satisfied the requirements of Rule 4003. The district court affirmed the grant of the turnover order, and Lee timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) because the bankruptcy court's turnover order constituted a formal denial of Lee's claimed exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Re Gilman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516617\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/956/#p961\">\n    887 F.3d 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 961-962 (9th Cir. 2018).

In this context, an adversary action and an objection under Rule 4003 are inextricably intertwined. Lee could claim a state-law exemption in his interests in Palua 1 and Palua 2 only because he had previously conveyed them to himself and his spouse as tenants by the entirety. Because property held in a tenancy by the entirety was exempt from Lee's creditors under Hawaii law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=561%20P.2d%201291\">\n    561 P.2d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the trustee had no legal basis for objecting to the claimed exemptions unless he could avoid the transfer of that property interest. In order to set aside Lee's\n   transfers and recover some portion of the challenged interests in Palua 1 and Palua 2 for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate, the trustee had to bring an adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Havoco of Am., Ltd. v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12148485,633509\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/197/1135/\">\n    197 F.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (11th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, by bringing the adversary action, the trustee attacked the basis for Lee's exemptions in order to recover the property for the estate; the proceeding would have been pointless if Lee could retain his exemptions and therefore retain his fraudulently transferred property interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mwangi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195747,4183035\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/1168/\">\n    764 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it was apparent that the adversary action's sole purpose was to prevent Lee from retaining the exemptions, Lee had adequate notice that the trustee objected to them. Accordingly, while including an express objection to the claimed exemptions in his complaint or other filing would have been a better practice, the trustee's action in filing the adversary complaint sufficiently constituted an objection to the exemption that satisfies Rule 4003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, the adversary complaint and proceeding met Rule 4003 's procedural requirements. It is undisputed that the complaint was timely filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b)(1). The time period for Rule 4003 objections began to run when the trustee concluded the meeting of creditors on December 19, 2013, and it expired on January 18, 2014. Prior to that date, the trustee filed an adversary complaint on January 14, 2014, initiating the fraudulent transfer proceeding. Nor does Lee dispute that the complaint and summons were served on him and his attorney, as required by Rule 4003(b)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(b)(4). Further, as required by Rule 4003(c), the fraudulent transfer proceeding provided a hearing after notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(c). Finally, the trustee was required to prove the fraudulent transfer by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kekona v.

The court concluded that these actions were insufficient to constitute an objection, noting that \"they were simply [the] Trustee's duties\" if the exemptions were invalid, and that they had been \"confusing\" to the debtor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6458413\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/185/584/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6458413\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/185/584/\">\n    at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court reasoned that \"to condone\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   objections under [ Rule] 4003, would mean that trustees and creditors everywhere will be improperly seizing assets,\" citing due process concerns.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6458413\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/185/584/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the trustee did not simply disregard Lee's claimed exemptions and seek to take possession of Palua 1 and Palua 2.

Here, the trustee timely objected pursuant to Rule 4003(b) and the bankruptcy court adjudicated \"the issues presented by the objections\" in a manner that satisfied Rule 4003(c). Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(c). When Lee raised the exemptions in a later proceeding to oppose the turnover motion, the bankruptcy court's explicit denial of the exemptions was consistent with Rule 4003.
