Dkt. No. 358-8 ('126 Patent at cover page). The application giving rise to the '981 patent, U.S. Patent Application No. 13/012,219 (\"the '219 application\"), was filed on January 24, 2011, as a continuation-in-part (\"CIP\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of another application that was in turn a continuation\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the '216 application.

Dkt. No. 1-2 ('726 Patent at cover page).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 14, 2015, CCGroup filed this lawsuit alleging that Truven infringed numerous claims of the '726 patent and claims 13 and 20 of the '981 patent. Dkt. No. 1. In its infringement contentions, CCGroup expressed its intent to \"claim a priority date at least as early as March 2, 2004\" for all asserted claims, and identified \"its own Marketbasket System as practicing at least claims 13 and 20 of the '981 patent....\" Dkt. No. 348-6 at 3:18-22. In response to Truven's interrogatories, CCGroup again stated that the \"asserted claims are entitled to a priority date of March 2, 2004\" and identified the \"Marketbasket System as practicing and/or embodying the limitations of the asserted claims.\" Dkt. No. 348-5 at 4:19-5:2. CCGroup later stated in its response to Truven's Request for Admissions that \"its own system, which existed prior to March 2, 2004, used medical claims data to form episodes of care.\" Dkt. No. 348-7 at 3:3-4. It is not disputed that as early as March 14, 2006, CCGroup made its Marketbasket System publicly available. Dkt. No. 348-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 13, 2015, Truven served its invalidity contentions on CCGroup. Dkt. No. 362-3. In those contentions, Truven asserted that the priority date for the '981 patent was the filing date of the '981 patent application, January 24, 2011, and that the priority date could not be March 2, 2004, because (a) the '981 patent issued from a CIP of an earlier application and (b) the patent claims encompassed new matter not disclosed in the earlier applications. Dkt. No. 362-3. Specifically, Truven asserted,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The '981 patent was filed on January 24, 2011 as a continuation-in-part of application No. 12/769,090 (\"the '090 application\"), filed on April 28, 2010, now abandoned. The '090 application is a continuation of application No. 10/794,216 (\"the '216 application\"), filed on March 5, 2004, now issued as U.S. Patent Number 7,739,126.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In order for the '981 patent to claim priority to the '090 and '216 applications, the claims in the '981 patent must be \"supported by the specification and claims of the parent application.\" M.P.E.P. \u00a7 706.02(VI) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordance Corp. v.

Dkt. No. 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 17. CCGroup also attached as an exhibit a Certificate of Correction (\"Certificate\") for the '981 patent issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") on September 22, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.

No. 44-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 12, 2016, Truven informed CCGroup that the priority date for the '981 patent was January 24, 2011, and that the CCGroup Marketbasket System therefore invalidates its patent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 348 at 2:20-22; Dkt. No. 358 at 5:8-9. CCGroup states that it notified Truven of its intent to drop the '981 patent from suit the same day. Dkt. No. 358 at 5:8-10. CCGroup states that it informed the Court of its intent to withdraw the '981 patent at a case management conference held on October 14, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    at 5:10-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Dkt. No. 85. The Court's minutes for that conference states that \"Counsel are in the process of discussing the possibility of withdrawing the '981 patent and filing an amended complaint.\" Dkt. No. 85. CCGroup states that it offered to give Truven a covenant not to sue on the existing claims of the '981 patent, but that Truven rejected the offer. Dkt. No. 358 at 6:2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 4, 2016, CCGroup moved for leave to file an amended complaint, in which CCGroup would withdraw its claim under the '981 patent. Dkt. No. 95. In its opposition to that motion, Truven noted that it \"proposed a joint dismissal with prejudice, with an unrestricted covenant not to sue and payment of the fees Truven has incurred in defending against the '981 Patent,\" and that CCGroup ignored the proposal. Dkt. No. 110 at 1:11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 2, 2016, CCGroup filed a petition with the Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") requesting ex parte reexamination of the '981 patent because there were substantial new questions as to the validity of the '981 patent due to, inter alia, questions about whether the '981 patent was entitled to the priority date of the '126\n   date and whether the '981 patent was invalidated by prior art. Dkt. No. 129-1. CCGroup's request for reexamination proposed amending the independent claims of the '981 patent to delete \"the recitation of the 'variable window periods,' \" and thus, according to CCGroup's request, \"resulting in all of the subject matter of independent claims 1, 11, 12, 13, 20, and 21 as amended being conclusively supported by the disclosure of the parent '126 patent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court granted CCGroup's motion for leave to file an amended complaint on December 22, 2016, under the conditions that the withdrawal of the claim under the '981 patent was with prejudice and that CCGroup execute a covenant not to sue Truven on the existing claims of the '981 patent. Dkt. No. 136 at 2:4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 9, 2017, CCGroup filed another motion for leave to file an amended complaint, requesting permission to add claims related to misappropriation of trade secrets. Dkt. No. 138. CCGroup argued that during discovery it had obtained evidence showing Truven had misappropriated CCGroup's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    at 2:16-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court granted CCGroup's motion. Dkt. No. 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 21, 2017, CCGroup filed its third amended complaint, which removed the claim under the '981 patent and added the trade secret misappropriation claims. Dkt. No. 159. Truven moved to dismiss the newly added claims and the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Dkt. Nos. 167, 205. Subsequently, CCGroup dropped the non-patent claims, leaving only its claim under the '726 patent. Dkt. No. 223. On December 15, 2017, this Court granted Truven's motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the '726 patent claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dkt. No. 342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 18, 2018, Truven moved for attorneys' fees and nontaxable expenses related to its defense against the '981 patent, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and under the inherent power of this Court. Dkt. No. 348. Truven seeks to recover fees and expenses related to the '981 patent between the day CCGroup sued Truven (May 14, 2015) and when CCGroup filed its third amended complaint withdrawing the claim under the '981 patent (February 21, 2017). Dkt. No. 348 at 9:19-22, 11:2-5. During this period, Truven estimates it incurred total patent-related fees of $816,721.84 and nontaxable expenses of $38,956.06.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the '981 and '726 patents are related, Truven notes that \"much of the same analysis and discovery applie[d] to both patents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    at 10:7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Truven contends that CCGroup chose to file the '981 application as a continuation-in-part, which by definition means that it has \"add[ed] matter not disclosed in the said earlier nonprovisional application.\" MPEP \u00a7 201.08. Truven argues that when CCGroup filed the '981 patent application, it added \"variable window periods,\" which was not disclosed in the earlier '126 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 348-9 at 67-68 (redline comparison of the '126 and '981 patent specifications showing \"variable window periods\" as new matter added to the '981 patent ). Thus, Truven argues, CCGroup should have known the '981 patent's priority date was January 24, 2011, and not March 5, 2004. Truven also argues that CCGroup repeatedly claimed that its Marketbasket System product practiced the asserted claims of the '981 patent, and thus that CCGroup knew or should have known that its product, which was publicly available by at least March 14, 2006, invalidated the '981 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CCGroup argues that this case is not exceptional because the \"[t]he \u00a7 102(b) issue arises from a technical oddity relating to the structure of the '981 patent claims.\" Dkt.

Dkt. No. 348-9 at 67-68. In order for the asserted claims of the '981 patent to receive the benefit of the filing date of the '126 patent, there must be adequate written description in the '126 patent disclosure to support the asserted claims. CCGroup's \"technical oddity\" argument acknowledges that the \"variable window periods\" were first described in the '981 patent application, and therefore that there is no written description support for the independent claims of the '981 patent in the '126 patent disclosure. Accordingly, the '981 patent was not entitled to the earlier filing date, and CCGroup could and should have recognized, based on the relationship between the '981 and '126 patents, that the priority date of the '981 patent was January 24, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cordance Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836431\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1330/#p1334\">\n    658 F.3d at 1334-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (patent claims in later application could not claim priority to earlier application because asserted claims in later patent was not supported by disclosure in earlier patent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, there was ample evidence to show the Marketbasket System was used and publicly available more than one year before January 2011, the filing date of the '981 patent.

After the state-law\n   claims were remanded to state court, the defendant moved for attorney's fees under \u00a7 1988, which allows award of \"reasonable attorney's fee to a prevailing party in certain civil rights cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 829-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932835,12450131\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2205/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In granting the defendant's fees for defending the entire suit in federal court, the district court had found that allocation of costs was unnecessary because the \"various claims arose out of the same transaction and were so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 831,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932835,12450131\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2205/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There were two main policy reasons underlying that conclusion. First, the Supreme Court found that the \"relevant purpose of \u00a7 1988 is to relieve defendants of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 836,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932835,12450131\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2205/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, \u00a7 1988 did not warrant windfalls that the defendant would receive under a \"more permissive test.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 837,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5932835,12450131\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2205/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court has held that \"our case law construing what is a 'reasonable' fee applies uniformly\" to all federal fee shifting statutes that permit the award of reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    City of Burlington v. Dague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p562\">\n    505 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p562\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481026\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/557/#p562\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court finds that the \"but for\" standard applies, and thus Truven is entitled to recover only those fees and costs it incurred because of CCGroup's assertion of the '981 patent, such as fees related to infringement and invalidity arguments specific to the '981 patent, and fees related to the motion for attorneys' fees. The Court notes that Truven does not actually dispute that the \"but for\" standard applies. Instead, Truven asserts that its request for 25% of the total patent fees incurred during the period the '981 patent was at issue is a \"reasonable and conservative approach\" to determining what fees and costs are attributable to the '981 patent. However, Truven acknowledges that given the substantial similarity between the '726 and '981 patents, much of the time spent litigating this case was applicable to both patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 362 at 8:6-9:7 (Truven discussing its work on various issues). The Court finds that while Truven's 25% flat rate request is not unreasonable in theory, Truven has not cited any authority that would permit the Court to award fees under that methodology. The Court further finds that the supporting documentation submitted by Truven does not satisfy the \"but-for\" standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court directs Truven to submit a revised fee and cost request supported by documentation that seeks only those fees and expenses that were incurred as a result of defending against CCGroup's claims under the '981 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Time Period Eligible for Fee Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CCGroup also contends that Truven should not be compensated for work done after CCGroup informed Truven of its intention to withdraw the '981 patent\n   claim in October 2016. CCGroup cites\n   <em>\n    Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n    866 F.3d 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2017), for the proposition that formal withdrawal of a claim is not required to find it withdrawn when the parties and the court know that the defendant intends to drop its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds that CCGroup's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Romag\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Romag\n   </em>\n   , the district court had \"concluded that [the defendant] declined to abandon [its] defenses until after trial,\" and that the \"failure to formally withdraw its...invalidity defenses until after the close of evidence\" was a \"key factor for awarding fees to\" the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n    at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the fee award, holding that the district court had \"clearly erred\" in finding that the defenses were not withdrawn until after trial because the record showed there was \"full awareness between the parties and the district court that the patent invalidity defenses were withdrawn before trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n    at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit additionally noted that the district court had made no finding that the defendant's invalidity defenses were objectively unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275752\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1330/#p1336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Romag\n   </em>\n   , the Court has concluded that the assertion of the '981 patent renders this case exceptional so as to warrant a fee award. Further, although CCGroup informed Truven in October 2016 that it intended to withdraw the '981 patent, a dispute regarding the '981 patent continued to exist because the parties could not agree regarding the appropriate mechanism for dismissal of the '981 patent claims, thus requiring further litigation until the '981 claims were dismissed in February 2017. The Court ultimately agreed with Truven that the dismissal should be with prejudice and under the condition that CCGroup execute a covenant not to sue Truven on the existing claims of the '981 patent. Under the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that the relevant time period for awarding a reasonable fee award related to defending against the '981 patent is between May 14, 2015 and February 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby GRANTS in part Truven's motion for attorney's fees and nontaxable expenses pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
