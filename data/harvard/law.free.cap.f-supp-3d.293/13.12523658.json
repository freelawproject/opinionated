English (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Ms. English\") to pay fees for an expert witness's deposition preparation time. Ms. English opposes the motion. The District Judge presiding over this case has referred all discovery disputes to the undersigned Magistrate Judge pursuant to Local Civil Rule 72.2(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 21. Having reviewed the parties' submissions, the Court will deny without prejudice WMATA's Motion to Compel Payment of Expert Fees for Preparation for Discovery Deposition (\"Motion to Compel Fees\") [ECF No. 27] for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is a wrongful death and survival action arising from a September 3, 2015 accident in which Reginald Burrell was dragged under the rear portion of a WMATA bus and injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-13, ECF No. 1. Mr. Burrell was hospitalized after the accident and died five days later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Ms. English alleges that the WMATA employee who operated the bus that injured Mr. Burrell acted negligently, and that the driver's negligence was the direct, sole, and proximate cause of Mr. Burrell's injuries and subsequent death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 51, 58, 87. WMATA admits that at all relevant times the bus\n   driver was acting within the scope of his employment as a WMATA bus operator, but denies that it or the driver was negligent. Answer at 2-3, ECF No. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. English deposed WMATA's medical expert, Dr. Romergryko G. Geocadin, on June 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Compel Payment of Expert Fees for Preparation for Discovery Dep. (\"Def.'s Mot. to Compel\") \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, ECF No. 27. Dr. Geocadin testified regarding the conscious pain and suffering that Mr. Burrell experienced prior to his arrival at Washington Hospital Center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Compel, Ex. 4 at 22:4-21 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 29-4.

On June 14, WMATA sent Ms. English an invoice seeking $5,950 for the time Dr. Geocadin spent preparing for the deposition. Def.'s Mot. to Compel \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, ECF No. 27; Def.'s Mot.

To Compel \u00b6 6, ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   WMATA now seeks a Court order compelling Ms. English to pay for the time that Dr. Geocadin spent preparing for the deposition.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Ms. English opposes the motion on two grounds, arguing: first, that WMATA failed to meaningfully confer as required under Local Civil Rule 7(m) ; and second, that WMATA has not proven that the time Mr. Geocadin spent on deposition preparation, or the hourly fee he charged, is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n.

Specifically, Ms. English has filed her counsel's response to WMATA's counsel's last email. Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. 3 at 2, ECF No. 29-3. In this email, which Plaintiff's counsel sent on Monday, June 19 at 3:09 p.m., Plaintiff's counsel objects to the invoice's calculation of the time Dr. Geocadin spent preparing and the amount charged, and asks WMATA to \"[p]lease provide us with the date(s) of each purported expenditure of time by Dr. Geocadin, as well as the time of day that he claims to have spent such time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127511\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/600/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither Ms. English nor WMATA has submitted an email in which WMATA responds to Plaintiff's counsel's June 19 email.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127511\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/317/600/#p605\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. English asserts that \"[i]nstead of providing the information Plaintiff's counsel requested in an effort to resolve the dispute, defense counsel chose\n   to file the Motion.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 5, ECF No. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   WMATA's efforts to confer with Plaintiff's counsel are too perfunctory to satisfy Local Civil Rule 7(m). Plaintiff's counsel requested details about the invoice which, if provided by WMATA, may have narrowed or eliminated the dispute. Despite having received that request within minutes of threatening to move to compel expert fees, WMATA did not respond. Although WMATA appears to have made a good faith effort to initiate a discussion, the abrupt and premature end to the discussion falls short of the meaningful and \"real steps\" to confer that Local Rule 7(m) requires.\n   <em>\n    Ellipso, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5218077\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/460/99/#p102\">\n    460 F.Supp.2d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
