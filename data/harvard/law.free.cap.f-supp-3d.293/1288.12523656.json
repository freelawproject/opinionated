[Doc. 20]. Having reviewed the Motion, briefs, testimony, and relevant law, for the reasons below, the Court grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Motion concerns a warrantless bus sweep and its fallout-one of many warrantless sweeps that have come before this Court and courts across the country. On March 10, 2016, Ollisha Easley, the defendant, was a passenger on a Greyhound bus traveling east from Claremont, California. The bus made many scheduled stops at stations along its route. Some stops were for a few minutes. The bus stopped for a longer layover at the bus station in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When it is on schedule, the bus arrives in Albuquerque at 9:55 a.m. and departs at 11:15 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the one-hour-and-twenty-minute layover in Albuquerque, passengers disembarked. Those who were continuing on to eastward destinations waited in the terminal while the bus was serviced, refueled, and cleaned in the maintenance shop-what is called the wash bay, south of the terminal. When the bus was ready to depart from Albuquerque, it left the wash bay and returned to the terminal. The passengers re-boarded to continue their journeys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Easley is a 34-year-old African-American mother from Louisville, Kentucky. It appears that she is the sole economic provider and caregiver for her family. In early March, 2016, she was in a desperate financial situation when she got an offer for a job that would pay $1,000. The Court does not know how much Ms. Easley was earning in Kentucky, where she worked at a chain restaurant. But the weekly take-home pay-that is, pay after deductions for Social Security and Medicare taxes-for a minimum wage job in the United States during this time period was around $267.80.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would take a person earning the minimum wage more than 149 hours of remunerated work to earn what Ms. Easley was offered for this job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   William Schultz-a friend in Kentucky whom she had known for about a year and a half-knew that Ms. Easley needed money. He gave Ms. Easley's number to a woman who called to offer her the job. The woman said that Ms. Easley would earn $1,000 for flying out to California and returning to Louisville on a Greyhound bus. Beyond those details, Ms. Easley did not know what the job would involve and she did not ask the woman for more information. Mr. Schultz gave Ms. Easley money for her airline ticket, which she purchased with her own debit or credit card. She flew to Ontario, California, where Mr. Schultz\n   (who had traveled from Kentucky to California on an earlier plane) and the woman met Ms. Easley at the airport and took her to the woman's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Special Agent (SA) Jarrell Perry works to detect and intercept both illegal drugs and proceeds from the sales of illegal drugs at hubs of public transportation in Albuquerque: the bus station, the Amtrak train station (which is connected to the bus station), at packaging services, and sometimes at the international airport. SA Perry has more than nineteen years of experience with the DEA. He has interdicted illegal drugs and proceeds from sales of illegal drugs for almost eighteen of those nineteen years-at the Greyhound station in Albuquerque for six or seven of those nineteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 10, 2016, SA Perry was at the Greyhound station in Albuquerque. Before SA Perry arrived at the bus station, he had received a passenger list from Greyhound. In reviewing the list, SA Perry observed that two passengers-Ms. Easley and a woman called \"Denise Moore\"-were traveling under the same reservation number. Their tickets had been paid for in cash and, according to the passenger list, both women had one piece of checked luggage, that is, luggage traveling in the cargo area of the bus. [Doc. 21 at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That day, the other agent with whom SA Perry typically works was on vacation. Another DEA agent, Scott Godier, was SA Perry's backup. Agent Godier does not typically work in interdiction. The two agents were in street clothes, their shirts were untucked. SA Perry was carrying a weapon, but his shirt was covering it. SA Perry believes that Agent Godier was also carrying a weapon, but he (SA Perry) did not see it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The two agents watched the bus from Claremont pulling into the Greyhound station in Albuquerque. They watched the passengers disembark from the bus. The bus went to the wash bay. While the bus was in the wash bay, SA Perry and Agent Godier \"observed\" the luggage that was stored underneath the bus. Ms. Easley's counsel notes that the extent of the agents' observations in the luggage hold is unknown. [Doc. 20 at 2]. In the Preliminary Examination/Detention Hearing on March 14, 2016, SA Perry testified that he \"opened up the luggage bins[,] ... looked at the luggage[, and] looked at the tags.\" [Doc. 23 at 10:11-13]. According to the government, SA Perry observed two pieces of luggage-a grey-colored Rome Essentials-brand suitcase with a luggage tag displaying Ms. Easley's name and a black-tan-colored G-brand suitcase with a luggage tag displaying the name of Denise Moore. Both luggage check-in tags listed Claremont, California, as the city of origin, and a Louisville, Kentucky, as the final destination. The two luggage tags also listed an identical contact phone number. [Doc. 21 at 2-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the bus was washed and refueled, Ms. Easley and the other passengers re-boarded. As she was returning to her seat, Ms. Easley saw Agent Godier at the front of the bus and SA Perry at the rear of the bus. SA Perry was questioning other passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Ms. Easley, after SA Perry had questioned about 15 passengers and searched numerous passengers' belongings, he approached Ms. Easley. In the Preliminary Examination/Detention Hearing on March 14, 2016, SA Perry testified that he \"spoke with each passenger\" and estimated that there were \"maybe 35, 40\" passengers aboard the Greyhound bus that day. [Doc. 23 at 14:17-18, 24]. The recording of SA Perry's conversations with passengers clearly demonstrates that different passengers were subjected to different levels of inquiry. For example, some passengers\n   were only asked where they boarded, where their final destination was, and whether they would consent to a search of their belongings, although SA Perry did not actually search these passengers. [Doc. 34 at 4]. Defense counsel points out that \"[i]t is not at all clear how Agent Perry decided which passengers would be subject to which level of inquiry. Every passenger on the bus began their travel in a source city for narcotics. Every passenger (except the two traveling to Fort Worth, TX) were traveling to a destination city for narcotics.\" [Doc. 34 at 5]. However, \"what is clear is that most of the people who were asked to produce their ticket and identification and who were ordered to submit to a search of their person were Hispanic surname individuals and Ms. Easley, who is an African-American.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the government, SA Perry had his recording device activated during his questioning of the passengers, including Ms. Easley. [Doc. 21 at 3]. The recording of these interactions reveals that not a single passenger on Ms. Easley's bus declined to speak with SA Perry, and that everyone who was asked to do so gave consent for SA Perry to search their person and belongings. A Latino passenger apparently even consented to SA Perry's cutting into his stiff shoe with a knife that SA Perry borrowed from another passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Ms. Easley, when SA Perry spoke to her, he asked her:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) where she was traveling from; (2) where she was traveling to; (3) if she was traveling alone; (4) if she had checked luggage stored underneath in the cargo hold of the bus; (5) if he could search her checked luggage stored underneath in the cargo hold of the bus; (6) if she had any personal belongings stored in the overhead bin of the bus; and, (7) if he could search her personal belongings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [Doc. 20 at 3]. According to the government, Ms. Easley told SA Perry that she was not traveling with anyone. Ms. Easley also identified a backpack, pillows, and a checked-in suitcase as the items belonging to her. [Doc. 21 at 3]. The government and Ms. Easley agree that Ms. Easley \"consented to a search of all of her belongings.\" [Doc. 20 at 3]. While on the bus, SA Perry saw her ticket, searched her backpack and pillow, asked Ms. Easley to open her jacket and if he could search her waist and around her legs. Ms. Easley complied with these requests. [Doc. 34 at 6]. After SA Perry finished speaking with each passenger, he exited the bus, pulled luggage out of the cargo hold, removed Ms. Easley's suitcase and the G-brand suitcase, then reboarded and asked Ms. Easley to step off the bus. Once she had exited the bus, SA Perry asked to see her ticket and again asked her about her travel plans. [Gov. Ex. 1(A) at 38:9-15]. He then asked to see her identification and to search her purse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:23, 40:17. Next, SA Perry asked Ms. Easley to identify her suitcase. Then SA Perry asked Ms. Easley if she also owned the G-brand suitcase, to which Ms. Easley responded that it was not hers and that she did not know who it belonged to.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:7-42:4. She then reboarded the bus. After confirming with the bus driver that the other passenger on Ms. Easley's reservation had not boarded the bus, SA Perry concluded that the G-brand suitcase had been abandoned and proceeded to search it. He cut into the suitcase and discovered methamphetamine. SA Perry then reboarded the bus and arrested Ms. Easley. The bus then departed, sometime later than its scheduled departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Agent Godier transported Ms. Easley to the DEA District Office in Albuquerque. According to Ms. Easley, while he was transporting her, Agent Godier asked her questions about the offense and warned\n   her that she was facing a prison sentence of ten years to life. [Doc. 34 at 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the DEA District Office, SA Perry interrogated Ms. Easley. The government provided a video of the interrogation and a transcript of the video. [Gov. Ex. 2(A) ]. The parties dispute what happened before the recorded interrogation-specifically, what SA Perry told Ms. Easley about the potential charges against her, her right to be represented by an attorney, and her potential exposure to incarceration. According to Ms. Easley, after she was placed in a holding cell, SA Perry removed her from the holding cell, showed her the methamphetamine that had been seized, told her that she was facing a sentence of ten years to life imprisonment, \"and then he told he[r] that she needed to be selfish, that she needed to think about her kids, that the people who supplied her with the drugs would not care about her and, most important, that she needed to 'help herself.' \" [Doc. 34 at 8]. Ms. Easley says that she was then returned to the holding cell and, sometime later, removed again by SA Perry to take her photograph, fingerprints, and obtain personal information. During this processing, according to Ms. Easley, SA Perry told her that she was \"not getting out,\" that he wanted to interview her, and that, again, she needed to be \"selfish\" and \"help\" herself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Ms. Easley recalls that SA Perry told her \"she could help herself by consenting to an interview because if she cooperated he would tell the judge that she was a good person but if she failed to cooperate he would be forced to tell the judge that she was not worthy of leniency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. At the hearing, SA Perry testified to telling Ms. Easley that \"if she decided to cooperate to help herself, that her consideration, anything that she did, would be relayed to the U.S. Attorneys who would relate it to the Judge, who would make the final decision of what happened to her.\" [Hearing Tr. at 100:11-15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SA Perry returned Ms. Easley to the holding cell and then, sometime later, removed her again and took her to an interview room where he conducted a tape-recorded conversation. The following is an excerpt of the interrogation near the beginning of the recording, after SA Perry read Ms. Easley her Miranda warning.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   SA Perry: You kind of had a puzzled look on your face. Do you-do you want me to read that again? Do you understand it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Easley: I understand it, but I'm just like I want to help but I'm like-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   SA Perry: Well, let me finish. Let me finish reading your rights. You understand that one, though, right? Let me read it to you again. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions and to have a lawyer with you during questioning. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Easley: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   SA Perry: Okay. If you cannot afford a Lawyer one will be appointed to you before any questioning if you wish. Do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Easley: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   SA Perry: Do you understand everything I just read to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Easley: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   SA Perry: Okay. Are you willing to answer some questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Easley: If I answer the questions now and then I answer questions with a lawyer here, how long would it that be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   SA Perry: Okay. Repeat that again because I didn't understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Ms. Easley: I said-I said how long would it be for me to answer questions with a lawyer here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   SA Perry: Okay. Here's the deal, you have a right to a lawyer, okay, before you answer any questions. If you tell\n   me that you want a lawyer right now-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Ms. Easley: Uh-huh\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   SA Perry: -we're just not going to ask you the questions today. Okay. So that's your right. We're not going to call a lawyer and bring one in here and have you question-answer questions. Okay. We're not going to do that today. If you decide you want a lawyer today we just won't ask you questions but you can-if you talk to your lawyer later and after you go to court and then you decide you want to answer questions then we'll talk to you then. Does that make sense? If it doesn't make sense let me know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Easley: It makes sense. I'm just like which one is going to help me better because I told you I don't-I can't afford to be here like this. I know what is going on but I can't afford to be here like this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   SA Perry: Okay. That's your right. I-you know, all I can do is read you your rights and I can't try to talk you into talking to us. You know, I mean, as I explained to you when we was processing you, you know, I want to talk to you. The advantages of you talking to us is it'll, in the long run help you. Obviously it will help us. It will help you when it comes down to your sentencing. That's a choice you make. You can get-make a choice to talk to us and, you know, I can't make that decision for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. Easley: All right. [...] I'll answer the questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [Gov. Ex. 2(A) at 2:24-5:13]. During the ensuing interview, Ms. Easley described how she agreed to transport luggage from Claremont, California, to Louisville, Kentucky, who she was working with and what transpired prior to her boarding the bus in Claremont. Over the course of the interview, both SA Perry and Ms. Easley made references to their earlier, unrecorded conversation while Ms. Easley was being processed, including SA Perry saying \"I told you before, we can't go back and change anything we did,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:4-5, and Ms. Easley saying \"like you already said, I'm not going to get out anyways,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:23-24. After the recorded interview, Ms. Easley was eventually transported to the Sandoval County Detention Center in Bernalillo, New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Ms. Easley was charged in a one-count Indictment [Doc. 12] with possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(1) and 841(B)(1)(a). On May 23, 2016, she filed the instant Motion to Suppress [Doc. 20], arguing that SA Perry had violated her rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and sought to suppress the evidence that SA Perry seized from the G-brand suitcase, as well as her subsequent custodial statements. On June 2, 2016, the United States filed a Response in opposition to Ms. Easley's Motion to Suppress. [Doc. 21]. On July 19, 2016, Ms. Easley filed a Reply to the United States' Response. [Doc. 30]. On August 24, 2016, the Court held a suppression hearing. SA Perry and Ms. Easley testified at the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to file written closing statements. The United States filed its written closing on August 31, 2016, and Ms. Easley filed her written closing on September 6, 2016.

The Court makes these findings under the authority of Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which requires a judge to decide preliminary questions relating to the admissibility of evidence, including the legality of a search or seizure, and the voluntariness of an individual's confession or consent to search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Neither counsel nor the Court has identified a case where law enforcement questioning passengers on a bus or train, during one of its scheduled stops, was considered an investigatory stop. Rather than stopping the bus outside of its schedule, SA Perry and Agent Godier boarded the bus during one of its regularly scheduled stops and spoke to passengers in an effort to conduct consensual searches. Everyone agreed to speak to SA Perry and no one declined consent to be searched. Because all of the agents' actions on the bus were based on consent, the factual setting of this case does not raise the issue of whether SA Perry and Agent Godier had reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop and frisk type search of Ms. Easley or others on the bus.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

First, there was no \"threatening presence of several officers.\" To the contrary, only SA Perry approached Ms. Easley, near the back of the bus, while Agent Godier remained at the front of the bus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, neither SA Perry nor Agent Godier \"brandished\" a weapon. SA Perry kept his gun and his handcuffs concealed beneath his shirt. Third, in reading the transcript of the audio recording, it would appear that SA Perry did not use \"aggressive language.\" Fourth, SA Perry did not retain Ms. Easley's personal effects for a prolonged period of time, as he searched each item briefly and immediately returned it to her. Fifth, the recording and testimony do not indicate that SA Perry blocked Ms. Easley's access to the aisle during the encounter. Finally, the encounter occurred in the presence of other members of the public, namely, the other bus passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   However, in considering the totality of the circumstances, beyond the factors specifically mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that a reasonable person in Ms. Easley's position would not have felt free to terminate the encounter with SA Perry. First, the recording of SA Perry's interactions with passengers on the bus reflects that none of the passengers refused to speak with SA Perry, and those who were asked\n   did consent to searches. One passenger even consented to SA Perry cutting into his shoe. [Gov. Ex. 1(A) at 13:19-14:6]. That no one declined consent suggests that SA Perry, either verbally or nonverbally, made a show of authority that would lead a reasonable person in Ms. Easley's position to believe she was not free to decline or terminate the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Levetan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032521\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/891/#p901\">\n    729 F.Supp. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (D.D.C. 1990), the district court held that, where the defendant train passenger was told that police were searching others on the train and defendant understood that the train would be stopped until the officers finished their questioning and searches, a reasonable person would not believe they were free to leave. The court recognized that \"[a] reasonable person is unlikely to believe that he alone can walk away from police when he is one of a group of persons being questioned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032521\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/891/#p901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further reasoned that \"[t]he knowledge that police are searching a group of other persons must have at least subtly coerced Levetan into believing that the police could lawfully search his bags whether he consented or not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032521\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/891/#p901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032521\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/729/891/#p901\">\n    at 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532082\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/735/#p740\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, Ms. Easley witnessed SA Perry's interrogation and search of several other passengers on the bus before she was questioned, and she did not see anyone decline consent. The Court therefore gives some weight to this factor, as part of the totality of circumstances, in favor of its finding that Ms. Easley's consent was involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, SA Perry initiated his conversation with several passengers by saying that he was checking the bus \"for security\" purposes, rather than stating he was looking for contraband.

Jan. 7, 2013), Doc. 98, the Court granted the defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that SA Perry coerced the defendant's consent to search, in part by misleading the defendant as to the purpose of his search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. The Court found that SA Perry failed to inform the defendant that he was searching for illegal narcotics, and instead informed her \"that he was searching for weapons and/or explosives,\" to which either the defendant or her co-defendant \"indicated that she felt reassured that law enforcement was being vigilant to protect their safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.

The Court weighed these factors and concluded that \"because Perry did not clarify that Defendant did not have to consent ... and because Perry misrepresented the reason why he wanted to search Defendant,\" and in light of some observations about the tone and demeanor of SA Perry, the defendant's consent to be searched was obtained through coercion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Here, the Court finds that SA Perry misled passengers as to the purpose of his search. The Court weighs this factor in support of its conclusion that Ms. Easley's consent to be searched and subsequent abandonment of the G brand suitcase was involuntary. On one hand, in talking to Ms. Easley specifically, SA Perry did not repeat his earlier statement to several other passengers that he was checking the bus for \"security.\" In fact, when he asked Ms. Easley for permission to search her checked bag, SA Perry asked \"Would you consent for [sic] a search of your bag for contraband, ma'am?\" [Gov. Ex. 1(A) at 27:11-12]. The Court does not know whether Ms. Easley specifically overheard SA Perry's prior interactions with passengers, in which he stated five times that he was checking the bus for security purposes. On the other hand, on the audio recording you can clearly hear him telling other passengers that he is a police officer checking the bus for security purposes. What is clear is that SA Perry did not tell Ms. Easley he was a DEA officer looking for narcotics. By being vague as to his purpose, SA Perry deprives passengers of an opportunity to understand the situation, let alone exercise their right to decline consent. Therefore, in light of the fact that all of the other passengers consented to be searched and that Ms. Easley was not informed of her right to refuse consent, the Court weighs SA Perry's misleading statement in favor of finding that Ms. Easley's consent was coerced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Third, when SA Perry reboarded and asked Ms. Easley to step off the bus for more questioning, his instructions could be interpreted as either a request or a demand, depending on contextual factors such as race, gender, and economic or social status. When SA Perry asked Ms. Easley to step off the bus, the recording indicates that he said \"Excuse me, ma'am. Can I speak to you outside for one second, please? You don't have to bring any of your stuff. You can bring your purse if you'd like. Can I see your ticket one more time, ma'am? Can we step over here just to get away from this noise? Where did you say you were headed to?\" [Gov. Ex. 1(A) at 38:9-15]. The government's position is that these instructions were non-aggressive and gave Ms. Easley the opportunity to decline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court disagrees and, in weighing the audio recording, considers race as a relevant contextual factor. Race influences the likelihood of a person asserting their constitutional rights. Through everyday experiences, people of color are conditioned to presume that asserting their constitutional rights in a police encounter will increase their likelihood of physical harm or arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the backdrop of fear between people of color and law enforcement, the Court must consider race as a factor, rather than simply asking whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court is persuaded that it is both permissible and necessary to consider race as part of the totality of the circumstances because the Supreme Court has regarded age as a relevant factor.

Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child's age properly informs the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   custody analysis.\" The Court explained that \"courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, \"[p]recisely because childhood yields objective conclusions like those we have drawn ourselves-among others, that children are 'most susceptible to influence' ... and 'outside pressures,' ...-considering age in the custody analysis in no way involves a determination of how youth 'subjectively affect[s] the mindset' of any particular child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 275,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted authority omitted). In the same way, if courts may consider that a younger person is less likely to decline consent than an adult, without determining the child's subjective mindset, this Court may consider the \"commonsense reality,\" backed by substantial evidence, that a person of color is also less likely to decline consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Justice Sotomayor explains in\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]his is not to say that a child's age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case....

This Court similarly considers Ms. Easley's race as one of several factors in assessing the totality of the circumstances surrounding her encounter with SA Perry. The fact that Ms. Easley was the only black person on the Greyhound bus bolsters the Court's conclusion that, in light of the previously discussed circumstances surrounding the encounter, Ms. Easley's consent was not voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the Supreme Court's consideration of age is based in part on the observation that \" '[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition' that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that our history has not similarly acknowledged race. However, just as youth or age may impact a court's understanding of the totality of the circumstances, this Court must consider race in order to fully apprehend the encounter between Ms. Easley, the only black passenger on the bus, and SA Perry, a white officer. Omitting consideration of the ways in which race influences encounters with law enforcement and insisting on a colorblind system of justice perpetuates a system in which constitutional protections are severely weakened for people of color. As Professor Devon W. Carbado explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Because, for example, whites and African Americans are not similarly situated with respect to how their racial identity might affect this sense of constraint, the Court's failure to consider race is not race-neutral. It creates a racial preference in the seizure doctrine for people who are not racially vulnerable to, or who do not experience a sense of racial constraint in the context of, interactions with the police. Black people, across intraracial differences, are likely to feel seized earlier in a police interaction than whites, likely to feel \"more\" seized in any given moment, and less likely to know or feel empowered to exercise their rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In other words, if race is ignored in the \"free to leave\" test, \"people who are especially vulnerable to police encounters because of their race are systematically disadvantaged in comparison to people who are not.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At least one appellate judge has stated in dissent that racial context must be considered in the totality of the circumstances analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Whether the courts speak of it or not, race is a factor that has for many years engendered distrust between black males and law enforcement personnel.... I respectfully venture to suggest that no reasonable innocent black male (with any knowledge of American history) would feel free to ignore or walk away from a drug interdicting team.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    In re J.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7355272\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/619/497/#p512\">\n    619 A.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512-13 (D.C. 1992) (Mack, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court similarly finds that it must consider race in weighing the totality of the circumstances as to whether someone in Ms. Easley's position would have felt free to leave, in order to ensure that Fourth Amendment protections apply equally to people of color.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, because the Court is tasked with assessing \"all the circumstances surrounding the encounter,\"\n   <em>\n    Bostick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\" the Court views SA Perry's request to speak with Ms. Easley outside the bus as an assertion of law enforcement authority that would make a reasonable person of color feel that they are not free to decline or terminate the interaction. The government argues that SA Perry's words, on paper and in isolation, are not coercive. However, this Court must consider the context in which these statements were made, in order to properly weigh the totality of the circumstances. In the context of an interaction between a white officer and the only black person on the bus, taking place after a stream of passengers have already agreed to answer questions or be searched, and after SA Perry has repeatedly misrepresented his purpose, the Court considers\n   SA Perry's words and instructions to Ms. Easley to have authoritative and coercive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For example, while searching Ms. Easley's purse, SA Perry asks if he can set it down and then says \"Some people are picky about their stuff.\" [Gov. Ex. 1(A) at 40:23-24]. This comment communicates to someone who is less likely to assert her rights that she should be permissive and cooperative. Furthermore, when SA Perry turns to show the G-brand bag to Ms. Easley he starts by saying \"Okay. I'm recording\" and asks Agent Godier to hand him the G-brand bag.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:10. Regardless of SA Perry's reasons for stating that the recording device was on, this comment would put a reasonable person of color on notice that the conversation was significant enough to be recorded, making it even more unlikely that she would feel free to terminate the conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As Justice O'Connor explains in\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   , courts are charged with enforcing constitutional protections and may not take policy positions on the war on drugs.\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures; it does not proscribe voluntary cooperation.... We adhere to the rule that, in order to determine whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure, a court must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter to determine whether the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   , no single factor is dispositive or receives extra weight in the Court's reasoning. However, the Court is concerned that (1) SA Perry misrepresented his purpose, (2) SA Perry did not inform Ms. Easley of her right to refuse consent, (3) all of the passengers agreed to answer SA Perry's questions and, among those who were asked to consent to searches, all agreed to searches of their belongings, including cutting into a shoe, and (4) as the only black person on the bus, Ms. Easley was less likely to assert her constitutional rights. This combination of circumstances leads the Court to conclude that Ms. Easley's consent was not voluntary. Although SA Perry is not required\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   to inform passengers of their right to refuse consent, the Court may give weight to this factor in combination with the other circumstances of the encounter.\n   <em>\n    Bostick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    501 U.S. at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108039\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/429/#p437\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"[t]he Florida Supreme Court erred in adopting a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule\" and that courts \"must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter\"). Furthermore, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Drayton\n   </em>\n   , the Court does not give \"extra weight\" to the absence of a warning regarding Ms. Easley's right to refuse consent. The Court gives this factor weight in combination with the other circumstances of the encounter. \"Although government agents are not required to advise a defendant that he or she has a right to refuse consent to search, this is one factor considered in the totality of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200921\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/1273/#p1278\">\n    639 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Under this set of circumstances, the Court finds that the encounter was coercive and that the government has not shown by a preponderance that an individual in Ms. Easley's position would feel free to leave. In short, because people of color are less likely to assert their constitutional rights, Fourth Amendment protections may only become meaningful when they are given the opportunity to meaningfully comprehend both the officer's purpose and their right to refuse consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.D.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928609,12450489\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/261/\">\n    564 U.S. at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450489,5928609\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2394/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To hold, as the State requests, that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody-and thus to ignor\n   e the very real differences between children and adults-would be to deny children the full scope of procedural safeguards that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   guarantees to adults.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Accordingly, because Ms. Easley has established that her abandonment of the G-brand suitcase resulted from an earlier Fourth Amendment violation, the Court must find that her abandonment of the suitcase was involuntary and SA Perry's search of the suitcase was therefore unreasonable.

However, the Court weighs this factor differently in the instant case because the totality of the circumstances is distinct. First, whereas Ms. Easley was present as SA Perry questioned and searched several passengers, Grobstein was only the third passenger to speak with SA Perry. Furthermore, whereas neither Ms. Easley nor any other passenger declined consent, Grobstein initially declined consent to search. Because the totality of the circumstances in the encounter between Grobstein and SA Perry indicated voluntary consent, the Court found that SA Perry's misrepresentation that he was on the bus for security purposes to be inconsequential.
