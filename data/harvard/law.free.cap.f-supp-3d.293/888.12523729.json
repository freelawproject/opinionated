Plaintiffs sued the companies that developed the phone-Huawei Device USA, Inc. (\"Huawei\") and Google LLC (\"Google\")-for breach of warranty, fraud, and unjust enrichment.

Here, the Court dives into the merits of Huawei's and Google's Motions to Dismiss, which assert that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted and that Plaintiffs' class allegations should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court held a hearing on these motions on January 18, 2018. The Court has considered the arguments presented at oral argument and in the briefing, as well as the submitted evidence and applicable law. For the reasons that follow, the Court hereby GRANTS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND IN PART, GRANTS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND IN PART, AND DENIES IN PART Huawei's and Google's Motions to Dismiss. The Court DENIES Huawei's and Google's motions to strike Plaintiffs' class allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Consolidated Amended Complaint (\"CAC\"), ECF 28. In September 2015, Google unveiled the Nexus 6P, the newest version of its Nexus 6 smartphone. CAC \u00b6 165. Google and Huawei created the Nexus 6P together, with Google handling software development and Huawei handling device manufacture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the launch event and in advertising, Google touted many of the superior features of the phone.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 169, 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unfortunately, according to the CAC, the Nexus 6P suffers from two defects. First, some phones unexpectedly turn off and, upon turning back on, experience an endless bootloop cycle (the \"Bootloop Defect\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174. When the Bootloop Defect manifests, the phone becomes nonoperational and all unsaved data is lost because the phone cannot proceed beyond the start-up screen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175. Second, some phones prematurely shut off despite showing a battery charge of anywhere from 15-90% (the \"Battery Drain Defect\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177. When the Battery Drain Defect manifests, the phone remains dead until the user reconnects it to power.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178. After some charging, the battery shows the same or similar charge as indicated before the premature shut-off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Complaints about the Bootloop and Battery Drain Defects began cropping up online as early as September and October 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 175, 184, 187-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This putative class action was commenced on April 19, 2017. ECF 1. Plaintiffs filed the operative complaint-the CAC-on May 23, 2017. Plaintiffs seek to represent a nationwide class of customers who purchased or own a Nexus 6P. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 205. They also propose twelve statewide subclasses, which cover all persons or entities in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington who purchased or own at least one Nexus 6P.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs bring twenty-three causes of action against both Huawei and Google under a spattering of state laws and one federal law. At the high level, their claims fall into three buckets: (1) warranty claims, (2) fraud claims, and (3) unjust enrichment claims. Their warranty claims consist of claims for (1) breach of express warranty on behalf of the nationwide class or each statewide subclass, (2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability on behalf of the nationwide class or each statewide subclass, (3) violation of the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act on behalf of the California subclass, and (4) violation of the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act presumably on behalf of the nationwide class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 213-67, 284-96. Their fraud claims consist of (1) a common-law\n   claim for deceit and fraudulent concealment on behalf of each statewide subclass and (2) claims for violations of state consumer protection statutes on behalf of the relevant statewide subclass.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 268-77, 297-535. Finally, their unjust enrichment claims are asserted on behalf of the nationwide class based on the universal principles of equity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 278-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2017, Huawei and Google filed their Motions to Dismiss. Huawei's argument regarding lack of personal jurisdiction was addressed in a prior order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 113. Here, the Court focuses on the sufficiency of the CAC. Specifically, both Huawei's and Google's Motions to Dismiss assert that Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts entitling them to relief on their claims. Huawei Mot. 9-28; Google Mot. 3-29. Huawei and Google also request that the Court strike Plaintiffs' class allegations. Huawei Mot. 26-28; Google Mot. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both Huawei and Google contend that Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts entitling them to relief on their claims. Before turning to the merits of those arguments, the Court addresses Google's request for judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Request for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In connection with its Motion to Dismiss, Google seeks judicial notice of two documents: Google's U.S. Terms of Sale and the Nexus 6P webpage. ECF 57. Portions of the documents are referenced in the CAC, and both are capable of accurate and ready determination because they are publicly available online. These documents are properly subject to judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) ;\n   <em>\n    Knievel v. ESPN\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174169\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1068/#p1076\">\n    393 F.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2005). Plaintiffs did not formally object to Google's request. Accordingly, Google's request for judicial notice is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motions to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Huawei and Google contend that Plaintiffs' CAC provides insufficient allegations to properly plead their causes of action. The Court begins by making some general observations about changes that should be made to any amended pleading. The Court then addresses the sufficiency of an allegation important to many of Plaintiffs' claims-namely, whether Huawei and Google had knowledge of the defects at the time of sale. Finally, the Court proceeds to analyze separately the claims asserted against Huawei and the claims asserted against Google.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. General Observations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court starts with a couple general observations about the pleadings. First, in their twenty-three causes of actions, Plaintiffs often lump Huawei and Google together, alleging conduct by \"Defendants\" without distinguishing what Huawei did from what Google did.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CAC \u00b6\u00b6 230 (\"Defendants received timely notice of the breaches experienced by Plaintiffs and Class members. Defendants were provided notice of the Defects by complaints lodged by consumers before or within a reasonable amount of time after the allegations of the Defects became public.\"), 241 (\"Defendants breached the implied warranty of merchantability because the Phones they sold are not of a merchantable quality, but instead contain a Bootloop Defect and a Battery Drain Defect.\"), 270 (\"Defendants concealed and suppressed material facts concerning the performance and quality of the Phones, and the quality of the Huawei, Google, and Nexus brands. Specifically, Defendants knew (or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known) of the Defects, but failed to disclose them prior to or at the time they marketed Phones and sold them to consumers.\"). As discussed in\n   more detail below with respect to particular causes of action, this setup obfuscates what roles Huawei and Google independently played in the alleged harm and whether either is liable for its own conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adobe Sys. Inc. v. Blue Source Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065366\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/125/945/#p964\">\n    125 F.Supp.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (N.D. Cal. 2015). In an amended pleading, Plaintiffs \"must identify what action each Defendant took that caused Plaintiffs' harm, without resort to generalized allegations against Defendants as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    In re iPhone Application Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-MD-02250-LHK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204403963\">\n    2011 WL 4403963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 20, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and unjust enrichment on behalf of a nationwide class but do not specify what law governs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed in more detail below with respect to these individual causes of action, the failure to identify the relevant law makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the Court to provide a thorough analysis of Plaintiffs' claims. Throughout this order, the Court often uses the law that the parties apply in their briefing without elaborating on other potentially applicable state laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any amended version of the pleadings, Plaintiffs should clarify what law governs each cause of action. Additionally, causes of action should not group together multiple sources of law; rather, Plaintiffs should plead separate causes of actions for each source of law, whether federal or state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Huawei's and Google's Knowledge of Defects at the Time of Sale\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Whether Huawei and Google had knowledge of the defects at the time that Plaintiffs purchased their phones is a common thread through many of the Plaintiffs' claims. Indeed, many of Plaintiffs' causes of action either start from the premise or entirely depend on the fact that Huawei and Google knew, or reasonably should have had known, of the defects at the time of sale. Therefore, the Court begins by examining the sufficiency of the Plaintiffs' allegations on that score, as the answer colors the analysis of many of the Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At multiple points in the CAC, Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants knew (or exercising due diligence should have known) that the Phones were defective at the time of sale.\" CAC \u00b6 246;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 186, 226, 270, 281, 318, 322, 335, 359. However, that statement is conclusory, and the CAC does not contain sufficient factual matter to make that inference plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The key issue here is timing. The Nexus 6P was released in September 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165. In the CAC, Plaintiffs provide multiple examples of consumers posting online about the Bootloop and Battery Drain Defects, but do not provide specific dates for any of those postings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184. Plaintiffs do not allege that Huawei ever saw or responded to these online complaints, let alone that Huawei knew about them\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs purchased their phones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048442\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1136/#p1147\">\n    668 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (\"[C]ourts have rejected undated customer complaints offered as a factual basis for a manufacturer's knowledge of a defect because they provide no indication whether the manufacturer was aware of the defect\n   <em>\n    at the time of sale\n   </em>\n   .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Plaintiffs allege particular dates for Google's online responses to the postings, those responses postdate Plaintiffs' purchases. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that a Google representative responded to customer complaints about the Bootloop Defect in September 2016, stating: \"We understand that a very small number of users are experiencing a bootloop issue on your device. We are continuing to investigate the situation, but can confirm that this is strictly a hardware related issue.\" CAC \u00b6 187.

Huawei Mot. 24-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Huawei Reply 15 (\"No matter what test is applied, the [CAC] lacks any factual basis to sustain such a claim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Under any test, Plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts to establish that Huawei engages in a \"practice of selling defective phones without providing an adequate remedy to cure the Defects.\" CAC \u00b6 302. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to five aspects of \"Defendants\" Huawei and Google's conduct: (1) knowingly sold defective phones, (2) refused to repair or replace phones when the defects manifested outside the warranty period, (3) avoided providing warranty service by blaming minor cosmetic issues, (4) had long wait periods on warranty claims, and (5) provided replacement phones that were also defective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 301. Although Plaintiffs endorse evaluating this conduct as a whole without testing the sufficiency of each aspect, the problem is that Plaintiffs lump Huawei and Google together under the heading of \"Defendants\" when each aspect does not apply uniformly to both. Therefore, the Court must undertake the difficult endeavor of teasing out which actions the CAC attributes to Huawei alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Ground (1) is easily discarded, as it merely parrots the already-rejected contention that Huawei had knowledge of the defects at the time of sale. Ground (2) also falls away because the California courts have held that there can be no \"unfair\" business practice, at least under the FTC Act section 5 test, when the product functions as warranted throughout the term of an express warranty.\n   <em>\n    Daugherty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20118\">\n    51 Cal.Rptr.3d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he failure to disclose a defect that might, or might not, shorten the effective life span of an automobile part that functions precisely as warranted throughout the term of its express warranty...does not constitute an unfair practice under the UCL.\"). Ground (3) appears more promising, but Plaintiffs do not provide sufficient facts to support it. Only one California Plaintiff alleges that Huawei denied warranty coverage based on a cosmetic flaw in his phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAC \u00b6 15 (\"Huawei informed [Plaintiff] Makcharoenwoodhi that his warranty was voided because his Phone had a small dent by the volume button.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   One isolated instance where\n   Huawei allegedly did not provide warranty coverage based on a minor cosmetic issue does not rise to the level of an unfair practice of failing to honor its warranties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Ground (4) asserts that Huawei \"[r]equir[ed] consumers to wait several weeks to several months to receive accommodation for warranty claims.\" CAC \u00b6 301.d. However, Plaintiffs have not identified any California Plaintiff who complains about wait times,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 85, 122, 156, and Plaintiffs do not argue, by reference to allegations in the CAC, that there is a basis to infer that Huawei's practice has affected any California resident. Moreover, the failure to provide timely responses to warranty claims might amount to poor customer service but, standing alone, cannot fairly be characterized as immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous. Finally, based on the present allegations, ground (5) does not apply to Huawei at all: Google is the only actor alleged to have provided certain Plaintiffs with a defective replacement phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 75, 113-14, 136. Thus, none of Plaintiffs' five asserted aspects of Huawei's conduct withstands scrutiny at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   More broadly, the CAC pleads that Huawei's conduct is unfair because it \"violated California public policy, legislatively declared in the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, requiring a manufacturer to ensure that goods it places on the market are fit for their ordinary and intended purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 301. Even if that description of the Song-Beverly Act accurately captures the general thrust of the statute, it fails to account for the Song-Beverly Act's circumscribed geographic reach to sales of consumer goods\n   <em>\n    in California\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201792\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At a minimum, the Song-Beverly Act's purpose is not offended by sales of unmerchantable consumer goods outside the state of California. Thus, like with Plaintiffs' claim under the Song-Beverly Act, Plaintiffs' claim under the UCL unfair prong fails because the CAC does not allege that the California Plaintiffs purchased their phones in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Huawei's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' UCL claim under the unfair prong with leave to amend to allege relevant facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Fraudulent Business Act or Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In the CAC, Plaintiffs identify three fraudulent acts on the part of Huawei and Google: (1) \"[k]nowingly and intentionally concealing from Plaintiffs and California Subclass members the existence of the Defects in the Phones\"; (2) \"[f]alsely marketing the Phones as being functional and not possessing defects that would render them useless\"; and (3) \"[p]romoting the battery capabilities and lifespan despite knowing of the significant Defects in the Phones.\" CAC \u00b6 303. Putting aside the fact that the allegations do not distinguish between Huawei and Google, all three acts are premised on Huawei's knowledge of the defects at the time of sale to the California Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' opposition likewise characterizes the claim under the UCL fraud prong as turning on the \"allegations of Defendants' knowledge of the Nexus 6Ps core defects, failure to disclose them, and portrayal of these phones as well functioning.\" Opp'n 40. As the Court has repeatedly reiterated, Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that Huawei had knowledge of the defects when the California Plaintiffs purchased their phones.

Google Mot. 3. Specifically, Plaintiffs Tran, Berry, and Leone purchased their Nexus 6Ps through the Google Store, and Plaintiffs Martorello and Jones purchased theirs directly from Google. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 38, 52, 70, 111, 130. Under Google's Terms of Sale, \"[t]he laws of California, U.S.A. apply to these Terms, excluding California's choice of law rules, and will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.\" Google argues that this choice-of-law clause should be enforced against the out-of-state Plaintiffs attempting to assert non-California based causes of action, Google Mot. 3-4, and Plaintiffs offer no meaningful response. The Court briefly examines the issues related to Google's choice-of-law clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   One issue is whether these out-of-state Plaintiffs mutually assented to Google's Terms of Sale, a question which implicates the law of Internet-based contract formation. As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, \"[c]ontracts formed on the Internet come primarily in two flavors: 'clickwrap' (or 'click-through') agreements, in which website users are required to click on an 'I agree' box after being presented with a list of terms and conditions of use; and 'browsewrap' agreements, where a website's terms and conditions of use are generally posted on the website via a hyperlink at the bottom of the screen.\"\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.

Google submits evidence that its Terms of Sale fall in the former category because, for online purchases, customers must click a button which indicates that the customer agrees to the Terms of Sale. Gotuaco Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 57-2. Plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary. In any event, regardless of whether Google's Terms of Sale are more appropriately characterized as a \"clickwrap\" or \"browsewrap\" agreement, courts have often enforced such agreements when the user \"had actual notice of the Terms of Use or was required to affirmatively acknowledge the Terms of Use before completing his online purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181388\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/1171/#p1175\">\n    763 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1176 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nevarez v.

Most prominently, that statement relies on numerical figures with a set meaning and defines the relationship between them-specifically, if the user charges for \"ten minutes,\" he will be able to use the phone for \"up to seven hours.\" Google counters with a footnote hanging off its \"get up to seven hours\" statement, which says that \"[a]ll battery life claims are approximate and based on an average mixed use profile that includes both usage and standby time.\" RJN, Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638011\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1134/#p1145\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Actual battery performance will vary and depends on many factors....\"). That footnote does not undermine the specificity of the \"get up to seven hours\" statement but merely clarifies that the \"get up to seven hours\" statement contemplates normal use of the phone. In other words, a consumer who continuously streams movies on his phone should not be upset if he is unable to watch for seven hours after charging for ten minutes. But that does not preclude a consumer who engages in normal usage\n   from reasonably expecting to get up to seven hours of use after ten minutes of charging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Measurability is not defeated by the fact that Google's statement is phrased as assuring \"up to\" seven hours, but not guaranteeing exactly seven hours. On this point, this case lies closer to Plaintiffs' cited authority than Google's. In the case Google cites, the district court concluded that a car manufacturer did not create an express warranty in advertising language, which stated that the powertrain in its trucks \"offers a maximum highway range of up to 680 miles on a single fill-up.\"\n   <em>\n    Acedo v.

Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Acedo\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's theory was that, based on the car manufacturer's statement, he justifiably believed that \"he would actually be able to drive 680...miles on a single tank of gas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012696176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs construe Google's statement as a warranty that their phones would not experience sudden shutdowns from battery failure, not that their phones would consistently get exactly seven hours or almost seven hours of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In that last respect, this case is analogous to Plaintiffs' cited authority. In\n   <em>\n    In re Toyota Motor Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the warranty \"statements convey[ed] that [the] [d]efendants' use of advanced technology in their vehicles...enhances safety.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268592\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/1145/#p1180\">\n    754 F.Supp.2d at 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Google's \"get up to seven hours\" statement is sufficiently specific and measurable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   By contrast, the statements that the Nexus 6P's battery life \"keeps you talking, texting and apping into the night\" and \"keeps you going all day and into the night\" are not adequate to create express warranties. For one thing, neither statement discusses what length of time of charging or what level of battery charge is envisioned. Equally important, the references to \"into the night\" and \"all day and into the night\" are inexact and do not provide a baseline against which to measure the rest of the statement.

Cal. 2012) (\"While this does not require that plaintiff relied on the individual advertisements, it does require that plaintiff was actually exposed to the advertising.\"). Indeed, one of Plaintiffs' central authorities explains that, at the motion to dismiss stage, plaintiffs need not allege reliance but must provide \"specific allegations that they were aware of the statements made in a national advertising campaign.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Toyota Motor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268592\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/1145/#p1180\">\n    754 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1182-83 &amp; n.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Thus, the operative question is whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that they became aware of Google's statements by exposure to its advertising. Plaintiffs do not clear that hurdle simply by alleging in a conclusory manner that \"Plaintiffs and Class members were exposed to and relied on [Google's above-identified] statements when they decided to buy Nexus 6P Phones\" and that \"Google's express warranties formed part of the basis of the bargain that was reached when Plaintiffs and Class Members purchased their Phones.\" CAC \u00b6 228.

For convenience, the Court groups Plaintiffs by controlling state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) California\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The three California Plaintiffs and the five out-of-state Plaintiffs who purchased from Google (Plaintiffs Martorello, Tran, Berry, Jones, and Leone) are subject to California law. Six of these Plaintiffs-Plaintiffs Makcharoenwoodhi, Gorbatchev, Christensen, Martorello, Berry, and Jones-do not allege that they saw any advertising statements; instead, they merely allege that they purchased the Nexus 6P. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 12-51, 70-78, 111-18. The remaining two Plaintiffs plead facts about advertising, but those allegations still are insufficient. Though the CAC alleges that Plaintiff Tran \"saw online advertisements representing that the Google Nexus 6P had a superior battery life,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52, it does not identify which advertisements he observed. That fact matters because only one of Google's statements-the \"get up to seven hours\" statement-is sufficiently specific and measurable at this stage to create an express warranty. As to Plaintiff Leone, the CAC alleges that he \"watched the live stream of the Nexus 6P release event in San Francisco and was exposed to Google's representations regarding the Phone at that event,\" and so he understood that \"superior battery life\" was a major selling point for the Nexus 6P.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. But Plaintiffs do not allege that the \"get up to seven hours\" statement was made at the launch event; that statement appeared on Google's website. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss the express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Makcharoenwoodhi, Gorbatchev, Christensen, Martorello, Tran, Berry, Jones, and Leone with leave to amend to allege which advertisements they saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Indiana\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Indiana Plaintiff Beheler's express warranty claim must also be dismissed on this ground. The CAC states that \"[t]he Nexus 6P's purportedly long battery life factored heavily into [Plaintiff] Beheler's decision to purchase this Phone.\" CAC \u00b6 59. But the CAC does not present the source of Plaintiff Beheler's view that the Nexus 6P had a long battery life. More precisely, it is not alleged that Plaintiff Beheler received that information from advertising at all, let alone the advertising containing Google's \"get up to seven hours\" statement. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss the express warranty claim of\n   Plaintiff Beheler with leave to amend to allege which advertisements he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) New York\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The CAC does not allege that New York Plaintiff Davydov saw or relied on the advertising statements identified as the basis for Plaintiffs' express warranty claims.

CAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-110. The allegations with respect to the other North Carolina Plaintiff, Harrison, are more detailed but still unsatisfactory. Specifically, Plaintiff Harrison's decision to purchase a Nexus 6P was \"materially influenced\" by her viewing of \"advertisements representing that the Nexus 6P's battery life was very good and touting the Nexus 6P as Google's top-of-the-line phone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. Nonetheless, that language does not appear in the advertising containing Google's \"get up to seven hours\" statement. Nor does the CAC otherwise nail down what particular advertising or statements Plaintiff Harrison encountered. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss the express warranty claims of Plaintiffs Harrison and Himes with leave to amend to allege which advertisements they saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Ohio\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The CAC does not allege that Ohio Plaintiff Servodio saw or relied on the advertising statements identified as the basis for Plaintiffs' express warranty claims. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 119-27. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss the express warranty claim of Plaintiff Servodio with leave to amend to allege which advertisements he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    (f) Texas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Like with Ohio Plaintiff Servodio, the CAC does not allege that Texas Plaintiff Poore saw or relied on the advertising statements identified as the basis for Plaintiffs' express warranty claims.

For many of the same reasons noted above, that allegation is not enough. Because the CAC does not pinpoint which advertisements Plaintiff Johnston has seen, there is no way to tell whether they contained Google's \"get up to seven hours\" statement, the actionable statement Plaintiffs have identified as a basis for the express warranty claim. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss the express warranty claim of Plaintiff Johnston with leave to amend to allege which advertisements he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   In sum, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' express warranty claims with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Disclaimer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In its motion to dismiss, Google appears to separately contend that Plaintiffs who purchased from Google-namely, Plaintiffs Gorbatchev, Martorello, Tran, Berry, Jones, and Leone, CAC \u00b6\u00b6 19, 38, 52, 70, 111, 130-are barred from pursuing an express warranty claim based on\n   Google's disclaimer in its Terms of Sale.

Like the manufacturer in\n   <em>\n    Prairie Production\n   </em>\n   , Google here made affirmations about the Nexus 6P in advertising. The Court has already determined that one of those statements was a specific and measurable promise. Even if the CAC does not sufficiently plead that Google is a manufacturer, the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Prairie Production\n   </em>\n   extends to this case. The CAC establishes that Google had significant involvement in the development of the Nexus 6P and advertised the virtues of the phone on its website in statements directed to consumers to induce them to buy the product.

The sole mention of \"notice\" is in a statement that \"the [California] Plaintiffs do not allege reliance or pre-suit notice, as the law requires.\" Google Mot. 5. Google's reply is equally unilluminating, stating that the letters of certain Plaintiffs were insufficient to put Google on notice. Google Reply 5. In these filings, Google nowhere indicates what law should apply, provides the relevant contours of the legal landscape, or clearly states which Plaintiffs are affected. Given the potential variances among the states and Plaintiffs (as indicated by the analysis with respect to Huawei), the Court declines to consider Google's bare assertion that notice provides another basis on which to dismiss Plaintiffs' express warranty claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Plaintiffs' second cause of action is for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability on behalf of a putative nationwide class under an unspecified law or, alternatively, on behalf of the putative statewide subclasses under the laws of the respective states. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 235-36. Plaintiffs' cause of action alleges that Google \"impliedly warranted that the Phones were of a merchantable quality\" but failed to live up to that guarantee because the Nexus 6Ps \"were not in merchantable condition and are not fit for the ordinary purpose for which phones are used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239.

For the former group, Google contends that these Plaintiffs are barred by the explicit disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability in its Terms of Sale. Google Mot. 5. For the latter, Google contends that these Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead privity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Disclaimer and Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Google first contends that the implied warranty claims of Plaintiffs Gorbatchev, Martorello, Tran, Berry, Jones, and Leone-who purchased their Nexus 6Ps from Google, CAC \u00b6\u00b6 19, 38, 52, 70, 111, 130-are barred by Google's disclaimer in its Terms of Sale.

Here, Google's Terms of Sale disclaimed the implied warranty of merchantability in accordance with California law because, under the bold heading \"Defects; Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties,\" the Terms provide in clear language and capitalized formatting that Google \"expressly disclaim[s] all warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, regarding any\n   devices, including any implied warranty of merchantability.\" The disclaimer is in all capital letters while the surrounding text is in lower case font of the same size, and the disclaimer is one of only two places in the entirety of the Terms of Sale that uses capitalized lettering.

In this way, Plaintiffs' allegations are consistent with Google's submitted evidence, which provides that customers had to click a button to complete their online purchases and that, next to the button, there was language advising that customer that clicking indicated acceptance of Google's Terms of Sale. Gotuaco Decl. \u00b6 3. Plaintiffs do not otherwise allege that they did not see or understand the disclaimer. Thus, this case is unlike the one cited by Plaintiffs where the allegations established that the plaintiff did not have a reasonable opportunity to view the disclaimer prior to purchase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

They contend that the disclaimer is unconscionable because Google and its customers are in an unequal bargaining position and because Google had \"exclusive knowledge of the Defects and true quality of the Phones.\" CAC \u00b6 261. On the latter point, the Court has already concluded that Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient. That conclusion significantly weakens the former point that Google had superior bargaining power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sony Grand Wega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174909\" index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/758/1077/#p1101\">\n    758 F.Supp.2d at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that defendant had superior bargaining power where plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged that the defendant knew of the defect before the point of sale).

Opp'n 28-29; CAC \u00b6 245 (\"Google knowingly sold a defective product without disclosing the Defects, while affirmatively misrepresenting purported attributes of the product that were important to consumer purchasers.\"). Again, Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to establish that conclusion. In their opposition, Plaintiffs also slightly change course from their complaint, asserting that a disclaimer may be substantively unconscionable any time a product is unfit for its intended use. Opp'n 29 (citing the statement in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205816410\">\n    2013 WL 5816410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13, that the \"inability to use the LG refrigerator for its intended purpose suggests that substantive unconscionability may exist\"). That reading of the law seems somewhat odd, as it works to invalidate a disclaimer of the implied warranty whenever the underlying implied warranty claim appears viable. In any event, Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient to show that Google's disclaimer \"create[s] overly harsh or one-sided results as to shock the conscience,\" and thus Plaintiffs have not established substantive unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    Aron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20555\">\n    49 Cal.Rptr.3d at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Based on the allegations in the CAC, Google's disclaimer is not unconscionable, and the disclaimer is enforceable.

Plaintiffs point to the same three statements that the Court analyzed above for Plaintiffs' express warranty claims-namely, the \"get up to seven hours\" statement, the \"keeps you talking, texting and apping\" statement, and the \"keeps you going\" statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 321.

The CAC makes no further effort to identify how that money came into Google's possession as a result of Plaintiff Christensen's purchase.

In particular, by treating Google and Huawei as a single unit without otherwise identifying Google's relationship with Best Buy, the CAC obscures the relevant actor.

No California Plaintiff was allegedly affected by this conduct, and Plaintiffs provide no argument that such an inference is reasonable based on the allegations.

Hence, none of Plaintiffs' five asserted aspects of Google's conduct withstands scrutiny at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that Google's conduct violates the Song-Beverly Act's policy of preventing unmerchantable products from reaching consumers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 301, fares no better.

The WCPA authorizes \"[a]ny person who is injured in his or her business or property by a violation of [the WCPA]...[to] bring a civil action...to enjoin further violations [or] to recover the actual damages sustained by him or her.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.090\">\n    Wash.

Plaintiff Johnston's WCPA claim falters on the same grounds. First, the CAC states that Google's acts were \"unfair\" because \"Defendants knowingly sold [Plaintiff] Johnston and Washington Subclass members Phones with the Defects, refused to honor warranties, required consumers to wait several weeks to several months on warranty claims, and replaced Phones under warranty with other defective Phones.\" CAC \u00b6 522. Google did not do any of those things with respect to Plaintiff Johnston, who bought his Nexus 6P from Best Buy and did not submit a warranty claim to Google.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"513\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"513\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.090\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 152-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the CAC states that Google's acts are \"deceptive\" because Google made misrepresentations about the Nexus 6P in advertising.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"514\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"514\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.86.090\">\n    \u00b6 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like with his breach of express warranty claim, Plaintiff Johnston has failed to adequately identify which Google advertisements he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Google's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Johnston's WCPA claim with leave to amend to allege further facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Unjust Enrichment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   Plaintiffs assert a cause of action for unjust enrichment. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 278-83. As discussed above with respect to Huawei, although a claim alleging unjust enrichment may state a claim for relief as a quasi-contract claim for restitution,\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"515\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202125004\">\n    2015 WL 2125004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9, Plaintiffs' claim must be dismissed for \"failure to allege which state law governs,\"\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"516\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20469370\">\n    2016 WL 469370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.

Huawei Mot. 26-27; Google Mot. 29.

Huawei Mot. 27-28; Google Mot. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Although these concerns are not without merit, Huawei's and Google's arguments are more appropriately addressed at a later stage of the proceedings when the issues have been more fully developed and sharpened. At the hearing, the Court indicated its inclination to defer these issues to the class certification stage. The Court remains convinced that it would be premature to resolve the issues at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Los Gatos Mercantile, Inc v. E.I.
