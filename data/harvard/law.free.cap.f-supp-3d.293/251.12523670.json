In an order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss, Judge O'Toole concluded that \"it is patently apparent that the definitions, even if they might be unclear at the margins, are not impermissibly vague in all applications, especially in light of the amendments to the Act which addressed some of the potential uncertainty.\" Mem. &amp; Order,\n   <em>\n    Gun Owner's Action League, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cellucci\n   </em>\n   , No. 98-12125-GAO, slip op. at 2 (D.

Though Judge O'Toole's assessment employed the higher pre-\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   standard, this Court agrees with his reasoning and concludes that the phrase \"copies or duplicates\" is not impermissibly vague even by the lower\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Though the Act does not define \"copies or duplicates,\" the phrase's plain meaning provides a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice as to what is prohibited under the Act. The commonly understood meaning of \"copy,\" as described by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is \"an imitation, transcript, or reproduction of an original work.\"\n   <em>\n    Copy\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copy (last updated Mar. 21, 2018).

The combined term \"copies and duplicates,\" in the context of the list of enumerated firearms, thus plainly refers to exact replicas of the enumerated firearms as well as firearms that may not be identical to the enumerated firearms but are nevertheless \"imitations.\" While citizens may need to apply their own interpretation of this language \"at the margins,\" this obligation does not render the language impermissibly vague because \" '[f]air' notice is understood as notice short of semantic certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Draper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4333756\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1/#p3\">\n    827 F.3d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Further, both the Second and Fourth Circuits have rejected vagueness challenges to similar or identical language. In\n   <em>\n    New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held the phrase \"copies or duplicates\" within the context of an assault weapons ban not to be unconstitutionally vague because the statute \"provided not only an itemized list of prohibited models but also [a] military-style features test,\" therefore providing citizens with another reference point for what may constitute a \"copy or duplicate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358143\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/242/#p254\">\n    804 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit upheld a statute's ban on \"copies\" of enumerated assault weapons in Maryland's assault weapons ban, relying heavily on the fact that notices issued by the Maryland Attorney General and the Maryland State Police \"explain how to determine whether a particular firearm is a copy of an identified assault weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    Kolbe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277257\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/114/#p138\">\n    849 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit sustained a vagueness challenge to an ordinance banning certain firearms, but emphasized that the ordinance \"outlaws assault weapons only by outlawing certain brand names without including within the prohibition similar assault weapons of the same type, function or capability,\" \"permits the sale and possession of weapons which are virtually identical to those listed if they are produced by a manufacturer that is not listed,\" and defines \"assault weapon\" by naming various individual models and then adding \"other models ... that have slight modifications or enhancements of firearms listed.\"\n   <em>\n    Springfield Armory, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Columbus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840554\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/250/#p252\">\n    29 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (6th Cir. 1994).

The Attorney General also issued a notice to the public (the Enforcement Notice) providing further guidance on how to determine whether a firearm is a \"copy or duplicate\" and thus prohibited. All of these characteristics conform with those of the statutes upheld in\n   <em>\n    New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass'n\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kolbe\n   </em>\n   , and with the characteristics that the Sixth Circuit indicated would have saved the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    Springfield Armory\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that the Act is nevertheless vague because the Enforcement Notice does not articulate every test that may be applied to determine whether a weapon is a copy or duplicate, and because the two tests it does set forth are not sufficiently clear to permit citizens to determine which weapons are prohibited.
