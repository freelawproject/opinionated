CONLEY, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Eric Schilling, Blaine Krohn and Erik Sinclair assert claims against their employer, PGA Inc., a company specializing in air comfort systems in central Wisconsin, for allegedly calculating overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Wisconsin state labor laws. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that: (1) PGA's policy of not including the \"cash fringe rate\" in calculating overtime violates both the FLSA and state law; and (2) PGA's policy of paying overtime based on the rate for the work performed during overtime hours, rather than on a \"straight-time hourly rate,\" violates state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   theory is based on PGA's alleged miscalculation of overtime pay for prevailing wage work. Plaintiff contends that PGA violated state law and the FLSA by failing to pay its employees overtime based on the hourly basic rate\n   <em>\n    plus\n   </em>\n   the cash fringe rate. Instead, plaintiffs claim, PGA calculated overtime for prevailing wage work using only the hourly base rate, and then adding the cash fringe rate to that overtime hourly rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   theory\n   is based on plaintiffs' PGA's allegedly miscalculating overtime using the rate of pay for the work completed during overtime hours, rather than the average straight time hourly rate earned during the workweek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Consistent with its usual two-step procedure, this court previously certified a conditional FLSA collective action based on the \"cash fringe rate\" claim. (11/2/2016 Order (dkt. # 24).) Before the court is plaintiffs' motion to certify a Rule 23 class covering both state law claims or two subclasses (dkt. # 45), as well as defendant's motion to decertify the FLSA collective action (dkt. # 53). For the reasons that follow, the court will grant plaintiffs' motion for class certification, certifying a single Rule 23 class covering both overtime claims. For the same reasons, the court will deny defendant's motion to decertify the FLSA collective action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. ## 85, 90.) In light of the parties' reliance on competing Wisconsin administrative code provisions and other administrative documents, and the limited case law as to plaintiffs' specific legal claims, the court believes that oral argument would be worthwhile. Accordingly, the court will hold oral argument at 10:00 a.m. on April 26, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Depending on the oral argument and the outcome of summary judgment, the court will reset pre-trial deadlines and a trial date, as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

While both theories here concern overtime pay calculations, the claims rest on different facts and questions of law. Still, there appears to be no conflict of interest. In other words, the interests of class members asserting a cash fringe rate\n   claim are not at odds with the interest of class members asserting a straight-time hourly rate claim. Specifically, these claims are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mutually exclusive-a class member could have been subject to either or both alleged overtime miscalculations. As such, two subclasses are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   3 William B. Rubenstein\n   <em>\n    et al., Newberg on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7:29 at pp.149-50 (5th ed. 2013) (\"Because there is no conflict of interest at issue, there is no necessity that each subclass have different representation and independently comply with all of the requirements of Rule 23(a), (b), and (g).\"). At some point, subclasses may be helpful from a management perspective, but the court will consider plaintiff's motion as seeking to certify a single class concerning both overtime challenges, which would also cover both FLSA collective action claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722982\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/802/#p811\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining the difference between compulsory subclasses to cure conflicts and permissive subclasses for management purposes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

P. 23(a)(1). Plaintiffs represent, and defendants stipulate, that at least 40 employees were paid overtime without accounting for the cash fringe rate, and at least 22 employees were paid overtime based on the rate for the work performed during overtime hours. (Pl.'s Br. (dkt. # 46) 7 (citing Ho Decl., Ex. 2 (dkt. # 20-2) (defendant's stipulation).) Because the court is considering plaintiff's motion as to certifying a single class, there are a minimum of 40 members, and perhaps more, if some of the 22 employees asserting straight time hourly rate claims are not counted in that 40. \"The Seventh Circuit has indicated that a group as small as forty may satisfy the numerosity requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Armes v. Sogro, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-C-0244,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201197537\">\n    2011 WL 1197537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.

McLaughlin,\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4:5 (8th ed. 2011) (collecting cases).

R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). A single, common issue will do, if it is \"capable of classwide resolution-which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each of the claims in one stroke.\"\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 2551, 2556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the commonality standard requires that plaintiffs do more than \"merely\" demonstrate \"that they have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff must show that \"the class members have suffered the same injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, plaintiffs' have put forth sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find that PGA has policies of (1) not including cash fringe in the overtime calculation and (2) calculating overtime based on the rate of pay for the work completed during overtime hours, rather than the average straight time hourly rate earned during the workweek. Defendant's challenge primarily concerns the latter claim, directing the court to purported evidence that employees, at times, were paid overtime calculated using the average wage rate. (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 12-13.) In\n   its analysis, however, defendant relies on an unsupported assumption that \"PGA rounds employees' time to the nearest half hour.\" (Id. at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Comparing defendant's math to that of plaintiffs', a key takeaway would appear to be that there is very little money at stake with respect to this claim. The examples provided by the parties demonstrate that the difference in pay (at least on a weekly basis) between overtime calculated based on the average straight time hourly rate and the rate for the overtime work is a matter of cents. (See, e.g., Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 12-14; Pl.'s Reply (dkt. # 82) 14-18.) Nonetheless, defendant's analysis does not undermine plaintiffs' evidence that defendants' have a policy of calculating overtime based on the rate of pay for the work completed during overtime hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Satisfied that plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendants have adopted the two challenged policies, the common issues are whether these policies violate state law. In response, defendant simply challenges whether its calculation of overtime based on the rate of pay for the overtime hours worked violates state law, at least for some employees. (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 16-19). This response, however, addresses the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of plaintiffs' cash fringe claim, not whether the claim is amenable to classwide proof. Regardless, the court finds that whether PGA's overtime policies violate state law are capable of classwide resolution, thus easily satisfying the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Typicality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Typicality for Rule 23(a) purposes requires that a named plaintiff's claim \"arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.\"\n   <em>\n    Keele v. Wexler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362668\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/149/589/#p595\">\n    149 F.3d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (7th Cir. 1998) (quoting\n   <em>\n    De La Fuente v.

For this reason, typicality will often overlap with the commonality requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v.

Applied with care, however, the former standard should ensure that \"a plaintiff with typical claims will pursue his or her own self-interest in the litigation and in so doing will advance the interests of the class members, which are aligned with ... those of the representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Insolia v.

Moreover, defendant offers no reason why plaintiffs' claims are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   typical of the other class members, or how their self-interest would diverge from the interest of the class more broadly. Instead, defendant's opposition regurgitates the same commonality arguments, which the court already rejected above. Since plaintiffs Schilling, Krohn and Sinclair's claims arise from the same legal theory as the class as a whole, the court finds the typicality requirement satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Adequacy of Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The adequacy requirement under Rule 23 is intended to ensure that \"representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). A class representative is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   adequate if he is subject to a defense to which other class members are not subject or could not prove the elements of the\n   class claim for reasons particular to him.\n   <em>\n    CE Design Ltd. v.

(Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 23-24.) Schilling and Krohn worked for PGA for approximately two and a half months during their summer vacation from college. While their limited employment may impact the extent of their damages, the fact that they initiated this lawsuit, sat for depositions and otherwise engaged in discovery provides sufficient evidence of their interest in pursuing their own claims and those of a like class of employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the fact that they have not maintained contact with other employees does not undermine their ability to represent the class fairly. Notice to class members will be directed by the court and coordinated by class counsel. Once represented by counsel, the class representatives need not (and arguably, should not) play a role in communicating with other class members outside privileged conversations involving legal counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant also contends that Sinclair in particular is not an adequate representative because he \"testified at his deposition that he views this lawsuit as an 'opportunity to make the playing field more level.' \" (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 26 (quoting Schilling Depo. (dkt. # 51) 57.) Defendant assumes that \"leveling the playing field\" means something different than-and is in conflict with-\"recover[ing] wages as required by law,\" but offers no reason for this assumption, nor can the court find any. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, absent more, this is a silly argument that warrants no response, other than to note the following. First, most parties, and certainly most plaintiffs, would, if asked, likely either say or agree that vindicating their rights in court was an attempt \"to level the playing field.\" Second, even assuming Sinclair's testimony encompassed labor relation issues that extend beyond the claims of this lawsuit, it does not raise a conflict of interest or otherwise call into question his ability to represent the interests of his subclass fairly, unless defendant had actual evidence that Sinclair would subvert his obligations to do just that in favor of his own, broader agenda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In addition to the named plaintiffs, courts are also required to determine whether the proposed class counsel is adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that adequacy \"raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Falcon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    457 U.S. at 157-158, n.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). Here, defendant challenges proposed class counsel's adequacy based on some missteps in this case, including: (1) an alleged travel time claim, which defendant contends plaintiff's counsel should have known at the time of pleading was meritless; (2) the inadvertent enclosure of a Wisconsin prevailing wage consent form in the FLSA collective action notice; and (3) the failure to file a third amended complaint timely as directed by the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Certainly, the court agrees these are reasons for concern,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   it has warned plaintiff's counsel to \"focus on the work at hand.\" (6/20/17 Order (dkt. # 108) 6.)

Indeed, even the potential for \"scores of separate trials\" to determine the extent to which each class member actually suffered a loss as a result of a policy does not preclude certification because, at minimum, \"it will not be necessary in each of those trials to determine whether [defendant] had an illegal policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340342\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/360/#p378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 379-380 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McReynolds v.

The court rejects this argument for the same reason as described above. Plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant has adopted a policy of calculating overtime based on the rate of pay for the work completed during overtime hours, rather than the average straight time hourly rate earned during the workweek. Defendant also opposes class certification on the basis that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that these policies are unlawful. As also already addressed, this argument goes to the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of plaintiffs' claim, rather than whether a common liability issue on the legality of the policies predominates over individual issues concerning the amount each class member worked. In light of\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the court finds that plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that common issues will predominate over individual issues under Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Relevant matters for consideration include class members' interests in individually litigating their claims; the extent and nature of competing litigation; the desirability of concentrating the litigation in the particular forum; and the likely difficulties of managing a class action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3737603\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/482/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the case must be one \"in which a class action would achieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\"\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p623\">\n    521 U.S. at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p623\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) advisory committee note to 1966 Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In challenging superiority, defendant once again largely rehashes its arguments concerning commonality and predominance. Accordingly, the court's response is much the same. While determining damages may well require separate trials (or at least individualized proof), the Seventh Circuit has already ruled that the need for separate damages trials does not preclude a finding of superiority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340342\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/360/#p378\">\n    800 F.3d at 379-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the class prevails in demonstrating that PNC had an unofficial policy or practice that required employees class-wide to work off-the-clock overtime hours, scores of separate trials might be necessary to determine which class members were actually adversely affected by the policy and if they were, what loss each class member sustained. At least it will not be necessary in each of those trials to determine whether PNC had an illegal policy of denying pay for off-the-clock work.\"). In fact, a single, class trial on whether an unofficial, unlawful policy existed is superior in terms of efficiency to requiring multiple individual actions seeking resolution of the same liability question or, at minimum, a determination of the preclusive nature, if any, on the determination of liability against the defendant in each individual lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant also argues that a class action is not superior because the \"potential damages to plaintiffs is not too small to make individual actions economically impracticable.\" (Def.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 78) 34.) As mentioned, this may not be true for some, if not many, of the class members. Regardless, the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that enough money may be at stake to motivate most individual claimants, however, does not undermine a finding of superiority, especially given that litigation costs may outweigh individual damages for many class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

Not surprisingly, defendant's arguments for decertifying the FLSA collective action are largely the same arguments raised in opposition to Rule 23 class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Specifically, defendant seeks decertification based on its argument that individual issues predominate over common issues or, relatedly, that the named plaintiffs' claims are not typical of other employees' claims (because there is no typical claim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the court already rejected those arguments, it finds no basis for decertifying the FLSA collective action based on overlapping charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition, defendant also challenges the collective action on the basis that only 11 individuals opted in. While the number of class members is pertinent to class certification under Rule 23, defendant does not direct the court to any FLSA opinion requiring a threshold number to maintain a collective action. To the contrary, this court has declined to decertify a collective action where only eight employees opted in.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bitner v.
