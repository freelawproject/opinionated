Plaintiffs Faisal Bin Ali Jaber, a citizen of Yemen, and Edward Pilkington, a member of the news media, submitted the requests at issue in this case to various components of the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Department of the Treasury. Before this court are the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and the Plaintiffs' cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Because each Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated the appropriateness of its\n  <em>\n   Glomar\n  </em>\n  response and the adequacy of its search for responsive records not implicated by that response, the Defendants' motion for summary judgment will be granted and the Plaintiffs' cross-motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But the fact that an agency described harms that would follow both from confirming and from denying a fact does not prove that it was required to do so. Thus, Plaintiffs' proposed rule is not supported by the authority on which they rely. Moreover, Plaintiffs' proposed rule would require disclosure of FOIA-exempt material in at least some cases: In any case in which requested information exists, the existence of the information is classified, and no harm would be caused by stating that the information does not exist, Plaintiffs' rule would require the Government to disclose the classified fact that the information exists-even though FOIA does not require this.

Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 20 (citing Mason Decl. at \u00b6 5). In light of Treasury's additional searches for all responsive material not covered by the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response, this argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiffs also argue that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the statement in Treasury's Reply Brief that \"Treasury mistakenly believed that it initially conducted an adequate search for responsive records, the existence or non-existence of which would not tend to reveal classified or statutorily-protected information\" and the statement in Treasury's affidavit that \"Treasury did not originally believe that it needed to assert a\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    response because it mistakenly believed that no offices within the Department would possess records responsive to any of the categories of document sought by Plaintiffs in their FOIA request.\" Pls.' Sur-Reply to Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 14-15. However, these statements are reconcilable. The first statement alleges that Treasury believed that confirming the existence or non-existence of responsive records would not tend to reveal classified or statutorily protected information. The second statement provides the reason: Treasury believed that it would not have responsive records regardless of whether the United States was involved in the alleged drone strike.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'
