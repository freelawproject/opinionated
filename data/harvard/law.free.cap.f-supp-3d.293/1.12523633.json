Therefore, the plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint, which challenges the 2014 Integrated Report, now suffers from the same mootness problem as its original Complaint did.

The Court does not fault the plaintiffs for waiting until after the Court ruled on the EPA's motion to dismiss to file its motion for leave to file an amended complaint for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs had \"request[ed] 'an opportunity to amend their Complaint' if the Court f[ound] that their claims [we]re moot,\" but the Court denied that conditional request because the plaintiffs had failed to comply with the law of this Circuit requiring that the proposed amended complaint be submitted with the motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Water Balt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264154\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/174/#p183\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   183 n.8, 2017 WL, at *7 n.8. Therefore, the plaintiffs had attempted, albeit deficiently, to amend their Complaint to address the mootness issue if necessary, and the EPA was on notice of that attempt. Moreover, although the Court disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that their challenges to the 2012 Integrated Report were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   moot, the plaintiffs' expectation that the Court would agree with their position was reasonable, given that two other federal district courts had ruled that challenges to the biennial Integrated Reports satisfy the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception to mootness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264154\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/174/#p183\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264154\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/174/#p183\">\n    at 181-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.
