Laws 1909, ch. 31 (the \"NYLL\"), against Defendants Astra Home Care, Inc. d/b/a True Care Home Health Care (\"Astra\"), Michael Werzberger, Rebecca Rosenzweig, and several John Does (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The gravamen of Plaintiff's complaint is that she often worked 24-hour shifts as a home health care aide without receiving breaks for sleep or meals and, further, that Defendants improperly counted each 24-hour period as a single shift (without regard to the number of hours actually worked), for which Plaintiff was paid a flat fee. Plaintiff also alleges, more broadly, that she was not given overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek; that she did not receive the requisite minimum wage; and that Defendants did not comply with New York's \"spread of hours\" requirement, the New York Wage Parity Act (the \"WPA\"), or the New York Wage Theft Prevention Act (the \"WTPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff now moves for conditional certification of a collective action under \u00a7 216(b) of the FLSA for her overtime and minimum wage claims. Plaintiff also moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 to certify several classes under the NYLL. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion for conditional certification, but denies without prejudice Plaintiff's motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Employment at Astra\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was a home health care aide (\"aide\") employed by Astra from June 19,\n   2014, to January 31, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 20). Plaintiff alleges that she was \"not paid full regular wages for all of her hours worked[,] was not paid overtime wages for all of her hours worked over [40] in a workweek ..., and was not paid an extra hour of pay for all her hours worked over a spread of 10 hours per day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Typically, Plaintiff worked\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   24 hour shifts staying overnight at the client's house, and on these days was only paid for 13 hours generally at the rate of $10.93 per hour equal to $142.09 or at the rate of $15 per hour equal to $195, despite the fact that her sleep was regularly interrupted at least 3-4 times by the client throughout the night, causing [Plaintiff] not to get 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep[,]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   and despite the fact that Plaintiff often \"did not receive a meal break and generally ate while working.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 35). The Complaint recounts Plaintiff's experiences with several clients who would wake her throughout the night to request assistance and would prevent her from taking continuous sleep breaks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-30). Plaintiff states that she \"generally worked 4-6 24 hour shifts per week.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). Plaintiff describes herself as a \"home health aide/maid\" and makes a variety of allegations about performing household work, such as \"dusting, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom ... mopping the kitchen floors, scrubbing the kitchen counters, cleaning the pots and pans, loading/unloading the dishwasher, feeding and taking care of cats, and taking out the garbage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Collective Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In support of her collective claims, Plaintiff submitted a declaration that largely tracks the allegations made in her Complaint regarding her own experiences while employed by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Decl.). When speaking about other aides, however, Plaintiff often speaks in conclusory terms-asserting, for example, that Defendants employ at least 40 other home health aides who were similarly not paid overtime and only compensated for 13 hours of their 24-hour shifts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30). Plaintiff identifies in her declaration one other aide, Matilda, who also claims that she was only paid 13 hours for a 24-hour shift when she did not receive five hours of uninterrupted sleep time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). Matilda is further alleged to have told Plaintiff that she (Matilda) was not paid any premium for working more than 40 hours per week and did not receive WPA wages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During her deposition, Plaintiff identified two other aides with whom she had spoken about their experiences. (Dkt. # 37-4 (\"Pl. Dep.\") ).\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff spoke to an aide named Katy during \"in-service training,\" who told Plaintiff that she had only been paid for 13 hours of a 24-hour overnight shift in which she had not been able to get five uninterrupted hours of sleep. (Pl. Dep. 322:13-323:7).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff mentioned that she spoke to an aide named Maranga. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 402:6-10). The excerpts of the deposition provided to the Court do not include the substance of Plaintiff's discussions with Maranga, and the Court is thus unable to find that Plaintiff is similarly situated to her. Even crediting\n   the additional statements Plaintiff made during her deposition, the Court finds that this evidence is not, on its own, enough to sustain Plaintiff's collective claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   More persuasive is the documentary payroll evidence Plaintiff obtained during discovery and submitted with her attorney's supporting declaration. Plaintiff's pay stubs reflect several categories of compensation: (i) Astra InService, (ii) live in, (iii) regular, (iv) overtime, (v) holiday, and (vi) vacation. (Rand Decl., Ex. A). Several of her pay stubs list only \"live in\" compensation; on these pay stubs, the \"hours\" column reflects between four and six \"hours\" of work compensated at a flat rate of $142.09 per \"hour\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); the Court understands from the oral argument in this matter that the references to \"hours\" in the live-in payment context are payroll record idiosyncrasies that were fixed sometime in late 2015 or early 2016, and that the $142.09 figure is in fact payment for a 13-hour shift. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 42 (\"Oral Arg. Tr.\") 8:7-17, 20:14-18, 28:23-29:4). Certain other pay stubs reflect multiple forms of compensation. For example, from September 6-12, 2014, Plaintiff worked 40 hours of \"regular\" time (compensated at $15 per hour), eight hours of \"overtime\" (compensated at $22.50 per hour), and two \"hours\" of \"live in\" time (which, again, the Court understands to reflect two shifts compensated at $195.00 per shift). (Rand Decl., Ex. A). Plaintiff submitted payroll documents for 10 other aides. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B-K). Each set of pay stubs reveals instances of aides working live-in shifts for no more than seven \"hours\" per week for which they were compensated a flat fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Several were compensated at the same rate as Plaintiffs-$142.09 per shift. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rand Decl. Ex. B, D, E, F, I).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed this suit on August 29, 2016 (Dkt. # 1), and Defendants filed their Answer on October 7, 2016 (Dkt. # 13). On January 11, 2017, the Court granted in part Plaintiff's motion for discovery related to her class and collective action claims. (Dkt. # 15, 20). The Court ordered Defendants to produce \"(i) the name and contact information and (ii) the wage and hour information of two randomly selected home health aide employees for each of the six years that Plaintiff was allegedly employed by Defendants, resulting in the sampling of twelve aides.\" (Dkt. # 20). The parties completed collective and class discovery on March 30, 2017 (Dkt. # 25), and on May 2, 2017, Plaintiff moved for conditional certification of a collective action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and to certify several classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Dkt. # 26-28). Defendants filed their opposition on June 1, 2017. (Dkt. # 32). Plaintiff filed her reply brief on June 15, 2017. (Dkt. # 38). The unredacted Declaration of Ella Shillingford and Exhibits B through M of the Declaration of William C. Rand, Esq. were filed under seal, but redacted versions are on the docket at Docket Entries 34 and 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 4, 2018, the Court ordered the parties to appear for oral argument to discuss certain concerns about the record on Plaintiff's collective claims. (Dkt. # 41). The Court held oral argument on January 12, 2018, and the Court's resolution of this motion benefitted greatly from the capable\n   advocacy on both sides.

Employers are required to pay at least a minimum wage for each of the first 40 hours worked in a workweek and, for each hour over 40, must pay employees overtime \"at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which [they are] employed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 207.

As the Court indicated in its January 4, 2018 Order and at oral argument, certification of a collective action of \"all current and former ... home health aides\" is a bridge too far. (Dkt. # 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 9:7-11; 26:9-24).

Plaintiff's declaration and deposition coupled with the payroll evidence show that Plaintiff and other similarly situated aides who worked live-in shifts were victims of a common policy wherein they received pay stubs that represented each live-in shift as one hour and were not compensated adequately for these overnight shifts\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   they received bona fide sleep and meal breaks-which, Plaintiff alleges, they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Two examples are illustrative:\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's pay stub for the week of June 13-19, 2015, shows that Plaintiff was compensated for four \"hours\" (i.e., shifts) of live-in time at a rate of $142.09 per shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Rand Decl., Ex. A). Assuming Plaintiff received an eight-hour sleep break and a one-hour break for each meal of the day, Astra would be entitled under the FLSA to deduct 11 hours from each of Plaintiff's four 24-hour shifts, leaving a total of 52 compensable hours for these four shifts combined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.22\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's pay stub indicates that her pay rate is $10.00. (Rand Decl., Ex. A). Assuming she would be paid $10.00 per hour for each of the first 40 hours worked that week, and $15.00 per hour for each of the 12 hours worked that week over 40 hours, Plaintiff would be entitled to receive $580 in gross pay for the week, but she was only paid $568.36. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the pay stub for aide E.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the pay period ending on May 22, 2015, shows that E.C. was similarly compensated for six \"hours\" (i.e., shifts) of live-in time at a rate of $142.09 per shift. (Rand Decl., Ex. I). As was the case with Plaintiff, Astra would be entitled to deduct 11 hours per shift, assuming that E.C. received sleep and meal breaks. On that assumption (and assuming further that she similarly earned a base rate of $10 per hour), she would have been entitled to $970.00 gross pay for the week, but she was only paid $852.54. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). E.C.'s pay stubs show that she, too, often worked live-in shifts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These two examples speak to the existence of a common policy of underpaying overtime\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   aides received the bona fide breaks needed to entitle Defendants to deduct sleep and meal time from the aides' count of compensable hours. These records, coupled with the allegations in Plaintiff's declaration and deposition that she and other aides were routinely unable to take breaks for meals and did not receive five uninterrupted hours of sleep as required by the FLSA, demonstrate the existence of a common policy sufficient to satisfy the \"low standard of proof\" needed to conditionally certify a collective action.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795933\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/537/#p555\">\n    624 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   555 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez de Carrasco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206403521\">\n    2017 WL 6403521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (certifying an FLSA collective action of home health care aides not properly compensated for live-in shifts);\n   <em>\n    Hypolite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273585\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/485/#p489\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   What the payroll records also show, however, is that Astra's aides had a variety of different work schedule arrangements. While Plaintiff spent the majority of her time working at Astra in live-in 24-hour shifts, it is clear that there are aides who did not work live-in shifts at all or for whom these shifts were a small portion of their working time. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Rand Decl., Ex. A-C,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Rand Decl., Ex. G-H). Moreover, the Court learned at oral argument that about 85% of aides employed by Astra work no live-in shifts. (Oral Arg. Tr. 22:19-24:4). Because Plaintiff's claim centers on the compensation for her overnight shifts, the Court cannot find that she has shown that she is similarly situated to aides who did not also spend the majority of their time in live-in shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206375793\">\n    2017 WL 6375793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (certifying a collective action, limited to only those employees with similar responsibilities to the plaintiff);\n   <em>\n    Galindo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Cty.

Thus, the Court will limit the collective action to aides who worked live-in shifts during 50% or more of the weeks that they were on Astra's payroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants' arguments against conditional certification are not persuasive. Defendants do not address the fact that the records demonstrate a failure to pay overtime even if Astra properly deducted all bona fide break periods. Rather, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has \"failed to establish that she never received her 'bona fide sleep/meal periods' \"-that the record and logic belie her claim that she never received any breaks during any of her 24-hour shifts. (Def. Opp. 13-14). Defendants overstate matters. Plaintiff alleges that her sleep was \"regularly interrupted generally at least 3-4 times by the client throughout the night\" and that she \"generally ate while working.\" (Pl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 14). She does not claim that she never received a break to sleep or eat. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ; Pl. Dep. 197:17-20, 213:8-25, 235:24-236:15). Defendants next argue that Plaintiff did not work more than 40 hours per workweek as of late 2015; that she was thus was not entitled to overtime pay; and that she is therefore not similarly situated to those who are. (Def. Opp. 14). But this point does little to undercut Plaintiff's evidence showing that she was, at least for a time, entitled to overtime pay and is similarly situated to other aides who were denied overtime for live-in shifts and were thus victims of a common policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that \"Plaintiff could not provide a single relevant factual detail as to her purported conversations with other [a]ides which would corroborate her allegations,\" and that the Court should deny the motion given this \"startling lack of detail.\" (Def. Opp. 15-16). Again, Defendants' dramatic language falls short. Plaintiff's burden at this stage is minimal, and she has met it for the reasons set forth above.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205211839\">\n    2013 WL 5211839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"The purpose of this first stage is merely to determine\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   similarly situated plaintiffs do in fact exist.\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) ). Because the Court is persuaded that Plaintiff has met her modest burden on conditional certification, the Court conditionally certifies a collective action of home health care aides who (i) worked for Astra from January 1, 2015, to present, (ii) worked live-in shifts in 50% or more of the weeks that they were on Astra's payroll, and (iii) were not paid adequate overtime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    c. FLSA Minimum Wage Collective\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff has also shown a common policy or plan that violated the FLSA minimum wage provision sufficient to warrant conditional certification.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795933\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/537/#p555\">\n    624 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff seeks certification for \"all current and former employees of Defendants who are or were formerly employed by Defendants as home health aides ... who were non-exempt employees within the meaning of the FLSA, [and] who were not paid minimum wages.\" (Dkt. # 27-1). To be clear, Plaintiff's submissions in support of her motion do little to support her minimum wage claim under the FLSA. Plaintiff's brief makes no more than a passing reference to her minimum wage claims, choosing instead to devote much of its substance to her overtime claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. 8-9). And her declaration makes but one cursory reference to her FLSA minimum wage claims. (Pl. Decl. \u00b6 15). The payroll records do not evidence a violation of the FLSA minimum wage provision. In the time period at issue (January 1, 2015, to present), the federal minimum wage was $7.25 per hour.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C). Take, for example, Plaintiff's pay stub for the week of June 13-19, 2015. (Rand Decl., Ex. A). Plaintiff worked four live-in shifts and was paid $142.09 per shift, or an average of $10.93 per hour (assuming she worked only 13 compensable hours), thus reflecting that her hourly compensation was well above the federal minimum wage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But at oral argument, Plaintiff's counsel encouraged the Court to credit Plaintiff's allegations that she rarely received meal breaks or five uninterrupted hours of sleep such that Astra would have to compensate her for the full 24 hours, and argued further that the Court would then find that Plaintiff was paid, on average, $5.92 per hour and did not receive a minimum wage. (Oral Arg. Tr. 36:23-37:13). The Court does credit this allegation as to Plaintiff herself and as to the aide who told Plaintiff that she, too, did not receive five uninterrupted hours of sleep. If Plaintiff and the opt-in plaintiffs did not receive five uninterrupted hours of sleep, Astra would be obligated by federal regulation to count all eight hours of their unattained sleep break as compensable time.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.22\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Returning to the prior example, Plaintiff would be entitled to compensation for 21 hours, and her average pay would drop to $6.77 per hour-below the federal minimum wage. While the Court expressed skepticism about the strength of the record based on Plaintiff's declaration and deposition alone (i.e., absent documentary support), it finds that Plaintiff has just cleared the hurdle of showing that she and other aides who worked live-in shifts were victims of a common policy that violated the minimum wage provision of the FLSA. Accordingly, the Court conditionally certifies a collective action of home health care aides who (i) worked for Astra from January 1, 2015, to the present, (ii) worked live-in shifts during 50% or more of the weeks that they were on Astra's payroll, and (iii) were not paid a minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification Under Rule 23\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff moves to certify five classes under the NYLL, consisting of \"all current and former employees of Defendants [ ] who are or were employed by Defendants as home health aides,\" who were not paid (i) minimum wages; (ii) overtime compensation at a rate of at least one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per workweek; (iii) minimum wages under the WPA; (iv) a \"spread of hours\" premium; and (v) who were not given proper notices under the WTPA. (Dkt. # 27-1). As discussed at oral argument, there is scant record evidence as to the latter three proposed classes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. 9:7-20),\n   and certainly not enough to meet the requirements of Rule 23. Plaintiff's motions to certify classes of employees who were allegedly not paid proper WPA wages, spread of hours wages, or who were not given proper notice under the WTPA are all denied without prejudice. The Court will consider, however, Plaintiff's motions to certify classes of aides who were not paid overtime wages or minimum wages as required under the NYLL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Before delving into the Rule 23 requirements for class certification, the Court must address a very recent and unsettled development in the NYLL that has unfolded since this motion was filed. There has emerged a split between state and federal courts in New York on the question of whether the NYLL incorporates the FLSA's treatment of bona fide sleep and meal breaks as non-compensable time. NYLL \u00a7 652 imposes a minimum wage. As of December 31, 2017, every large employer-defined as an employer with 11 or more employees-must pay a minimum wage of $13 per hour \"for each hour worked in the city of New York.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20652\">\n    N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a)(i). The regulation implementing the minimum wage law provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The minimum wage shall be paid for the time an employee is permitted to work, or is required to be available for work at a place prescribed by the employer[.] ... However, a residential employee-one who lives on the premises of the employer-shall not be deemed to be permitted to work or required to be available for work: (1) during his or her normal sleeping hours solely because he is required to be on call during such hours; or (2) at any other time when he or she is free to leave the place of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 142-2.1(b). New York regulations also require that employees be paid overtime, though the quantum of overtime due depends on whether the employee is covered by the FLSA: Those who are so covered must receive overtime pay at the rate of one and one-half times their regular rate of pay while employees who are exempt from the FLSA need only receive overtime at the rate of one and one-half times the minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 142-2.2.

In\n   <em>\n    Lai Chan\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court, New York County, reasoned that the home health aide plaintiffs did not live in the homes of their employers, and were thus not covered by the NYDOL's guidance that addressed only residential employees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069530\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/50/201/\">\n    21 N.Y.S.3d at 827-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As pointed out by plaintiffs, they allegedly maintain their own residences and do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   live in the home of defendant.\").

Judge Ross reaffirmed her holding that the NYDOL's 2010 letter was entitled to deference and held that the NYDOL was reasonable in its decision to treat home health aides as \"live-in\" employees for whom their employer could deduct sleep and meal breaks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. In\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez de Carrasco\n   </em>\n   , Judge Forrest echoed Judge Ross's reasoning and similarly held that the NYDOL's letter was entitled to deference.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206403521\">\n    2017 WL 6403521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Judge Forrest's reasoning was bolstered, additionally, by an emergency regulation promulgated by the NYDOL on October 6, 2017, apparently in response to the spate of state cases disregarding its 2010 guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-7. The NYDOL amended the minimum wage regulation to add:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, this subdivision shall not be construed to require that the minimum wage be paid for meal periods and sleep times that are excluded from hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, in accordance with sections 785.19 and 785.22 of 29 C.F.R. for a home care aide who works a shift of 24 hours or more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   12 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 142-2.1(b). The NYDOL explained that the amendment was \"necessary to preserve the status quo, prevent the collapse of the home care industry, and avoid institutionalizing patients who would be cared for at home, in the face of recent decisions by the State Appellate Divisions[.]\" 10/25/17 N.Y. St. Reg. LAB-43-17-00002-E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court discussed the relevant state and federal cases with the parties at oral argument. Plaintiff argued that the split between state and federal courts on the issue of compensable hours under the NYLL encouraged forum-shopping, and that federal courts had improperly set aside state decisional law in favor of their own reasoning. (Oral Arg. Tr. 3:24-4:24). Defendants, on the other hand, argued that the state cases were wrongly decided and that the federal courts had correctly deferred to the NYDOL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:25-16:12). Plaintiff agreed, however, that the NYDOL emergency regulation supplanted the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Tokhtaman\n   </em>\n   and that, as of October 6, 2017, Astra could properly deduct sleep and meal breaks from the count of compensable hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:3-14, 4:25-5:14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court is left to consider whether, prior to October 6, 2017, Astra could properly deduct 11 hours of break time under the NYLL from the time worked in a 24-hour shift.

Plaintiff's motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for certification of classes for (i) minimum wage violations under the NYLL; (ii) overtime pay violations under the NYLL; (iii) \"spread of hours\" under the NYLL; (iv) violations of the WTPA; and (v) minimum wage under the WPA are all DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. This case will proceed to discovery on Plaintiff's collective FLSA claims, and if in the course of that discovery Plaintiff can compile a more robust record on which this Court can find that Defendants' liability can be established without an individualized inquiry into the working conditions of each aide, Plaintiff may renew the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties are ORDERED to meet and confer within 10 days of the date of this Opinion and to submit within 14 days of the date of this Opinion a proposed notice to the potential opt-in collective action members for the Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    This Opinion draws from the Complaint (\"Compl.\" (Dkt. # 1) ), and the exhibits to the Declarations of William C. Rand, Esq. (\"Rand Decl.\" (Dkt. # 35 (redacted) ) ) and Ella Shillingford (\"Pl. Decl.\" (Dkt. # 34 (redacted) ) ). At this stage of the litigation, the Court looks primarily to Plaintiff's account of the facts because of her modest burden on a \u00a7 216(b) motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Myers\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hertz Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795933\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/537/#p555\">\n     624 F.3d 537\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 555 (2d Cir. 2010) (describing the \"modest factual showing\" needed for a motion for conditional certification). Where Defendants offer contrary facts as to whether Plaintiff is similarly situated to potential opt-in plaintiffs, the Court has noted Defendants' position, but \"will grant the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt given the posture of this motion.\"\n    <em>\n     Mendoza\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ashiya Sushi 5, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 12 Civ. 8629 (KPF),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205211839\">\n     2013 WL 5211839\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Thus, to the extent needed, the Court also looks to the exhibits attached to the Declarations of Yehuda Schneider (\"Schneider Decl.\" (Dkt. # 36) ) and Christopher P. Hampton, Esq. (\"Hampton Decl.\" (Dkt. # 37) ). For convenience, the Court refers to Plaintiff's opening brief as \"Pl. Br.\" (Dkt. # 28); to Defendants' opposition brief as \"Def. Opp.\" (Dkt. # 32); and to Plaintiff's reply brief as \"Pl. Reply\" (Dkt. # 38).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The pay stubs for the comparators appear in a different format than Plaintiff's and contain different compensation designations. In his deposition, Yehuda Schneider, Astra's director of payroll, confirmed that the code \"AUNIT\" denotes a live-in shift, \"AOT\" is overtime pay, and \"REG\" is regular (non-overtime) pay.

The Court's review of Astra's payroll records reveals that, beginning in late 2015 or early 2016, Astra changed the way it recorded live-in shifts on pay stubs. Plaintiff noted as much at oral argument. (Oral Arg. Tr. 7:1-13). From that time period forward, Astra appears to have counted each live-in shift as a set of 13 hours, rather than a single hour. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Rand Decl., Ex. E). At oral argument before the Court, Defendants' counsel argued that the payroll records \"refute\" Plaintiff's allegations because these records show that Astra's employees were paid the proper rates of overtime pay. (Oral Arg. Tr. 17:5-15). Yehuda Schneider, Astra's director of payroll, stated during his deposition that beginning in the latter part of 2015, Astra began to pay overtime to aides who performed live-in shifts. (Schneider Dep. 66:14-68:21). Defendants did not brief this issue, however, and the Court is reluctant to delve too deeply into the merits, which are not ripe for resolution. More to the point, the Court is not persuaded that this evidence is sufficient to warrant cutting off the collective action period on a particular date.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hypolite\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Health Care Servs. of N.Y.

It is not clear exactly when or how Astra's policy changed, and thus the Court is persuaded-at least for purposes of the instant motion-that Plaintiff has shown a common policy of underpaying overtime for live-in shifts during the time period January 1, 2015, to the present.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The colloquy at oral argument referred to October 25, 2017.
