(\"Porters\") against Defendant Scott Laderoute (\"Laderourte\") in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, Case No. 16-cf-6055 (\"the underlying suit\"). The underlying suit alleges Laderoute conspired with several of Porters' employees to steal proprietary information from Porters, and then used the information to solicit business for Laderoute's business, Sprint Lumber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Nationwide Affinity Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\") provided Laderoute's home owner's insurance during the relevant time. Nationwide provided a defense in the underlying suit to Laderoute\n   under a reservation of rights. It filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration that Laderoute is not entitled to coverage or indemnification in the underlying suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Now before the Court is Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 10). The Court GRANTS the motion because the \"business pursuits\" exclusion in Nationwide's policy denies coverage, and Laderoute's proffered affirmative defenses fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A moving party is entitled to summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The Amended Petition was very similar to the initial Petition, but brought one less count.

It also claimed damages of lost revenue, cost to replace and recover destroyed data, lost good-will, and damaged customer relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 8, 2017, Nationwide filed this declaratory judgment action. On March 3, 2017, Laderoute filed his answer and a counterclaim alleging he is entitled to coverage under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Policy is organized into different parts, with no index or table of contents.

Nationwide owes no duty to defend or indemnify Laderoute because the \"business pursuits\" exclusion applies to the injuries claimed in the underlying suit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nationwide argues it is entitled to summary judgment for several reasons, the first being that the \"business pursuits\" exclusion in the Premier Homeowners endorsement denies coverage. Because the Court agrees and this argument is dispositive, the Court will not address Nationwide's other arguments in favor of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The \"business pursuits\" exclusion applies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The underlying suit asserts a variety of economic and business tort claims. It seeks damages for lost revenue, cost to replace and recover destroyed data, lost good-will, and damaged customer relationships. These damages are plainly injuries arising out of Laderoute's business pursuits with\n   Sprint Lumber, hence they are excluded under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Policy is not ambiguous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Laderoute does not deny this exclusion exists; rather, he claims it is inconsistent with the clause preceding it, that is, the clause that reads \"SECTION II-EXCLUSIONS in paragraphs E., F., and G. do not apply to 'personal injury'.\" Laderoute argues the policy is ambiguous because it grants coverage in one place and then takes it away in another. Laderoute also contends the endorsement uses the phrase \"deleted and replaced by\" in a confusing way and adds to the Policy's ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Under Missouri law, an insurance contract is ambiguous \"when there is duplicity, indistinctness, or uncertainty in the meaning of the language in the policy. Language is ambiguous if it is reasonably open to different constructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Owners Ins. Co. v.

Granted, the Policy could be written more clearly and organized in a way that is easier to follow, but it is still clear that the Premier Homeowners Endorsement changes the Policy by excluding personal liability coverage for acts taken while running a business such as the Sprint Lumber company. The Policy is not ambiguous; it cannot be reasonably read as extending personal liability coverage to business torts committed by Laderoute with the Sprint Lumber company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Nationwide did not waive this coverage defense.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Laderoute also claims that Nationwide is not entitled to summary judgment because it waived any coverage defenses. Laderoute suggests that whether a party's conduct can be construed as a waiver is question of fact. He contends the reservation of rights letter Nationwide sent him does not qualify as a reservation of rights letter under Missouri law because it did not clearly and unambiguously explain how the allegations in the initial Petition created coverage issues. Alternately, even if it was a valid reservation of rights letter, Nationwide waived any coverage defenses by not sending another reservation of rights letter after Porter filed the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   These arguments are unavailing. As a threshold matter, a court may decide as a matter of law that a defense of waiver is not applicable, and so enter summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

Allan D. Windt,\n   <em>\n    Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies and Insureds\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.14 (5th ed. 2011). If the insurer decides to defend the insured subject to a reservation of rights, the insured may elect to allow the insurer to defend him, or he may refuse to allow a defense under a reservation of rights, instead retaining his own attorney to defend himself and perhaps sue the insurer later.\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

In particular, it clearly and unambiguously explains how the allegations in the underlying suit create coverage issues. It identifies the relevant Policy provisions, recounts the allegations in the underlying suit implicating these provisions, links these provision to the allegations with sufficient detail, and then states a clear conclusion. It states: \"[T]he policy excludes from coverage any damages which arise out of or in connection with a 'business' ... [I]t appears that all of the damages either arise out of or in connection with Sprint Lumber, which is owned by Mr. Laderoute. Accordingly, this exclusion bars coverage for such damages.\" This was sufficient to make a valid\n   reservation of rights of the \"business pursuits\" exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Nationwide did not have to send a second reservation of rights letter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, Laderoute contends that by initially providing him with a defense under a reservation of rights, continuing that defense after Porters filed the Amended Petition without sending another reservation of rights letter, and then not filing this declaratory judgment action until February 8, 2017, a question of fact has somehow arisen concerning whether Nationwide impliedly waived its right to coverage defenses which prevents the entry of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   This argument is without merit. As the nonmoving party, Laderoute may resist summary judgment by asserting an affirmative defense such as waiver, but he must support it with specific facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hiland Partners GP Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187436\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/594/#p601\">\n    847 F.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App. 2015). And if a waiver is alleged to be\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   from a party's conduct, \"the conduct must clearly and unequivocally show a purpose to relinquish the right.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The Court does not see how the facts identified above-providing a defense under a reservation of rights, continuing that defense after an amended petition is filed without sending an additional reservation of rights letter, and then filing a declaratory judgment action-support an inference that Nationwide impliedly waived its coverage defenses. Laderoute has not identified any analogous cases suggesting that it does,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor can the Court find any. Consequently, the Court holds Laderoute has not identified facts capable of supporting an implied waiver affirmative defense, and Nationwide is entitled to summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Nationwide's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 10) is GRANTED.
