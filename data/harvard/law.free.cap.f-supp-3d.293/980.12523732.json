The CPUC orders set up a procurement program called \"Re-MAT\" (short for \"Renewable Market-Adjusting Tariff\"), and regulate the terms on which utility companies like the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (\"PG &amp; E\") must purchase power from alternative energy power production facilities like small wind farms and solar projects. Winding Creek intends to build such a solar project in Lodi, California, and it seeks a long-term contract to sell the energy from the proposed facility to PG &amp; E. It sued because it believes the CPUC orders in dispute prevented it from getting a contract entitlement under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (\"PURPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This order brings to a close a case that has been fought hard over a number of years. After three rounds of motions to dismiss, the parties filed cross-requests for summary judgment which were heavily briefed and included submission of an amicus brief from PG &amp; E and other third-party utility companies. Disputes over material facts compelled the Court to hold a one-day bench trial. Both sides presented witnesses and expert testimony, and filed substantial post-trial briefs. The Court makes these findings of fact and conclusions of law, and grants summary judgment in favor of Winding Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To frame the rather technical dispute between the parties, the Court summarizes the statutory context set out in a prior order. Dkt. No. 60. Under the Federal Power Act (\"FPA\"), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a et seq., the interstate commerce of electric energy at wholesale is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"). In 1978, Congress enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (\"PURPA\"), which amended the FPA. PURPA was enacted to encourage the development of renewable sources of energy, and \"thus to reduce American dependence on fossil fuels by promoting increased energy efficiency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Indep. Energy Producers Ass'n, Inc. v. Cal. Pub. Util. Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527770\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/848/#p850\">\n    36 F.3d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (9th Cir. 1994). To that end, PURPA directs FERC to prescribe \"such rules as it determines necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production,\" including rules that require electric utilities to offer to \"purchase electric energy from [qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities].\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a). The Court found in a prior order that plaintiff Winding Creek's proposed Lodi facility is a \"qualifying small power production facility\" under PURPA. Dkt. No. 75 at 9. PURPA requires State regulatory authorities such as CPUC to implement the rules prescribed by FERC. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The outcome of this case turns on three key requirements under PURPA and its implementing FERC regulations. The first is what the parties have referred to as the \"must-take obligation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 152 (Trial Tr.) at 127:8-128:9, which is industry short-hand for the proposition that PURPA requires FERC to encourage small power production with rules that \"require electric utilities to offer to ... purchase electric energy from [qualifying] facilities.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a). FERC's implementing regulations state that \"[e]ach electric utility shall purchase ... any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility ... [d]irectly to the electric utility.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.303\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). A few exceptions exist for this mandatory purchase obligation, but the parties agree that they do not apply here. Trial Tr. at 130:14-131:7 (CPUC witness Michael Colvin testifying that \"the must-take obligation for 20 megawatts and under remains\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The second and third legal requirements that are critical to this case have to do with pricing. PURPA and FERC's regulations not only mandate that electric utilities must purchase energy and capacity from qualifying facilities, they also set certain required terms for those purchases. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), utilities must purchase energy and capacity from qualifying facilities at a rate that \"equals the avoided costs\" of the utility. Under the regulations, \"avoided costs\" means \"the incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or qualifying facilities, such utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The regulations also require that qualifying facilities be given a choice in the pricing of the energy sales to the utilities.

Dkt. Nos. 39, 60, 75. The operative complaint is plaintiff's second amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. Dkt. No. 61. Plaintiff is Winding Creek Solar LLC, an owner and developer of solar projects, and Allco Finance Limited is its only member.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    \u00b6 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. No. 61 \u00b6 6. As Winding Creek alleges, these orders set the terms on which California's investor-owned utilities such as PG &amp; E must enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts with qualifying facilities such as Winding Creek's Lodi facility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nos. 89, 90) following the Court's third motion to dismiss order, which granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss without further leave to amend. Dkt. No. 75. Tracking its complaint, Winding Creek sought summary judgment on the grounds that the Re-MAT Program violates PURPA because (i) it caps the amount of electricity that utilities must purchase from qualifying facilities, and (ii) the rate offered under the program is not based on the utilities' avoided costs. Dkt. No. 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants sought summary judgment in their favor on the same issues, but in doing so, they relied heavily on a different CPUC procurement program: the \"mandatory Standard Contract that California utilities must offer smaller QFs of 20 MW or less generation capacity under PURPA.\" Dkt. No. 90 at 1. Defendants argued that the Re-MAT program's caps did not violate the utilities' purchase obligation under PURPA because \"the Standard Contract is available to Winding Creek.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants also argued that Re-MAT pricing is properly based on utilities' avoided cost rates, and that the Standard Contract satisfies the pricing requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    at 17-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants argued that because the Standard Contract fully satisfies PURPA, the CPUC was free to have alternative programs like Re-MAT even if those additional programs may not be PURPA-compliant. Dkt. No. 105 at 15:5-19. The parties' disagreement\n   has now crystallized around the compliance of the Re-MAT Program and the Standard Contract with PURPA and implementing regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Needless to say, this dispute takes place in a complex regulatory context. While the dispositive facts turned out to be relatively straightforward, the parties had a marked tendency to resort to industry jargon and inside-baseball arguments in ways that sometimes obscured the basic issues. Consequently, after the summary judgment motion hearing, the Court invited and received an amicus brief jointly filed by PG &amp; E, Southern California Edison Company and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company, to which both plaintiff and defendants filed responses. Dkt. Nos. 109, 110, 112. Even then, the Court determined that summary judgment could not be resolved on the papers and held a one-day bench trial on the question of \"whether the CPUC's standard contract complies with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).\" Dkt.

After every two-month program period, the Re-MAT price can be adjusted in $4/MWh increments (up to $12/MWh) up or down based on the outcome and price adjustments of the previous program period. The price is designed to respond to changes in generator interest and costs to construct and operate generation facilities, which are understood to be \"market supply signals.\" If there is decreased generator interest in accepting the offer price, the price is adjusted upward to encourage more generators to enter the market; conversely, when more generators are willing to sell at the offer price, the Re-MAT price is adjusted downwards so that ratepayers can benefit from what appear to be increased supply and falling prices. Dkt. No. 130 \u00b6\u00b6 40-42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

If at least five unaffiliated projects are in the utility's product category queue and the total capacity of the price-accepting project applicants is &lt; 20% of the capacity allocation in that period, then the price is adjusted upward by $4/MWh. If at least five unaffiliated projects are in the utility's product category queue and the total capacity of the price-accepting project applicants is = 100% of the capacity allocation in that period, then the Re-MAT price is adjusted downward. If the two conditions for either increasing or decreasing the price do not exist, then the price stays the same for the next program period. Dkt.

The size of the price adjustment (between $4/MWh to $12/MWh) depends on the number of consecutive program periods for which the increase or decrease conditions have been met, and whether or not a contract has been executed in the prior period. Dkt. No. 130 \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   10. There was no reasoned basis for CPUC's choice of increments in multiples of $4 for these price adjustments as opposed\n   to any other number; the size of these price adjustments was arbitrary.

The CPUC established $89.23 as the starting price based on the most recent Renewable Auction Mechanism solicitation at the time of the Re-MAT program's adoption. $89.23/MWh was the weighted average of each of the investor-owned utilities' highest-priced executed Renewable Auction Mechanism contracts.

Re-MAT contracts are long-term contracts of 10, 15 or 20 years in duration. The price is fixed for the entire length of the contract, with an all-in (or combined) capacity, energy and renewable energy credit payment based on the offered price, which is adjusted by time-of-delivery factors based on time of year and day that the electricity is generated. Dkt. No. 130 \u00b6 32.

It is undisputed that the Re-MAT program caps the amount of energy a utility must procure through it. There is a statewide program cap of 750MW for all publicly owned utilities. Dkt.

The pricing for the Standard Contract has two components-one for capacity, for which the price is fixed, and another for energy. Trial Tr. at 22:4-23; Dkt. No. 156 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The capacity payment is essentially a payment for the amount of energy a facility could deliver at any given time, as having that energy available to it increases a utility's ability to meet an increased demand for electricity more quickly. Trial Tr. at 21:4-15. The energy payment on the other hand is for the actual energy that is delivered from the QF to the utility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:16-18. For intermittent resources like solar, it is the energy component that counts for probably 80 percent of the revenues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   23. The energy price for the Standard Contract is a formula rate for which some inputs are known, but at least three of the inputs are not known at the time the contract is signed. Trial Tr. at 22:4-23. The three market-based variable inputs are: a gas index (or burner tip gas price), a market heat rate, and a location adjustment factor. Dkt. No. 156 \u00b6 21. (The other three inputs for the formula are: variable operations and maintenance, a time of use factor, and greenhouse gas compliance costs. Dkt. No. 153 \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   24. The burner tip gas price is essentially the price for natural gas, which can vary significantly over time. Trial Tr. at 35:18-20, 27:8-25. The gas input is based on a monthly index updated on the first business day of each month, based on the last week of the previous month. Dkt. No. 156 \u00b6 21; Dkt. No. 153 \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   25. The market heat rate is a measure of the efficiency of the assumed avoided gas-fired generator. Trial Tr. at 35:7-9. The market heat rate varies monthly and its value for purposes of the formula is updated on the 5th business day of each month. Dkt. No. 153 \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   26. The third key variable is the locational difference. Trial Tr. at 28:17-19. That factor is based on locational marginal prices, and consequently does not yet exist for an unbuilt facility like the Lodi facility at issue in this case. Trial Tr. at 29:3-23. The location adjustment factor is a site-specific factor that varies to reflect the fact that the cost of energy from a particular location varies due to changes in the local energy markets. It varies monthly and is identified 30 days after generation occurs and is then applied to the prior month's payment. Dkt. No. 153 \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   27. This formula is the only way that the price of energy is calculated for a QF under the Standard Offer Contract. Trial Tr. at 34:9-15. The output of the formula can exhibit significant volatility over time. Trial Tr. at 30:9-31:21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   28. The CPUC cannot say what the output of the formula,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the energy price, will be for any given time in the future during a utility's contract period with a QF without knowing how the variables will be filled in on a month-by-month\n   basis with actual market data.

THE RE-MAT PROGRAM IS NOT COMPLIANT WITH PURPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Despite the complex regulatory and factual background here, the key legal issues turned out to be straightforward, and the scope of the parties' actual dispute quite narrow. As an initial matter, the Court concludes that the Re-MAT Program is not PURPA-compliant in at least two independent ways. Defendants implicitly recognize this non-compliance in the heavy emphasis they place on the Standard Contract Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   One area of Re-MAT's non-compliance is the program cap. It is undisputed that the CPUC imposed a 750 MW statewide cap for the program overall, which is further subdivided into a 5 MW cap for PG &amp; E for each category of QF in each Re-MAT program period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"FFCL\"),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. At the same time, it is also undisputed that PURPA and the implementing FERC regulations contain a \"must-take obligation\"-a mandatory purchase obligation on the part of utilities to buy \"any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility\"-which remains in place for facilities like the Lodi facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   p. 2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.303\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and Trial Tr. at 130:14-131:7. The plain meaning of this requirement is that utilities must buy all of the energy and capacity offered by QFs. It does not require significant legal analysis to conclude that CPUC's imposition of caps in the Re-MAT program violates the must-take obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The other area of non-compliance involves pricing. Here, too, the Court finds that the issue is straightforward. Prices generated by the Re-MAT program's reverse auction procedure do not satisfy the definition of \"avoided costs\" in FERC's regulations. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6), \"avoided costs\" means \"the incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or qualifying facilities, such utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.\" PURPA itself requires that in prescribing rules for utilities to purchase electric energy from a qualifying facility, the rates may not \"exceed[ ] the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(b). The \"incremental cost of alternative electric energy\" is in turn defined as \"the cost to the electric utility of the electric energy which, but for the purchase from [a QF], such utility would generate or purchase from another source.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In light of these definitions, it would make sense to look to a spot market price or similar indicator for electricity. It makes much less sense to use a complex auction procedure burdened with arbitrary rules, such as a randomly selected two-month time period (as opposed to any other) and price adjustments applied in $4 increments-a method that even the CPUC witness acknowledged was without a reasoned basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FFCL \u00b6\u00b6 5-10. The reverse auction procedure strays too far from basing prices on a utility's but-for cost, which the statute and regulations require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE STANDARD CONTRACT DOES NOT EXCUSE RE-MAT NON-COMPLIANCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because Winding Creek has shown the Re-MAT program's non-compliance on these two requirements, the burden shifts to defendants to demonstrate why summary judgment should not be entered for Winding Creek. They do not meet their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As defendants acknowledge, only two programs are at issue in this case: \"The CPUC has developed numerous programs that are compliant with [PURPA], but have identified only two of these programs for which WCS can qualify: the Renewable Market Adjusting Tariff (Re-MAT) program; and the Standard Contract for QFs 20 MW or Less.\" Dkt. No. 156 \u00b6 5 (citing Lee Unretained Expert Report, \u00b6\u00b6 55-59). Defendants' primary defense in this case is that the Standard Contract satisfies PURPA, and so the CPUC is free to have additional programs that are not PURPA-compliant, including a non-compliant Re-MAT Program. Dkt. No. 90. That point makes some analytical sense, and for summary judgment purposes the Court accepts it as true. But it does not save defendants because they have not shown that PURPA and its implementing FERC regulations are fully satisfied through the Standard Contract in and of itself, or even in combination with Re-MAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here is why. The text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) clearly states that, \"at the option of the qualifying facility exercised prior to the beginning of the term,\" the QF may sell energy or capacity at a rate determined by either \"(i) [t]he avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or (ii) [t]he avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred.\" Winding Creek agrees that the Standard Contract provides a rate based on an \"avoided cost.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 153 \u00b6 35 (\"The rate contained in the Standard Contract is an 'avoided cost' rate, which is defined as a cost that the utility would otherwise incur if it had to buy power from a non-QF source.\"). But the Standard Contract does not-and cannot-offer both of the pricing options that PURPA gives to QFs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The evidence against the CPUC emerges directly from the defendants' own trial testimony and post-trial submissions. At trial, Michael Colvin, a CPUC employee, expressly testified that the Standard Contract complies with both\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii). Trial Tr. at 119:21-121:15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 155 at 6. This testimony effectively acknowledged that the Standard Contract does not offer the legally required price option choice to QFs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 121:10-15 (Q: \"So in your mind, in your view, there is no meaningful difference between (d)(2)(i) and (d)(2)(ii) in the way that the price paid to the QF would be calculated, is that right?\" A: \"Correct. For purposes of this contract.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In post-trial briefing, defendants tried to escape from this testimony by declaring Colvin to be \"in error,\" and stating that \"[t]he CPUC here concedes that the Standard Contract for 20 MW or Less is a contract under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(ii), but is not a contract under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i).\" Dkt. No. 155 at 6. This effort to bury Colvin's testimony is wholly unpersuasive. As an initial matter, defendants championed Colvin as an expert on contract pricing for QFs, and relied heavily on his statements before his testimony in court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 134. After taking evidence about Colvin's long experience at the CPUC, and hearing his testimony on the stand, the Court has no doubt that he was a knowledgeable and competent witness who fully understood the questions posed to him and the answers he gave at trial. The Court also finds his testimony was credible. Defendants' about-face on Colvin as a witness and his testimony is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition, defendants' post-trial attacks on Colvin are all in the form of statements by lawyers and not based on evidence before the Court. A lawyer's argument does not trump a fact witness's testimony at trial. That is all the more true here because other facts undermine defendants' contentions. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2), there are two pricing options that must be provided, and defendants have not identified how those two options are on offer through one or more programs that are available to Winding Creek.

None of them are persuasive. Defendants suggest that they need not comply with FERC regulations at all because \"PURPA itself does not mandate the requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) and (ii).\" Dkt.

But as the\n   <em>\n    Allco\n   </em>\n   court noted, whatever latitude the state agency is to be given \"to implement FERC's PURPA rules does not justify an implementation that plainly conflicts with those rules.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272352\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/390/#p398\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our circuit has also underscored this uncontroversial principle in a case that defendants repeatedly cite. In\n   <em>\n    Independent Energy Producers Association v. California Public Utilities Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527770\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/848/#p850\">\n    36 F.3d 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1994), the court carefully examined FERC's regulations and concluded that a CPUC program is preempted \"under federal law\" citing to a FERC regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527770\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/848/#p850\">\n    36 F.3d at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that CPUC program is \"also preempted under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.303\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)\"). Even the snippet defendants quote from a Supreme Court case states that a State commission can comply with PURPA \"by issuing regulations, by resolving disputes on a case-by-case basis, or by taking any other action\n   <em>\n    reasonably designed to give effect to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FERC's rules.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    FERC v.

No. 155 at 1). FERC's regulations undeniably carry the force of law, and defendants are not free to ignore them just because the regulatory requirements do not appear in the text of PURPA itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants also make much of two FERC decisions that addressed Winding Creek's challenges to the Re-MAT program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

These decisions do not speak to the salient issues here. The May 2015 \"Notice of Intent Not to Act and Declaratory Order\" simply states that the Standard Contract provides a \"long-term PURPA contract at an avoided cost rate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202151303\">\n    2015 WL 2151303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. And the October 15, 2015 \"Order Denying Request for Reconsideration\" states that FERC sees no reason to change its prior decision that \"the Re-MAT program is consistent with PURPA, because it is an alternative to a primary PURPA program, the Standard Contract for QFs 20 MW or Under, which is consistent with PURPA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206083932\">\n    2015 WL 6083932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Neither order even mentions, let alone meaningfully discusses, the two pricing options that are required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) and (ii), or how the Standard Contract, the Re-MAT program, or some combination of the two, satisfies those requirements. And because the FERC decisions are consequently not germane, the Court finds that it need not reach questions of the level of deference it must afford to these decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Rather than attempting to show how the Standard Contract (by itself or with the Re-MAT program) might satisfy the price option requirements for QFs, defendants actually put both programs-the only programs available to Winding Creek-in the same pricing category, and then insist that the CPUC need not satisfy the regulations at all. This is a misguided approach and the Court rejects it. As a consequence, defendants' argument that it does not matter that the Re-MAT program is not PURPA-complaint because the Standard Contract already does all that is required under PURPA must also be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Returning to the cap issue, there is no dispute that participation in the Re-MAT program is capped. Participation in the Standard Contract program is not capped. But because the Standard Contract program does not by itself fully satisfy the pricing requirements under PURPA, the absence of caps in the Standard Contract program does not give the CPUC leeway to violate PURPA with a Re-MAT cap. Put differently, even if the Standard Contract program and the Re-MAT program in combination provided the two different pricing options under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) or (d)(2)(ii), that would not be enough because of the Re-MAT program's caps. Winding Creek does not, as the law mandates, have access to an uncapped program offering, at its election, either a rate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) or (d)(2)(ii). Consequently, defendants have not carried their burden against summary judgment for Winding Creek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. STANDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXHAUSTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants have again raised Article III standing and administrative exhaustion arguments, which were previously denied and are denied again here. Defendants say that \"WCS could have accepted an offer of $77.23/MWh on March 1, 2014, and it declined to do so,\" and argue on that basis that \"self-inflicted harm is not an injury for constitutional standing purposes.\" Dkt. No. 155 at 21-22. This is nothing more than an ill-taken request for reconsideration of the Court's prior standing decision. The Court has already found that Winding Creek has Article III standing for this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75 at 11-12 (finding sufficient plaintiff's allegations that its lost \"opportunity to enter into a contract with [PG &amp; E] on terms required by federal law\" is its injury in fact, as well as the allegation that the \"current impermissible price offered ... 'is the only remaining barrier to plaintiff's ability to obtain the financing needed to construct the Lodi facility\"). Defendants make no effort to establish a proper basis for reconsideration of this ruling,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Civil L.R. 7-9, and the Court declines to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants also raise an administrative exhaustion argument against Winding Creek's \"attack\" on the Standard Contract. Dkt. No. 159 at 5. In general, PURPA provides qualifying facilities with the right to file suit in the United States district courts if State agencies like the CPUC fail to properly implement FERC's rules. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3(h)(2)(B). But this right to file suit arises only after the \"electric utility, qualifying cogenerator or qualifying small power producer\" has first \"petition[ed] the Commission [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , FERC] to enforce the requirements of subsection (f)\" and FERC has not initiated an enforcement action itself within 60 days of the petition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants believe that \"WCS's failure to challenge the validity of the CPUC's primary PURPA program pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.301\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   raises a new failure of WCS to exhaust its administrative remedies.\" Dkt. No. 159 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This is unavailing. The Standard Contract is not a program Winding Creek affirmatively challenged in the first instance. Rather, it became an issue in the case-and plaintiff raised a challenge to it-only because defendants put the program forward in opposition to Winding Creek's summary judgment motion. There is no administrative exhaustion bar here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    V. RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Consequently, on the record before the Court, summary judgment is appropriate for Winding Creek. The question of relief is now ripe. Winding Creek asks the Court to find that it is entitled to a contract with PG &amp; E under the Re-MAT program at the initial offering price of $89.23/MWh.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 154 at 16 (requesting that the Court order \"the CPUC to award Winding Creek with a contract for $89.23 per MWh\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   That goes too far.
