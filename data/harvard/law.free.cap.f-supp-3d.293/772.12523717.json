Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bolden spent 22 years in prison for crimes he did not commit-the murders of Derrick Frazier and Ledell Clayton, and the attempted murder of Clifford Frazier. [40] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January of 1994, the Fraziers and Ledell Clayton attempted to sell multi-kilograms of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Clifford Frazier kept lookout while the other two entered a nearby J &amp; J Fish Restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. All three men were heavily armed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. When the prospective drug purchaser arrived, he, Derrick Frazier, and Clayton, drove off in Derrick Frazier's car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. While in the backseat, the buyer shot and killed both Derrick Frazier and Clayton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. He then returned to the original scene and exchanged gunfire with Clifford Frazier, shooting Frazier in the back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At all relevant times, Bolden was inside J &amp; J Fish playing a video game.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. He was there when Clifford Frazier ran into the restaurant for help, and Bolden called 911 from the phone inside the restaurant to report Frazier's injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the defendant officers arrived, they interviewed several witnesses, including Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the witnesses identified Bolden, or anyone matching Bolden's description, as the man who shot Frazier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Tenesha Gatson,\n   who worked at J &amp; J Fish, told the defendant officers that Bolden had remained at the restaurant throughout the evening and was there when Frazier entered after being shot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. The officers failed to investigate Gatson's statements or conduct follow-up interviews with any of the witnesses who could have corroborated Bolden's alibi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Officers also interviewed Vondell Goins, who had been inside J &amp; J Fish at the time of the shooting, but did not ask her about Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Had she been asked, Goins would have explained that she was speaking with Bolden inside the restaurant both when she heard the shooting outside and when Frazier entered the restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officers took down the name of Todd Henderson, who witnessed the fight between Frazier and his attacker and who, at the time, could have described the attacker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. The officers never questioned or followed up with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant officers also interviewed, but never attempted to contact, at least one other witness and failed to interview another owner of J &amp; J Fish who could have corroborated Bolden's story.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Clifford Frazier told defendant officers that he had gotten a good look at the shooter, who he described as between 5 foot 10 inches and 6 feet tall, clean-shaven, with a light complexion, low-cut hair, and a medium build.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Bolden was 6 feet 2 inches tall, very thin, and bald, with a dark complexion and a moustache.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Frazier met with a sketch artist, and the resulting picture looked nothing like Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. The defendant officers showed Frazier a photo array, which included a photo of Bolden, and Frazier did not recognize anyone in any of the photos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Around the same time of the photo array, defendants Higgins and Rowan signed a police report indicating that they learned from Derrick Frazier that a man named Anthony Williams had been involved in the murders and that \"Lanier\" (Lynier is Bolden's middle name) was with Williams prior to the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Derrick Frazier, of course, was dead at this time; this evidence was fabricated to frame Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon learning he was wanted for questioning, Bolden hired an attorney to represent him during his encounter with the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The lawyer accompanied Bolden to the Area 2 Violent Crimes Unit, where the defendant officers instructed them to wait in the waiting room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. While there, defendant Oliver walked Frazier directly past Bolden and his lawyer so Frazier could see Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The defendant officers then asked Bolden to participate in a lineup, and he agreed on the condition that his lawyer could be present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Defendant officers said they would allow the attorney to be present, but when he attempted to enter the viewing room alongside Bolden, defendant Pesavento physically blocked his path.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30. Twice during the lineup, officer Karl asked Bolden, \"you, Eddie Bolden, right?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Defendants Barnes, Pesavento, and at least one other defendant officer witnessed Karl's actions and allowed the lineup to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Frazier identified Bolden, who was subsequently arrested and charged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While Bolden was held in a room prior to be being sent to the lockup, defendant Kill entered, looked at Bolden, and laughed, noting that Bolden was bald-presumably because Frazier had previously described the shooter as having hair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Around the same time, Bolden asked Karl to bring defendant Oliver into the room because Oliver had seen Bolden inside J &amp; J Fish after the shootings and could corroborate his alibi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Karl responded, \"he doesn't remember\" and kicked the door to the room shut.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officers recovered two firearms during the investigation, Clifford Frazier's .40 caliber pistol recovered from inside the J &amp; J\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Fish and a nine millimeter pistol from Frazier's Cadillac nearby.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The state's ballistic expert concluded that the recovered firearms did not fire the deadly shots. [81] at 16 n. 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Bolden's attorney requested production of these weapons, the defendant officers destroyed them. [40] \u00b6 36. The .40 caliber pistol recovered from J &amp; J Fish was the firearm Frazier had with him while he was chased by the true perpetrator. [81] at 17 n. 10. At trial, Frazier testified that the perpetrator grabbed the firearm from him and hit him over the head with it, meaning the firearm could have contained the perpetrator's fingerprints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant officers destroyed\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant Temple's notes from interviews she conducted inside J &amp; J Fish on the night of the murders, including interviews with Bolden and with Frazier before he went to the hospital. [40] \u00b6 37. And although Bolden's attorney informed the defendant officers that Bolden had made a 911 call on the night of the murders, and that there would be a recording of that call, the defendants intentionally failed to act on that information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The recording was destroyed pursuant to the City of Chicago's policy at the time, which called for destruction of 911 recordings after 30 days absent a request for preservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October of 1996, Bolden was tried before a jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. The only evidence directly implicating him was fabricated by the defendant officers, including Clifford Frazier's false identification in a tainted lineup-no physical or forensic evidence linked Bolden to the crimes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Despite Clifford Frazier's confession to his involvement in a large drug deal, and to being part of a larger drug conspiracy, he was never charged with any crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Instead, the defendant officers overlooked Frazier's illegal conduct in exchange for his false testimony against Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant officers intentionally withheld information about this benefit and other benefits-such as the personal protection Frazier received-from Bolden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant officers also offered perjured testimony about the propriety of the lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bolden was found guilty, and in December 1996, was sentenced to a natural life term for the murders, to run consecutively to a thirty-year sentence for the attempted murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The convictions remained in place, and Bolden was in custody until the charges were dismissed in April 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The defendant officers argue that Bolden failed to allege both that the officers acted in bad faith and that the evidence was potentially exculpatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant officers first argue that the guns belonged to Frazier-not the perpetrator-and so were not exculpatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his complaint, Bolden asserts, \"Defendant Officers knowingly concealed, withheld, and/or destroyed exculpatory and impeachment evidence from Mr. Bolden and from prosecutors.\" [40] \u00b6 66. This is a conclusory statement which, taken alone, need not be accepted as true. But in his brief, Bolden elaborates on why the firearms were potentially exculpatory. [81] at 17 n. 10. He asserts that Frazier had one of the recovered firearms-the .40 caliber pistol-with him while he was chased by the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190700\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/529/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Frazier testified at trial that the perpetrator wrestled this gun from him and hit him over the head with it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190700\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/529/#p550\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The gun, then, could have contained the real perpetrator's fingerprints. The presence of those fingerprints, or the lack of Bolden's fingerprints, could have suggested Bolden's innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant officers further argue that Bolden has failed to adequately allege that they destroyed the two firearms in bad faith. Bolden, however, asserted that the defendant officers destroyed the guns\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Bolden requested their production. [40] \u00b6 66. This timing of the destruction-combined with the potential significance of the firearms and Bolden's other allegations of misconduct throughout\n   the investigation-is sufficient to allege that the defendant officers acted in bad faith in destroying the firearms. Bolden paints a picture of the defendant officers attempting to pursue him through any means necessary, which is enough. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190700\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/529/#p550\">\n    786 F.3d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, although Bolden has not specifically alleged which defendants are responsible for destroying the firearms, he has alleged that the defendant officers were the ones who destroyed them, and as noted above, this means he is saying they all did. Whether he can prove the allegation is an issue that cannot be resolved at this stage of the case. Bolden has stated a claim based on the defendant officers' alleged destruction of the two firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant officers next move to dismiss Bolden's destruction claim regarding Officer Temple's interview notes, arguing again that Bolden has failed to satisfy the standard for bad faith set out in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   . They argue that the conduct alleged here is not as egregious as that alleged in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   . The bad-faith test in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   is not limited to its specific facts. Here, the entire complaint adequately paints a picture of defendants taking any action necessary to close the case, including by framing Bolden. When that mindset is paired with the destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence, the complaint states a due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Aside from a conclusory statement, the complaint fails to allege the exculpatory nature of the notes. In his response to defendants' motions to dismiss, though, Bolden elaborates-arguing that the very existence of the notes was exculpatory because it proved the police interviewed Bolden at J &amp; J Fish immediately after the shooting, and \"[t]he real gunman obviously never entered the restaurant and was not interviewed by police side-by-side with Frazier.\" [81] at 15.

But Bolden has alleged that the defendant officers destroyed the notes themselves, not that they suppressed the information within those notes. Even if not admissible in their own right at trial, the notes had independent evidentiary value as contemporaneous corroboration of Bolden's location in close proximity to Clifford Frazier shortly after the shooting. The defendant officers can be liable for the bad-faith destruction of the notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bolden's third and final allegation of destruction of evidence involves the defendant officers' failure to preserve a recording of the 911 call Bolden made inside J &amp; J Fish on the night of the murders. The officers argue that they had no duty to preserve evidence outside of their possession. Bolden asserts that defendant officers \"caused the destruction of the critical 911 recording,\" that Bolden's attorney informed the officers of the call, and that the officers intentionally failed to act on that information so that the recording would be destroyed pursuant to the city's policy at the time. [40] \u00b6 38. Bolden fails to allege that the tape was under the defendant officers' control or that the officers' were somehow responsible for the tape's destruction.

Bolden alleges that the defendant officers engineered a faulty lineup by having Bolden participate in the lineup even though Frazier had failed to identify him in a photo spread, by walking Frazier past Bolden immediately prior to the lineup, and by having Officer Karl mention Bolden's name while executing the lineup. The defendant officers argue that these actions do not demonstrate that they knew Frazier's identification was false. But Bolden has alleged that the officers were aware of Frazier's initial description of his attacker (which did not match Bolden), that Frazier had failed to recognize a photo of Bolden, and that after Frazier was identified, defendant Kill laughed, pointing out that Bolden was bald (presumably because Bolden looked nothing like the attacker Frazier had previously described). These facts, taken as true, are sufficient to allege that the defendant officers acted with the requisite knowledge to support a claim for fabrication of evidence. Evidence of the fabricated lineup was presented at trial-Clifford Frazier's false identification from the lineup was the only evidence that directly implicated Bolden. [40] \u00b6 2.

Bolden also alleges that the city had a widespread practice of failing to adequately train, supervise, and discipline its officers to ensure that they: employed proper identification techniques; faithfully represented material facts when seeking criminal charges; secured, maintained, and prevented the destruction of material evidence; disclosed exculpatory and impeachment information to prosecutors; and adequately investigated potential leads, including questioning alibi witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.

In some situations, such group pleading might not give sufficient notice to each defendant about his or her alleged conduct; each defendant's liability for constitutional torts must be based on personal involvement. In this case, I read the complaint to allege that every one of the defendant officers committed the acts attributed to \"defendant officers,\" and I accept that as true. If the facts belie such a group allegation, some of the officers may not face liability.
