Cal. Feb. 26, 2013), where the San Bernadino Associated Governments (\"SANBAG\") entered into a contract with Riverside Construction Company (RCC) to construct a freeway extension to protect the freeway from flooding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The San Bernadino County Flood Control District sued SANBAG and others \"to recover for the damage to, and taking of, its property caused by Defendants' construction of the [freeway project] and the related Cactus Channel that protects the freeway from flooding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. The complaint alleged that the \"Freeway Project and Cactus Channel damaged pre-existing flood control facilities owned by the District[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. It further alleged liability \"due to the negligent and/or other wrongful acts or omissions of the Defendants in connection with their agreements to construct the Freeway Project and Cactus Channel, and failure to construct improvements to the Cactus Basins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held that \"it is at least possible that the property damage claimed by the District as a result of the construction of the freeway and Cactus Channel combined with the 2004-2005 rainy season could be considered an 'accident.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

The insurer argued that it did not have a duty to defend because all of the causes of action rested on the same factual allegations of fraud and deceit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n    at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected this, finding that the insurer \"ignore[d] the causal series of events leading to the damage sustained as a result of Defendants' alleged misrepresentations-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the manufacture and sale of allegedly defective mattresses by Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n    at 886-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because there was a potential for a product defect cause of action to be added by future amendment to the underlying complaint, there was potential for coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, although the underlying complaint contained allegations that the defendants knew of the alleged defects since 2007, the policy coverage began in 2004 and the putative class was not limited to any particular time period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court found that there was a possibility that the underlying complaint sought damages for accidental sale of defective mattresses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326378\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Lastly, at the hearing, Burlington argued that Henstooth's arguments strayed outside of the factual record before the Court. In response, Henstooth cited\n   <em>\n    Tidwell Enterprises, Inc. v. Financial Pacific Insurance Company, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12463004\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/6/100/\">\n    6 Cal.

This is so because current pleading rules liberally allow amendment; the third party plaintiff cannot be the arbiter coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20634\">\n    210 Cal.Rptr.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"[a]n insured may not trigger the duty to defend by speculating about extraneous 'facts' regarding potential liability or ways in which the third party claimant might amend its complaint at some future date.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v.

Here, no allegations in the underlying complaint or extrinsic evidence raise the possibility that Henstooth's actions were negligent or accidental. Thus, there is no duty to defend. \"Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, a conclusion that here [Burlington] did not have a duty to defend will be dispositive of plaintiff [Henstooth's] claim that [Burlington] had a duty to indemnify.\"\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899435\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/302/#p308\">\n    47 Cal. 4th at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   308 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). Consequently, there is no duty to indemnify either.
