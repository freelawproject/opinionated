(\"UR\" or \"Plaintiff\") initiated this action in the District of Connecticut on February 27, 2015, alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment relating to alleged indemnification obligations of Conti Enterprises, Inc. (\"Conti\" or \"Defendant\"). (\"Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 1.) Conti filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and for improper venue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 17.) UR then filed a Motion to Transfer to Another District, which was granted, and the case subsequently transferred to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 26, 43, 45, 46.) On November 18, 2015, UR filed an Amended Complaint (\"Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 44). Conti filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint on March 3, 2016 (Dkt. No. 50),\n   and on March 24, 2017 moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (\"Motion,\" Dkt. No. 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2008, Conti of New York, LLC (a Conti entity) was hired by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (\"TBTA\"), an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (\"MTA\"), to repair the Whitestone Bridge. In connection with the repair work, Conti rented certain equipment from UR. The rental arrangement is reflected in a number of documents. UR and Conti entered into a National Account Agreement (\"NAA\"), dated August 1, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, on August 4, 2009, UR and Conti entered into a rental contract (\"Rental Agreement\"), whereby Conti rented a JLG boom lift, serial number 0300118085 (\"the Lift\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Rental Agreement, at least according to UR, consisted of two pages: one page which bears the words \"Rental Agreement\" at the top, and a second page which is titled \"Rental Agreement Additional Terms and Conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, Ex. B.) Conti alleges it did not receive the \"Rental Agreement Additional Terms and Conditions\" page along with the \"Rental Agreement\" and notes that no facsimile transmission stamp appears on the additional terms page as it does on the Rental Agreement page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.

B at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The \"Rental Agreement Additional Terms and Conditions\" contained an indemnity provision, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Indemnify/Hold Harmless: To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold United harmless from and against any and all liability, claim, loss, damage, or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, loss of profit, business interruption or other special or consequential damages, damages relating to bodily injury, damages relating to wrongful death) caused by or in any way arising out of or related to the operation, use, maintenance, instruction, possession, transportation, ownership or rental of the equipment, including, but not limited to, whenever such liability, claim, loss, damage or cost is founded, in whole or in part, upon any negligent or grossly negligent act or omission of United or the provision of any allegedly defective product by United. This indemnity provision\n   applies to any claims asserted against United based upon strict or product liability causes of action, breach of warranty or under any other theory of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Amended Complaint, Ex. B at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, regarding Conti's required insurance coverage, the additional terms and conditions require:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   18. Customer's Insurance Coverage: Customer agrees to maintain and carry, at its sole cost, adequate liability, physical damage, public liability, property damage and casualty insurance for the full replacement cost of the Equipment, including, but not limited to all risks of loss or damage covered by the standard extended coverage endorsement, to cover any damage or liability arising from the handling, transportation, maintenance, operation, possession or use of the Equipment during the entire Rental Period. When requested, Customer shall supply to United proof of such insurance by Certificate of Insurance clearly setting forth the coverage for the Equipment and naming United as loss payee and additional insured; such insurance and evidence thereof to be in amounts and form satisfactory to United. The Certificate of Insurance and policy shall provide that, United shall receive no less than 30 days' notice prior to any cancellation of the insurance required hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, according to the additional terms and conditions, the \"Customer agrees to pay all reasonable costs of collection, court, attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by United in the collection of any charges due under this Rental Agreement or in connection with the enforcement of its terms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or about May 6, 2010, Conti employees Karl Fritz (\"Fritz\") and Richard O'Keefe, Jr. (\"O'Keefe\") allegedly sustained injuries after the Lift malfunctioned at the Whitestone Bridge project site. Fritz commenced an action in November 2010 against UR and other defendants for damages relating to his injuries. In April 2011, O'Keefe filed his own lawsuit as a result of his alleged injuries, in which defendants MTA and TBTA filed a Third-Party complaint against UR and others. These lawsuits (\"Underlying Lawsuits\") have since been consolidated in New York state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Conti breached the NAA and/or the Rental Agreement by: (1) failing to indemnify UR in the Underlying Lawsuits, and (2) failing to secure liability insurance providing \"Additional Insured coverage\" to UR for any liability arising from the use of the Lift. The Amended Complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment that: (1) Conti is obligated to defend and indemnify UR in the Underlying Lawsuits; (2) Conti must pay UR's defense costs incurred in the Underlying Lawsuits going forward; and (3) Conti must pay all amounts UR is held liable for and obligated to pay by way of settlement or judgment in connection with the Underlying Lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Conti argues: (1) the indemnification provision of the Rental Agreement is void and unenforceable as a matter of law under New York General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 ; (2) the insurance procurement provision was not breached and is not enforceable as a matter of law; and (3) The Rental Agreement does not provide for an award of attorneys' fees under the \"American Rule\" of attorney fee recovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem.; Defendant's Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Reply Mem.\"), Dkt. No. 86.) Conti argues that UR's complaint should be dismissed for these reasons and requests that the Court issue an order\n   declaring that Conti (i) is not obligated to defend and indemnify UR in the current action and the Underlying Lawsuits; (ii) is not obligated to fund UR's prior and/or future defense costs in the Underlying Lawsuits; and (iii) is not obligated to pay, on behalf of UR, all sums UR becomes obligated to pay by reason of liability for damages, including attorneys' fees and costs in connection with this action or the Underlying Lawsuits. (Def Mem. at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In opposition, UR argues: (1) the Rental Agreement's indemnity provision is valid and enforceable; (2) Conti's motion for summary judgment should be denied because there has been no finding of fault; (3) Conti breached the insurance procurement provision of the Rental Agreement by not naming UR as an \"additional insured\" for all liability arising from use of the Lift; and (4) Section 22(b) of the Rental Agreement provides for the recovery of attorneys' fees incurred by UR in connection with the enforcement of the agreement.

(Def. Mem. at 10-13.) In opposition, UR argues that the indemnity provision is valid because it calls for only partial indemnification, and that UR is entitled to enforce the indemnification provision against Conti for any liability not attributable to UR's own negligence. (Pl. Opposition at 8-15.) UR's argument that the indemnity provision contemplates partial indemnification is based on the inclusion of the words \"to the fullest extent permitted by law\" in the provision.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The first sentence of the insurance provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Customer agrees to maintain and carry, at its sole cost, adequate liability, physical damage, public liability, property damage and casualty insurance for the full replacement cost of the Equipment, including, but not limited to all risks of loss or damage covered by the standard extended coverage endorsement, to cover any damage or liability arising from the handling, transportation, maintenance, operation, possession or use of the Equipment during the entire Rental Period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Amended Complaint, Ex.

(Def. Mem. at 16-17.) As UR notes, however, the sentence also contains the broad language that Conti must maintain insurance \"to cover\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   damage or liability arising from the handling, transportation, maintenance, operation, possession or use of the Equipment.\" (Amended Complaint, Ex. B at 3 (emphasis added).) The plain language of the contract does not limit Conti's obligation to procure insurance to property damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

Although the first sentence of the provision does not state explicitly that Conti was required to name UR as an additional insured, the next sentence of the insurance provision states: \"When requested, Customer [Conti] shall supply to United proof of such insurance by Certificate of Insurance clearly setting forth the coverage for the Equipment and naming United as loss payee and additional insured; such insurance and evidence thereof to be in amounts and form satisfactory to United.\" (Amended Complaint, Ex. B at 3.) The reference in the second sentence to \"proof of such insurance ... naming United as loss payee and additional insured\" plainly shows that Conti was obligated to name UR as an additional insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289107\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/15/#p22\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This provision, while clumsily drafted, unambiguously shows that [customer] had a contractual obligation to name United Rentals as an additional insured. Neither sentence, on its own, states explicitly that United Rentals was to be an additional insured, but taken together, that is their clear effect.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Conti's related argument, that the second sentence of the provision required Conti only to get certificates of insurance naming UR as an additional insured, but did not require Conti to procure a policy naming UR as an additional insured, is also unpersuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 18.) In support of this argument, Conti cites\n   <em>\n    Trapani v. 10 Arial Way Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1012613\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/301/644/\">\n    301 A.D.2d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1012613\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/301/644/\">\n    755 N.Y.S.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Dep't 2003). In\n   <em>\n    Trapani\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that \"contract language that merely requires the purchase of insurance will not be read as also requiring that a contracting party be named as an additional insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398. In that case, the court found that a plain reading of the provision at issue \"shows that it does not pertain in any way to additional insured coverage. Indeed, those words were never used .... [The contract] simply requires [subcontractor] to provide a certificate of insurance showing that [subcontractor] had both liability and workers' compensation coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398-99. Such contractual language stands in contrast to the provision here which specifically refers to a \"Certificate of Insurance clearly setting forth the coverage for the Equipment and naming United as loss payee and additional insured.\" (Amended Complaint, Ex.
