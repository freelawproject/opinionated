Unlike previous motion capture technologies, the MOVA Contour Program \"precisely captures and tracks the 3D shape and motion of a human face to sub-millimeter precision.\" No. 17-cv-04006 JST ECF No. 1 (\"Disney Compl.\") \u00b6 22; No. 17-cv-04191 JST ECF No. 1 (\"Fox Compl.\") \u00b6 22; No. 17-cv-04192 JST ECF No. 1 (\"Paramount Compl.\") \u00b6 20. The MOVA Contour system captures \"an actor's performance frame-by-frame, and then creates original Contour Program output files based on the performance, frame-by-frame.\" Disney Compl. \u00b6 27; Fox Compl. \u00b6 27; Paramount Compl. \u00b6 25. The output files can be used for many different applications, such as \"retargeting\" the actor's face onto another real or fictional face.

Paramount argues that the only example provided does not include \"MOVA\" at all. ECF No. 26 at 29. Rearden argues that \"the Facebook page contains numerous references and visual images of the reverse-aging process for Schwarzenegger, and corresponding links concurrent with the release of a WIRED magazine promotional video made with Paramount that uses the MOVA mark, or public statements by Paramount personnel specifically using the MOVA mark.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, as discussed above, to prevail on a trademark infringement claim, Rearden must show that Paramount used the trademark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Kids on the Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514411\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/302/#p308\">\n    971 F.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
