Lamberth, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Robert A. Berman brings this case\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   against defendants Joseph D. (Donald) Crook, Jr., a Special Agent with the Department of the Interior; Brenda K. Morris, a former attorney in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice; and David M. Finkelstein and Judith Rabinowitz, attorneys in the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. Before the Court is the defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. ECF No. 29. Upon consideration of the defendants' motion, the opposition and replies thereto, the applicable law, and the entire record herein, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Robert A. Berman is a former senior economist in the Department of the Interior. He provided assistance to a nonprofit organization, Project on Government Oversight (\"POGO\"), in connection with POGO's\n   <em>\n    qui tarn\n   </em>\n   actions to recover unpaid royalties owed by oil companies to the federal government. Mr. Berman declined to join as co-relator in the actions, but he and POGO agreed that he would receive one third of POGO's recovery. After the United States intervened, it recovered $440 million from the companies. POGO received a $1.2 million share of the settlement and issued a check to Mr. Berman for $383,600.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 03-cv-00096, ECF No. 168 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequently, in 1998, Brenda Morris impaneled a grand jury to investigate Mr. Berman. She sought and obtained a warrant to search his office based on the affidavit of Donald Crook, a Special Agent with the Department of the Interior. The government did not seek an indictment of Mr. Berman and he was not charged with any crimes. During the investigation, however, the government was granted a motion to seal the Crook affidavit. After Mr. Berman moved to unseal in 2000, the government provided Mr. Berman a redacted version of the affidavit, who claimed that it was full of fabrications, half-truths, and unsupported speculation. In 2008, the court ordered that the affidavit be unsealed, but the Clerk's office failed to unseal the affidavit at that time. In 2013, the court again ordered the Clerk's office to unseal the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, in 2003, the government-represented in part by Judith Rabinowitz-filed a civil action against Mr. Berman for disgorgement of the payment that he had received from POGO. The government sought disclosure of the grand jury material gathered during the investigation, and its petition was granted by the court. In granting the government's motion, Judge Hogan noted that \"[n]o opposition has been filed.\" ECF No. 16-4 (under seal). The grand jury material was transferred from the Criminal Division to the Civil Division. The case eventually went to trial in 2008 and a verdict was issued in favor of the government. Mr. Berman appealed and the verdict was vacated and the case was remanded. Mr. Berman, now proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   filed a motion to dismiss and for sanctions, and a motion to compel affidavits and other evidence on which the government intended to rely, which was denied as premature. In 2012, the court denied the motion to dismiss and for sanctions, and granted summary judgment in favor of the government on one of the counts-the breach-of-fiduciary-duty\n   count. David Finkelstein then entered an appearance in the case for the government and a second jury trial was held on the remaining claims which ended in a mistrial. In 2014, the D.C. Circuit upheld the district court's summary judgement finding that Mr. Berman breached his fiduciary duty and that he had to disgorge the payment he received from POGO.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Project on Gov't Oversight,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4110356,4200494\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/9/\">\n    766 F.3d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Mr. Berman filed a motion to unseal, seeking access to materials related to the search warrant, which the court interpreted as a petition for grand jury materials. The court ordered Mr. Berman to provide justification for the disclosure. Mr. Berman claimed that the remaining grand jury materials were relevant to his pending D.C. Circuit case and his case before the Merit Systems Protection Board. In February 2014, after order by the court, the government disclosed the remaining grand jury materials to Mr. Berman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Berman now brings a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action seeking damages against the defendants for providing a false search warrant affidavit and for conducting an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; for conspiring to deny his due process rights by denying access to a search warrant affidavit and for knowingly using the fruits of an unlawful search; for conspiring to deny his due process rights by unlawfully misappropriating district court records; and for conspiring to use the grand jury in service of a planned civil suit. Although Mr. Berman reframed his claims under a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   theory in his Amended Complaint, the individual counts still assert claims against the defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1985, and 1988.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The facts in this section come from the Amended Complaint, documents incorporated by reference in the Amended Complaint, and from the long public record of this case (of which the Court can take judicial notice).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    In support of his claims, Mr. Berman argues that Ms. Morris knew, prior to launching the criminal investigation, that a document existed that refuted her theory of criminal misconduct, but she never disclosed the document to the grand jury. He further states that the search warrant affidavit signed by Mr. Crook contained false allegations, and absent those false allegations, the affidavit could not support a finding of probable cause. Turning to the 2003 civil case, Mr. Berman states that Ms. Rabinowitz used materials gained from the illegal search to support the government's case and notes that despite the expiration of the seal, the search warrant materials remained under seal. Then Ms. Rabinowitz filed a motion to obtain a copy of the grand jury materials, including the search warrant affidavit, failing to disclose that the investigation was closed without seeking an indictment. Mr. Berman claims that Ms. Rabinowitz and Ms. Morris conspired to transfer the records-which were the property of the district court-with the intent to deny Mr. Berman access.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Mr. Berman further posits that in 2008, Ms. Morris filed a motion with a different magistrate judge to unseal the affidavit and did not include a certificate of service so that Mr. Berman would not be aware of the filing. Mr. Berman asserts that it was not until mid-2013-after he had filed a motion to unseal the affidavit-that the government revealed that Ms. Morris had closed the grand jury investigation without seeking indictment and that it intentionally withheld the search warrant affidavit from civil pre-trial discovery by alleging that it contained grand jury material, and that due to age, the record was likely destroyed. In November 2013, the magistrate judge determined that there were no grand jury materials in the search warrant affidavit and ordered that it be unsealed. In addition, Mr. Berman argues that Mr. Finkelstein intentionally, and without authorization, distributed grand jury documents to individuals not authorized to view them and that he introduced the fruits of the illegal search and lied to the district\n    court regarding false statements in the affidavit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    On May 17, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss all of Mr. Berman's claims alleged in his Amended Complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

Accordingly, his current position-that since he did not receive the unredacted affidavit until November, 2013, the claim cannot be barred-is without merit.

The Supreme Court has only approved\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims in three limited contexts and instructed that \"if [a] case is different in a meaningful way from previous\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    cases decided by this Court, then the context is new.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1859-1860 (listing the three previous\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claims that the Supreme Court approved: \"a claim against FBI agents for handcuffing a man in his own home without a warrant; a claim against a Congressman for firing his female secretary; and a claim against prison officials for failure to treat an inmate's asthma.\"). When considering whether to extend a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claim to a new context,\n    courts must analyze whether \"there are special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1857.

He argues that he was denied due process because the affidavit was sealed and intentionally withheld from him. He also contends that his due process was violated because defendant Morris failed to serve him with the government's 2008 motion to unseal the affidavit. But Mr. Berman had numerous paths to recover the sealed affidavit. For instance, he could have moved in the civil litigation to recover the entire affidavit during discovery. His argument that he could not access the affidavit because it was still under seal when discovery ended in 2007 strains credulity. It is not as if he was unaware of the affidavit's existence. As previously discussed, he knew about it all the way back to 2000 and at the time believed that it contained numerous falsehoods. The record does not reflect any attempt on his part to discover the affidavit during the course of the civil litigation. Moreover, he could have at any point filed a renewed motion to unseal the affidavit in the separate proceeding before the magistrate judge-something he eventually did in 2013. See Case No. 00-mj-00138, ECF No. 23. Mr. Berman now alleges that his due process was violated because the defendants withheld the affidavit. In reality, he failed to pursue the multiple paths available to him to retrieve the affidavit. Because alternative methods of relief existed for the plaintiff, the Court will not extend a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy to this new context. Similarly, the Court will not extend a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy based on Mr. Berman's allegations that the \"fruits\" of the search warrant were used in the civil proceeding. He could have moved to exclude that evidence in his civil suit. Moreover, defendant Rabinowitz could not have violated a clearly established constitutional right. As discussed already, the search was not illegal and defendant Rabinowitz petitioned the court to access that information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Mr. Berman also asserts that the Court should recognize a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claim for an alleged violation of Rule 6(e) of the Criminal Rules of Procedure. He alleges in his Amended Complaint that \"[u]nder the direct supervision of Ms. Rabinowitz, Mr. Finkelstein intentionally, and without authorization of the grand jury court, distributed multiple grand jury documents to individuals not authorized or otherwise permitted to view such documents under Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 6(e), a direct violation of Plaintiffs rights.\" Amended Complaint, ECF No. 20-1 at \u00b629. Berman provides no further detail in the Amended Complaint supporting this allegation. However, even accepting this as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Court cannot extend a\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    remedy. There is no constitutionally protected right against disclosure of grand jury materials, nor does Mr. Berman explain how that would be a violation of his due process rights. Moreover, he had an alternative method of relief-he could have highlighted his concerns in the context of the civil litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Even if the Court were to extend\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    to this context, the claims would still be dismissed on immunity grounds. The allegations levied against defendant Morris all involved her role as a government prosecutor. Mr. Berman posits that she impaneled the grand jury and failed to disclose a document that would have refuted her theory of the case. He also alleges that she extended the grand jury investigation in order to \"enhance a planned civil complaint.\" Amended Complaint, ECF No.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    20-1 at \u00b643.

Since Mr. Berman does not plead any additional facts related to their contact with this forum, the case may be dismissed against defendants Morris and Crook for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Defendants also correctly note that Mr. Berman failed to effectuate proper service pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Under Rule 4(i)(3), to serve a United States officer or employee in an individual capacity, \"a party must serve the United States and also serve the officer or employee under Rule 4(e), (f), or (g).\" Rule 4(e) permits service based on the rules of the state in which the district court is located or where service is made. D.C. law permits service by certified mail, but to be effective the plaintiff must receive a signed return-receipt from the defendant or someone authorized to accept\n    service on behalf of the defendant.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eldridge v. District of Columbia,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9038561\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/786/#p787\">\n     866 A.2d 786\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 787-88 (D.C. 2004). Berman's return-of-service filing indicates that he attempted to serve the defendants via certified mail. However, none of the return receipts contain signatures from the defendants in this case or individuals authorized to accept service on their behalf. Only two receipts provided by Mr. Berman contain signatures, and they are of unspecified individuals. Since the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing service and Mr. Berman was made aware of defective process by defendants in a filing in December 2016, ECF No. 6, the Court may dismiss the claims against the defendants for failure to serve pursuant to Rule 4(m).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Dismissal Pursuant to Westfall Certification\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Mr. Berman does not specifically allege a tort claim in his Amended Complaint. But to the extent it can be construed to contain such a claim, the defendants argue they can be dismissed pursuant to the Westfall certification filed by the government in this case. See Certification of Daniel F. Van Horn, ECF No. 29-1. Under the Westfall Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), if the United States certifies that the individual defendant is operating within the scope of his office, the \"employee is dismissed from the action, and the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee.\"\n    <em>\n     Osborn v. Haley,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553626\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/225/#p229\">\n     549 U.S. 225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 229,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553626\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/225/#p229\">\n     127 S.Ct. 881\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553626\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/225/#p229\">\n     166 L.Ed.2d 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007). The claims then proceed against the United State; and are governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\").\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553626\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/225/#p229\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Here, the United States certifies that the defendants were operating within the scope of their employment. Therefore, to the extent Mr. Berman asserts a tort claim, the United States would be the sole defendant and the suit would need to be cognizable under the FTCA. Since Mr. Berman has not alleged that he exhausted his administrative remedies, his suit against the government cannot be brought under the FTCA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a). Claims for damages against the United States would also be barred on the basis of sovereign immunity. See\n    <em>\n     Clark v. Library of Cong.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805607,628863\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/89/\">\n     750 F.2d 89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 103 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\"Sovereign immunity ... bar[s] suits for money damages against officials in their official capacity absent a specific waiver by the government.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     II. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court will\n    <strong>\n     GRANT\n    </strong>\n    the defendants' motion to dismiss. A separate Order a companies this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-57\">\n     Section 1983 states, in relevant part, that \"[e]very person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-58\">\n     Neither of the other two subsections of the statute remotely apply to the facts of this case. Subsection 1985(1) relates to preventing an officer from performing his or her duties and subsection 1985(2) applies to obstruction of justice through the intimidation of a party, witness or juror.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-59\">\n     Mr. Berman also alleges in his Amended Complaint that \"\n     <em>\n      ALL\n     </em>\n     affidavit allegations contain intentionally or recklessly false statements or misleading omissions.\" ECF No. 20-1 at \u00b6 13 (emphasis in original). He reiterates that point in his opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. But the Court need not accept as true that conclusory statement, as it is unsupported by specific facts.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-60\">\n     The defendants are also correct that any claim related to \"misappropriation\" of grand jury materials would be time barred. The motion to access the grand jury evidence (which was served on Mr. Berman) was granted in 2003, 13 years prior to this lawsuit.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
