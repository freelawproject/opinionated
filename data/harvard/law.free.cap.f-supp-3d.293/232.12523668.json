Brock Hornby, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The issue here is whether a federal court in Maine has jurisdiction over a German company. The German company, named Scrutinizer GmbH, has no physical presence in the United States, but it offers cloud-based services from an interactive website that attracts customers from around the world, including the United States (and two customers from Maine). A Maine firm, Plixer International, Inc. owns the U.S. registered mark \"Scrutinizer.\" Plixer has filed this lawsuit claiming that the German defendant is infringing its registered mark by operating an interactive website using the name \"Scrutinizer,\" providing services similar to the plaintiff's, generating income from customers in the United States, confusing the public, and diluting and infringing the mark. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-18; Pl. Opp'n at 1, (ECF No. 14). The German defendant has moved to dismiss. I previously dismissed by agreement any general jurisdiction claim. Order on Pending Motions at 1 (ECF No. 20). I also permitted limited discovery on the plaintiff's specific jurisdiction claim with reference to what is sometimes called the federal long-arm statute, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Swiss Am.

After that discovery and further briefing, I now\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint, concluding that upon a prima facie record, the federal long-arm statute provides specific jurisdiction. It is a close call, however, and worthy of appellate review since the First Circuit has not addressed the issue of personal jurisdiction based solely upon an interactive website that offers cloud-based services, and the Supreme Court has never addressed 4(k)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinochem Intern.

R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2), the so-called federal long-arm statute. Nationwide personal jurisdiction in federal court can be obtained through service of process if (1) the claim \"arises under federal law,\" (2) the defendant is \"not subject to jurisdiction in any state's courts of general jurisdiction; and ... [3] exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution and laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The defendant does not contest the first and second factors (arising under federal law; no jurisdiction in any state court). Def. Suppl. Mem. at 1 (ECF No. 27). Only the third factor, constitutionality, is in play.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because federal law controls, the Fifth Amendment rather than the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause applies. That creates a conceptual difference because the Fifth Amendment, unlike the Fourteenth, does not involve the factor of relationships among states in our federal system.

Its website was available to anyone in the world who had Internet access, and there is no evidence that it restricted its interactive purchasing feature. The plaintiff's argument that the website's use of English demonstrates targeting to the United States ignores the large number of English-speaking countries around the world, as well as the use of English as a lingua franca in many commercial transactions (as distinguished, for example, from the defendant's German language). Instead, the defendant's requirement of euros as a currency for transactions weakens the argument that this German defendant was soliciting Americans in particular. The 14-day free trial is a neutral factor, affecting all potential users regardless of their preferred currency. The defendant's marketing statement that companies around the world trust its service certainly suggests that it was placing its service in commerce everywhere, but not that the defendant targeted the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (The fact that the defendant uses third parties that may have servers in the United States is not\n   related to this trademark infringement cause of action and I therefore do not consider it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the same time, this defendant can be said to have wanted, if not targeted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   business outside its home country of Germany; it adopted an interactive website that accepted without restriction business from Maine and the United States, accepted transactions that resulted in both a substantial number of customers and a sturdy revenue stream from the United States, emailed its billing invoices to those customers, and on its interactive website touted its customers and projects around the world.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of showing no purposeful availment, the defendant points out that in its contracts with customers it inserted a forum selection and choice of law clause requiring that all lawsuits must be in German courts and that German law applies. Def. Reply Mem. at 7 &amp; Ex. A at 5-6 (ECF No. 17 &amp; 17-2). This language does not bind those, like this plaintiff, who are not subject to a contract, but it does demonstrate that the defendant knew it was extending its reach outside Germany and decided to take steps to deal with foreign contract-based litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This case presents the quintessential Internet-based personal jurisdiction quandary. It does not help the analysis to say that the defendant reached or did not reach\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   the United States, or that customers in the United States reached or did not reach\n   <em>\n    out to\n   </em>\n   the defendant's out-of-country website. Through the website, the United States customers did proceed to make all the necessary contacts to obtain the defendant's services. As the defendant points out, they could (and sometimes did) do so from anywhere in the world given the cloud-based nature of its service. The defendant then emailed invoices to them and continued to accept their American business-now for 3-1/2 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I conclude that this German defendant operated a highly interactive website that sold its cloud-based services directly through the website, that it was open to business throughout the world, that it accepted recurrent business from the United States in a substantial amount, and that it did so knowingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The conventional judicial concern in these interactive website cases is fear of adopting a standard that would impose worldwide exposure to lawsuits on any enterprise that does business through an interactive website.

(\"The vast majority of courts reject the universal jurisdiction view.\"). That concern is misplaced here. This German defendant has engaged in sizeable and continuing commerce with United States customers through its interactive website. It should not be surprised at United States-based litigation. I conclude that it meets the standards that some other circuits have set: although it does not ship physical products into the forum (Second and Eleventh Circuits), well more than \"a few residents\" (Sixth and Seventh Circuits) have established accounts with the defendant over its website; it has \"knowingly interact[ed] with residents of the forum state via its web site\" (Third Circuit); and if it did not expressly target the United States in particular (Fourth Circuit), its interactive website made clear that it would take business from anywhere, and it continued to do so while billing its customers by email (Ninth Circuit, except for individual targeting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, I have not yet addressed the relevance of the defendant's post-lawsuit January 2017 application to obtain a trademark for \"Scrutinizer\" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

This case, on the other hand, involves continuing \"tortious\" conduct in the defendant's allegedly infringing activity, and the plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. (Damages are requested, but they are not tied to any particular infringement.) If the plaintiff should move to amend its Amended\n   Complaint to add new infringing activity in support of its claims for equitable relief (the defendant's website continues in existence), I would undoubtedly grant the motion. Why therefore should I not consider the defendant's more recent trademark application filing? In typical appellate fashion,\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   did not lay out a hard-and-fast rule. Instead its principle applies \"generally\" and \"in most cases.\" 432 F.3d at 61, 62. Rather than wait for a motion to amend (or indeed a new lawsuit, since a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is without prejudice on the substantive issue and a new lawsuit might be able to use the trademark application filing to show personal jurisdiction), I conclude that the situation here may lie outside\n   <em>\n    Harlow\n   </em>\n   's\"generally/most cases\" rule and that I should consider the defendant's post-lawsuit federal trademark application filing for whatever impact it has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But does that application filing make a difference in determining personal jurisdiction?

In the end, the defendant's United States trademark application filing is not a factor that tips the scales, but it does confirm the defendant's desire to deal with the American market and thus purposeful availment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c.

By that I mean that there is abundant and efficient air travel and, just as important, much legal and judicial business in today's world is accomplished electronically. All pleadings and most discovery-documents, admissions, interrogatories-can be conducted remotely. As the plaintiff has noted, even in-person depositions are generally held in the deponent's home jurisdiction. Pl. Opp'n at 4. Hearings short of trial can be and often are conducted by telephone or videoconference. Most cases are resolved short of trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   but trial at a distance could be a burden.
