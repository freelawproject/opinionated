The defendant, Milwaukee Public School District (\"MPS\"), provides busing to qualifying public and private school students in the city of Milwaukee. The plaintiff, St. Joan Antida High School (\"SJA\"), a private school in Milwaukee, contends that MPS' student transportation policy treats MPS public school students differently and more favorably than it treats similarly-situated private school students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   SJA filed its complaint on March 21, 2017, alleging that MPS has violated its rights and the rights of its students under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

MPS, through its Board of Directors, has created a policy for student transportation services, set forth in MPS Administrative Policy 4.04 (\"Policy 4.04\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Policy 4.04, in\n   relevant part, directs that transportation will be provided to Milwaukee-resident students as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) CONDITIONS OF DISTANCE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) To and from Public Schools within the City\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3.

If the student resides within the designated attendance area of the private school.

(Docket # 32 at 4-5 and # 37 at 9). Only those students on the roster submitted by the private school receive busing if otherwise eligible. MPS does not apply a roster deadline for students attending MPS schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In a subsequent section, the policy prescribes rules for transportation of students who attend MPS schools other than the schools to which they would otherwise be assigned based on their residences (their attendance-district, or \"neighborhood,\" schools) in order to take advantage of programs offered at select MPS schools or to avoid problems such as overcrowding and racial imbalance at their neighborhood schools.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121.54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121.54\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .04(5).

This is in contrast to MPS neighborhood schools, of which there is one for each attendance area within the city. MPS city-wide schools have special programs or areas of study such as the arts, International Baccalaureate, Montessori, language immersion, or gifted and talented programs. MPS does not offer these special programs in all of its high schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    3.3 SJA's Application to MPS for Busing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   SJA is an independent, private, female-only high school in Milwaukee. It provides its students, a majority of whom are racial minorities, an intellectually challenging college-preparatory International Baccalaureate program of study. SJA's approved attendance area, for the purposes of student transportation under Policy 4.04, is city-wide. For the 2016-17 school year, its enrollment was 145 students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   SJA believes that because its attendance area is city-wide, its students should fall under Section 4.04(5)(a), which, by its terms, applies only to city-wide public school students. That section provides a more generous busing scheme than section 4.04(2)(b), which applies to private school students. Section 4.04(5)(a) provides busing for students who live more than two miles from school, while section 4.04(2)(b) provides busing for students if they live more than two miles from school\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   more than one mile from public transportation. Additionally, section 4.04(2)(b) includes a requirement that the private school submit a roster of eligible students to MPS before the start of the school year, whereas section 4.04(5)(a)-and all other sections applying to public schools-does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 14, 2016, prior to the 2016-17 school year, SJA applied to MPS for transportation for SJA students it believed qualified for that benefit under MPS' transportation policy. SJA's initial roster included 62 of the 68 students involved in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   SJA submitted an updated roster on September 29, 2016 that included all 68 students. Those students have residences that are within Milwaukee and more than two miles walking distance from SJA, but not more than one mile walking distance from public transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   MPS denied SJA's request. Of the 68 students, 61 were denied transportation under section 4.04(2)(b) because they lived within one mile of a public bus stop. Six students were denied transportation under the same section because they were not on SJA's roster by July 1. One student was denied transportation under that section because MPS contended the student lived within two miles of SJA. SJA states that the student lives 2.1 miles from SJA, but the parties agree that even if SJA is correct, the student would have been denied transportation because the student lives within one mile of a public bus stop. SJA arranged and paid for transportation for the 2016-17 school year for those 68 students, and the students' parents assigned their transportation rights and benefits to SJA to facilitate this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On March 21, 2017, SJA filed this action against MPS on its own behalf and on behalf of the 68 students. SJA claims it has been harmed because MPS' transportation policy burdens its recruitment efforts and\n   because it was forced to provide transportation to its students, who should have qualified for MPS busing, at a cost of $108,200.00 for the 2016-17 school year. SJA alleges that the 68 students and their families have been harmed because SJA was forced to use a portion of the money they pay in tuition to provide transportation rather than other educational programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   SJA brings two claims in this case. The first is a civil rights claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for MPS' violation of SJA's and its students' Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection of law. The second is a state law claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20121.54\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 121.54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for MPS' violation of its statutory obligation to treat SJA students with \"reasonable uniformity\" as compared to public school students in Milwaukee with respect to transportation to school. Both of these claims share two bases: the disparate busing scheme and the private-school-only roster requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1 Equal Protection Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that \"no State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend XVI, \u00a7 1.

Section 1983 establishes a cause of action against any \"person\" who, acting under color of state law, \"subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the United States. The parties do not dispute that MPS is a state actor for the purposes of SJA's Section 1983 claim. The dispute is over the alleged constitutional deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On that question, the parties disagree at every turn. First, they disagree as to which type of equal protection claim SJA has alleged-a class-of-one claim or a claim based on a legislative classification. Second, they disagree on the appropriate level of scrutiny under which the Court is to review SJA's claim. Third, they disagree as to whether MPS has a rational basis for providing more generous busing to some public school students than it provides to private school students, and for requiring a roster from private schools but not from public schools. Each issue is addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1.1 MPS' Legislative Classification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The first issue the Court must resolve is whether SJA's equal protection claim is, as SJA says, based on a legislative classification or if it is instead, as MPS says, a \"class of one\" claim. MPS contends that because SJA's claim is of the class of one variety and because SJA has not identified a similarly situated class of persons that is treated more favorably under Policy 4.04, SJA's claim fails at the outset. If that were true, the Court need not continue its equal protection analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In an equal protection case where the plaintiff \"challenges a statute or ordinance that by its terms imposes regulatory burdens on a specific class of persons ..., there is no need to identify a\n   comparator; the classification appears in the text of the policy itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Monarch Beverage Co. v.

Its decision to allow students from all over the city to attend specialized schools and to allow some students to attend neighborhood schools other than their own, MPS argues, is rationally related to that purpose in light of the overcrowding and racial imbalance at some MPS neighborhood schools and MPS' inability to offer special programming at all of its schools.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264410\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/384/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This reasoning certainly supports MPS' attendance policy for its own schools, but it is a red herring here. That MPS was rationally motivated in allowing students to access special programming and move from overcrowded or racially imbalanced neighborhood schools is both true and irrelevant. The relevant question is whether MPS' decision to provide preferential busing to those students is rationally related to some legitimate purpose. As to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   question, MPS makes two points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, MPS states that \"when a pupil has to go to a school other than his or her designated attendance area school, it is not fair to require that pupil to either walk the extended distance or navigate public transportation for that distance, which may mean many transfers and far more stops along the way than a pupil transportation service.\" (Docket # 23 at 19). From this the Court discerns one legitimate purpose for MPS' provision of expanded busing to city-wide school students: convenient and safe student transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But this does not answer whether MPS' disparity of treatment between public city-wide school students and private school students is rationally related to that purpose. As SJA points out, a private school student attending a school with a city-wide attendance area faces the same challenges in her commute as does a student attending a public city-wide school. (Docket # 34 at 3). And there is nothing in the record to suggest that students attending MPS city-wide schools face longer or more dangerous commutes than students who attend private city-wide schools. Thus, the hazards of a long commute do not provide a rational basis for MPS to give expanded busing to certain of its own students but not to students who attend a city-wide private school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, MPS states that it would be prohibitively expensive to extend the expanded busing option to students who attend private city-wide schools. MPS' student transportation costs already exceed the amount it receives in state aid for transportation, and avoiding the additional cost (even if small in relation to MPS' overall transportation budget) serves the purpose of preserving the district's resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Racine Charter One\n   </em>\n   controls here. As discussed earlier, that case also involved a school district's decision not to provide busing to students who may attend a local school. The court found that the \"unique and additional costs that [the school district] would incur were it to provide [busing] to Charter One\" was a rational basis\n   for its refusal to bus the charter school students.\n   <em>\n    Racine Charter One\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n    424 F.3d at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Explaining this finding, the court noted that to accommodate Charter One students,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [the school district] would almost certainly be forced to alter its current busing routes. Some buses service more than one school, requiring the accommodation of not only the various, specific addresses of each passenger (both current riders and each added Charter One student), but also the coordination of potentially different start and end times at each school serviced. Such alterations would come with appreciable costs, be they the creation of new routes, the addition of more buses, or the elongation of bus routes requiring earlier pick-ups and later drop-offs. And while the record does not allow us to quantify these additional costs to [the school district] with any degree of certainty, we are confident that they are substantial enough to provide a rational basis for [the school district's] refusal to extend the busing benefit to Charter One students.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n    at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court went on to compare the size of Charter One with the size of the Racine school district, noting the latter is much larger and has many more challenges to manage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n    at 686-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court noted that Charter One could appeal to its benefactors for transportation funding whereas the school district was at the mercy of the taxpayers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n    at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   All of these cost-related concerns may also be reasonably said to apply in this case. Eliminating the bus stop rule for private city-wide schools would almost certainly require MPS to alter is current busing routes, as it would be transporting more and different students than it currently buses and for longer distances. MPS would also likely have to coordinate different start and end times for the schools serviced. True, it already does this for any private school students it already buses, but with more private school students qualifying for busing, some bus routes that previously only serviced public schools might have to service private schools with potentially different schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   These are hypothetical costs not presented with any detail by MPS, much less based on data, but the Court is bound to discern any and all rational bases for a law's disparate treatment when conducting rational basis review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190150\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/673/#p680\">\n    566 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12190150\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/673/#p680\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while these costs might not be colossal, indeed possibly less than the $108,200 SJA spent for the 2016-17 school year, this Court cannot say that they are appreciably less or different than the costs the\n   <em>\n    Racine Charter One\n   </em>\n   court found sufficient to justify denial of busing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1.3.2 Roster Submission Deadline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   MPS also has a rational basis for requiring private schools to submit a roster of students who desire busing for the coming school year but not requiring the same from public schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   MPS reports that the required roster provides MPS with relevant information concerning which private school students are eligible for transportation and allows MPS to make provisions for such transportation. Once MPS receives the roster, MPS staff members compare the information therein to its own information to ensure no student appears on both a private school and public school enrollment log. MPS staff members then use the addresses listed in the roster to determine which private school students are eligible for busing based on their distance from school and from the nearest bus stop. MPS does not need a roster for its own students because MPS has immediate access to the names and addresses of its own students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   SJA agrees that MPS needs a student roster from private schools so MPS knows who to bus and from where. However, MPS needs a roster of sorts for its own students at some point too, SJA counters, and MPS' imposition of a cutoff deadline for private school rosters and not for public school rosters is arbitrary and irrational. According to SJA, if MPS can provide busing for latecomers to MPS, it should provide busing to latecomers to private schools as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   MPS' decision to impose a roster submission deadline for private schools and not public schools finds rational support in administrative concerns. The rosters are necessary because, without them, MPS would have no information about private school students who need busing. Indeed, MPS knows nothing about what happens\n   at private schools like SJA unless those schools decide to share information. Given that MPS must process the roster information once received, it is rational for MPS to impose a roster submission deadline that allows time for processing before the school year begins. As for latecomers, the administrative tasks associated with providing busing for students enrolling late in MPS schools is presumably less than for students enrolling late at private schools, because MPS knows about its latecomers the moment they enroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   A legislative policy need not be perfectly efficient to pass muster under the rational basis test.

Indeed, SJA asserts throughout its equal protection briefing that because MPS has a statutory obligation to transport public and private school students with reasonable uniformity, MPS acted irrationally in expanding busing for public city-wide school students and not private city-wide school students. But whether MPS buses students in non-uniform way and whether that non-uniformity is rational are two different questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The latter question has been answered above. The former has not, but it is a question best suited for the state courts of Wisconsin.

Therefore, the benefit plan was rationally tailored to reward heterosexual couples who chose to marry.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 610.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Racine Charter One\n    </em>\n    , there is no indication that Charter One students were somehow more costly to transport than other students the district bused. Judge Cudahy pointed this out in a concurring opinion, explaining that \"[i]t is not rational to treat equally expensive or equally at-risk students differently based solely on their school affiliation. Indeed if [the school district's] cost-based arguments here can succeed, any government official could deny service to any individual, regardless of the dictates of government policy, based solely on the proposition that serving one additional person would cost more than not serving him or her.\"\n    <em>\n     Racine Charter One\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924754\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/677/\">\n     424 F.3d at 688-89\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Cudahy, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The same might be said of the SJA students in this case; there would be an additional cost to bus them, certainly, but not necessarily a unique cost, apart from whatever administrative cost MPS would incur to determine which private schools have city-wide attendance areas. Because\n    <em>\n     Racine Charter One\n    </em>\n    is controlling precedent, which applies the Supreme Court's rational basis jurisprudence to facts very similar to those here, this Court will not depart from its majority holding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Colby v. J.C. Penney Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1165288\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/811/1119/#p1123\">\n     811 F.2d 1119\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1123 (7th Cir. 1987) (to depart from appellate precedent, the district court must be \"powerfully convinced\" that the higher court would overrule its previous decision \"at the first available opportunity\"). Here, as in\n    <em>\n     Racine Charter One\n    </em>\n    , the cost of busing an additional class of students is a rational justification for the school district's policy not to bus them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
