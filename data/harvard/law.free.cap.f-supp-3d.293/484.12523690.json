Although these letters bear labels suggesting that they are motions for various forms of relief, we construe them to represent plaintiffs' opposition to Patel's motion to dismiss. None of them address the merits of Patel's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the district judge presiding over the plaintiffs' criminal case in this district, Judge Forrest, enjoined the defendants \"from filing any lawsuits against any counsel, court officer, or judicial officer connected to the criminal proceedings during its pendency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almaleh\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cr-00025 (S.D.N.Y.

In that case, the Second Circuit held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   the district court, in determining whether or not to restrict a litigant's future access to the courts, should consider the following factors: (1) the litigant's history of litigation and in particular whether it entailed vexatious, harassing or duplicative lawsuits; (2) the litigant's motive in pursuing the litigation, e.g., does the litigant have an objective good faith expectation of prevailing?; (3) whether the litigant is represented by counsel; (4) whether the litigant has caused needless expense to other parties or has posed an unnecessary burden on the courts and their personnel; and (5) whether other sanctions would be adequate to protect the courts and other parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583425\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/19/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583425\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/19/\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These five factors strongly support such a bar here. As noted in the Florida Federal Action, plaintiffs have together filed 14 lawsuits (15 including the Florida Federal Action) that have been dismissed\n   <em>\n    sua\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sponte\n   </em>\n   by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

There is no reason to believe plaintiffs had a good faith view they could prevail in this case in light of the fact that they did not address the res judicata argument in their opposition papers and continued to file motions rather than responding to the defendant's arguments. While the plaintiffs here are pro se, we do not view this factor as strongly counseling against a litigation bar. The plaintiffs have posed needless expense and burden to Patel, who had to file motion papers seeking dismissal of the instant action, as well as burden to other named defendants and to the courts in the many other frivolous lawsuits plaintiffs have filed. Finally, we do not think any other sanction would protect the courts and the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, an injunction should issue barring plaintiffs from filing any further lawsuit against Patel or his firm based on any conduct occurring prior to the date of the injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore v.
