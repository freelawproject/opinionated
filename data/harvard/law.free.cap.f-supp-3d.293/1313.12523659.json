INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Under Alabama law, an individual of voting age who commits a \"felony involving moral turpitude\" forfeits his or her right to vote. Ala. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 177 (b). Restoration of the right to vote is available only after the felon has completed all the terms of his or her sentence, which includes full payment of all fines, court costs, fees, and restitution.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015-22-36.1\">\n    Ala.

In this putative class action against the State of Alabama and its officials, Plaintiffs contend that these laws-section 177(b) of Article VIII of the Alabama Constitution of 1901, and section 15 - 22 - 36.1 of the Alabama Code-violate the federal constitution and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that, due to their felony convictions or their financial inability to satisfy the monetary obligations associated with their convictions, they cannot vote in the State of Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a prior Order, the court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and noted that a memorandum opinion would follow. (Doc. # 75.) This is that opinion. For the reasons to follow, Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, and 15 are due to be dismissed either for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted or\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Ala. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 182 (repealed 1996). Eighty-four years after the adoption of section 182, on a challenge to its application to misdemeanors, the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Thus, the\n   Court struck down section 182's disenfranchisement provision as applied to misdemeanor offenses on grounds that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Court expressly declined to decide whether section 182\"would be valid if enacted today without any impermissible motivation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200061\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/222/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A decade after the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , the Alabama Legislature replaced section 182.

Of significance here, the court found that HB 282, which clarified for Plaintiffs whether their Alabama felony convictions qualified as felonies \"involving moral turpitude\" under section 177 (b), mooted their vagueness challenges (Counts 6 through 10) to section 177 (b)'s moral turpitude phrase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims' mootness is\n   a jurisdictional flaw that precludes a merits resolution of these claims.

Those factors are: (1) \"[t]he impact of the official action-whether it bears more heavily on one race than another\"; (2) the historical context of the law, (3) the events leading up to the challenged decision; (4) departures from normal procedures; (5) departures from typical substantive, decision-making practices; and (6) \"[t]he legislative or administrative history ..., especially contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or reports.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n    at 266-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, without suggesting any view on whether Plaintiffs ultimately will be able to prove intentional discrimination and having considered Defendants' arguments, the court finds, under\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   , that the law's impact, its historical context, and the events leading up to the enactment of section 177 (b) are sufficient to allege plausibly a discriminatory intent to disenfranchise black voters. First, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts of a disproportionate impact of section 177 (b) on the black voting-age population, as compared to the white voting-age population. According to the allegations, section 177 (b) disenfranchises 15% of the black voting-age population in Alabama but only 5% of the white voting-age population. (Compl. \u00b6 136.) Hence, the black voting-age population is three times as likely as the white voting-age population to suffer disenfranchisement under section 177 (b). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 122 (stating that in 1995 \"roughly 70 percent of Alabamans in prison were black\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs have summarized the undisputed \"well established and documented\" history of racially motivated disenfranchisement laws in Alabama. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-105.) It is alleged that, Southern states, including Alabama, have used felon disenfranchisement dating back to Reconstruction \"as a means of achieving the wholesale disenfranchisement of blacks.\" (Compl. \u00b6 93.) Significantly, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , as recounted in the Complaint and elsewhere in this opinion, evidences that the Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901 purposely produced a post-Reconstruction state constitution intended to discriminatorily disenfranchise the state's black voting-age population. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-100);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200061\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/222/\">\n    471 U.S. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200061\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/222/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901 was \"part of a movement that swept the post-Reconstruction South to disenfranchise blacks\"). This historical context cannot be ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, as to the sequence of events leading up to section 177 (b), Plaintiffs allege that the racially discriminatory animus motivating the adoption in the 1901 Alabama Constitution of section 182's provision disenfranchising individuals convicted of \"any ... crime involving moral turpitude\" infects section 177 (b) because section 177 (b) lifts the phrase \"moral turpitude\" directly from the 1901 Alabama Constitution. (Compl. \u00b6 164.) Plaintiffs contend that the legislature's adoption of the phrase \"moral turpitude\" as the disenfranchising guidepost in section 177 (b), without clarification of the phrase's meaning and denunciation of its racial heritage, makes it plausible that its motives included a racially impermissible one. In particular, Plaintiffs point out that an Alabama official criticized the inclusion of the phrase \"moral turpitude\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   as having a dubious, ignoble usage and history\" and its inclusion in section 177 (b) as being \"suspect.\" (Compl. \u00b6 121 (noting that an attorney, while employed by a state agency, criticized the inclusion of the phrase \"moral turpitude\" in section 177 (b) as being \"suspect\" and as having a \"dubious, ignoble usage and history\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   These allegations show a connection between the past and the present that is sufficient to nudge the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment claims \"across the line from conceivable to plausible,\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , even if it appears \"that a recovery is very remote and unlikely,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It is undisputed that racial animus motivated Alabama lawmakers in 1901 to disenfranchise black voters under the guise of a facially neutral law. Whether the modern-day circumstances that Plaintiffs allege-the law's allegedly continued disproportionate impact on the black voting-age population and section 177 (b)'s reincorporation of a purportedly standardless standard (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"moral turpitude\")-are enough to prevail on the merits of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and Fifteenth Amendment claims is not the question today. At this phase, when the well-pleaded facts are taken as true, Plaintiffs have alleged \"enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that is sufficient for the claims to survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny and to proceed to the discovery phase where an evidentiary sifting on intent will occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants persist, though, that the Eleventh Circuit's en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , which was on appeal from a summary judgment ruling, the Eleventh Circuit rejected an equal protection claim that racial animus motivated the adoption of Florida's 1968 reenactment of a century-old disfranchisement law.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , at least presently, is distinguishable on three grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, the cases are in different procedural postures.

Code \u00a7 15-22-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This alternative statutory avenue for a convicted felon to secure re-enfranchisement at first blush would seem to indicate that, in Alabama, like in Florida, \"the right to vote can be granted to felons who cannot afford to pay restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2015-22-36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue, though, that restoration of voting rights only through the pathway of a discretionary pardon with the potential for a fine remittance erects a barrier to voting based on the felon's ability to pay. Namely, indigent felons, as opposed to felons with financial means, have only one of two state-provided methods to obtain the franchise and cannot pursue what Plaintiffs contend is the more preferable method of automatic restoration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, the court declines to dismiss Counts 13, 14, and 15 based upon the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision, which is the sole authority upon which Defendants rely. At least four reasons compel this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court's analysis of the plaintiffs' poll tax claims is sparse, relegated to a short discussion in an introductory footnote. The bulk of that decision focused on other federal constitutional and statutory claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, Defendants analogize section 15-22-36.1 to Florida's Rules of Executive Clemency, which were at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n   But there is scant context in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   from which to construct a meaningful parallel between Florida's and Alabama's re-enfranchisement laws. The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision does not provide a citation for those rules or quote them, and Defendants do not submit the rules or provide meaningful discussion of their terms. Against this backdrop, it would be unwise to predicate a finding that section 15-22-36.1 does not deprive felons of \"the restoration of the franchise based on ability to pay\" on the bare fact that the Eleventh Circuit has found that a different Florida law does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Third, it is noted again that this action stands in a different procedural posture than the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case. The claims in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   reached the circuit on cross-motions for summary judgment, not on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Fourth, Defendants do not address whether the distinctions, noted by Plaintiffs, between Alabama's and Florida's paths to re-enfranchisement (two paths versus one) are material ones. Suffice it to say, at this juncture, these distinctions separate this action from\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   So the court turns to Defendants' other arguments, which are made with the assumption that Alabama law requires a felon to pay LFOs as a condition of re-enfranchisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Count 13: The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendants contend that requiring convicted felons to pay LFOs as a condition of re-enfranchisement invokes rational basis review under the Fourteenth Amendment and that the State easily has four \"legitimate interests that are rationally related to the requirement that felons pay all [LFOs] before having their rights restored.\" (Doc. # 43, at 63.) Plaintiffs counter that none of the asserted reasons \"meets the low standard of rationality, much less the heightened 'compelling state interest' standard [the State] must meet.\" (Doc. # 48, at 86.) Hence, a preliminary dispute exists about which level of scrutiny applies in the equal protection analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor the Eleventh Circuit has addressed the level of scrutiny applicable to equal protection challenges to felon-re-enfranchisement laws. Even if this court were to align with the weight of non-binding authority and\n   apply rational basis review, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is premature on Defendants' thin arguments. Defendants provide only snippets from cases in a string citation to support their position that there are multiple rational bases for conditioning re-enfranchisement on the payment of fines, costs, and restitution. (Doc. # 43, at 64.) But even a cursory review of these cases reveals notable distinctions that Defendants have failed to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   To illustrate, in\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

In other words, the Complaint's theory recognizes no difference in the aims of Alabama's laws on disenfranchisement and re-enfranchisement. For this reason, as Defendants urge, Count 15, like Count 3, cannot survive in the wake of the Eleventh Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision: \"Congress never intended the [VRA] to reach felon disenfranchisement provisions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013835\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/1214/#p1217\">\n    405 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But because the purpose of the latter statute is to designate a reasonable ground of eligibility for voting, this law is sustained as a nonpenal exercise of the power to regulate the franchise.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 596 (internal footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Defendants' collection of cases sheds light on whether felon-disenfranchisement laws have \"been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p92\">\n     538 U.S. at 97\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030411\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/84/#p92\">\n     123 S.Ct. 1140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
