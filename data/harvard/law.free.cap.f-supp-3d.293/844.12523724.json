The\n   motion is fully briefed and ripe for determination. For the reasons stated below, the motion to dismiss (Document No. 8) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff worked for Defendants at their retail store in Conway, Arkansas. Her duties included conducing retail transactions and overseeing some of the day-to-day operations of the store. Her complaint alleges that Defendant willfully violated the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (FLSA) and the Arkansas Minimum Wage Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-4-201\">\n    Ark.

She claims she was misclassified as a salaried employee and was paid a total of $500 per month though she regularly worked more than forty hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants answered and denied that Plaintiff was classified as an exempt salaried employee and denies that Plaintiff ever worked in excess of 40 hours per week. They also filed a counterclaim alleging conversion by (1) selling Defendant's retail products at discounted rates without authority; (2) taking possession of Defendant's retail products such as snacks, cigarettes, and cigars without authority; and (3) taking possession of Defendant's store management documents related to employee schedules, pay rates, and check stubs without authority. It was the theft of these items that lead Defendant to fire Plaintiff in July of 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). For the Court to have supplemental jurisdiction, the counterclaim must \"form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact if they \"are such that [the asserting party] would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v.

To prove her claim, Plaintiff will have to prove that she was a non-exempt employee of Defendants, she was not paid at least the minimum wage for each hour she worked, she worked in excess of forty hours in certain weeks, and that she was not paid overtime. To prove their counterclaim for conversion, Defendants would have to prove that Plaintiff wrongfully committed a distinct act of dominion over the property of Defendants-retail products and some store management documents-which is a denial of or is inconsistent with their rights as owners.\n   <em>\n    Hartness v. Nuckles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835827\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/558/\">\n    2015 Ark. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6835827\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/475/558/\">\n    475 S.W.3d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (2015). While there would undoubtedly be some overlap in witnesses, these two claims do not require the same factual or legal arguments and would not rely on the same set of facts. See\n   <em>\n    Escobedo v. Oswego Junction Enterprises LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-0682,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203130643\">\n    2017 WL 3130643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 24, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants argue that they lack the ability to defend Plaintiff's wage allegations because Plaintiff allegedly stole some documents pertaining to Plaintiff's employment schedule and wages. Whether Plaintiff wrongfully took documents that now impede Defendants' ability to defend this action can be addressed in the context of the complaint. Defendants' do not need a counterclaim for conversion to raise the issue of the alleged theft and its impact on their defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This findings is consistent with the purpose of the FLSA. \"The substantive sections of the FLSA, narrowly focusing on minimum wage rates and maximum working hours, bear out its limited purposes\" of achieving certain minimum labor standards.\n   <em>\n    Lyon v. Whisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414487\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/758/\">\n    45 F.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.
