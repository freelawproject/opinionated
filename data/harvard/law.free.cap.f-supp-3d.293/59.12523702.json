BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 9, 2017, President Donald Trump fired James Comey as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the fallout from that event, news rapidly circulated about numerous private conversations\n   between the two men over the preceding months. The exchanges left the former Director feeling unnerved and, apparently, wanting a paper trail. On June 8, Comey testified publicly that while still in office, he had created several contemporaneous memoranda documenting up to nine conversations with the President. The content of those memos has since been the subject of intense public speculation and is the focus of these consolidated cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, which include various news organizations and non-profits, all sought copies of the so-called Comey Memos via a tried-and-true method: The Freedom of Information Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The Government denied each request, claiming that the release of these documents would interfere with the Office of Special Counsel's ongoing investigation into links between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign team. Plaintiffs then brought these suits, and both sides now seek summary judgment. After reviewing the Memos\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , as well as receiving a sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proffer from the Special Counsel's Office, the Court agrees with the Government's assessment. As it prevails here, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain in the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   published a report about an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and the then-Director, said to have taken place on February 14 of that year. During this one-on-one conversation, the President allegedly referenced a potential investigation into his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia, telling Comey, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\" Michael S.

Plaintiffs Daily Caller News Foundation, non-profit organizations Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, and USA Today (the business name of Gannett Satellite Information Network), along with its reporter Brad Heath, the James Madison Project, and journalists Garrett Graff and Lachlan Markay, all submitted FOIA requests to the same end.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21, 30, 37, 44. Some Plaintiffs (including the USA Today group and Freedom Watch) sought additional related records, which are outside the scope of the instant summary-judgment motions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    , \u00b6 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Department of Justice responded to each request by letter dated June 16, 2017, invoking Exemption 7(A) to withhold all documents. To wit, it stated: \"The records responsive to your request are law enforcement records. There is a pending or prospective law enforcement proceeding relevant to these responsive records, and the release of the information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exhs.

The Court consolidated their cases on July 31, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Four months later, the Government moved for partial summary judgment as to all requests related to the Comey Memos, and Plaintiffs, in turn, filed cross-motions for the same. To bolster its case, the Department of Justice also sought leave to introduce an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   affidavit from David W. Archey, a Deputy Assistant Director with the Counterintelligence Division, who currently supervises all FBI personnel assigned to the investigation into Russia's interference with the 2016 Presidential election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   23. After the parties finished briefing, the Court granted the Government's request and ordered, at Plaintiffs' behest, that it also produce all withheld Memos for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of Jan. 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court reviewed those submissions and, out of an abundance of caution, thought it helpful to seek more specifics as to the Memos' connection with an ongoing investigation. It therefore asked that an attorney from the Office of Special Counsel proffer such information. Michael R. Dreeben, who serves as Counsel to the Special Counsel, did so in a sealed, on-the-record\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   session. Finally, in response to this Court's follow-up questions about that sealed proffer, the Government submitted the Third Declaration of David W. Archey\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47.

But the caselaw aligns with common sense. The public-domain doctrine exists because release of a \"truly public\" document can do little harm to the agency's interests; in that case, the exemption \"can serve no purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Cottone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11563272,3671225\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/550/\">\n    193 F.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the Memos are possibly held by one person outside the agency, and the Bureau and Special Counsel still have something to lose by their dissemination to the broader public. The Court therefore holds that Comey's release of any documents to his close friend does not waive the agency's otherwise valid Exemption 7(A) defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    3. Other Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs also raise an array of other arguments for waiver, but the Court can dispose of each in short order. First, USA Today contends that this Court has discretion to treat \"President Trump's public denial of the substantive accuracy of Director Comey's claims [as] incorporating by reference the substance of what Director Comey said occurred.\" USA Today Br. at 12. Plaintiff's logic is a bit hard to parse, and it admits to lacking any \"case law on-point\" for its position, but the upshot seems to be that the President's denials somehow constitute an \"official disclosure\" of any referenced Memo's contents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. This theory suffers at least two flaws. First, Trump repudiated Comey's\n   <em>\n    testimony\n   </em>\n   ; he never discussed nor purported to know the contents of the Memos themselves. He therefore could not have \"incorporated\" that information by reference into any official disclosure. Second, the President's denials hardly recited any portion of the Memos verbatim and thus are not as \"specific\" as the records sought nor an exact \"match\" for their content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n    628 F.3d at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Daily Caller and Judicial Watch next argue that the FBI \"officially acknowledged\" Comey's testimony when it failed to \"dispute, disavow, [or] even disagree\" with it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DCNF Br. at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JW Br. at 15. Far from \"an official and documented disclosure,\" however, the agency's silence is just that-silence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n    628 F.3d at 620-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It suggests that voluntarily disclosing this connection somehow \"undermines\" the agency's entire Exemption 7(A) defense, such that it must now disclose the Memo\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff invokes\n   <em>\n    Labow v.

Instead, Justice seeks to protect the\n   <em>\n    contents\n   </em>\n   of the Memos, as release would reveal \"the level of detail in the memos, the extent to which they corroborate Mr. Comey's testimony, and the extent to which they contain information that was not the subject of his testimony.\" Def.
