He argues that his sentence was based on a mandatory minimum that was erroneously applied to him and that his trial and sentence violated his rights under the United States Constitution and the Speedy Trial Act. For the reasons set forth below, petitioner's \u00a7 2255 motion is granted and the judgment in this case is vacated pending resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 15, 2010, petitioner was indicted on felon-in-possession and drug trafficking charges. On February 23, 2012, I granted petitioner's request to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and appointed his former defense lawyer as standby counsel. On April 3, 2012, trial began. After the jury was sworn, petitioner and the government gave opening statements. When petitioner did not return after the lunch break, I dismissed the jury for the day and issued a bench warrant for petitioner's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Four days later, petitioner was arrested. Magistrate Judge Coffin ordered him detained. On April 11, 2012, I granted petitioner's motion for a mistrial and ordered a competency examination. Based on the results of that examination, I found petitioner was competent to stand trial and to continue to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 19, 2013, a second trial began. After the jury was sworn, court recessed for lunch. At that point, petitioner and the government informed me they had agreed to a stipulated-facts trial on the first charge in the indictment only. Petitioner signed a written waiver of his right to a jury trial. Based on the parties' stipulations, I found petitioner guilty on the first charge, felony possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Pursuant to the parties' agreement, the government stated it intended to dismiss the remaining charges at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 14, 2014, I sentenced petitioner to fifteen years' imprisonment, to be followed by five years' supervised release. Adopting the Presentence Report in full, I concluded that fifteen years' imprisonment was the statutory mandatory minimum because petitioner had three previous state-law convictions for manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance, a \"serious drug offense\" within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminals Act (\"ACCA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government then dismissed the remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, petitioner was represented by counsel. He challenged his conviction and sentence on several grounds, arguing that his waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was invalid, that the guns discovered during a 2006 search were found pursuant to an illegal search warrant, that his state drug convictions were not serious drug offenses under the ACCA because the Oregon law does not impose a statutory maximum of ten years or more, and that his conviction violated the Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

About a month later, he filed a motion to appoint counsel. I denied the request for counsel, finding that petitioner had not met the standards under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(a)(2)(B). I did, however, grant petitioner's request for an extension of time to file his reply. The reply was initially due September 7, 2017; in a letter dated September 8, 2017, petitioner asked for a seven day extension. I granted him an eighteen day extension and set a new deadline of September 25, 2017. Although petitioner's reply was not docketed until October 2, 2017, he states that he mailed it on September 25. Accordingly, I have considered all arguments made in the reply brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his \u00a7 2255 petition, petitioner asserts five claims for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   His first, second, and fourth claims concern the use of his prior Oregon convictions as predicate offenses under the ACCA.

In\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, sought review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals that he was subject to deportation because his conviction for delivery of a controlled substance under Oregon law qualified as an \"aggravated felony\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the ACCA mandates a fifteen-year minimum sentence in cases where a defendant convicted of a firearms offense has three prior convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). As noted, at petitioner's sentencing, I concluded the ACCA's mandatory minimum applied to petitioner based on three convictions in Oregon state court. Each of those convictions was for manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of the same statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval.\n   </em>\n   Petitioner argues that\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   's holding that the Oregon statute is overbroad applies in the ACCA context as well. He contends that, due to that overbreadth, his convictions under Oregon law are not categorically \"serious drug offense[s]\" within the meaning of the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Matters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government suggests several reasons why this Court lacks authority to consider petitioner's first claim for relief. I begin by considering whether any of those arguments has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government first argues that petitioner's challenge to the categorization of his prior convictions as serious drug offenses is barred by the relitigation doctrine. That doctrine provides that \"[w]hen a [petitioner] has raised a claim and has been given a full and fair opportunity to litigate it on direct appeal, that claim may not be used as a basis for a subsequent \u00a7 2255 petition.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11183196\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/1132/#p1139\">\n    231 F.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (9th Cir. 2000). But the relitigation doctrine does not bar this claim. Petitioner did not have a full and fair opportunity to argue that his prior convictions were not serious drug offenses under\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   was not decided until January 2017, more than six months after his conviction became final on direct review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ordinarily, the failure to raise a claim on direct review bars a petitioner from asserting that same claim in a \u00a7 2255 petition unless he can show cause and prejudice for the procedural default.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Withers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198558\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1055/#p1064\">\n    638 F.3d 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1064 (9th Cir. 2011). But procedural default is an affirmative defense that can be waived by the government.\n   <em>\n    McDaniels v. Kirkland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088740\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/770/\">\n    813 F.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 n.3 (9th Cir. 2015). The government has not argued that petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   claim is procedurally defaulted. Accordingly, petitioner is not obligated to establish cause and prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government next contends\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   cannot be applied retroactively on collateral review under the rule set out in\n   <em>\n    Teague v. Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/#p311\">\n    489 U.S. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/#p311\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/#p311\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). But\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to this case for two reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   limits only the retroactive application of new\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reina-Rodriguez v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827592\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1182/#p1188\">\n    655 F.3d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1188 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"If the new rule is not founded on constitutional concerns, it does not implicate\n   <em>\n    Teague.\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   was not a constitutional decision; it was a statutory interpretation decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ezell v.

Second,\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   restricts retroactive application of procedural rules, not substantive ones. When a decision \"alter[s] the conduct that substantively qualifies\" as a predicate offense \"under the categorical approach,\" it announces a substantive rule.\n   <em>\n    Reina-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827592\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1182/#p1188\">\n    655 F.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   therefore\n   may be retroactively applied on collateral review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, the government argues that this Court lacks authority to consider petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   argument because of\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Parry\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued his Oregon state convictions for delivery of methamphetamine were not serious drug offenses within the meaning of the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n    at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the ACCA, a conviction qualifies as a \"serious drug offense\" if it is \"an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(A)(ii). In\n   <em>\n    Parry\n   </em>\n   , the defendant \"concede[d] that [his prior convictions] involve[d] distributing a controlled substance,\" but argued that there was a mismatch between the state crimes and the ACCA regarding penalty.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n    479 F.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the defendant argued that the Oregon statute was overbroad because, under the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, the maximum penalty for delivery of methamphetamine was 90 months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument, noting that the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines set out the presumptive sentence, not the maximum sentence, and that the applicable\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   maximum for Class B felonies like delivery of methamphetamine was ten years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842797\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/722/#p726\">\n    at 724-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Neither\n   <em>\n    Parry\n   </em>\n   nor any other Ninth Circuit decision addresses whether Oregon's drug delivery statute, when compared to the ACCA, is overbroad as to\n   <em>\n    delivery.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This brings me to the merits of petitioner's argument. The question is whether\n   petitioner's prior convictions for delivery of a controlled substance are predicate offenses under the ACCA, thereby triggering the statute's fifteen-year mandatory minimum. Petitioner argues that the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   makes clear that his prior convictions are not predicate offenses and that the mandatory minimum never should have been applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Determining whether a state conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate is often difficult: state criminal statutes are not uniform, so although all fifty states have laws on the books prohibiting delivery of a controlled substance, the text of those statutes varies from state to state.

Both the ACCA and the immigration statute in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   concern drug offenses, but the two laws are not textually identical. Under the immigration statute, a conviction may subject an immigrant to removal proceedings if it is for an \"aggravated felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii). \"Aggravated felony\" is further defined in the statute to include any \"drug trafficking crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B).

But did his actions\n   <em>\n    involve\n   </em>\n   distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine? Viewed in the light of the federal case law summarized above, this is a close question. On the one hand, the defendant was convicted for telling a potential lender that if he provided money to post bail for a third person, that third person would help the lender get cocaine. Giving \"involving\" its broadest construction, the statements are related or connected with the illegal drug trade. On the other hand, the relationship to that trade was rather tangential: the\n   <em>\n    Self\n   </em>\n   defendant did not possess the drugs, never intended to possess the drugs, was not going to pay or be paid for the drugs, and talked about obtaining the drugs only in nonspecific terms. Arguably, the connection between the\n   <em>\n    Self\n   </em>\n   defendant's actions and the illegal drug trade is more tenuous than the connection between that trade and the typical case of simple possession; after all, a person who possesses a controlled substance for personal use generally obtained that substance from a distributor.

The district court has wide latitude when conducting\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , and petitioner has not shown that\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in this case impaired his ability to \"test the jury for bias or partiality[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Goland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524201\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/1449/#p1454\">\n    959 F.2d 1449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1454 (9th Cir. 1992). And both this Court and the Ninth Circuit considered and rejected petitioner's contentions\n   regarding waiver of his right to counsel and warrants obtained without probable cause. Appellate counsel has no obligation to make frivolous arguments, so petitioner's Sixth Amendment argument fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

He fleshes this claim out in some detail in the reply brief. But a petition under \u00a7 2255 cannot be used to collaterally attack state convictions.\n   <em>\n    Daniels v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301278\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/374/#p382\">\n    532 U.S. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301278\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/374/#p382\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301278\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/374/#p382\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). If petitioner has problems with his state convictions, he must begin by pursing the appropriate state post-conviction remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, petitioner's fifth claim, that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act were violated, is barred because Speedy Trial Act arguments are waived if they are not raised before trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Petitioner did not make a Speedy Trial Act argument before trial, and because he represented himself at trial, he cannot revive his Speedy Trial Act claim through an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons stated above, petitioner's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence (doc. 292) is GRANTED. The judgment in petitioner's criminal proceeding (doc. 256) is VACATED. I will direct my Courtroom Deputy to set a date for resentencing, at which time petitioner may submit objections to his Presentence Report pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(1)(D) and both sides may argue for an appropriate and lawful sentence. Counsel will be appointed to represent petitioner at resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Petitioner was convicted under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20475.992\">\n     Or.
