Currently before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court heard oral arguments on December 13, 2017. Counsel Enrique Martinez appeared for Plaintiffs and counsel Ian Blade Wieland appeared for Defendants. No objectors appeared at the hearing. The Court provided the parties with the opportunity to file supplemental briefing. Having considered the moving papers, the declarations and exhibits attached thereto, arguments presented at the December 13, 2017 hearing, as well as the\n   Court's file, the Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Danell Custom Harvesting, LLC is a California company doing business in Kings County, State of California. (Compl. \u00b6 14.) Defendant Danell Custom Harvesting LLC is a company that develops, manufactures, and sells specialized equipment and parts for harvesting purposes and provides machinery and personnel to client dairies at their premises to harvest, transport, and weigh wheat and corn that is used for animal feed (\"silage\"). (Compl. \u00b6 21.) Defendant Danell Custom Harvesting, LLC is co-owned by Defendants Rance Danell, Eric Danell, David Danell, and Justin Danell. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Danell Custom Harvesting LLC's day to day operations and wage and hour practices are managed by Defendants Rance Danell, Eric Danell, David Danell, and Justin Danell. (Compl. \u00b6 21.) Defendants Rance Danell, Eric Danell, David Danell, and Justin Danell regularly visit and oversee operations at the Danell Custom Shop and at numerous customer sites where the putative class members worked. (Compl. \u00b6 22.) These defendants make decisions regarding the scheduling, working conditions, and hiring and termination decisions. (Compl. \u00b6 22.) They also exercise control over the wages, hours, or working conditions. (Compl. \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Danell Custom Harvesting LLC employs five groups of workers: 1) mechanics who service cars and trucks and develop parts at their shop (\"mechanics\"); 2) maintenance workers who service and clean agricultural equipment at their shop (\"maintenance workers\"); 3) farm equipment operators who work in the fields harvesting (\"operators\"); 4) truck drivers who transport silage from the fields to the dairy (\"drivers\"); and 5) weighers who weigh the silage for billing purposes (\"weighers\"). (Compl. \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants employ a large team of mechanics who service trucks, forklifts, the defendants' personal race cars, and the defendants' family vehicles. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Some of the mechanics also do welding, painting, and machinist duties. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) The mechanics are paid an overtime rate after working more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) A meal break is provided for mechanics after they have worked six hours in their shift. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Although the mechanics typically work more than a 10 hour day, they are not provided with a second meal period. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Sometimes the mechanics will work twelve or more hours per day and are not provided with a third rest break. (Compl. \u00b6 24.) Mechanics must purchase and use their own tools to work for Defendants despite being paid less than double the California minimum wage. (Compl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants also employ maintenance workers who service and clean agricultural equipment, including choppers, swathers, and dozers at their shop. (Compl. \u00b6 25.) Maintenance workers are subjected to the same conditions as the mechanics. (Compl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants also employ operators who handle farm machinery such as dozers and choppers to harvest corn or wheat at Defendants' clients' fields. (Compl. \u00b6 26.) The operators typically work more than 12 hours per day without being provided meal and rest periods and must eat while operating their vehicles. (Compl. \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The truck drivers transport silage from Defendants' clients' fields to their dairies. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Around mid-2016, Defendants began paying their truck drivers at an overtime rate when they worked more\n   than 8 hours in a day. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Previously, truck drivers were not paid overtime until they worked more than 10 hours in a day or sixty hours per work week. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Truck drivers have never been provided with meal and rest periods. (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Truck drivers typically work more than 12 hours per day and are required to eat while they are driving their trucks and delivering the silage. (Compl. \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Weighers work at the premises of Defendants' clients weighing and recording the silage brought by the truck drivers. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Weighers are paid an overtime rate after working 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Although weighers typically work more than 12 hours per day, they are not provided with meal and rest periods and must eat while performing their work. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) Weighers must also purchase and use their own equipment, such as tables and chairs, and are not fully reimbursed for using their own vehicles. (Compl. \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Rodriguez was employed by Defendants as a maintenance worker at their shop from approximately May 2012 to May 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff Infante has been employed as a maintenance worker at their shop since approximately June 2012 to the present. (Compl. \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff Garcia was employed as a shop mechanic and maintenance worker in Defendants' shop from approximately June 2015 to September 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff Bravo has been employed by Defendants as a maintenance worker and farm equipment operator from approximately 1998 to the present. (Compl. \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff Patino was employed by Defendants as a weigher from approximately 2004 to September 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff Orozco was employed by Defendants as a truck driver from approximately November 2014 to June 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff Ortiz has been employed by Defendants as a truck driver from approximately July 2014 to the present. (Compl. \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 7, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a class and collective action alleging failure to pay overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ; failure to pay overtime wages in violation of California Labor Code sections 510, 1194 and IWC wage orders; failure to provide meal and rest periods in violation of California Labor Code section 226.7 and IWC wage orders; failure to furnish accurate wage statements in violation of California Labor Code section 226 ; indemnification of work related expenses, California Labor Code section 2802 ; waiting time penalties, California Labor Code section 203 ; Unfair Business Practices in violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq. ; and civil penalties for violation of the California Labor Code section 2699.

(ECF No. 13.) On June 9, 2017, the action was stayed for the parties to engage in mediation. (ECF No. 24.) On October 16, 2017, the stay was lifted. (ECF No. 27.) Plaintiffs' filed a motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement on November 22, 2017. (ECF No. 30.) A hearing on the motion for preliminary approval was held on December 13, 2017, after which Plaintiffs were granted the opportunity to file supplemental briefing. (ECF Nos. 31, 32.) On January 17, 2018, Plaintiffs filed supplemental briefing to address the issues raised at the December 13, 2017 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   An informal teleconference was conducted on January 23, 2018, to address several issues the Court identified in the documents upon review.
