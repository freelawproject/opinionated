REAL, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Counts Four, Five, and Six of Plaintiff's Complaint, filed on November 21, 2017, and Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Counts Four, Five, and Six of Plaintiff's Complaint, filed on January 12, 2018. (Dkts. 49, 53). Having considered briefing by the parties, briefing by amici curiae, and oral argument of counsel, this Court issues the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Congress created a grant program to support local governments in hiring officers for deployment in community-oriented policing (\"COPS\"). The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), headed by Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions III (\"Attorney General\"), administers this grant program through the \"COPS Office.\" The COPS Office administers the COPS Hiring Program (\"CHP\") grant, which \"provides funding directly to law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Each fiscal year, the COPS Office issues applications for the CHP grant and selects local governments to receive funding. Because funds are limited, the COPS Office created this scoring system to best allocate the funds: Community Policing (50% of score), Crime (30% of score), and Fiscal Health (20% of score). The COPS Office also awards \"additional consideration\" bonus points but does not disclose their relative weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fiscal year (\"FY\") 2017 application cycle for CHP grants, the COPS Office added a \"focus area\" called \"Illegal Immigration.\" The COPS Office explained that additional consideration may be given to applicants that partner with federal law enforcement to address illegal immigration. On September 12, 2017, the COPS Office sent an e-mail with an attached \"Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation\" form that each applicant could sign to qualify for the additional consideration points. The form required applicants to certify implementation of \"rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices\" granting federal immigration authorities (1) access to detention facilities to ask aliens and suspected aliens about their immigration status and (2) at least 48 hours' notice of their expected release from custody (\"Challenged Considerations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Los Angeles has applied for a CHP grant in 39% of all cycles since inception. It received CHP grants in 2012 and 2016, the last two times it applied. It also applied for a FY 2017 grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Los Angeles filed its Complaint and an application seeking to preliminarily enjoin Defendants from imposing the Challenged Considerations. On October 12, 2017, Defendants declared they had already selected grant awardees and Los Angeles was not among them. They also declared that Los Angeles would not have received a grant even if it\n   had qualified for the additional bonus points. On October 16, 2017, Los Angeles withdrew its preliminary injunction application citing Defendants' declaration and explaining that it could not secure timely relief in advance of the CHP award decisions. Los Angeles now seeks to enjoin Defendants from imposing the Challenged Considerations in future grant cycles. To that end, both Los Angeles and Defendants move for summary judgment on Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Los Angeles filed its Complaint promptly upon notification that Defendants would award bonus points based on compliance with the Challenged Considerations and before funds were distributed. As Los Angeles did not certify compliance with these conditions, it could not fairly compete with those competitors that did. Therefore, Los Angeles suffered ongoing competitive injury at the time it filed suit and properly sought to enjoin Defendants from creating an uneven playing field. Defendants do not challenge application of the remaining standing elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants instead argue the case is now moot because the COPS Office has since awarded all FY 2017 grants. \"Mootness [is] the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\"\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

Under this exception, (1) the challenged action must be too short in duration to fully litigate before the claim expires, and (2) there must be a \"reasonable expectation\" that the plaintiff will again be subject to the challenged action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=195%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This case is not moot because Los Angeles' harm is capable of repetition in a manner that evades judicial review. First, Los Angeles could not fully litigate this case before completion of the FY 2017 grant process. Exactly one month passed between the date Defendants announced imposition of the Challenged Considerations and selected successful applicants. Therefore, Los Angeles had no more than one month to meaningfully challenge the selection process. The Ninth Circuit has explained that even \"actions lasting only one or two years evade review.\"\n   <em>\n    Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886234\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1006/#p1018\">\n    681 F.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (9th Cir. 2012). Additionally, disputes over government grant awards are common examples of challenges too short in duration to be fully litigated before funds are distributed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wright &amp; Miller, Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 3533.8 (3d ed. 2017). Therefore, Los Angeles satisfies the first prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, there is at least a \"reasonable expectation\" that Los Angeles will suffer similar injury in FY 2018. The Attorney General has touted immigration enforcement as a cornerstone of the DOJ's agenda, meaning competitors can reasonably expect similar conditions to apply in FY 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, it is reasonably likely Los Angeles will seek a FY 2018 CHP award because it has applied for a grant in 39% of all cycles since inception. Although 39% does not represent a statistical probability, it is more than sufficient to satisfy the \"reasonable expectation\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Honig v.

According to Defendants, because \"the Attorney General\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   give preferential treatment\" in the three circumstances listed in subsection (c), the Attorney General\n   <em>\n    may also\n   </em>\n   develop additional factors to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the Court's view, subsection (c) does not plainly or even arguably authorize the Attorney General to give preferential treatment to competitors based on compliance with the Challenged Considerations. Defendants' reading effectively renders subsection (c) superfluous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v.

Defendants, citing a House Report and the Los Angeles Police Department's website, argue at some length that community policing is concerned broadly with crime prevention and public safety, which the Challenged Considerations address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is no dispute between the parties that community policing ultimately aims to prevent crime and keep the public safe. But all policing is fundamentally aimed at these end goals. Community policing is distinct from other types of policing because\n   of the means used to achieve these end goals, namely partnerships between police\n   <em>\n    and communities\n   </em>\n   . Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, \u00a7 10003(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n    108 Stat. 1796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (Congress established COPS statute \"to increase police presence, to expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and\n   <em>\n    members of the community\n   </em>\n   to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Brief of Amici Curiae Prosecutors and Law Enforcement Leaders, No. 17-cv-7215-R-JCx, pp. 3-4, (community policing \"requires police to interact with neighborhood residents in a manner that will build trust and improve the level of cooperation with the police department\"). Defendants' attempt to use these funds to encourage partnerships between local police and federal immigration authorities encroaches on territory Congress did not contemplate. Congress mandated that CHP grants must be used for\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   policing, not policing generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, Defendants' broad interpretation of their authority carries extraordinary implications. If the Attorney General can favor applicants based on any factors relevant to public safety, he enjoys nearly limitless discretion to select grant awardees in ways not even tangentially related to community policing. For example, he may favor CHP applicants that agree to implement or abolish capital punishment in the name of public safety. In the absence of clear statutory guidance, this Court cannot conclude that Congress intended to stretch Defendants' authority so broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

First, Defendants offer no supporting precedent. Second, compliance with these considerations is required in order for applicants to compete on a level playing field. Not coincidentally, 80% of successful applicants complied with the Challenged Considerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, because applicants who\n   do not comply are less likely to receive a CHP grant, the Challenged Considerations will be dispositive in at least some cases. Finally, if Defendants are correct, it would be simple for federal agencies to avert Spending Clause requirements by labelling all considerations \"plus factors.\" This Court cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, the Challenged Considerations violate the Spending Clause because, as discussed above, Congress did not unambiguously condition receipt of a CHP grant on local compliance with federal authorities. Defendants' argument that the COPS Office unambiguously instructed applicants how to qualify for bonus points misses the point.\n   <em>\n    Dole\n   </em>\n   counsels that\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   must be clear in its directives.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28042\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/203/#p206\">\n    483 U.S. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28042\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/203/#p206\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is irrelevant whether the COPS Office is transparent where Congress does not authorize it to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the analysis may conclude here, the Court briefly notes that the Challenged Considerations are not \"reasonably related\" to the articulated goal of the COPS program. As explained above, community policing is about developing partnerships between local authorities and the community. Whether local police cooperation with federal authorities allows for more effective enforcement is not the relevant inquiry. In short, there is no relationship between local police partnerships with federal authorities and\n   <em>\n    community\n   </em>\n   policing. Therefore, the Challenged Considerations violate the Spending Clause as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, Los Angeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 6\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Los Angeles alleges in Count 6 that the Challenged Considerations are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the APA, agency actions must be set aside if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).

Second, monetary damages cannot ensure that Los Angeles will compete on a level playing field in future grant cycles.

The injunction here only incidentally impacts competitors to the extent they cannot receive bonus points for compliance with the Challenged Considerations.
