Friends of the River (\"Plaintiff\" or \"FOR\") sued the United States Army Corps of Engineers (the \"Corps\") and National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS\") (collectively, \"Federal Defendants\") alleging violations of the Endangered Species Act and Administrative Procedures Act. Yuba County Water Agency (\"YCWA\" or \"Intervenor\") intervened in the case. ECF No. 16. Parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, ECF Nos. 33, 38, 41, which were followed by opposition and reply briefs, ECF Nos. 49, 54, 57.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This case is one in a series of cases regarding the impact of dams, hydropower facilities, and water diversions on Listed Species within the Yuba River.

(requesting NMFS set aside extensions to 2012 BiOp deadlines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The first consultation between the Corps and NMFS regarding Yuba River activities occurred around 2000, in response to a lawsuit brought by the South Yuba River Citizens League (SYRCL). Corps R. 356:23031. That year, the Corps requested formal consultation with NMFS in a BA regarding the impact of Englebright and Daguerre Point Dams and water diversions on spring Chinook and steelhead. Corps R. 171:12759. In 2002, NMFS issued a BiOp finding that the dams' operations were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the spring Chinook and steelhead or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. Corps R. 356:23066. According to the 2002 BiOp, \"[t]he proposed action...is the continuation of current Corps operations of Englebright and Daguerre Point Dams,\" and \"[a]n important component of the Corps operations is the issuance of permits, licenses and easements to non-federal entities for their operations of water diversion facilities at or near the dams.\" Corps R. 356:23033.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Corps's 2007 BA similarly defined the agency action as the \"continuation of current Corps operations associated with Englebright and Daguerre Point Dams on the Yuba River\" with respect to its impact on spring Chinook, steelhead, and green sturgeon. Corps R. 178:13641-42. In the 2007 final BiOp, NMFS again determined that the agency action was not likely to jeopardize the List Species, but found a\n   likelihood of incidental take. Corps R. 368:24749.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2012, the Corps prepared a BA that defined the agency's action differently. Relying on the 1998 FWS and NMFS ESA Consultation Handbook, the Corps determined that the future effects of the dams' presence should be included in the environmental baseline. Corps R. 186:14185. The Corps made this finding based on the argument that the agency did not have the authority to change the presence of these preexisting facilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20662\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20662\">\n    at 186:14185-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NMFS concluded in its 2012 BiOp that the Corps's proposed actions, including those the Corps believed were nondiscretionary, were likely to jeopardize the listed species. Corps R. 389:29663. NMFS also provided reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid jeopardizing the Listed Species. Corps R. 389:29664.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Corps had \"serious concerns\" regarding the 2012 BiOp and sought to reinitiate consultation based on \"new information.\" Corps R. 544:43422. In 2013, the Corps reasserted its argument that the dams' continued existence was not an agency action because it was non-discretionary. Corps R. 81:4074. The Corps also broke up what it previously considered one \"agency action\" along the Yuba River into multiple smaller parts, separating actions connected with the Englebright Dam, Daguerre Point Dam, and licensing. Corps R. 80:4030. The Corps postponed consultation on outgrants for the Narrows I and II and an easement for the Brophy diversion to a later date. Corps R. 81:4095-96. The 2013 Daguerre Point BA sought formal consultation, while the 2013 Englebright BA sought only informal consultation. Corps R. 81:4053.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In May 2014, NMFS changed course from its prior opinion in the 2012 BiOp. Corps R. 532, 581. In its 2014 Englebright Letter of Concurrence (\"Letter of Concurrence\"), the agency agreed that the Corps's proposed action at Englebright was not likely to adversely affect the Listed Species. Corps R. 581:48897. Similarly, in the 2014 Daguerre Point Dam BiOp (\"2014 BiOp\"), NMFS concluded that the Corps's proposed action at Daguerre Point was not likely to jeopardize the Listed Species.

In Claim I, Plaintiff argues that the Corps's 2013 Englebright Dam BA violated the APA because it (1) asserted that maintaining the Englebright Dam is not an action subject to consultation; (2) found that the Englebright Dam's maintenance was nondiscretionary; (3) denied that adverse effects on the Listed Species and critical habitat caused by Englebright Dam's existence were effects of the action; and (4) segregated out permits, licenses,\n   and easements into separate future actions. Am. Compl. at 26-27, \u00b6\u00b6 96-99.

Claim III asserts that NMFS violated the APA in its 2014 BiOp by (1) adopting the Corps's definition of agency action from the 2013 Daguerre Point Dam BA; (2) failing to analyze effects of the action on Listed Species by considering dam existence to be part of the environmental baseline; (3) insufficiently explaining its change of position from the 2012 BiOp; and (4) improperly defining the action area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30, \u00b6\u00b6 106-10. In Claim IV, Plaintiff alleges that NMFS violated the APA by replacing the 2012 BiOp with the 2014 BiOp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30, \u00b6\u00b6 111-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Claim V argues that the Corps violated its procedural duties under ESA Section 7(a)(2) by failing to adequately consult with NMFS about the Corps's Yuba River activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31, \u00b6\u00b6 114-17. In Claim VI, Plaintiff asserts that the Corps violated its substantive duty under ESA Section 7(a)(2) to ensure its actions will not jeopardize the Listed Species because (1) its consultations were inadequate and (2) new information surfaced after NMFS issued the 2014 BiOp and Letter of Concurrence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32, \u00b6\u00b6 118-22. Claim VIII alleges the Corps violated the ESA because the issuance of new scientific and technical information has triggered the Corps's duty to reinitiate consultation with NMFS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-36, \u00b6\u00b6 133-39. Finally, Claim IX alleges NMFS violated the APA by failing to reinitiate consultation with the Corps based on the same new information in Claim VIII.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-38, \u00b6\u00b6 140-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At the heart of Plaintiff's Section 7 claims lies a dispute over the scope and definition of the Corps's agency action.

First, the Court resolves whether the Corps's 2013 Englebright BA may be subject to judicial review. Second, the Court examines what actions fall within the environmental baseline, separate from the present agency action. Third, the Court determines whether the Corps's activities fit the ESA's broad definition of agency action. Within this inquiry, the Court explores whether the Corps's activities are (i) affirmative and (ii) discretionary actions that are (iii) guaranteed to occur and (iv) include interrelated and interdependent activities. Fourth, the Court considers whether Federal Defendants properly determined the scope of the action area in the 2013 and 2014 documents. Fifth, the Court reviews the sufficiency of the consultation between the Federal Defendants, including whether (i) NMFS has a duty to reidentify the agency action; (ii) the agency action at Englebright required formal consultation; and (iii) the Corps violated its duty to ensure against jeopardy. Sixth, the Court examines whether any changes in position by Federal Defendants were adequately explained. Seventh, the Court evaluates whether Federal Defendants had a duty to reinitiate consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Following the 2012 BiOp, the Corps \"deconstructed its proposed action to more clearly identify which activities were subject to 'discretionary Federal involvement or control' \" and which \"were non-discretionary and would therefore not be included in the Corps' request for consultation.\" Corps R. 581:48888-89. The Corps then sought to reinitiate consultation with NMFS to provide more accurate information on agency discretion, the proposed action's scope, and recent scientific and technical findings. Corps R. 581:48889-90, 532:42324-25. Separate BAs on the dams were submitted because the Corps found \"each dam has a separate authorization and appropriation, and because the actions at Englebright and Daguerre are wholly separate and are not dependent upon each other to operate.\" Corps R. 581:48890.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   NMFS's description of its change in reasoning is less detailed. For the most part, NMFS appears to adopt the Corps's reasoning and reconsiders its prior BiOp based on this change:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   In the 2012 BiOp, NMFS identified several additional actions as interrelated and interdependent actions associated with the project description in the Corps 2012 BA (Corps 2012a).

NMFS's explanation, albeit quite brief, indicates that it examined the relevant data, made a rational connection between the facts, and explained its change in position from the 2012 BiOp to the 2014 BiOp and Letter of Concurrence.

Plaintiff argues that the taking results from the continued existences of the two dams, as well as the fish ladders at Daguerre Point Dam and introduction of invasive species through recreational activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33, \u00b6 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \"All persons, including federal agencies, are specifically instructed not to \"take\" endangered species.\"\n   <em>\n    TVA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p180\">\n    437 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p180\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court has already found Federal Defendants did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the dams' existences do not constitute a present or continuing \"agency action.\" Even if the dams' existences did constitute an agency action, this action appears to be outside the agency's discretion. While the Ninth Circuit has not clearly spoken on this issue, a similar case in this district found that an agency cannot be liable where it has no discretion over the activities resulting in the alleged taking.\n   <em>\n    Nat.
