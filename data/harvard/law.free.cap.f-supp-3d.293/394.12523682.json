This Court briefly recounts the relevant facts as context. In sum, Plaintiffs are major textbook publishing companies who brought this copyright and trademark infringement action against a web of individuals and entities alleged to have orchestrated an international scheme to reproduce, import, distribute, and sell counterfeit copies of Plaintiffs' textbooks. One such entity is iBestBargains, a Texas limited-liability company. According to the Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"), iBestBargains purchased counterfeit textbooks in bulk from foreign distributors and re-sold them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a August 3, 2017 conference addressed in part to iBestBargains' anticipated motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim, this Court ordered limited jurisdictional discovery on certain discrete topics on consent of the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 66, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) On December 12, 2017, this Court denied iBestBargains' motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 415-16,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Ten days later, iBestBargains moved to certify an interlocutory appeal, and while briefing on that motion was still underway, filed a motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Reconsideration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Timeliness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a threshold matter, this Court must determine what rule authorizes iBestBargains' motion for reconsideration. iBestBargains purports to bring the motion under Rule 59(e), which applies to motions to alter or amend a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). In turn, Rule 54(a) defines judgment to include \"a decree and any order from which an appeal lies.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(a). Here, Rule 59(e) does not apply because the December 12 Order denying iBestBargains' motions to dismiss is\n   neither a judgment nor an order from which an appeal lies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ret.

This Court agrees. Local Civil Rule 6.3 directs parties to move for \"reconsideration or reargument of a court order determining a motion ... within fourteen (14) days after the entry of the court's determination of the original motion.\" Local Civ. R. 6.3. Here, iBestBargains filed its motion for reconsideration on January 8, 2018-twenty-seven days after this Court's December 12 Order. As numerous cases from this Circuit have held, the untimeliness of a motion for reconsideration is reason enough to deny the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cyrus v.City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20148078\">\n    2010 WL 148078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y.

A motion for reconsideration under Local Civil Rule 6.3\"will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked-matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrader v.

Such a motion \"cannot assert new arguments or claims which were not before the court on the original motion,\" because \" Rule 6.3 is intended to 'ensure the finality of decisions and to prevent the practice of a losing party examining a decision then plugging the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ret.

Stated differently, a motion for reconsideration is not an invitation for parties to \"treat the court's initial decision as the opening of a dialogue in which that party may then use such a motion to advance new theories or adduce new evidence in response to the court's rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    De Los Santos v.

Nov. 12, 1998). The standard for reconsideration is strict, and ultimately, the decision is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. H.H.

July 22, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, the crux of iBestBargains' argument is that this Court failed to consider an affidavit by Plaintiffs purportedly conceding that iBestBargains did not distribute counterfeit textbooks. That affidavit describes \"test purchases from third-party online sellers of textbooks distributed by iBestBargains,\" which Plaintiffs aver \"were shipped from Texas addresses associated with iBestBargains.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. iBestBargains appears to contend that this affidavit contradicts the Complaint's allegations of sales of counterfeit textbooks. But iBestBargains raised this argument, and this Court considered it on the motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 90, at 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   iBestBargains' contention that Plaintiffs' affidavit identifies \"several online third parties that actually sold the alleged counterfeit books\" does not compel a different result. For one thing, iBestBargains misapprehends the relevant standard. As explained in the December 12 Order, because iBestBargains' Rule 12(b)(6) motion \"is premised solely on the argument that lumping all defendants together ... is insufficient to provide fair notice of the grounds for the claims made against each specific defendant,\" dismissal is warranted when the complaint is \"so confused, ambiguous, vague, or otherwise intelligible that its true substance, if any, is well disguised.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 413-14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (citation and quotation mark omitted). This Court concluded that the allegations in the Complaint \"are sufficient to give fair notice to iBestBargains of the allegations and claims it is facing.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 415,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Whether Plaintiffs can ultimately\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   the elements of a copyright infringement claim after discovery is complete is a separate matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, iBestBargains contends that the allegations in the Complaint fail to adequately plead personal jurisdiction by lumping all defendants together without specific averments relating to each defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant, iBestBargains, Motion for Reconsideration, ECF No. 104 (\"Motion for Reconsideration\"), \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) However, this argument was also squarely presented in iBestBargains' motion to dismiss and rejected by this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Amended Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 80 (\"Motion to Dismiss\"), \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) The December 12 Order detailed the relevant standards for personal jurisdiction when a court has allowed jurisdictional discovery but not held an evidentiary hearing: (1) the plaintiff must make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of jurisdiction; (2) which may be made through pleadings, affidavits, and supporting materials; and (3) which are construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff notwithstanding any controverting presentation by the moving party.\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 409-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citations omitted). In applying those standards, the December 12 Order concluded that Plaintiffs satisfied their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The arguments raised in iBestBargains' motion for reconsideration constitute nothing more than disagreement with this Court's explication of the relevant legal standards and application of the standards to the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indergit v. Rite Aid Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058947\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/52/522/#p523\">\n    52 F.Supp.3d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (a motion for reconsideration is not an opportunity \"to obtain a second bite at the apple\"). iBestBargains makes no attempt to point to any controlling precedent or factual matters that this Court overlooked.

To the contrary, the December 12 Order found that the affidavit \"do[es] not alter the fact that Plaintiffs make a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   showing that \u00a7 302(a)(1) permits jurisdiction based on their pleadings and affidavits.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523855\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/404/\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 412,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206343627\">\n    2017 WL 6343627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Certify an Interlocutory Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Interlocutory appeals are \"presumptively disfavored,\"\n   <em>\n    Youngers v.

Thus, an interlocutory appeal may only be certified if the moving party establishes that the proposed appeal (1) \"involves a controlling question of law,\" (2) \"as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\" and (3) \"that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segedie v.

First, it asserts that an affidavit submitted by iBestBargains' managing member \"prove[s] that [iBestBargains] did not sell any of the identified counterfeit books,\" and that an affidavit submitted by Plaintiffs in opposition to the motion to dismiss \"further confirmed the fact that iBestBargains did not sell any of the counterfeit books\" identified in the complaint. (Defendants' iBestBargains Motion for Certification of Appeal and Stay of Proceeding, ECF No. 99 (\"Motion to Certify\") \u00b6 9.) According to iBestBargains, these affidavits contradict the Complaint's allegations of distribution by iBestBargains and preclude this Court from accepting\n   them as true. But this argument evinces a misunderstanding of what is required at the pleading stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, as iBestBargains appears to concede, the Complaint alleges the sale of counterfeit books by iBestBargains and provides representative examples.

Again, whether-and to what extent-these allegations are ultimately borne out by the evidence in this case is a separate matter for summary judgment or trial, not an interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its reply brief, iBestBargains shifts gears, and asserts that the question of law to be certified is \"whether or not plaintiffs' complaint has asserted allegations to meet [Rule 8] to assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\" (Reply to Plaintiffs' Response, ECF No. 106 (\"Motion to Certify Reply\"), at 1.) This question is not a pure question of law suitable for interlocutory appeal for the same reasons set forth above-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , because it simply challenges the sufficiency of the Complaint's allegations as to personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koehler v.

Aside from reciting the relevant statutory requirements, iBestBargains does not attempt to identify the existence of a substantial ground for difference of opinion or explain how an immediate appeal could materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because iBestBargains has not shown that reconsideration or certification of an interlocutory appeal is warranted, its motions are denied.
