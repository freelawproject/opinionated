However, TNA argues that the transverse conveyor must also be positioned at some significant angle (\"not substantially parallel\") relative to the conveyor segments; otherwise, items dropping down from the first segment end might not be delivered to the transverse conveyor as required in the claim. (Pl Br. at 23-24, ECF No. 52). TNA highlights that the preferred embodiment, consistent with this construction, has the transverse conveyor positioned perpendicular to the conveyor segments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '754 patent at Fig. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454008\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1313/#p1324\">\n    299 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\"The words used in the claims are interpreted in light of the intrinsic evidence of record, including ... the drawings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   PPM argues that the patent does not explicitly define the range of acceptable angles for the transverse conveyor's position and that, at any rate, the word \"substantially\" is ambiguous. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. at 7 (\"Would 15 or 20 or 45 or 60 degrees be considered not substantially parallel?\"), ECF No. 55). Moreover, PPM proposes to add a clarifying statement to the construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Without providing any support from the record, PPM summarily states that the transverse conveyor includes \"offset or misaligned conveyors.\" (Def. Br. at 21, ECF No. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court agrees that there is a range of acceptable positions for the transverse conveyor. For example, items may not be properly delivered to a transverse conveyor positioned at a one degree angle relative to the segments. However, the Court declines to define this range through the construction of the term. This is because the position of the transverse conveyor relative to the segments is already defined later in the claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   a transverse conveyor\n   <strong>\n    positioned\n   </strong>\n   below said first segment downstream end and said second segment upstream end\n   <strong>\n    so that items leaving said first segment downstream end and not delivered to said second segment upstream end are delivered to said transverse conveyor\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   '754 patent at 3:50-54. The claim requires that the transverse conveyor be positioned at some angle \"so that items leaving [the] first segment downstream end and not delivered to [the] second segment upstream end are delivered to [the] transverse conveyor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454008\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1313/#p1324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   TNA incorporates this limitation into the construction of transverse conveyor itself, which is redundant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TurboCare Div. of Demag Delaval Turbomachinery Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9486273\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/1111/#p1123\">\n    264 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (finding superfluous a term construed to include a limitation when that limitation is already provided in the patent). The Court's construction, in contrast to TNA and PPM's proposals, does not reference the relative position of the transverse conveyor and avoids any redundancy; however, it is still consistent with intrinsic evidence and dictionary definitions proffered by the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. at 22 (listing dictionaries defining \"transverse\" as \"crosswise\"), ECF No. 52). \" Transverse conveyor\" is construed as a \"conveyor that crosses the longitudinal transport direction of the first and second conveyor segments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court, furthermore, declines to adopt PPM's clarifying statement that the transverse conveyor includes \"offset or misaligned\" conveyors. This statement is not based on any intrinsic or extrinsic evidence. The construction also introduces more ambiguity as the jury might question the meaning of \"offset,\" a term that does not appear anywhere in the patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Geodynamics, Inc. v. Dynaenergetics US, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206217181\">\n    2016 WL 6217181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 25, 2016) (rejecting claim construction that \"is not based on the intrinsic record and introduces technical terms that could unnecessarily confuse the jury\" where the introduced terms \"do not appear in the specification or claims\" of the patent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    i. \"positioned below\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-55\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>TNA's Proposed</strong> <strong>PPM's Proposed</strong> <strong>Court's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"positioned below\" Positioned beneath Positioned lower than Positioned lower (Claims 1, 6, 11, 16) or beneath than or beneath</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   TNA argues that the transverse conveyor must be positioned \"beneath\" the segment ends, i.e., a portion of the first segment downstream end and the second segment upstream end has to be directly above the transverse conveyor. (Pl. Br. at 24). Again, TNA asserts that, without this construction, items leaving the first segment downstream end might not be delivered to the transverse conveyor as required by the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   PPM responds that the invention can still work if the transverse conveyor is beneath just one of the segment ends, but still positioned lower than both ends. (Def. Resp. at 10-11). PPM's construction is also consistent with dictionaries defining \"below\" as \"lower than.\" (Def. Br. at 22). Furthermore, PPM notes that the Patentee used the word \"beneath\" to describe another structure in relation to the conveyor segments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '754 patent at 2:47-50 (\"The base 13 is longitudinally extending so as to pass beneath each of the segments.\"). Because the Patentee chose to use \"below\" here rather than \"beneath,\" PPM argues that the words cannot be synonymous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CAE Screenplates Inc. v. Heinrich Fiedler GmbH &amp; Co. KG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239489\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/1308/#p1317\">\n    224 F.3d 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (\"In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, [courts] must presume that the use of ... different terms in the claims connotes different meanings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds no compelling reason to construe \"below\" as narrowly as argued by TNA. There is no reason why the claim should not cover a transverse conveyor positioned beneath only one of the segment ends, but still lower than both ends, as long as \"items leaving [the] first segment downstream end and not delivered to [the] segment upstream end are delivered to [the] transverse conveyor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '754 patent at 3:50-54. For example, the transverse conveyor could be positioned as such:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The transverse conveyor is only beneath the first segment downstream end, but still receives all of the items falling from it. PPM's construction does not unnecessarily limit the term and is consistent with the intrinsic evidence and the plain and ordinary meaning of \"below.\" Accordingly, the Court construes \" positioned below\" as \"positioned lower than or beneath.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    f. \"aligned position at which a desired quantity of said items pass from said first segment to said second segment\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-61\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>TNA's Proposed</strong> <strong>PPM's Proposed</strong> <strong>Court's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"aligned position at No construction Where the first No construction which a desired needed. segment and second needed. quantity of said segment are arranged items pass from said in agreement or proper first segment to said orientation to move second segment\" items from the first (Claims 1, 6, 11) segment to the second segment.
