BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2006,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs Beverley and M. Glenn Mitchell secured a $960,000 loan from Wells Fargo to purchase property located in the District of Columbia. ECF No. 1, (\"Notice of Removal\") at Ex. A, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3; ECF No. 7 (Defs. Br.) at Ex. B. After Plaintiffs began having difficulty paying their loan, they contacted Wells Fargo sometime in 2010 or early 2011 requesting a loan modification. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. According to Plaintiffs, Wells Fargo took several years to offer a modification, later reneged on the offer and, during another round of modification negotiations in June 2015, unexpectedly filed a foreclosure proceeding in the District of Columbia Superior Court (hereinafter \"Superior Court\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-38; ECF No. 13 (Defs. Reply) at Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Almost two years later, on May 3, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Wells Fargo's Trustee, U.S. Bank National Association (\"USBNA\") in Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A. Several months later, however, the Superior Court dismissed Plaintiffs' lawsuit without prejudice because, according to Plaintiffs, their attorney became ill and failed to notify the court when he was unable to appear at a hearing. ECF No. 11 (Pls. Resp.) \u00b6 6; Defs. Reply at Ex. A; Defs. Reply at 4 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Three days after their case was dismissed, Plaintiffs filed a seventy-six paragraph complaint against USBNA in Superior Court alleging that Wells Fargo has handled their mortgage modification request and the foreclosure proceedings fraudulently, in bad faith, and in violation of the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex.

Plaintiffs asked the Superior Court to: (1) stay the foreclosure proceedings in order to allow them to enter into a loan modification agreement; (2) dismiss the foreclosure proceedings once they have demonstrated a record of timely payments; (3) remove all \"unreasonable charges\"; (4) return their mortgage to good standing; and (5) award Plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages.

USBNA asks this court to dismiss this lawsuit for various reasons, including: (1) statute of limitations grounds; (2) Plaintiffs' failure to identify the provisions of the CPPA that Wells Fargo allegedly violated; and (3) Plaintiffs' failure to set forth facts that would support their fraud and bad faith allegations.

Plaintiffs contend that USBNA acted in bad faith by removing this action in an effort to preempt Plaintiffs' attempts to consolidate it with the pending foreclosure action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.

In the reply, USBNA confirmed that Plaintiffs have asserted a fraud counter-claim in the foreclosure action. ECF No. 16, (Defs. Second Reply) at 3. USBNA expressed consternation that \"[a]t no time prior to removal, did the Plaintiffs seek to file any counterclaim in the then two-year-old Foreclosure Action,\" but rather chose to file two lawsuits asserting their fraud\n   claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a), a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss an action, without consent of the defendant or the court, so long as the plaintiff files the notice of dismissal before the defendant files an answer or a motion for summary judgment.

Indeed, Plaintiffs had previously sought to join their claims with the foreclosure action, but the foreclosure court directed them to file a written motion. Not only did USBNA object to the motion, but five days later USBNA removed the lawsuit to this court before Plaintiffs could file a written motion and before the thirty-day removal deadline expired. Given this course of events, it is unsurprising that Plaintiffs would want this lawsuit dismissed without prejudice so that they can pursue their claims in the foreclosure action. Moreover, USBNA has not expended any effort or expense \"in preparation for trial\" and this litigation has not proceeded to a stage where dismissal would put USBNA at any disadvantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to whether Plaintiffs were not diligent or engaged in excessive delay, it is unclear from the record why Plaintiffs waited almost two years after the foreclosure began to assert fraud/bad faith claims and why they elected to do so in a separate lawsuit, rather than in the foreclosure proceeding. It is significant, however, that Plaintiffs attempted to consolidate their claims with the foreclosure action prior to removal and have now raised them in the foreclosure proceeding. It is also significant that Plaintiffs claim that some of the allegedly fraudulent conduct occurred, and continues to occur during court-supervised foreclosure loan modification negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at Ex. A, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. Accordingly resolution of the parties' overlapping claims-including any justifications for the delay in bringing the fraud claims-is better left to the foreclosure court.
