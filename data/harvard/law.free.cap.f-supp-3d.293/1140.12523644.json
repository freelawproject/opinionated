(Def.'s Notice of Removal at 5.) Defendant arrived at this number by multiplying $11.41 (the estimated hourly rate of pay for plaintiff) by 40 (the estimated hours plaintiff worked per week\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), to show that the plaintiff earned approximately $456.40 during an average workweek. Then defendant multiplied $456.40 by 28 (the number of workweeks between June 22, 2017, plaintiff's last day of work, and January 5, 2018, the date of the Notice of Removal) which totals $12,799.20 of back pay. Thus, defendant has presented sufficient evidence that plaintiff has put $12,799.20 worth of back pay at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, defendant has established evidence that the amount in controversy regarding plaintiff's back pay is $12,799.20.

The court is hesitant to accept defendant's estimate where \"the Complaint does not expressly seek two years front pay or bonuses. Thus, Defendant's conjecture that Plaintiff could seek or be entitled to two years front pay is speculative and insufficient to meet its burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Paris v.

Jan. 22, 2018). Accordingly, the court will not include the estimated amount of front pay in calculating the amount in controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Labor Code Penalties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Overtime Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges defendant failed to pay overtime wages. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86-91.) Defendant estimates that plaintiff seeks at least $14,804.48 in overtime wages. (Def.'s Notice of Removal at 7.) The Complaint is silent as to how many hours of overtime pay plaintiff is seeking. Therefore, defendant estimates that if plaintiff claims he did not receive 5 hours of overtime pay per week, multiplied by 1.5 times plaintiff's 52-week average hourly rate of pay of $11.41, then plaintiff has placed $14,804.48\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in controversy on his overtime claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) While defendant can make reasonable assumptions, defendant's calculation rests on the speculative assumption that plaintiff was denied five hours of overtime pay every week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, plaintiff alleges that he routinely worked in excess of eight hours per day and/or forty hours per week, and/or on a seventh consecutive day in a work week, but plaintiff does not provide any estimate as to the number of overtime hours he was allegedly not compensated for by defendant. (Compl. \u00b6 90.) Thus, the court may not consider defendant's calculation of overtime because \"the court may not base its jurisdiction on speculation and conjecture.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

May 5, 2010) (citation omitted) (refusing to consider defendant's calculation for overtime damages where defendant assumed each plaintiff worked 2.5 hours overtime each day but that assumption was not supported by the allegations in the complaint and defendants provided no sufficient basis to apply its assumption.) Accordingly, the court will not consider defendant's estimate of $14,804.48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Meal and Rest Break Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that defendant failed to provide meal periods and rest periods in violation of Labor Code \u00a7 226.7. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-107.) Defendant estimates that plaintiff seeks at least $9,869.65 in meal period premiums and $9,869.65 in rest break periods. In order to arrive at those estimates, defendant assumed that plaintiff missed 1 rest break per day and 1 meal period per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37.) Plaintiff alleges that during the relevant time period, plaintiff did not receive compliant meal periods for working more than five and/or ten hours per day because his meal periods were short, missed, or late and/or he was not permitted to take a second meal period. (Compl. \u00b6 94.) As to rest periods, plaintiff alleges that during the relevant time period, plaintiff did not receive a ten minute rest period for every four hours or major fraction thereof worked because he was required to work though his daily rest periods and/or was not authorized to take his rest periods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Plaintiff further alleges that throughout his employment, he was not authorized or permitted to take his meal periods or rest periods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court finds that defendant's estimate that plaintiff missed one meal period and rest period every day is reasonable and supported by the Complaint. Here, the Complaint reasonably suggests that during the relevant time period, plaintiff regularly did not receive compliant meal periods and rest breaks. Moreover, as to rest periods, plaintiff alleges that he did not receive a ten minute rest period for \"every\" four hours worked and/or was not authorized to take his breaks. Thus, the court believes that defendant's assumption that plaintiff alleges he was denied these breaks every day is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giannini v. Nw. Mut.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-120.) Defendant estimates a total amount in controversy of $2,738.40 in waiting time penalties under plaintiff's twelfth cause of action. (Def.'s Notice of Removal at 7.) Defendant calculates this number based on the statutory maximum permitted under the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Labor Code section 203 provides for a maximum statutory \"waiting time penalty\" of thirty days of wages. Here, plaintiff alleges that plaintiff's employment was terminated on June 22, 2017, and defendant has failed to pay plaintiff all of the unpaid wages and compensation due to him at the time of his termination. (Compl. \u00b6 119.) Thus, it is reasonable for the defendant to assert the statutory maximum. Accordingly, the court will consider $2,738.40 in waiting time penalties in determining if the amount in controversy requirement is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Wage Statement Penalties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant estimates a total amount in controversy of $4,000 for wage statement penalties.

Here, plaintiff alleges that during the relevant time period, defendant failed to comply with Labor Code Section 226(a) on wage statements that were provided to plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6 110.) Thus, there is reasonable support in the Complaint that plaintiff put in controversy at least $4,000 in penalties.
