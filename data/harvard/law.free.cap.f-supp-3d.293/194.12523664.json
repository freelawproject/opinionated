Mr. Parker raises a host of claims against the District of Columbia and the Director, including several asserted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for purported violations of his constitutional rights. Defendants move for summary judgment on three claims, which allege violation of Mr. Parker's rights to procedural and substantive due process with respect to the termination of Mr. Parker's benefits and violation of Mr. Parker's right to bodily integrity with respect to the purported sexual assault. For the reasons explained below, the Court grants summary judgment in Defendants' favor with respect to Mr. Parker's substantive due process claim and on the sole issue of notice with respect to Mr. Parker's procedural due process claim. However, the Court otherwise denies Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties disagree, however, about the circumstances surrounding Mr. Parker's termination from the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Defendants, DOES terminated Mr. Parker because \"he was accused of spitting, or attempting to spit, on two female participants.\" Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 1. Defendants contend that Mr. Parker met with DOES employees-including a psychiatrist-to discuss the accusation and that during the meeting he denied that he had spit on or attempted to spit on the women. Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 11. Defendants assert that Mr. Parker was given notice of the grounds for his termination-specifically, \"Mr. Parker was told that he was being terminated because his behavior, which led to the spitting accusation, was perceived as inappropriate\"-and that he also received an opportunity to be heard.

According to Mr. Parker, in August and September 2014, he complained to Mr. Jones and other Project Empowerment employees that he was receiving insufficient support in finding a permanent job placement. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-12. Mr. Parker alleges that on September 22, 2014, Mr. Jones called Mr. Parker into his office then closed the door. Compl. \u00b6 13.

Mr. Jones allegedly approached Mr. Parker from behind while Mr. Parker was urinating and \"grabbed and squeezed [Mr. Parker's] scrotum,\" causing severe pain. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Mr. Parker pushed Mr. Jones away, after which Mr. Jones allegedly propositioned Mr. Parker once again, asking \"When you going to give me some?\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-29. Mr. Parker contends that he rushed into the hallway, but Mr. Jones followed him and continued to proposition him and to sexually and physically assault him. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-34. After pushing Mr. Jones away, Mr. Parker gathered his belongings and left the building, reporting the incident to security on his way out. Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 35-38. The next day, Mr. Parker reported his claims to the police and, in the days following, he complained or attempted to complain to various DOES officials. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-43. Mr. Parker contends that DOES failed to pay him the reminder of his benefits for participating in Project Empowerment. Compl. \u00b6 50. According to Mr. Parker, in the days after the purported assault, he experienced significant pain, depression, headaches, and difficulty sleeping,\n   for which he has received medical and mental health treatment. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Parker initiated the present action in December 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Complaint, ECF No. 1.

Defendants move for summary judgment on Mr. Parker's Fourth Amendment claim in Count V, arguing that Mr. Parker has not stated a claim under the Fourth Amendment and that any alleged assault committed by Mr. Jones was not an action taken under color of state law. Defendants also move for summary judgment on Plaintiff's procedural and substantive due process claims in Count VI. With respect to the procedural due process claim, Defendants contend that Mr. Parker was not constitutionally entitled to benefits for his participation in Project Empowerment and that, in any event, DOES afforded him sufficient process before terminating his benefits. With respect to the substantive due process claim, Defendants assert that Mr. Parker has not shown that Defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his right to benefits and, thus, they argue that his claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Parker's substantive due process claim for benefits and that, with respect to Mr. Parker's procedural due process claim, Defendants have shown that they are entitled to summary judgment on the sole issue of notice. However, Defendants have otherwise failed to demonstrate an absence of genuine issues of material fact. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied with respect to Count V-which the Court construes as a claim of violation of Mr. Parker's substantive due process right to bodily integrity rather than as a claim under the Fourth Amendment-and with respect Mr. Parker's claimed procedural due process violation for the purported deprivation of benefits owed to Mr. Parker for participating in Project Empowerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendants argue that Mr. Parker \"has not alleged an unreasonable search or seizure for a Fourth Amendment claim, nor does the evidence support one.\" Charles Jones, Jr.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 2 n.2. While the Court agrees that Mr. Parker's claim does not squarely fall under the Fourth Amendment, it does not conclude that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this basis.

Rather, the central question is whether there remain issues of material fact regarding whether Mr. Jones acted under pretense of state authority when he allegedly assaulted Mr. Parker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court concludes that issues of material fact remain. As the Court explained above, it must look to whether Mr. Jones \"purpose[d] to act in an official capacity or to exercise official responsibilities pursuant to state law\" at the time of the alleged assault.\n   <em>\n    G'Sell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4108139\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/101/#p111\">\n    724 F.Supp.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Mr. Parker's version of events, on September 22, 2014, Mr. Jones offered to use his work connections to secure Mr. Parker a permanent job placement in exchange for sexual favors. The very next day, Mr. Jones allegedly propositioned Mr. Parker again and sexually assaulted him, this time in a bathroom and in a hallway in the building in which Mr. Parker was attending classes for Project Empowerment and in which Mr. Jones was performing his work as Director of the program. Defendants apparently view-and ostensibly ask this Court to view-these events as separate, wholly disregarding the circumstances that led up to the bathroom confrontation, over which there are plainly disputes of fact. The Court does not see, however, how it could possibly find as a matter of law that Mr. Jones could not have acted under color of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Reasonable jurors could credit Mr. Parker's account. Those same jurors could reason that any sexual assault Mr. Jones committed the day after he explicitly invoked his authority in an attempt to procure sexual favors constituted continued invocation of that same authority. At bottom, the issue of whether Mr. Jones acted under color of state law therefore may come down to a determination of credibility, which this Court is neither authorized nor equipped to decide on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brokenborough v.

He cites no provision of law, however, that might have conferred such a right. He likewise fails to contend with the Supreme Court's and the D.C. Circuit's strictly circumscribed view of substantive due process. For example, courts have roundly rejected that public employees enjoy a fundamental right to government employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.
