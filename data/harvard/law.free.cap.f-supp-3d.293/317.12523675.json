BIACO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sunrise One, LLC and Sunrise One Operating LLC, doing business as the Rockville Centre Inn, (collectively, \"Sunrise\" or \"plaintiffs\") bring this action against Harleysville Insurance Company of New York (\"Harleysville\" or \"defendant\") for breach of an insurance contract. Plaintiffs own and operate a hotel called the Rockville Centre Inn, located in Nassau County, New York. According to plaintiffs, the Rockville Centre Inn sustained wind and rain damage during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. After inspecting the hotel, however, Harleysville determined that Hurricane Sandy did not cause damage to the Rockville Centre Inn, and denied coverage for damage to the hotel, as well as for business income losses resulting from that damage. This lawsuit eventually resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court are motions for partial summary judgment. In its motion, Harleysville argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on (1) Sunrise's claim for business income losses; (2) Sunrise's claim for consequential damages; and (3) Sunrise's claim for attorney's fees and costs. Harleysville additionally seeks summary judgment on Sunrise's attempt to use its Third Estimate of Damages, and instead, seeks to limit Sunrise to the damages sought in its Second Estimate. Sunrise's motion, in turn, argues that Sunrise is entitled to summary judgment on Harleysville's\n   third through fourteenth affirmative defenses, and that Harleysville's third through eleventh affirmative defenses should be stricken as redundant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court grants summary judgment to Harleysville on (1) Sunrise's claim for business income losses; (2) Sunrise's claim for consequential damages; and (3) Sunrise's claim for attorney's fees and costs. The Court denies Harleysville's motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' Third Estimate of Damages because there are disputed issues of fact that preclude summary judgment on the issue of whether the Third Estimate of Damages was timely under the at-issue insurance contract. Finally, the Court denies Sunrise's motion for summary judgment and motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. Facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At all times relevant to this litigation, non-parties Thomas Morash, Sr., Rosemary Morash, Thomas Morash, Jr., and Michael Morash (\"the Morash Family\") owned three hotels in Nassau County: The Five Towns Motor Inn, the Holiday Inn Express, and the Rockville Centre Inn. (Pls. 56.1 \u00b6 180.) Although Harleysville insures all three properties (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 20), only the Rockville Centre Inn is the subject of this litigation. The Rockville Centre Inn is an approximately 40,000 square foot, five-story hotel, with 68 guest rooms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) Plaintiff Sunrise One LLC owns the Rockville Centre Inn property (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21), and plaintiff Sunrise One Operating LLC operates the hotel (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sunrise obtained property insurance on the Rockville Centre Inn from Harleysville, effective from April 22, 2012 to April 22, 2013 (\"the Insurance Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def. 56.1 Ex. 7.) Under the Insurance Policy, Harleysville agreed to cover,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) \"direct physical loss of or damage to\" the Rockville Centre Inn and (2) \"the actual loss of Business Income ... result[ing] from\" such loss or damage, with limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the event of any loss or damage to the Rockville Centre Inn, Sunrise agreed to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) provide Harleysville \"prompt notice of the direct physical loss or damage[,] includ[ing] a description of the property involved\"; (2) \"[a]s soon as possible, give [Harleysville] a description of how, when, and where the direct physical loss or damage occurred\"; (3) \"[a]t [Harleysville's] request, give [Harleysville] complete inventories of the damaged and undamaged property[,] includ[ing] quantities, costs, values and amount of loss claimed\"; and (4) \"cooperate with [Harleysville] in the investigation or settlement of the claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the east coast of the United States. Sunrise asserts that the rain and high winds resulted in substantial damage to the Rockville Centre Inn. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 180, 202-04.) According to plaintiffs, Michael Morash drove by all three Morash Family hotels on October 29, 2012, and \"noted visible wind damage, water penetration issues, and various leaks at each property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) Plaintiffs further assert that, on November 9, 2012, Michael Morash reported, via telephone,\n   damage to all three hotels to the broker for all three insurance policies (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181-84), and that in January 2013, he submitted a claim via email (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Harleysville disputes that Michael Morash submitted a claim for damage to the Rockville Centre Inn on November 9, 2012, or in January 2013. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 29.) Harleysville further asserts that, based on an inspection conducted by its general adjuster, consulting engineer, and building consultant, Hurricane Sandy did not cause damage to the Rockville Centre Inn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    E.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the lengthy procedural history of this case, and provides only a brief recitation here. Plaintiffs filed the original complaint in this action on January 15, 2015. Plaintiffs sought leave to amend the complaint on June 21, 2016, which the Court granted on July 29, 2016. Thereafter, on August 3, 2016, plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint. Defendant answered on August 10, 2016. On July 28, 2017, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment. On September 27, 2017, defendant moved for partial summary judgment. The parties filed oppositions on October 27, 2017 and replies on November 15, 2017. The Court heard oral argument on both motions on December 19, 2017. The Court has fully considered the parties' submissions and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), a court may grant a motion for summary judgment only if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The court \"is not to weigh the evidence but is instead required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party, and to eschew credibility assessments.\"\n   <em>\n    Amnesty Am. v.

HARLEYSVILLE'S MOTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Business Income Losses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Harleysville argues that summary judgment is warranted on Sunrise's claim for lost business income for four independent reasons: (1) Sunrise did not sustain a covered business income loss under the Insurance Policy's plain terms; (2) Sunrise failed to timely notify Harleysville of its business income loss claim; (3) Sunrise waived its right to pursue lost business income; and (4) Sunrise is estopped from seeking lost business income. As explained below, the Court grants summary judgment to Harleysville based on the plain language of the Insurance Policy. Because it grants summary judgment on this ground, the Court need not, and does not, reach the alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, the Insurance Policy provides that Harleysville will cover business income losses resulting from covered damage to the Rockville Centre Inn, with certain limitations. This coverage is established in the Insurance Policy's \"Business Income (and Extra Expense) Coverage Form\" (\"the Business Income Form\"), which provides that Harleysville will \"pay for the actual loss of Business Income you sustain due to the necessary 'suspension' of your 'operations' during the 'period of restoration.' \" (Def. 56.1 Ex. 54.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will now examine this language in more detail, and apply the provisions to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The Period of Restoration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties dispute the length of the \"period of restoration\" under the Insurance Policy. The Business Income Form defines the \"period of restoration\" as the period of time that \"begins 72 hours after\n   the time of direct physical loss or damage ... caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss at the described premises\" and \"ends on the earlier of\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) The date when the property at the described premises should be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced with reasonable speed and similar quality; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) the date when business is resumed at a new location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463915\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/667/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Attached to the Insurance Policy is an \"Actual Loss Sustained\" endorsement (\"the Endorsement\"), which states that it \"modifies insurance provided under the ... Business Income (and Extra Expense) Coverage Form.\" (Def. 56.1 Ex. 55.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the Endorsement further states that \"[t]he following replaces paragraph B. of 3. 'Period of Restoration' of G. Definitions\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Ends on the earlier of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) The date when the property at the described premises should be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced with reasonable speed and similar quality; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) the date when business is resumed at a new location; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (3) the anniversary date that ends a 12 consecutive month period after the date on which the direct physical loss of or damage to the property occurred at the described premises which caused the \"suspension\" of your \"operations\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463915\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/667/305/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Harleysville contends that the Endorsement unambiguously modifies the definition of \"period of restoration\" such that the period ended no later than \"12 consecutive month[s] after the date on which the direct physical loss of or damage to the property occurred.\" In response, Sunrise notes that the Endorsement purports to modify section \"G. Definitions,\" but the Business Income Form's definitions section is section \"F.\" Sunrise asserts that this incongruity demonstrates that the Endorsement does not modify the Business Income Form, or, at a minimum, creates an ambiguity. For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the Endorsement unambiguously modified the \"period of restoration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The construction of an insurance contract is ordinarily a matter of law to be determined by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Underwriters Ins.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Endorsement's reference to \"G.\" as opposed to \"F.\" is a clear typographical error that does not render the definition of \"period of restoration\" ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    C.f.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Axis Ins.

Accordingly the Court concludes that the Endorsement modified the definition of \"period of restoration\" such that the period terminated no later than \"12 consecutive month[s] after the date on which the direct physical loss of or damage to the property occurred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2. Sunrise Did Not Suspend Operations During the Period of Restoration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As noted, Harleysville agreed to cover the \"actual loss of Business Income you sustain due to the necessary 'suspension' of your 'operations' during the 'period of restoration.' \" (Def. 56.1 Ex. 54.) \"Suspension\" is defined as \"the cessation or slowdown of your business activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As modified by the Endorsement, the \"period of restoration\" began \"72 hours after the time of direct physical loss or damage ... caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss at the described premises\" and ended no later than \"the anniversary date that ends a 12 consecutive month period after the date on which the direct physical loss of or damage to the property occurred.\" (Def. 56.1 Ex. 55.) Thus, as applied to the facts of this case, the \"period of restoration\" began approximately 72 hours after Hurricane Sandy and ended twelve months after the Rockville Centre Inn was allegedly damaged by the storm (approximately October 30, 2013). Accordingly, under the Insurance Policy's unambiguous terms, Sunrise must have experienced a \"suspension\"-a cessation or slowdown of its business activities-at least 72 hours after Hurricane Sandy and before October 30, 2013, in order to be entitled to lost business income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Sunrise concedes that it did not experience a cessation or slowdown of business activities during that time period. At his examination under oath, Sunrise's corporate representative, Michael Morash, testified that the Rockville Centre Inn was \"only down for one day\" as a result of Hurricane Sandy. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 119, Ex. 48.) Similarly, at his deposition in this litigation, Michael Morash testified that \"we did not trigger business interruption due to the fact that we only had a power outage\n   for twelve or sixteen hours or eighteen hours ... and the policy clearly states that it is 72 or 74 hours needed to trigger business interruption.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165, Ex. 6.) Further, Sunrise does not dispute that the Rockville Centre Inn's operations were not interrupted as a result of Hurricane Sandy (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166); that the hotel's occupancy was at or near 100 percent in the two months following the storm (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167); or that the hotel actually\n   <em>\n    benefited\n   </em>\n   from unusually high demand for the year after Hurricane Sandy (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Instead, Sunrise argues that, although it has not\n   <em>\n    yet\n   </em>\n   experienced a \"suspension\" of \"operations,\" it will eventually be forced to close the Rockville Centre Inn for at least three months to repair the damage allegedly caused by Hurricane Sandy. This argument is unavailing. Under the Business Income Form's unambiguous terms, the \"suspension\" of \"operations\" must occur \"during the 'period of restoration' \" in order to trigger business income losses coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 54.) The Insurance Policy does not provide coverage for any \"suspension\" that occurs either before \"72 hours after the time of direct physical loss or damage\" or after \"the anniversary date that ends a 12 consecutive month period after the date on which the direct physical loss of or damage to the property occurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Sunrise admits that its operations were not suspended within that time frame, any claim for lost business income is foreclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B. Consequential Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Harleysville argues that the Court should grant summary judgment on Sunrise's claim for consequential damages because there is no evidence that (1) Harleysville acted in bad faith or (2) that such damages were contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting. For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Harleysville acted in good faith, and accordingly grants summary judgment to Harleysville on Sunrise's claim for consequential damages. Because it grants summary judgment on this ground, the Court does not determine whether consequential damages were contemplated by the parties at the time of contracting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An insured may recover consequential damages from an insurer only if \"they derive from an insurer's bad faith refusal to pay an insured's claim and such damages were reasonably contemplated by both parties at the time of the contract's execution.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sikarevich Family L.P. v.

First, the uncontroverted evidence establishes that Harleysville was diligent in its efforts to assess plaintiffs' claims as soon as possible. Harleysville initially retained an independent adjuster, Robert Schepis, to inspect the Rockville Centre Inn. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 32.) Harleysville's contemporaneous claims notes establish that, from February 27, 2013 through March 25, 2013, Mr. Schepis contacted plaintiffs six times to attempt to schedule an inspection, but \"got[ ] nowhere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9.) On March 25, 2013, in accordance with instructions from Michael Morash, Mr. Schepis contacted Sunrise's construction consultant, John Minor, to schedule the inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of March 27, 2013, Mr. Minor had not returned Mr. Schepis's call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, on March 27, 2013, Harleysville prepared a reservation of rights letter, which it sent to Sunrise on April 3, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 18.) That letter expressly reserved Harleysville's right to deny coverage and stated that Harleysville was doing so \"because of your failure to comply with your ... duties in the event of loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Schepis eventually scheduled an inspection of all three Morash Family hotels for April 30, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) At plaintiffs' request, the inspections were rescheduled to May 1, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) According to plaintiffs, Mr. Schepis was unprofessional during the morning inspection of the Five Towns Motor Inn, and Mr. Minor accordingly canceled the remaining inspections for that day. (Pls. 56.1 \u00b6 44.) The inspection resumed on May 2, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) According to Sunrise, Mr. Schepis was again unprofessional and \"aggressive\" with Mr. Minor, and Mr. Minor accordingly canceled the inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In response to these reports, Harleysville promptly reassigned the claims to an internal adjuster, Steven LaPierre. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Mr. LaPierre retained legal counsel, Steven Nassi, to assist with the Rockville Centre Inn claim. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 48) Mr. LaPierre also retained an engineer, Mark Cipolone, and a construction consultant, Don Pierro, to assist with investigating Sunrise's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) From May 22, 2013 through July 3, 2013, Mr. Nassi and plaintiffs' counsel, Javier Delgado, worked to schedule a date to inspect all three Morash Family hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The inspection occurred on July 12, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Mr. LaPierre, Mr. Cipolone, and Mr. Pierro attended the inspection on behalf of Harleysville. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.) After inspecting the Rockville Centre Inn, Mr. Cipolone, an engineer, concluded that (1) the damage to the Rockville Centre Inn's roof was preexisting; (2) \"there was no wind damage to the windows\"; (3) \"the interior water damage was due to pre-existing roof leaks\"; and (4) \"the problems [he] observed at the [Rockville Centre Inn] were primarily due to a lack of maintenance and to normal age related deterioration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 31.) Mr. Pierro, a construction consultant, concluded that he was \"unable to provide an estimate to repair storm damages because none were observed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on the foregoing undisputed facts, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute that Harleysville investigated Sunrise's claims, and denied coverage, in good faith. There is no evidence that Harleysville improperly delayed the inspection; to the contrary, the uncontroverted evidence establishes that Harleysville diligently attempted to schedule and conduct an inspection. When Harleysville was notified that Mr. Schepis may have been unprofessional at the inspection, Harleysville promptly reassigned the claim to Mr. LaPierre. Mr. LaPierre then worked diligently to retain experts and schedule an inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Harleysville's coverage denial was based on the opinions of an engineer and a building consultant who independently determined that the damage to the Rockville Centre Inn was not caused by Hurricane Sandy. These opinions demonstrate that Harleysville had a sufficient basis to deny coverage, and accordingly foreclose any conclusion by a rational factfinder that no reasonable carrier would have denied coverage under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In opposition to summary judgment, plaintiffs argue only that the Supplemental Report of Stephen L.

Instead, the report (at best) demonstrates a \"general disapproval of [Harleysville's] investigation of the[ ] claim,\" insufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to Harleysville's good faith.\n   <em>\n    Ebrahimian v.

As discussed above, however, Sunrise has failed to offer any evidence that Harleysville denied coverage in bad faith. Accordingly, even assuming such an exception exists, Sunrise is not entitled to attorney's fees or costs under the undisputed facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D. The Third Estimate of Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Harleysville argues that Sunrise's third revised estimate of damages (the \"Third Estimate\") should be dismissed on summary judgment to the extent it asserts damages beyond those asserted in Sunrise's second revised estimate of damages (\"the Second Estimate\") because it is untimely under the policy. In other words, Harleysville argues that plaintiffs should be prevented from asserting damages contained in the Third Estimate that were not included in the Second Estimate. Harleysville contends that Sunrise's alleged failure to notify Harleysville of the new damages asserted in the Third Estimate until November 9, 2015 constituted a breach of Sunrise's obligations to promptly notify Harleysville of damage to the Rockville Centre Inn and to cooperate with Harleysville in the investigation of the claims. Harleysville also argues that Sunrise should be estopped from asserting the new damages contained in the Third Estimate. As explained below, the Court finds that genuine disputes of material facts preclude summary judgment on these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, genuine disputes of material facts exist as to whether Sunrise promptly notified, or reasonably delayed in notifying, Harleysville about the damages contained in the Third Estimate.

Specifically, Sunrise submitted a declaration from its construction consultant, Mr. Minor, asserting that the Third Estimate \"includes the benefit of having the policy holder walk 90% of the units and document the damages[, which] added a number of additional rooms and costs.\" (Pls. 56.1 Ex. D.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   That\n   declaration further states that Mr. Minor was \"only able to thoroughly inspect the roof and window when we obtained the proper and safe equipment and obtained a schedule,\" and that \"[i]t is industry custom and practice to submit revised scopes and estimates as additional information is discovered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court finds that these facts are sufficient to raise a triable issue as to whether Sunrise provided notice of the damages contained in the Third Estimate to Harleysville within a reasonable time under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, Harleysville has failed to establish that it is entitled to summary judgment on its claim that the circumstances surrounding Sunrise's submission of the damages in the Third Estimate demonstrate a failure to cooperate under the Insurance Policy. In order to prove that an insured failed to cooperate, an insurer bears the \"heavy burden\" of showing that (1) the insurer acted diligently in seeking to bring about the insured's cooperation; (2) the efforts employed by the insurer were reasonably calculated to obtain the insured's cooperation; and (3) the attitude of the insured, after his or her cooperation was sought, was one of willful and avowed obstruction.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SCW W.

It also points to the fact that, at his examination under oath, Michael Morash testified that the Second Estimate was an accurate statement of damages. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 125-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, as explained above, Sunrise has submitted evidence that it did not have all of the necessary information before November 9, 2015, and that its delay was reasonable and accepted in the industry. (Pls. 56.1 Ex. D.) The fact that Michael Morash testified that the Second Estimate was an accurate statement of damages, before the damages in the Third Estimate were allegedly discovered, falls far short of establishing a deliberate failure to cooperate. Accordingly, construing the evidence most favorably to Sunrise, the Court concludes that summary judgment is unwarranted on Harleysville's claim that the Third Estimate should be dismissed for failure to cooperate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on Harleysville's claim that Sunrise should be estopped from relying on the Third Estimate. To establish equitable estoppel, Harleysville must demonstrate (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) intention that such conduct will be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge of the real facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    E.g., Intelligent Digital Sys., LLC v.

Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Thirteenth Affirmative Defenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Harleysville's third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and thirteenth affirmative defenses allege that Sunrise failed to comply with various obligations under the Insurance Policy. Specifically, those affirmative defenses allege that Sunrise failed to comply with (1) all of the relevant terms of the Insurance Policy; (2) all of the conditions precedent to coverage under the Insurance Policy; (3) the Insurance Policy's property loss conditions; (4) Sunrise's duties in the event of loss or damage under the Insurance Policy; and (5) Sunrise's obligation under the Insurance Policy to provide Harleysville with a description of how, when, and where the loss or damage occurred. As explained in detail above, Harleysville has submitted evidence that Sunrise failed to fulfill these obligations under the Insurance Policy. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 33-41, 73-78, 138-54.) Although Sunrise disputes this evidence, Harleysville has offered sufficient evidence to preclude summary judgment. Accordingly, summary judgment is denied on these affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   2. Seventh Affirmative Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Harleysville's seventh affirmative defense alleges that Sunrise failed to provide prompt notice of the loss, which bars recovery under the Insurance Policy.

The Court concludes that Section 3420 does not apply to the Insurance Policy. As its title-\"Liability insurance; standard provisions; right of injured person\"-indicates, Section 3420 applies to liability insurance, not property insurance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indian Harbor Ins.

Further, Section 3420(a) states that its provisions apply to insurance contracts \"insuring\n   <em>\n    against liability\n   </em>\n   for injury to person ... or\n   <em>\n    against liability\n   </em>\n   for injury to, or destruction of, property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n    N.Y.

In response to an inquiry asking \"Does the prejudice rule set forth in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 only apply to liability policies?\" the Office of General Counsel responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The second query asks whether the prejudice rule set forth in Insurance Law \u00a7 3420, which prevents the invalidation of a claim due to untimely notice by the insured, injured person or any other claimant unless the failure to provide timely notice has prejudiced the insurer, only applies to liability policies. The inquirer asserts that in some states, the prejudice rule is not limited to liability policies, and asks whether non-liability policies in New York may contain a prejudice rule.\n   <em>\n    Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 is limited to establishing minimum requirements for liability policies\n   </em>\n   . That statute, however, does not preclude an insurer from adding a similar prejudice provision in non-liability policies.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that Section 3420 does not apply to the Insurance Policy and, therefore, Harleysville is not required to demonstrate that it was prejudiced by Sunrise's alleged delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With respect to whether Sunrise provided prompt notice of the damage to\n   the Rockville Centre Inn, the Court concludes that a genuine dispute as to the material facts precludes summary judgment on that issue. For example, Sunrise has submitted evidence that Michael Morash reported, via telephone, damage to all three Morash Family hotels on November 9, 2012 (Pls. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 181-84),\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that he additionally notified Harleysville via email on January 28, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182). Harleysville, in turn, has submitted evidence that it did not receive notice on November 9, 2012, or on January 28, 2013. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 29.) Ultimately, whether and when Harleysville was notified about damage to the Rockville Centre Inn, and whether any delay was reasonable, will involve credibility determinations not suitable for disposition on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeffreys v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8916395\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/549/#p553\">\n    426 F.3d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"Assessments of credibility and choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury, not for the court on summary judgment.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rule v.

Accordingly, summary judgment is denied on Harleysville's seventh affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   3. Ninth Affirmative Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Harleysville's ninth affirmative defense alleges that Sunrise failed to take all reasonable steps to protect its property after Hurricane Sandy. Harleysville argues that the fact that the Third Estimate, submitted in November 2015, included a significantly higher estimate of damages than the Second Estimate, submitted in July 2013, is evidence that Sunrise failed to mitigate its damages in accordance with this provision of the Insurance Policy. Sunrise argues that the Third Estimate does not evidence a failure to mitigate damages, and again asserts that the Third Estimate uncovered existing damages that it had not previously been able to inspect for the reasons asserted in Mr. Minor's affidavit. Accordingly, the Court finds that a genuine dispute of fact exists as to whether Sunrise failed to take reasonable steps to protect its property and denies summary judgment on this affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   4. Tenth Affirmative Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Harleysville's tenth affirmative defense alleges that Sunrise failed to cooperate with the investigation of the claim as required under the Insurance Policy. Sunrise argues that the record evidence establishes that Sunrise cooperated with Harleysville's investigation. In response, Harleysville again argues that Third Estimate demonstrates a failure to cooperate. Harleysville also relies on additional record evidence that it argues more broadly evidences Sunrise's failure to cooperate. For example, Harleysville points to evidence that Mr. Minor canceled two inspections of the Rockville Centre Inn in May 2013 (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-46); that no one familiar with the damage to the Rockville Centre Inn attended the July 2013 inspection (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-77); and that Sunrise did not provide any documents responsive to Harleysville's request for information pertaining to its business income losses claim (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). The Court finds that the above\n   evidence is sufficient to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Sunrise cooperated with Harleysville's investigation of the claim, and thus denies summary judgment on this affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   5. Eleventh Affirmative Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Harleysville's eleventh affirmative defense alleges that Sunrise failed to produce for inspection and make available for copying documents requested by Harleysville. The Court finds that Harleysville has offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to this affirmative defense (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-12), and accordingly denies summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   6. Fourteenth Affirmative Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, Harleysville's fourteenth affirmative defense alleges that Sunrise's claims are barred by the late presentation of its claim resulting in prejudice to defendant. As Harleysville's opposition makes clear, this affirmative defense relates to Sunrise's allegedly untimely submission of the Third Estimate. As explained above, a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Sunrise submitted the Third Estimate in a reasonable time under the circumstances. Accordingly, summary judgment is denied on this affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   B. Sunrise's Motion to Strike\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Sunrise moves to strike the third through eleventh affirmative defenses as redundant under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied. Rule 12(f) permits a court to strike from a pleading any \"insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). \"Motions to strike affirmative defenses are 'generally disfavored.' \"\n   <em>\n    Emmpresa Cubana Del Tabaco v.

Moreover, although many of the affirmative defenses factually overlap, they address different legal defenses (as discussed above). With respect to prejudice, the Court concludes that Sunrise will not be prejudiced by the Court permitting these affirmative defenses to remain in the case. The parties have completed discovery, during which they engaged in extensive letter briefing on these issues, and fully briefed motions for summary judgment. Thus, Sunrise has full knowledge of the facts underlying these affirmative defenses. Moreover, these affirmative defenses are intricately related to the merits of Sunrise's claims, and will not unnecessarily prolong the trial.\n   <em>\n    Calabrese v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Harleysville's motion for summary judgment on (1) Sunrise's claim for business income losses; (2) Sunrise's claim for consequential damages; and (3) Sunrise's claim for attorney's fees and costs. The Court denies Harleysville's motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' Third Estimate of Damages because there are disputed issues of fact that preclude summary judgment on the issue of whether the Third Estimate of Damages was timely under the Insurance Policy.

In support, Harleysville points to,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    : (1) a May 1, 2014 email from plaintiffs' counsel stating that \"[o]n Rockville Centre Inn the insured will not be presenting a business income claim\" (Def. 56.1 Ex. 44); and (2) the fact that, when asked at his examination under oath in September 2014 whether it was Sunrise's \"intent to present a business income claim with respect to Rockville Centre Inn,\" Michael Morash responded, \"No, it is not. No, it is not\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    Ex. 48). However, because the Court grants summary judgment on Sunrise's claim for business income losses based on the plain language of the Insurance Policy, it need not determine whether this evidence and the additional evidence cited by Harleysville demonstrates that Sunrise waived its lost business income claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    As noted, whether Hurricane Sandy in fact caused damage to the Rockville Centre Inn is not at-issue in the instant motions.

In any event, even putting Mr. Minor's declaration aside, the Court finds that Harleysville has not established that any delay was unreasonable as a matter of law, and the Court concludes that whether any delay was reasonable is a question for the jury based on the disputed facts in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Harleysville has agreed to strike the twelfth affirmative defense.
