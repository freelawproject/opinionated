(Dkt. No. 91). Plaintiff Bruce M. Anderson filed this lawsuit in October 2014 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Chief Justice Valdez violated Plaintiff's right to free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by retaliating against Plaintiff for reporting the potential misuse of public funds by Valdez. (Dkt. No. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January 2015, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff's suit pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and Plaintiff responded by moving for leave to amend his complaint to add clarifying factual allegations. (Dkt. Nos. 16, 18). The Court granted the opposed motion for leave, thereby mooting the motion to dismiss, in April 2015. (Dkt. No. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2015, Defendant renewed his request for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that he was entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiff's First Amendment claim against him in his individual capacity, and that Plaintiff lacked any factual or legal basis for his requests for declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendant in his official capacity. (Dkt. No. 35). In June 2015, the Court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, but denied Plaintiff's appeal to qualified immunity at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage and permitted Plaintiff to pursue his request for injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement. (Dkt. No. 42). Defendant appealed the Court's denial of qualified immunity to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176901\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/580/\">\n    845 F.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016),\n   <em>\n    rh'g en banc denied\n   </em>\n   (2017). Upon Defendant's request, opposed by Plaintiff, the Court stayed all proceedings during the pendency of the appeal, from July 2015 to January 2017. (Dkt. No. 52). In July 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff's second, opposed motion for leave to amend his complaint to add factual allegations relevant to a new, anticipated defense theory. (Dkt. No. 89). Through the instant Motion also filed in July 2017, after the close of discovery, Defendant now requests summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim and request for reinstatement. (Dkt. No. 91;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 69). Upon consideration of the Motion and\n   the parties' responsive briefing (Dkt. Nos. 94, 96), in light of the relevant law, the Court finds that the Motion must be denied for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's Work History with the Thirteenth Court of Appeals and Justice Rose Vela\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Thirteenth Court of Appeals (referred to herein as the \"Thirteenth Court\" or \"Court\") for the State of Texas is comprised of six elected Justices and divided between two courthouses, one in Corpus Christi and one in Edinburg. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 13; GSANGER DEP. at pp. 18, 31, 33; PERKES DEP. at pp. 14-15; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 60).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff testified that his employment as an attorney with the Thirteenth Court spanned over 20 years, during which time Plaintiff worked for four different Justices in Corpus Christi. After leaving his employment with the Hidalgo County District Attorney's (\"DA's\") Office in 1988, Plaintiff first worked as a briefing attorney for Chief Justice Paul W. Nye for five years. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 7-8, 146). When Nye retired, Plaintiff became a research attorney working on more complex cases for the next Chief Justice, Robert J. Seerden, until 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 8-9. Plaintiff then received a promotion to the position of staff attorney for Justice J. Bonner Dorsey and held that position until Dorsey retired at the end of 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9. After working as a writs attorney for the Nueces County DA's Office from early 2003 until the end of 2006, Plaintiff returned to the Thirteenth Court as a briefing attorney for newly-elected Justice Rose Vela.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Justice Vela testified that she first met Plaintiff when she worked as a briefing attorney for Chief Justice Seerden from 1990 to 1992. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 66). During that time, Vela interacted with Plaintiff on a daily basis to conduct research and draft opinions for the Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 68. When she became a Justice herself, Vela hired Plaintiff as her briefing attorney and he served in this position for the entirety of Vela's six-year term, from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12, 70-71. Vela explained that although the briefing attorney position was considered junior to the staff attorney position within each Justice's chambers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   she \"had two very qualified attorneys, so [she] considered them to be equal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 70. Vela assigned her criminal cases to Plaintiff given his DA's Office experience, while the civil cases were assigned to the staff attorney who was board-certified in civil appellate law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 72, 124-25. Although Vela opted for this general division of labor, she testified that both attorneys were able to and did work on both types of cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he is legally blind, and that he lost all reading vision in 1996, at which point he began using a print magnifier at work. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 15-16). Justice Vela suggested that because of his impairment, Plaintiff \"was just a workaholic\"; she described him as \"an excellent attorney\" and \"by far, in my opinion, one of the hardest working attorneys that I had ever worked with in any...part of my career.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 123).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Justices Vela and Perkes Investigate Use of Chapter 22 Fund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Justice Vela testified that in early 2011, the Nueces County Republican Party approached her and newly-elected Justice Gregory T. Perkes about the party's interest in a bill filed in the Texas legislature to split the Thirteenth Court into two appellate courts, one in Corpus Christi and one in Edinburg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17. At the time, Justices Vela and Perkes were the only Justices on the Thirteenth Court who had been elected as Republicans. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 133; PERKES DEP. at pp. 106-07). The remaining four Justices had been elected as Democrats. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 133). Vela and Perkes, along with Justice Nelda Rodriguez, were based in Corpus Christi, and Defendant and Justices Gina Benavides and Dori Contreras were based in Edinburg, although the Justices heard oral argument in both locations. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 14, 132; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 580, 584).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Justice Vela testified that in researching the bill to split the Thirteenth Court, she and Perkes learned of \"a fiscal note attached to the bill, which meant that in order for the bill to succeed...it had to show that the effect of [the split] would be budget neutral.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 17-18). The Justices then decided to \"figure out how [the split could] be budget neutral by looking into the finances of the court[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In speaking with the Nueces County Judge, Nueces County Auditor, and the\n   Thirteenth Court's Chief Clerk at the time, Cathey Wilborn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Justices Vela and Perkes became aware of a fund prescribed by Chapter 22 of the Texas Government Code (\"Chapter 22 fund\"), consisting of filing fees paid by litigants to the counties covered by the Thirteenth Court. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 16, 20-21; PERKES DEP. at p. 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Justices also learned that \"there were leftover funds every year and those funds would go directly to the chief justice's office.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 16; PERKES DEP. at p. 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At some point, a Texas Public Information Act request (referred to herein as \"open records request\") pertaining to the Chapter 22 fund was made by Joel Yowell, an individual involved in the local Republican party who had previously served as Justice Vela's campaign treasurer. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a letter dated May 10, 2011, Defendant in his capacity as Chief Justice responded to Yowell that upon consultation with the Court's accountant, Thomas Mendez, the Thirteenth Court had decided to charge for the production of certain of the requested records, at the approximate total cost of $1,500.00. (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 13). By letter dated June 1, 2011, Vela and Perkes wrote to Defendant about the open records request for documents related to the Chapter 22 fund, and stated that they had learned that this public fund had never been audited. (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 536). The Justices communicated their beliefs that \"an audit of this fund (from its inception) to the present date [should] be performed by either the state or county auditor at the earliest possible date,\" and that such an audit was \"the only true way to maintain the integrity of the accounting procedures and continued receipt of the fund, as well as to pass public scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At some point after the open records request, and possibly on two occasions, all of the Justices met to discuss the request and the Chapter 22 fund. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 61-63; PERKES DEP. at p. 121-22; BENAVIDES DEP. at p. 52; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 119). Defendant testified that when the Justices met, Vela inquired about the Chapter 22 fund, Defendant \"proceeded to explain...what it [was] because Perkes was brand-new,\" and Vela\n   and Perkes told Defendant that they wanted an audit of the fund. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 112-13). Defendant opposed the audit as costly and without reason, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Now, if you tell me there's some reason, if one of my employees is doing something wrong or, you know, you find out something's odd, let's do an audit. I will be the first one to be in line. But just to have an audit just to have an audit, you know, it doesn't make any sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 113-14. Defendant also characterized the audit request as the unnecessary airing of \"dirty laundry,\" explaining that the airing and resolution of any problem should first occur internally, rather than \"out in public where people are listening to us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 120. According to Defendant, neither Vela nor Perkes ever expressed to him any belief that he had mismanaged the funds in the Chapter 22 account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant knew that Vela's former campaign treasurer had made the open records request, and had heard rumors that Vela was planning to run for office against him, but did not know whether the motivations for the audit were political.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 110-12, 117. To him, the audit request \"was coming out of left field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Justice Perkes testified that when the Justices met, Perkes supported the request for records related to the Chapter 22 fund because the Justices had a fiduciary responsibility to the Thirteenth Court, and \"it deeply concerned [him] that there was a fund that was unaudited, a public fund.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 122-23). He recalled Defendant referring to the Chapter 22 fund as a \"slush fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 133. Justice Benavides testified to her belief that an audit was an \"unnecessary expenditure of money from the Court,\" given that the Office of Court Administration (\"OCA\") already reviews the Thirteenth Court's financial records, and also since the Court \"[wasn't] having any problems that would require an audit.\" (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 51-53). She recalled that the other Justices \"were all pretty much on the same page except for, of course, Justice Vela and Justice Perkes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 53. Perkes testified that Benavides also expressed her disagreement with the audit request in a separate, brief exchange with him after oral argument, and that in his opinion she was \"sticking up for the chief.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On or around July 5, 2011, Justices Vela and Perkes sent a letter to the OCA, the entity that \"oversee[s]...the courts of appeal across the state of Texas,\" taking issue with a July 1, 2011 letter sent to the OCA by Defendant on behalf of the Thirteenth Court. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 141-42; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 534-35). According to Vela and Perkes's letter, Defendant had written to the OCA that \"[g]iven these lean financial times and the State budgetary cuts impacting the Court, the Court en banc determined that waiving the charges [for the open records request] was not in the public interest because the records sought do not primarily benefit the general public.\" (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 534). Vela and Perkes disagreed \"that documents reflecting the Court's use of public, taxpayer funds does not 'primarily benefit the general public,' \" and also with Defendant's representation that this determination was made \"en banc\" by all six of the Thirteenth Court Justices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Vela and Perkes further expressed their concern that the Chapter 22 monies managed by Defendant were \"possibly being used outside of their permissible scope,\" noting that the only monthly bank statement produced through the open records request showed check card charges to local restaurants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 535. The Justices sought \"guidance as to the permissible use of these funds, so as to fully ensure compliance with the law,\" and also noted that no\n   action had been taken on their previous correspondence requesting an audit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By letter dated September 22, 2011, the OCA responded that under the operative statutory provisions, \"the only limitation on the Court's authority to use [the Chapter 22] funds is that they be used for official court business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 532-33. The letter also recommended that \"the appropriate entity to conduct...an audit would be the state auditor, not the county auditor,\" under the authority of Texas Government Code \u00a7 321.017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 533.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In or around November 1, 2011, Justices Vela and Perkes wrote to the State Auditor's Office to request an audit \"as soon as possible,\" noting that \"[u]ntil this week, [they] were not provided access to information regarding expenditures from [the Chapter 22 fund account managed by Defendant] and had no knowledge of how these funds were being utilized.\" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 15). Referencing bank statements and documentation provided in response to the open records request, and apparently attached to the letter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Justices opined that \"the fund has been used for hotels, restaurants, travel, employee bonuses, birthday cakes, flowers and other various uses which we do not believe are within the permissible scope of the fund's use or are within the spirit of the intended use of taxpayer monies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Vela testified that Yowell provided her with the bank statements and documentation, that she reviewed them pursuant to her responsibility as a steward of public funds, and that when the records revealed \"questionable use of taxpayer money,\" she believed it her duty as a Thirteenth Court Justice \"to do something.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 24-25, 40-41). Perkes recalled Vela showing records to him, and that he saw charges for \"meals for staff to go out for birthday parties\" and \"trips that seemed like they were not for judicial purposes.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 134). However, he did not \"carefully walk through the documents\"; he wanted the fund audited but \"did not want to get deep in the minutiae of the political that [he] saw going on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In a letter dated November 17, 2011 and addressed to Justices Vela and Perkes, with copies sent to the other Justices, the State Auditor's Office responded that \"[d]ue to limited resources and our audit work schedule, the SAO will not be able to initiate an audit as requested at this time.\" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 16). Perkes testified to his belief that no audit ever occurred. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Justice Vela Compares Chapter 22 Fund Records with Defendant's Campaign Finance Records, and Asks Plaintiff for His Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Justice Vela testified that she did not involve Plaintiff in the audit request, and that she did not recall speaking to him about the Chapter 22 fund in 2011. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 134). However, sometime in 2012, while meeting with Plaintiff in her office during the course of the workday, she spoke to him about records she had obtained which indicated that Defendant had made \"same day, same payee, exact same amount\" charges to the \"court account\" and his campaign account, raising the concern of \"duplicate reimbursements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 76-81, 84, 134. Vela\n   asked Plaintiff for \"his opinion, what did he think,\" and did not recall what Plaintiff told her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 77, 82. Vela testified that she did not consider it Plaintiff's job duty to assist her in researching whether Defendant had violated the law, and that she did not ask Plaintiff to do any legal research on the issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 134-35. As she lacked \"underlying data\" for the records in her possession, Vela did not reach any conclusion about whether the records revealed any illegal activity or violations of the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, and did not tell Plaintiff to report Defendant to anyone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 82, 84, 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff also provided testimony about Justice Vela's conversation with him, recalling that in early 2012, Vela called Plaintiff into her office during the workday and told him about the Chapter 22 fund records obtained through the open records request. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 21-23). Vela also told him that she had compared those records with Defendant's 2012 campaign finance records and had discovered that Defendant had taken \"double reimbursements\" from the two funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 24-26. Vela then asked Plaintiff for his opinion, in light of his past experience as a prosecutor, as to whether Defendant had committed any crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 27. At the time, Plaintiff recalled hearing a radio story about a Texas state representative who \"was caught taking double reimbursements, which constituted a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 31. Out of personal interest, Plaintiff had determined through an Internet search that the crime was \"abuse of official capacity,\" and had looked up the crime in the Texas Penal Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the basis of this recollection and the facts provided to him by Vela, Plaintiff offered his opinion that Defendant \"may very well have committed the crime of abuse of official capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 27-28, 33. Plaintiff testified that Vela did not ask him to report Defendant to the authorities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff Sends Letters to Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice and State Commission on Judicial Conduct in October 2012\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When Plaintiff began his employment with Justice Vela in 2007, he signed an \"Oath of Briefing Attorney,\" sworn to and subscribed by Vela, which included the statement, \"I recognize that I am subject to the provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct and will observe the standards of fidelity and diligence prescribed.\" (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 497). Relevant to this case, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct (\"the Code\") provides that \"[a] judge shall comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 503. The Code also contains a section outlining Texas judges' \"Disciplinary Responsibilities,\" among them that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [a] judge who receives information clearly establishing that another judge has committed a violation of this Code shall take appropriate action. A judge having knowledge that another judge has committed a violation of this Code that raises a substantial question as to the other judge's fitness for office shall inform the State Commission on Judicial Conduct or take other appropriate action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After his conversation with Justice Vela, Plaintiff was disturbed by the possibility that the sitting Chief Justice of the Thirteenth Court had violated Texas law. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 43). He saw it as \"a matter of tremendous public importance,\" explaining that \"[i]f a chief justice is taking double reimbursements and violating the Penal Code, that's extremely important and it needs to be stopped, it needs to be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 43-44. Plaintiff felt that Vela had an obligation to report Defendant\n   to the authorities and assumed that she would, but when he asked her in or around May or June 2012 whether she planned to do so, Vela responded that she did not because \"it would look too political.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 44, 136, 157-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff did not share Justice Vela's concern, and felt compelled to report Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 44, 157. He reasoned that \"if it leaked out\" that he made a report, and \"if they tried to fire [him],\" he needed to accumulate enough vacation pay to compensate him through the end of Vela's term in December 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 135-37. After accumulating about two months of vacation pay, Plaintiff wrote to Wallace B. Jefferson, Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court, by letter dated October 10, 2012 and marked \"confidential.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 44, 135-37; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 556-57). Plaintiff explained what he knew of the Chapter 22 fund and the open records request, including the possibility that some documents responsive to the request had been destroyed. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 556-57).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also recounted his conversation with Vela regarding Defendant's receipt of double reimbursements from the Chapter 22 fund and Defendant's campaign fund, and suggested that Defendant may have committed the crime of abuse of official capacity under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 39.02.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 557. Plaintiff stated, \"I am reporting this information to you because I do not know who else to report it to.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 556.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On October 23, 2012, the Supreme Court's General Counsel responded by directing Plaintiff to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct (\"SCJC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 558. Plaintiff then wrote to the SCJC in another \"confidential\" letter dated October 30, 2012, nearly identical in substance to his previous letter to Chief Justice Jefferson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 559-60. On November 13, 2012, the SCJC responded that it had \"received [Plaintiff's] complaints against two (2) Texas judges,\" that the complaints would receive a thorough review and investigation, and that the proceedings were confidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Plaintiff Applies to Work in Volunteer Capacity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In December 2012, as Justice Vela's term on the Thirteenth Court was nearing its end, Plaintiff asked Justice Perkes if he could stay on as a volunteer for the early part of 2013. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 137; PERKES DEP. at p. 22; Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 11). Perkes testified that \"[a] lot of your staff attorneys in the court stay one or two, maybe three years,\" so he surmised that Plaintiff \"was hoping a position would open up that he could eventually take.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 23). On December 17, 2012, Perkes sent an email to Defendant informing him of Plaintiff's request and Perkes's desire \"to facilitate [Plaintiff] in that role for that time period,\" using \"the identical procedure that we use for unpaid, summer interns.\" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 11). Perkes asked for Defendant's assistance and Defendant responded that he would \"check into this and review the policy considerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant testified that he consulted the Thirteenth Court's Chief Clerk, Dorian Ramirez, in order to determine \"what were the pros and cons and if that had ever happened and what do we need to do.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 21, 105-06;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RAMIREZ DEP. at p. 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ramirez\n   ultimately recommended that the request be denied because Plaintiff would not be covered by workers' compensation insurance, and also because the Court lacked equipment for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 106-08. Perkes also spoke with Justice Benavides about Plaintiff's request, \"[not] so much about Plaintiff\" himself, but \"more about...procedure in the court\"-that is, whether \"we want to have attorney interns working in the court[.]\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 176-77;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 11). Benavides testified that she gave Perkes her opinion that the request should be denied because \"[w]e've never had...lawyers that are unpaid interns that aren't particularly working for any chambers, and we didn't have a policy in place that would allow that to occur.\" (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at p. 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Justice Perkes testified to his understanding that Defendant spoke to all of the Justices, who \"basically said no\" because \"[t]hey didn't want to create a new policy of having people come and volunteer on the court like that.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 22, 25-27). Therefore, Perkes \"told [Plaintiff] no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 22. Perkes did not recall Defendant, Benavides, or anyone else making any complaints about Plaintiff personally or about his work product, and neither Defendant nor Benavides testified to any other reason for denying Plaintiff's request to work in a volunteer capacity. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 168-69, 179-83; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 108; BENAVIDES DEP. at p. 44). Perkes testified to his opinion that Plaintiff was an \"excellent attorney,\" that he \"did a good job\" on the opinions he wrote for the Court, that he \"was always pleasant and polite,\" and that he \"basically kept to himself, did his job.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 165-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff testified that on January 2, 2013, he began volunteering at the Nueces County DA's Office, located in the same building as the Thirteenth Court, and that he was still a volunteer there as of his March 2017 deposition. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PERKES DEP. at p. 199).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    F. In 2013, Former Justice Vela Provides Information to SCJC and Learns of Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Justice Vela testified that in February 2013, she received a telephone call from SCJC investigator Royce LeMoine, who informed her that he was investigating Defendant's use of funds and wanted all of the information Vela had relating to this investigation. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 44-45). Vela perceived LeMoine's questioning as \"accusatory,\" \"almost like...he was investigating [her].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 47. LeMoine did not tell Vela that a complaint had been filed with the SCJC, or who had filed it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45. That same month, Vela responded by letter and enclosed numerous documents, including the records she had indicating Defendant's potential receipt of double reimbursements, correspondence relating to Vela and Perkes's audit request, and a complete copy of the Chapter 22 fund bank account records for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 43-45; Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 21). Vela testified that she possibly copied the Texas Attorney General's (\"AG\") Office on her letter to the SCJC. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At some point in 2013, after Justice Vela sent the information to LeMoine, Plaintiff told Vela that he had filed a complaint with the SCJC. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 46-47; PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 71). Plaintiff testified that Vela called to tell him that someone had reported Defendant to the SCJC, at which point Plaintiff responded, \"[W]ell, your Honor, it was me.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Travis County DA's Office Initiates Investigation and Plaintiff Provides Information to DA's Office in April 2013 and April 2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Travis County DA's Office records indicate that on March 7, 2013, the Texas AG's Office forwarded to the DA's Office a letter from Justice Vela reporting that Defendant \"is improperly charged (sic) a taxpayer funded account while at the same time charging his campaign expense account, thus 'double dipping.' \" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 22). On this basis, in April 2013 the DA's Office Special Prosecution/Public Integrity Unit opened a case to investigate the allegations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Vela recalled that sometime after March 2013, she received a few calls from the Travis County DA's Office about the investigation. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 95-100). She did not remember the substance of the conversations, nor whether she provided any documents to the DA's Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After becoming aware of a possible investigation by the Travis County DA's Office,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff wrote to the DA's Office by letter dated April 30, 2013 and marked \"confidential,\" disclosing that he had reported Defendant to the SCJC in October 2012, and offering information concerning additional double reimbursements that he had since learned of from former Chief Clerk Wilborn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as additional observations he had made while employed by the Thirteenth Court concerning the possible destruction of records responsive to the open records request. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 550-52). Plaintiff opined that any destruction of records could not have occurred without the knowledge and cooperation of the Thirteenth Court's Chief Staff Attorney, Cecile Gsanger, the Court's current Chief Clerk, Ramirez, and Mendez, who Plaintiff identified as \"the Court's administrative assistant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 551. Almost one year later, on April 14, 2014, Plaintiff again wrote to the Travis County DA's Office to offer additional information given him by Wilborn concerning Defendant's receipt of double reimbursements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 547-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    H.

Job Posting and Overview of Applicable Thirteenth Court Hiring Procedures and Administrative Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the spring of 2014, Justice Perkes's senior staff attorney resigned and Perkes began looking for a replacement. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 30-31, 189-90; HOLLOWAY DEP. at pp. 34-35; LOCKWOOD DEP. at pp. 13-14). At the time, Perkes was the only Justice on the Thirteenth Court who had been elected as a Republican, and he remained based in Corpus Christi along with Justice Rodriguez. (Dkt. No. 91, LOCKWOOD DEP. at p. 37; PERKES DEP. at pp. 16-17; Dkt. No. 91 at p. 580). Justice Nora Longoria, who had replaced Justice Vela, officed primarily in Edinburg along with Defendant and Justices Benavides and Contreras. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 17; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 61; BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 69-70; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 582, 584).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the time, the responsibility for drafting and posting the Thirteenth Court's job openings fell to Chief Clerk Ramirez and/or to Chief Staff Attorney Gsanger. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at pp. 122-23; RAMIREZ DEP. at p. 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The job posting for Perkes's senior attorney, which listed a start date of May or June 2014 and required the submission of applications to Ramirez, set forth \"minimum qualifications\" including \"[t]hree to five years of prior legal experience\" and \"preferred qualifications\" including \"prior work for an appellate court or other appellate experience.\" (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 501-02). The Thirteenth Court's Hiring Procedures in effect at the time instructed, in relevant part, that \"[i]n order to be eligible for a particular position, an applicant must meet all of the minimum qualifications as noted on the job posting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 528. The Procedures further stated that \"[a]n applicant does not have to have the preferred qualifications to be eligible for the position,\" although generally, \"those applicants meeting the greater number of job qualifications should be more competitive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Procedures also provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Hiring decisions shall be made by the appropriate 'hiring official,\" as follows: Senior attorneys, briefing attorneys, and legal assistants shall be hired by the Justice to whom they are assigned.

Plaintiff Applies for the Job\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Justice Perkes testified that although April was \"not a good time to be looking for candidates\" for the senior attorney position, and the pool of applicants was small, he had inherited a backlog of work from his predecessor Justice and believed it urgent to fill the position. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 30-31, 169-70, 240-41). Plaintiff was among those who applied for the job. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 153-54). Perkes's entire chambers-the outgoing senior attorney, junior staff attorney Daniel Lockwood, and legal assistant Caylie Holloway-participated in reviewing the applications submitted, and agreed that Plaintiff was the top candidate. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 39-40, 191-93; HOLLOWAY DEP. at pp. 35-36, 39; LOCKWOOD DEP. at pp. 14-15). Perkes testified that the other applicants \"just weren't even close\"-that \"without a doubt,\" there was \"a mile between number one and number two.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 40, 192-93, 196). Perkes had observed Plaintiff working with Justice Vela and thought he was someone with whom Perkes could work closely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 196. Perkes also testified that despite Plaintiff's visual impairment, \"[h]e got product out pretty fast,\" and that perhaps because of that\n   impairment, Plaintiff \"had one of those minds\" that was \"[e]nhanced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 198. Perkes explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   You walk in and talk to [Plaintiff] about a case or a particular issue, and he would pop up, 'It's so-and-so case.' Bing, bing, bing.

(Dkt. No. 91, LOCKWOOD DEP. at p. 11). Lockwood described Plaintiff as \"very astute,\" with \"a very good mind for criminal law especially,\" and testified that he had periodically asked for and received assistance from Plaintiff when Lockwood was \"spinning [his] wheels on a particular assignment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10-11.

Justice Benavides Expresses Concerns about Plaintiff's Potential Hiring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Justice Benavides testified that even before the job posting, she knew that Justice Perkes was looking for a senior attorney. (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at p. 70). When she learned that Perkes intended to interview Plaintiff for the position, she called Perkes \"because [she] didn't want him to hire [Plaintiff].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71. According to Perkes, Defendant first informed him that Benavides had issues with Plaintiff, at which point Perkes had a meeting with Benavides to discuss those concerns. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 42, 45). Perkes explained that \"if somebody's saying they have a problem with [an attorney] who...would have been my senior staff attorney..., I needed to know about it and if it could be resolved, so we sat down and talked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 44. Perkes described the Thirteenth Court at the time as \"very political\" and \"hostile,\" and testified that he \"didn't want to create additional hostilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Justice Benavides testified that she and Justice Vela had started at the Thirteenth Court at the same time, and that she became familiar with Plaintiff's work through the circulation process used to review and edit the Court's opinions. (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 15-26). Generally, the process begins with the random assignment of a case to a panel of three Justices, one of whom is assigned as the \"writing author.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 19. In the stage of the process known as \"first circulation,\" that Justice's initial draft of the opinion circulates among all of the panel Justices' attorneys, who edit the opinion before sending it to \"second circulation,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , review by Chief Staff Attorney Gsanger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The opinion then goes to \"third circulation\" among the three Justices on the panel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If Benavides had an issue with an opinion, either because her attorneys \"red-flagged\" it at first circulation or based on her own review at third circulation, she would talk to the writing Justice and/or the attorney who wrote the opinion for that Justice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   By the end of Justice Vela's term, Justice Benavides had developed the following opinions regarding Plaintiff and his work product: (1) Plaintiff had a tendency to write opinions that \"did not fully flush out all the facts and issues in a case\"; (2) Plaintiff was \"not a team player\" in the circulation process, in that he \"did not participate in the editing process in a manner that was efficient for the Court\"; (3) he had an arrogant attitude toward Benavides\n   and was not open to criticism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 27-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based on her observations, Justice Benavides implemented a special policy within her chambers for when Plaintiff was the attorney writing an opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 37-40. At third circulation, Benavides would require her staff to provide her with the first circulation edits so that she could evaluate whether her attorneys' recommendations were being followed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 38. Benavides testified that her attorneys' edits were not generally included, in which case she would advise Justice Vela's chambers that the edits needed to be included before she would \"sign off\" on the opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39. \"Sometimes they would do them, sometimes they wouldn't,\" and if her attorneys' edits were not included, Benavides would then determine whether to write a separate concurrence or a dissent, or to just \"let it go\" and sign off on the opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Benavides testified that this policy caused delays in the circulation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Justice Benavides testified that she raised all of these issues when she spoke with Perkes, and that she also expressed her concern that Plaintiff \"only handled criminal matters, and Justice Perkes'[s] docket was behind and [she] thought that would only make [his] docket further behind.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 72. At the end of the conversation, Benavides thought she had convinced Perkes not to hire Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 74. She suggested re-posting the position, and also offered to reach out to other lawyers to find new candidates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Perkes, however, left the conversation with the understanding that he could address and resolve Benavides's concerns with Plaintiff, and that in such case Benavides did not oppose Plaintiff's hiring. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Justice Benavides testified that she also spoke with Defendant and Justices Contreras and Longoria about Plaintiff's potential hiring, but did not detail for them the issues she had with Plaintiff; she merely told them that she had concerns and had raised those concerns with Justice Perkes. (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 75-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Justice Perkes Interviews and Hires Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he had an informal interview with Justice Perkes during the first week of April, and that \"the first words out of [Perkes's] mouth were, 'I heard that you reported the Chief to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, how is that going?' \" (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 74, 120). Plaintiff confirmed that he had reported Defendant to the SCJC and relayed what Justice Vela had told him about Defendant's potential receipt of double reimbursements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 74-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff recalled that his formal interview occurred on May 2, 2014, whereas Justice Perkes remembered interviewing Plaintiff only once, on that date. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 129; PERKES DEP. at pp. 32-33, 40-42). Perkes testified that during the interview process, he never asked Plaintiff whether he had filed a complaint against Defendant. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 33). Perkes recalled that he spent time talking to Plaintiff about Justice Benavides's concerns, and that he \"really wanted to impress upon [Plaintiff] that I'm hiring him with those things in mind, and we're going to have to really work on those things.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the conclusion of the interview, Perkes offered Plaintiff the job, and Plaintiff accepted it. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 129; PERKES DEP. at p. 201). According to Plaintiff, Perkes instructed him to tell Chief Clerk Ramirez that he had been hired. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Plaintiff Is \"Un-Hired\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    a. After Defendant Learns of Hiring, He Asks Chief Staff Attorney to Look into Plaintiff's Opinion History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On the morning of May 2, 2014, Ramirez sent an email to Justice Perkes, copying Defendant and Mendez, stating that Plaintiff had just come to her office asking for the amount of his gross salary. (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 499). Ramirez asked, \"Am I to assume that [Plaintiff] has been hired for the position?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ramirez forwarded this email to Chief Staff Attorney Gsanger, who responded, \"Crap!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Several minutes later, Justice Perkes responded by email, \"Yes, I am hiring [Plaintiff] as my Senior Staff Attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 500. Perkes copied his staff and Gsanger on his response, and Ramirez forwarded the response to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant testified that he then called Ramirez and Gsanger, who both expressed concerns about whether Plaintiff was qualified for the position. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 123-24, 134-36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   GSANGER DEP. at pp. 155-56; RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 42-43). Ramirez and Gsanger each testified at length about their concerns, some of which resembled the concerns raised by Justice Benavides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 91, RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 43-63; GSANGER DEP. at pp. 63-114). According to Gsanger, she provided \"the same detail\" to Defendant. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at p. 156). Ramirez remembered telling Defendant that Plaintiff \"was unprofessional, he was difficult to work with, and he was inappropriate at times.\" (Dkt. No. 91, RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   According to Defendant, it was \"for [him] to decide what was going to be the salary,\" so he \"had to decide whether or not [Plaintiff] was qualified...and competent for the position to make that final decision.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 139). Defendant testified that a Justice's senior attorney \"need[s] to understand and know how to do criminal cases and civil cases,\" and that in order to determine whether Plaintiff qualified for the job, Defendant asked Gsanger to look into Plaintiff's opinion history.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 139-40. Gsanger recalled Defendant asking her to verify whether Plaintiff had written only criminal opinions, and also that they discussed Justice Perkes's docket and its needs. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at pp. 156-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That same afternoon, Gsanger responded to Defendant's request via email marked \"confidential,\" noting that she had only been able to retrieve data from fiscal year 2009 through the end of Justice Vela's term, and that according to this data, Plaintiff \"did not write any civil cases during this period of time-all 132 cases were criminal.\" (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 516;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   pp. 517-22). Gsanger's email also noted that Defendant \"had asked about the other applicants for the position,\" and that she thought that Ramirez could forward the applications to Defendant if desired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 516.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defendant Speaks with Justice Perkes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant testified that he also called Justice Perkes and \"explained to him [Plaintiff's]...lack of cooperation being a team player..., following up on the duties of edits,\" and also that Defendant \"had done some research and [Plaintiff] only did criminal cases.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 144-45). Defendant reminded Perkes of his repeated requests for help with the civil docket, leading Defendant to believe that Perkes \"would be looking for...somebody who's strong on civil[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 146. Defendant admitted that Perkes still wanted to hire Plaintiff, believing that he could correct any issues with his managerial style.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant therefore\n   suggested that they \"take it en banc\" and \"see what the rest of the judges...think about it,\" and Perkes agreed. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 147;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PERKES DEP. at p. 278).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defendant Speaks with Other Justices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendant testified that at that point, he had already spoken with Justice Benavides and \"[knew] what...her vote [was] going to be.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 148). He then spoke with each of the other three Justices, explaining to them that Justice Perkes wanted to hire Plaintiff, and that Defendant \"personally [had] some problems with it\" and believed that Plaintiff was not qualified for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 148-49, 152. According to Defendant, all of the Justices told him, \"Well, we have problem[s] with him too,\" and \"our opinion is that it wouldn't be a good idea.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Justice Rodriguez, who had served on the Thirteenth Court since 1995, and whose principal office was in Corpus Christi, stated in her sworn declaration that by the time Plaintiff left the Court at the end of 2012, she \"had developed a general concern about the thoroughness of the analysis presented in his legal opinions,\" and that she \"felt obliged to give [Plaintiff's opinions] extra attention because [she] no longer had confidence in their depth or accuracy.\" (Dkt. No. 94 at p. 580). Rodriguez also attested that on the basis of her observations, she believed that Plaintiff \"did not fully participate in the circulation process,\" \"often did not incorporate the edits of other staff attorneys,\" and \"rarely offered his own edits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also felt that Plaintiff \"was not a good team player,\" \"always seemed to have a chip on his shoulder,\" and \"often acted in an arrogant manner-as though he believed he knew more than the Justices on the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rodriguez remembered Defendant calling to ask her opinion about Plaintiff's hiring, and that she \"told him [she] was absolutely against it and if there was any way to prevent him from coming back, [she] was all for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Justice Longoria, whose term with the Thirteenth Court began in 2013, and whose principal office was in Edinburg, attested in her declaration that she participated in a discussion with Defendant and Justices Benavides and Contreras in which Benavides \"voiced serious misgivings about whether [Plaintiff] would be a good hire, particularly given that Justice Perkes was already behind on his docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 582. Longoria also recalled Benavides expressing \"specific concerns regarding [Plaintiff's] refusal to work on civil cases and his failure to both make edits on other lawyers' opinions and...to incorporate other staff attorneys' edits in draft opinions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since she had never worked with Plaintiff, Longoria \"deferred to the majority, which [she] understood to be against the hiring decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Justice Contreras, who had served on the Thirteenth Court since 2002, and who at the time was based in Edinburg, stated in her declaration that she learned of Plaintiff's potential hiring from Justice Benavides, who reported that she had expressed concerns about the hiring to Justice Perkes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 584. Those concerns were that Plaintiff \"had not participated fully in the circulation process, that he would not take edits when other staff attorneys commented on his work, and that he was not a team player.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Contreras \"shared Justice Benavides's concerns because [she] had witnessed the same issues with [Plaintiff's] work performance,\" and therefore \"when asked by [Defendant],\" she told him that she thought Plaintiff should not be hired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Each of the Justices stated that Defendant did not attempt to sway her opinion regarding Plaintiff's hiring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 581, 582, 584.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Defendant Notifies Justice Perkes That He and Other Justices Do Not Approve of Plaintiff's Hiring, and Perkes's Office Informs Plaintiff That He No Longer Has a Job\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On the morning of May 6, 2014, Justice Perkes notified Defendant by email that it was his current senior attorney's last day of work, and that Perkes would \"need to move asap re [Plaintiff],\" especially since he had already offered Plaintiff the job. (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 565). Perkes stated his belief that Plaintiff's work ethic and Perkes's style of management would \"move these cases along\" and meet the concerns discussed with Benavides, and subsequently with Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Perkes also informed Defendant that \"none of the other candidates have any court experience and would require training and downtime,\" and therefore in the event that Perkes was \"not allowed to bring [Plaintiff] on board,\" he would \"need some assistance with [his] docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   That same hour, Defendant emailed Ramirez and Gsanger, \"Can you please call me to address my decision on [Plaintiff].\" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 32). In his ensuing conversation with Ramirez, Defendant asked her to draft a response to Justice Perkes based on that conversation, which she did. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 192-93; RAMIREZ DEP. at 100-03; Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 33). Later that afternoon, Defendant emailed the response to Perkes: \"After due consideration and after consulting with all of the other justices, we do not approve of your request and recommendation to hire [Plaintiff].\" (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 565). The response also offered Defendant's and the other Justices' assistance in reviewing applications and interviewing potential candidates for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Within minutes, Justice Perkes responded by email, \"I would request assistance then with respect to cases to which I have been assigned,\" suggesting \"two cases per Justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 566. He also suggested that since \"[t]he applicant pool of experienced attorneys is lacking at this time,\" \"[t]he best that we can do is re-post,\" and stated his intention to forward to Defendant the applications received thus far.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Immediately thereafter, Perkes forwarded his initial email and Defendant's response to Holloway, asking her to \"call the OCA and find out who I would need to speak with regarding staff attorney hires,\" and to do it \"ASAP.\" (Dkt. No. 94, Exh. 35). That same hour, Defendant emailed Perkes that the posting was still open, that Defendant would be happy to assist with the hiring process, and that the Justices would discuss the status of Perkes's docket at the next conference. (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 567).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Justice Perkes acknowledged that under the Court's Administrative Rules, he did not need the other Justices' approval to hire anyone, but testified that \"our rules tended to be fluid in those situations, and if there are five judges against me, that's a quick vote.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 47-48). He opined that \"[t]he effect of what the court did was to suspend their rules\" under Rule 23-a position also taken by Gsanger, who testified to her understanding that a majority of the Court en banc decided to temporarily suspend or amend Rule 21, which allows a Justice to hire his own staff, with respect to the hiring of Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 114-15; GSANGER DEP. at pp. 44-47).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, Perkes testified that he\n   \"didn't believe in the total veracity\" of Defendant's statement that all of the other Justices had disapproved of Plaintiff's hiring. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 72). Defendant himself disagreed that Rule 23 had been invoked in this situation, characterizing his discussions with the other Justices as \"trying to learn the facts before I make a final decision...on the salary [and on] whether...I need to object to it or not.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 143-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Justice Perkes testified that he \"was steadfast in favor\" of Plaintiff, and that in his view, his decision to hire Plaintiff was \"countermanded\" and \"rescinded.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 82, 233, 290). At that point, \"it put [Perkes] in substantial difficulty keeping the docket up while [he] had to go through the whole [hiring] process again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 233. He testified that \"the only thing [he] could think of [was to] write a letter to the chief justice of the Supreme Court or send a letter to the OCA, ...neither of which really had jurisdiction over the local court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 53. He remembered deliberating with Holloway on whether to contact the OCA, and in the end concluded, \"This is already a done issue. Move on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On May 8, 2014, Holloway called Plaintiff to tell him that he no longer had a position with Justice Perkes. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 103-104; HOLLOWAY DEP. at p. 65). Holloway felt \"horrible\" about making the call and \"didn't want to do it,\" explaining that she \"felt bad for [Plaintiff]\" and believed that \"[t]here was no logical reason for him not to be hired.\" (Dkt. No. 91, HOLLOWAY DEP. at p. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Testimony Concerning Defendant's Intervention in Other Justices' Hiring Decisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendant recalled two other occasions when he intervened in another Justice's hiring decisions. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 221-22). The first time, newly-elected Justice Longoria \"didn't have a good pool\" of staff attorney applicants and wanted to hire two \"rookie\" attorneys-one \"right out of law school\" and one who had only been an attorney for a few months-for the senior and junior attorney positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 169-70. Defendant told Longoria \"that it was not a good idea, that she was going to have problems,\" explaining in his testimony that a senior attorney without the minimum three-to-five years' legal experience was \"not going to be able to...do the job.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 171-73. Defendant therefore suggested that Longoria find a senior attorney among the other Justices' junior attorneys with requisite experience, which she did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The second time, when Justice Longoria's senior attorney left and she had selected a new hire, Defendant asked Gsanger to check the applicant's references and Gsanger \"came back with some negative reviews\"-namely, that the applicant was \"not a team player,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"not very dependable.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 218-21). Defendant then relayed this information to Justice Longoria, who decided to hire someone else.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    J. After Plaintiff Is \"Un-Hired,\" Justice Perkes Has Discussions with Former Justice Vela, His Chambers, and Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In an exchange of text messages on May 9, 2014, Justices Perkes and Vela discussed\n   the intervention in Plaintiff's hiring. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 112; PERKES DEP. at pp. 65-66; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 568-79). Vela recalled that she reached out to Perkes after Plaintiff called to tell her that \"he got unhired,\" and that he \"was confused and didn't understand what happened.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 110-11). The following text exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice Vela\n   </strong>\n   : \"Hey greg, what happened with Bruce-he called and told me he wasn't going to work with you after all?

No. 91 at pp. 568-79). Vela believed that the text exchange constituted the only discussion she had with Perkes about the withdrawal of Plaintiff's job offer. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 117-18). With regard to the reasons relayed to her for why Defendant opposed Plaintiff's hiring, Vela testified that no one had expressed these concerns to her when she was on the Court, and in fact offered testimony discounting the concerns about Plaintiff and\n   his work product that were noted in the text exchange and by other deponents in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 112-13, 123-32. Perkes also testified that he had \"never heard of anything negative at all with regard to [the] personality of [Plaintiff],\" and that he had not previously heard of any criticisms of Plaintiff's work product. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 170-72). Perkes testified, \"[T]o the contrary, I thought he was an excellent attorney. He was timely, and the product appeared to be good.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Whereas Justice Vela interpreted Justice Perkes's reference to the \"investigation\" of which Defendant may have \"gotten wind\" as \"the one that was being done by the [SCJC],\" Perkes testified that he was referring to the \"original investigation, when [Perkes] came on the court, regarding the [Chapter 22] funds[.]\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 137; PERKES DEP. at pp. 74-76, 95, 249). Perkes explained that he told Vela that the other Justices had \"kowtowed\" to Defendant's wishes based on his observations of the Thirteenth Court and his \"gut feelings\" at the time. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 68). He described the Court as a \"very politically divided\" environment in which Defendant \"would say things, and the other justices would basically go that direction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on Perkes's previous conversation with Justice Benavides, in which they discussed the same reasons given by Defendant for not hiring Plaintiff, Perkes believed that he had resolved those concerns with Benavides, and therefore \"the only person that came to mind at that point, it had to be [Defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 69, 79-80. Perkes explained that his \"gut instinct\" that Ramirez also played a part stemmed from his observation that Ramirez \"works right under [Defendant], and basically her job is contingent upon [Defendant],\" and that if Perkes \"said anything to [Ramirez], [Defendant] would know it within minutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Justice Perkes testified that after the text exchange with Justice Vela, junior attorney Lockwood approached Perkes at the office and first alerted him that Plaintiff had filed a complaint against Defendant. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 33-34, 56-57, 94-95). According to Perkes, he had suspected Plaintiff's involvement in Vela's original investigation into the Chapter 22 fund, but found it \"shocking\" that Plaintiff had filed a formal complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After learning about the complaint from Lockwood, Perkes spoke with Holloway, who provided him with a little more information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 57-58, 63-64. According to Perkes, he did not know where the complaint was sent-just that Plaintiff sent it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 247-48. He testified that Lockwood and Holloway may have thought that he already knew about the complaint, when in reality \"[his] thought was going way back to the original investigation with regard to the funds,\" and that he and his staff \"obviously did not have a communication there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 248-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Justice Perkes surmised that Lockwood and Holloway learned of the complaint from speaking to other Court employees or staff attorneys, among them Plaintiff, explaining that in the Corpus Christi office, \"[a]ll the judges [are on] one side, and all the staff are together on another side,\" and \"they're going to talk to each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 57-58, 254-56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lockwood recalled that on May 6, 2014, the day Defendant\n   informed Perkes that the other Justices did not approve of Plaintiff's hiring, Perkes \"was frustrated and a bit flustered\" and told Lockwood in chambers, \"[B]etween you and me, [Plaintiff] might be privy to certain information involving [Defendant] that [Defendant] knows about, and...he's taking...retaliation against [Plaintiff].\" (Dkt. No. 91, LOCKWOOD DEP. at pp. 23, 26-27). Lockwood could \"not recollect whether [Perkes] said that the process had been formalized through a complaint or not,\" and thought that Justice Rodriguez's staff attorney may have been the first to inform Lockwood that Plaintiff had formally complained with \"the ethics or the supreme court[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 27-28, 33-34. Lockwood believed that Rodriguez's staff attorney knew about this formal complaint at the time Plaintiff's job offer was withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 34. He testified that he did not know whether anyone else at the Court, including Holloway, knew of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 34-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Holloway testified that while still on the Thirteenth Court, Justice Vela had given her a set of documents containing copies of checks, and had asked Holloway to tell Vela what she thought of them. (Dkt. No. 91, HOLLOWAY DEP. at pp. 23-28, 33). Holloway reviewed the documents at home and formed the opinion \"that there was something not right about funds being used from [Defendant's] campaign and also funds coming from a local fund that were to the same place, the same amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 28-29. Holloway recalled giving the documents back to Vela, but did not remember whether she shared her opinion about them with Vela.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 30. Holloway did remember having a conversation with Plaintiff when he was still working for the Court, at which time Plaintiff told her that he had reported Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 31-32. Holloway knew only that Plaintiff \"wrote a grievance and sent it,\" but did not know where the grievance was sent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45. Holloway claimed that she did not talk to anyone else, including Justice Perkes, about the contents of the documents given her by Vela, because she \"didn't want anything coming back on Judge Perkes, [and she] just knew that if [Plaintiff] had reported it, that hopefully somebody would do something.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 30-31. Holloway also claimed that she did not tell anyone about Plaintiff's \"grievance,\" including Perkes, because she \"didn't want Judge Perkes involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 47, 68. At some point, she \"just got the idea that [Perkes] knew\" about the grievance, but she did not think that he knew at the time he interviewed Plaintiff for the senior attorney position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 50-51. Holloway testified that before she called Plaintiff to tell him that he no longer had a job, she wrote down talking points to follow when speaking to him because she \"didn't want to deviate\" and \"give [her] reasons as to why\"-that is, her opinion that \"they didn't want to hire [Plaintiff] because of his grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 13, 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiff testified that on May 12, 2014, a few days after the text exchange between Justices Perkes and Vela, Plaintiff called Perkes. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at p. 93). According to Plaintiff, Perkes told him that Defendant \"took it upon himself to tell all the judges on the court not to allow me to work for Justice Perkes\" because Plaintiff had filed a complaint against Defendant with the SCJC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 58, 93, 104-05. Plaintiff testified that Perkes further informed him that Defendant \"brought the issue up for a vote and it went 5 to 1,\" with Perkes voting for Plaintiff and the other five Justices voting against him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Justice Vela testified that she also spoke with Plaintiff after the text exchange, but by then Justice Perkes had called Plaintiff \"and explained to him what happened\"-that \"he didn't get the job because the other judges had voted not to...employ\n   him.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 115). Vela did not give Plaintiff her opinion as to why, other than to state her belief that the situation was \"unusual,\" since \"when [she] was on the court every judge had...the right to hire whoever they wanted[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Justice Perkes did not offer any testimony concerning a phone call with Plaintiff; rather, he remembered that at some point after Plaintiff's offer of employment was withdrawn, Plaintiff came to Perkes's office to \"try[ ] to figure out what went on,\" and that in their short conversation, Perkes told Plaintiff, \"They said no. I don't know anything else [that] I can tell you.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 59, 97). Perkes denied telling Plaintiff that Defendant intervened in the hiring decision because Plaintiff had filed a complaint against Defendant, recalling, \"I told [Plaintiff] I felt bad about him. I had a bad feeling in my gut, but that's about as far as it went.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 59-60, 96-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    K. Additional Evidence Regarding Justices' and Thirteenth Court Employees' Knowledge of Plaintiff's Communications with SCJC and/or Travis County DA's Office\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiff testified that before Defendant's intervention in his hiring, Plaintiff had spoken with one former and one current Thirteenth Court employee about his communications with the SCJC and/or the Travis County DA's Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff recalled telling former Chief Clerk Wilborn in 2013 about his complaint to the SCJC, and his letters to the Travis County DA's Office setting forth information learned from Wilborn which provide some indication that he also spoke to her about the DA's Office investigation and his involvement in it. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 72-73, 99-100;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 547-52). Plaintiff further testified that in or around May or June 2013, he was in his office at the Nueces County DA's Office when he had a telephone conversation with the Thirteenth Court's Civil Clerk, Patty Fowler, who asked him, \"[W]hat's going on with Chief Justice Valdez?\" (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 100-01;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HOLLOWAY DEP. at p. 69). Plaintiff asked Fowler to come to his office, where he told her that Defendant was under investigation by the Travis County DA's Office, which had statewide jurisdiction to investigate crimes involving public officials, and that it was Plaintiff who had reported Defendant to the SCJC after learning from Justice Vela that Defendant may be taking double reimbursements from the Chapter 22 fund and his campaign finance fund. (Dkt. No. 91, PLAINTIFF DEP. at pp. 101-02).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendant and Justice Benavides testified that they did not know whether Plaintiff had any involvement in Justices Vela and Perkes's request for an audit of the Chapter 22 fund, and all five of the Justices who opposed Plaintiff's hiring attested that they did not know about Plaintiff's complaints to the SCJC or any other law enforcement entity until after Plaintiff's job offer was withdrawn. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 239-40, 174-75; BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 53-54; Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 581, 583, 584-85). Defendant stated that he first became aware that Plaintiff had filed a formal complaint against him in October 2014, when he received a fax from Plaintiff's counsel providing pre-suit notice of Plaintiff's federal court complaint. (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 174-75;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 537-45). Justice Benavides testified that she first became aware of accusations of \"double dipping\" by Defendant, and that Plaintiff\n   had communicated these accusations in \"some complaints\" against Defendant, when Defendant informed all of the Justices of the lawsuit and Benavides then read Plaintiff's pleading. (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 54-58). Justices Rodriguez, Contreras, and Longoria also stated that they did know that Plaintiff had filed complaints against Defendant with the SCJC or any governmental entity until after the filing of this lawsuit. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 581, 583, 584-85). According to Benavides, upon learning of the lawsuit, the Justices discussed among themselves that \"none of [them] knew\" that Plaintiff had filed any complaint. (Dkt. No. 91, BENAVIDES DEP. at pp. 57-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Gsanger and Ramirez testified that they did not learn of any formal complaints filed by Plaintiff until October 2014, when Plaintiff's counsel sent Defendant a draft of the pleading in this lawsuit. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at pp. 138-40; RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 65-72). Gsanger did not recall when she first learned of the allegations underlying those complaints-that Defendant was potentially taking double reimbursements from the Chapter 22 fund and his campaign fund-whereas Ramirez testified that she learned of those allegations when she learned of the lawsuit. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at p. 230; RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 70-72). Both Gsanger and Ramirez remembered speaking to Defendant about the lawsuit, and also that he gave them an explanation for the allegations of \"double dipping\"-that the identical charges to each account reflected travel expenses for him and his wife. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at pp. 141-42, 148-49, 233-34; RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 76-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Celinda Coronado, who served as Defendant's legal assistant from 2008 through 2015, testified that at Defendant's instruction, she charged Defendant's and his wife's travel expenses to separate accounts. (Dkt. No. 91, CORONADO DEP. at pp. 5, 14-16). She also stated that she did not remember Defendant receiving a call at the office from the SCJC or the Travis County DA's Office, and that she learned of Plaintiff's complaints to these entities after the filing of this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 28, 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    L. Justice Perkes Hires His Junior Staff Attorney for the Job\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   On May 8, 2014, the date Plaintiff's job offer was withdrawn, Defendant sent an email to Justice Perkes recommending that Gsanger \"serve as [Defendant's] proxy\" in the process of evaluating and recommending a replacement. (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at pp. 269-70; DEFENDANT DEP. at pp. 195-96). Gsanger confirmed that she participated in the process, along with Perkes, Lockwood, and Holloway. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at p. 200). Perkes ultimately hired a new junior attorney and, effective July 1, 2014, promoted Lockwood to the position of senior attorney even though he lacked the three-to-five years' legal experience required for that position. (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 495; PERKES DEP. at pp. 263-65; GSANGER DEP. at pp. 203-04, 206; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 197; LOCKWOOD DEP. at p. 43). Perkes acknowledged that he \"really wanted somebody that was out five, six, seven [years], you know, a longer term with a lot more experience,\" but that \"nobody in the well...was even close,\" and therefore he based his hiring decision not on \"the number of years\" but on \"appellate experience and writing experience.\" (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 263). According to Gsanger, \"[t]he ideal would have been to find an attorney with lateral outside experience to fill [the senior attorney] position,\" but since \"[t]hat applicant did not come forward, [Lockwood] was promoted.\" (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at p. 217). Gsanger testified to her belief that Defendant and the other Justices agreed to waive the minimum experience requirement, whereas\n   Defendant testified that he did not know whether Lockwood had the legal experience required for the senior attorney position. (Dkt. No. 91, GSANGER DEP. at pp. 206-07; DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 202). Defendant testified that any such lack of experience would not concern him since Lockwood's \"work product has...already been reviewed by...the other attorneys\" and \"seems to be satisfactory.\" (Dkt. No. 91, DEFENDANT DEP. at p. 203). Ramirez, who learned of Lockwood's lack of required legal experience at her deposition, testified that the lack of experience concerned her \"[b]ecause we have a [job posting] that says one thing and yet Justice Perkes had decided to promote [Lockwood] to senior attorney.\" (Dkt. No. 91, RAMIREZ DEP. at pp. 116-17). Ramirez was not aware of any other occasion when the Court hired an attorney who did not meet the minimum experience requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    M. Status of SCJC and Travis County DA's Office Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Justice Vela testified that sometime in 2013, after she had communicated with SCJC investigator LeMoine, she received a letter from the SCJC stating its determination that Vela herself had \"done no wrongdoing.\" (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at p. 51). Several years later, by letter dated February 10, 2017, the SCJC informed Plaintiff that it \"reviewed the facts and evidence obtained in the course of its investigation, which evidence included reviewing court records, interviewing individuals with knowledge of the matters addressed in the information [Plaintiff] provided, and performing legal research regarding the issues raised by [Plaintiff's] complaint,\" and that \"[i]n its discretion, the [SCJC] determined that there was insufficient evidence that [Defendant] engaged in 'double dipping' or engaged in retaliatory conduct toward [Plaintiff].\" (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 563-64). Therefore, \"[t]hose allegations were dismissed without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 563.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With regard to the Travis County DA's Office investigation into Defendant's potential receipt of double reimbursements, Justice Vela remembered receiving a call from a DA's Office representative informing her that \"they weren't going to pursue it,\" but did not remember why, nor did she recall receiving a closure letter. (Dkt. No. 91, VELA DEP. at pp. 104-05). The record contains no other competent evidence regarding whether Plaintiff's April 2013 or April 2014 letters to the Travis County DA's Office were addressed or resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the record does contain evidence that Plaintiff reported Defendant's alleged retaliation against him through another letter to the DA's Office dated May 13, 2014, and that on June 27, 2014, the DA's Office responded that it lacked venue over the matter. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 546, 553-55). In his May 2014 letter, Plaintiff claimed that Defendant had \"convinc[ed] the other Justices on the Court to vote against Justice Perkes'[s] attempt to hire [Plaintiff]\" solely because Plaintiff had \"satisfied [his] duty\" under the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct to report Defendant's alleged criminal behavior to the SCJC. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 553-55). Plaintiff's letter stated, \"I do not know how [Defendant] found out that I reported him to the [SCJC].

However, whistleblower laws did not create the duty on the part of the plaintiff to write the memo recommending disposition of the case-his job duties did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , 480 F.3d at 693 (when plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   \"articulated his opinion about a case in a memorandum to his supervisor, alleging that the police\n   acted inappropriately in gathering evidence, he did exactly what he was required to do\" as a prosecutor and calendar deputy). Here, \"rules of conduct\" applicable to all attorneys created the duty to engage in the particular form of speech at issue before the Fifth Circuit-a letter and complaint disclosing the potential misuse of public funds by a sitting state-court justice-not Plaintiff's employer. To put it another way, the relevant \"analogue\" is one of role, not content, and to determine the role the speaker occupied, courts must consider the source of his obligation to speak. If this obligation is \"created by and owed to\" the employer, the employer may control that speech regardless of its content. If it is not, the employer may not lawfully control speech exposing governmental misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiff has since filed his Third Amended Complaint, alleging that his protected speech includes the letter and complaint considered by the Fifth Circuit, as well as two letters sent to the Travis County DA's Office when Plaintiff no longer worked for the Thirteenth Court. Through its Motion, rather than appeal to a duty created by the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and shared by all lawyers, Defendant now asserts that when Plaintiff used information obtained from Justice Vela pursuant to \"a duty she held as a Justice\"-that is, her review of records relating to the Chapter 22 fund-in order to fulfill another duty Plaintiff shared with Vela under the Texas Judicial Code, by virtue of his Oath of Briefing Attorney, Plaintiff's \"reporting to the SCJC was triggered by his obligations as [an employee] and controlled by Vela, and his letters to the [DA's Office] were a continuation of that speech.\" (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 26-29). The difficulty with the attempted distinction between the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Conduct and the Texas Judicial Code is that, relevant to this case, their provisions are substantively the same; whereas the former requires \"[a] lawyer having knowledge that a judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the judge's fitness for office [to] inform the appropriate authority,\" the latter applies that rule to lawyers who happen to be judges (and through Plaintiff's Oath of Briefing Attorney, to lawyers who happen to work for judges).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   TEX. DISCIPLINARY R. OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 8.03(b); (Dkt. No. 91 at p. 506). In other words, the speech retains its citizen analogue, as well as the protection against employer control. Although Defendant submits that the Thirteenth Court \"could have simply not subjected [Plaintiff] to the Judicial Code's reporting obligations,\" and therefore the decision to do so was \"\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   an action exercising control over employees' speech,\" as an attorney Plaintiff had the same obligation regardless of that decision. (Dkt. No. 96 at p. 10) (emphasis in original). Moreover, as Plaintiff points out, the Preamble to the Code states that \"intrinsic\" to all of its sections \"are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system.\" (Dkt. No. 94 at p. 24) (citing Dkt. No. 91 at p. 503). \"In other words, the Code is intended to compel judges and judicial employees to act in the interest of the public and the legal system as a whole, not a particular employer.\" (Dkt. No. 94 at p. 24). Any duty Plaintiff had to report Defendant's alleged misuse of public funds was neither created by the Thirteenth Court, nor owed to the Thirteenth Court as an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Fifth Circuit's determination that Plaintiff's October 2012 letter and complaint \"were not created pursuant to his official duties\" also hinged on Plaintiff's allegations, now supported by the summary judgment record, that Justice Vela did not ask Plaintiff to report Defendant to\n   anyone, that Plaintiff did so on his own initiative, and that Plaintiff marked his letter and complaint \"confidential.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vela may have supplied Plaintiff with information raising the specter of malfeasance, but evidence exists that Plaintiff's choice to forward his opinion to Chief Justice Jefferson and the SCJC was his own, and not otherwise contemplated by his actual job duties as the briefing attorney responsible for the criminal cases assigned to Vela.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    547 U.S. at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (whether speech is made pursuant to employment duties is a \"practical\" inquiry, not determined by formal job descriptions but by duties that an employee \"actually is expected to perform\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, with regard to the speech made subsequent to Plaintiff's employment-his letters to the Travis County DA's Office-Defendant argues only that these letters were \"a continuation\" of employee speech.

Circumstantial Evidence Creates Fact Issue in This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Defendant's Motion emphasizes that he and all of the other sitting Justices, including Justice Perkes, aver that they did not learn of Plaintiff's filing of a formal complaint against Defendant until after Plaintiff's job offer was withdrawn. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 34-35). Chief Clerk Ramirez, Chief Staff Attorney Gsanger, and Defendant's legal assistant Coronado, all of whom worked under Defendant's direct supervision, also disavowed knowledge. Plaintiff, on the other hand, emphasizes that Justice Perkes asked him about his complaint with the SCJC during the interview process, and also told Plaintiff that Defendant \"took it upon himself to tell all the judges on the court not to allow [Plaintiff] to work for Justice Perkes\" because of that complaint. (Dkt. No. 94 at pp. 30-31). Whereas Perkes testified that he learned about Plaintiff's formal complaint from junior attorney Lockwood after the adverse action had occurred, Plaintiff claims that Lockwood \"disputed Justice Perkes's testimony, and testified that Justice Perkes in fact told him about the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 30. However, Lockwood recalled Perkes telling him that Plaintiff \"might be privy to certain information involving [Defendant] that [Defendant] knows about, and...he's taking...retaliation against [Plaintiff],\" and could \"not recollect whether [Perkes] said that the process had been formalized through a complaint or not.\" Perkes's testimony provides further insight into the \"information\" to which he may have been referring in his alleged comments to Lockwood; although, in an exchange of text messages with Justice Vela, Perkes surmised that Defendant may have retaliated against Plaintiff because he \"got wind\" of the \"investigation,\" Perkes explained in his deposition that the investigation to which he referred was the \"original\" one by Justices Vela and Perkes into the Chapter 22 fund, leading them to request an audit of that fund. As Defendant emphasizes, Perkes also explained that his statements regarding Defendant's motive were informed by \"gut feelings,\" not by actual knowledge that Defendant had intervened in Perkes's hiring decision because of Plaintiff's protected speech. (Dkt. No. 96 at pp. 20-22). In combination, Plaintiff's and Lockwood's testimony at least calls into question whether Justice Perkes knew of Plaintiff's SCJC complaint at the relevant time, but the Court agrees with Defendant that, standing alone, this testimony does not place Defendant's knowledge in genuine dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Nonetheless, the record also contains evidence that at the time of the adverse action, former Justice Vela, former Chief Clerk Wilborn, Justice Perkes's legal assistant Holloway, and Civil Clerk Fowler knew of Plaintiff's communications with the SCJC and/or Travis County DA's Office. Lockwood also testified to his belief that Justice Rodriguez's staff attorney knew that Plaintiff had filed a formal complaint against Defendant, and may have first relayed that information to Lockwood-a belief finding implicit support in the testimony of Perkes, who explained that the Corpus Christi staff had offices together on one side of the building, and that \"they're going to talk to each other.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record also provides support for the Fifth Circuit's pleading-stage observation\n   that Plaintiff's \"confidential\" letters were not, in fact, wholly confidential; the record confirms that \"Chief Justice Jefferson did not answer the [first] letter himself,\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176901\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/580/\">\n    845 F.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Justice Vela testified that SCJC investigator LeMoine contacted her for information relating to the investigation stemming from Plaintiff's complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176901\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/580/\">\n    845 F.3d at 591-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the SCJC's November 13, 2012 letter in response to that complaint, as well as Vela's testimony, indicate that the SCJC may have construed the complaint as an invitation to investigate Vela as well as Defendant, yet LeMoine still contacted her directly. In sum, Plaintiff has presented evidence that multiple individuals associated with the Thirteenth Court, or with the persons or entities to whom Plaintiff reported his suspicions of \"double dipping,\" knew that Plaintiff had filed a formal complaint against Defendant and in some cases, had communicated that knowledge to others, at the time of the adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Bregon\n   </em>\n   , generalized evidence of employee awareness raised a fact issue in combination with evidence that the plaintiff's protected complaint and termination occurred close-in-time to one another, and the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Handzlik\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   also rely on evidence of temporal proximity. This case, however, differs from these and other decisions in which temporal proximity, and the inference to be drawn from it, are determined by comparing two definitive points in time. Were the Court to do so here, it would note that Defendant's intervention in Justice Perkes's hiring decision post-dated Plaintiff's letters to Chief Justice Jefferson and the SCJC by almost a year and a half, whereas Plaintiff's communications with the Travis County DA's Office approximate the adverse action more closely, with Plaintiff's second contact occurring less than a month before Defendant's intervention in his hiring. However, Defendant conceivably could have acquired the knowledge necessary for a retaliatory animus at any point between October 2012 and the adverse action, and since Plaintiff left employment with the Thirteenth Court in December 2012 and was prevented from returning in May 2014, Defendant had little occasion to act on any knowledge he may have obtained until that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Temporal proximity is conceivable, but too speculative to supply the requisite inference of knowledge and causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Rather, that inference hinges on the remaining evidence to which Plaintiff points-evidence which, as in\n   <em>\n    Handzlik\n   </em>\n   and the district court cases on which Plaintiff relies, raises sufficient \"uncertainty\" regarding Defendant's knowledge and animus for the adverse action. That is, the record contains evidence that Plaintiff worked for the Thirteenth Court for over 20 years, during which time he was promoted and rehired by multiple Justices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Defendant and four of the Justices, as well as two of the employees under Defendant's direct supervision, attested to concerns about Plaintiff and his work product as the catalyst for their disapproval of his hiring in May 2014, with Defendant specifically recalling that he raised the following concerns with Justice Perkes: (1) Plaintiff's \"lack of cooperation being a team player..., following up on the duties of edits\"; and (2) that Plaintiff \"only did criminal cases,\" and Perkes had repeatedly asked for help with the civil docket. Justice Perkes did not see these concerns as impediments to Plaintiff's hiring, and in fact, he and Justice Vela for whom Plaintiff had worked, as well as Perkes's junior attorney Lockwood who also worked with Plaintiff, described Plaintiff and his work product in a vastly different light. Plaintiff's response suggests that \"if [Plaintiff's] work product or personality were as deficient as [Defendant] now claims, there would be some record of it before May 2014,\" yet the record contains no evidence of any disciplinary complaints or opposition to Plaintiff's employment until that time. (Dkt. No. 94 at p. 32). The record does contain evidence that, when Justice Vela retired in December 2012, Defendant and the other Justices (save Perkes) opposed Plaintiff's request to stay on in a volunteer capacity, but only because volunteer attorneys were unprecedented, and not because of any deficiencies in Plaintiff's personality or work. Nonetheless, approximately a year and a half after Plaintiff left the Court, during which time no one had occasion to review Plaintiff's work product, these deficiencies apparently served as cause to oppose Plaintiff's hiring by Justice Perkes. Of course, during that year and a half, the SCJC investigation engendered by Plaintiff's initial letter and complaint was ongoing, and Plaintiff wrote letters to the DA's Office in an attempt to aid in that entity's own investigation of Defendant. In this respect, the summary judgment evidence in this case aligns with that in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , where evidence existed that the decisionmaker at least had occasion to acquire knowledge of the plaintiff's protected complaint through another employee, after which she expressed negative opinions about the plaintiff even though she did not supervise him directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As Plaintiff points out, the record also contains evidence that Defendant's interference in Plaintiff's hiring violated the Court's own Procedures and Administrative Rules, which allowed Justices to hire their own staff attorneys, and also that the extent of Defendant's interference was \"unprecedented.\" (Dkt. No. 94 at pp. 32-34). Although Justice Perkes and Gsanger posited that the Justices' majority vote to disapprove of Plaintiff's hiring itself constituted an authorized suspension of the Administrative Rule allowing Justices to hire their own staff, thereby effectively disallowing the hiring, Defendant himself disagreed. Rather, he characterized his intervention in the hiring decision and his consultation with the other Justices as stemming from the need to assure himself that Plaintiff was \"qualified.\" Defendant explained that on another occasion, he told Justice Longoria not to hire a senior staff attorney who did not meet the minimum qualifications-in particular, the three-to-five years' legal experience also required in Justice Perkes's job posting. Yet, even though Defendant was aware of the needs of Perkes's docket, his interference in Plaintiff's hiring left Perkes without a senior attorney for approximately two months, and Plaintiff's eventual replacement was Lockwood, who admittedly lacked the minimum legal experience for the job. In other words, as Plaintiff puts it, the evidence at least calls into question whether Defendant \"typically enforces the Thirteenth Court's administrative rules and hiring procedures by requiring judges to hire attorneys who meet the minimum requirements, but violated these rules and\n   procedures to ensure that [Plaintiff] would not work for the Thirteenth Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Defendant identified only one other instance when he intervened in another Justice's decision to hire staff, explaining that he initiated a reference check for another applicant for the position of senior attorney for Justice Longoria, and then relayed to Longoria that the check had resulted in \"some negative reviews\" of the applicant. As Plaintiff emphasizes, in contrast to this case, no evidence exists \"that Justice Longoria still wished to hire the applicant after learning of the negative references, that [Defendant] gathered the opinions of other justices in an attempt to overrule Justice Longoria's decision, or that [Defendant] forbade Justice Longoria from hiring the applicant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Although the evidence on which Plaintiff relies differs in some respects from the evidence precluding summary judgment in the cited cases-in particular, no inferences may be drawn from any direct conversation between the parties themselves, and as Defendant points out, this case does not involve the same \"open airing of the allegedly protected speech\" in\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   -these factual distinctions are not dispositive ones. In combination with evidence that multiple individuals knew and in some cases, communicated with others, about Plaintiff's protected speech, the circumstantial evidence to which Plaintiff cites at least raises a fact issue on whether Defendant learned of that speech, and then acted on it by interfering with Justice Perkes's decision to hire Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 96 at pp. 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Defendant's Burden: Whether the Adverse Action Would Have Occurred Regardless of Plaintiff's Protected Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   In arguing that he meets his burden at the second step, Defendant focuses on Justice Perkes as the \"hiring authority,\" and claims that Perkes would have withdrawn Plaintiff's offer of employment regardless of Defendant's expressed concerns about Plaintiff (whether they carried a retaliatory motivation or not), once he learned that all of the other Justices disapproved of Plaintiff's hiring. (Dkt. No. 91 at pp. 35-36). However, Perkes in fact testified that he considered the majority vote an effective suspension of the Administrative Rule allowing for Justices to hire their own staff, and that although he was \"steadfast in favor\" of Plaintiff, his decision to hire Plaintiff was \"countermanded\" and his only recourse was to write to the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court or the OCA, \"neither of which really had jurisdiction over the local court.\" In other words, as Plaintiff observes, evidence exists that Perkes did not voluntarily withdraw Plaintiff's job offer, casting doubt on Defendant's claim that Perkes would have made the same decision absent Defendant's intervention. (Dkt. No. 94 at pp. 35-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In any event, as Plaintiff points out, the focus is the decisionmaker whose alleged adverse action constituted the retaliation, and in this case, that decisionmaker is Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 36. Defendant has proffered legitimate reasons for inserting himself into Justice Perkes's decision to hire Plaintiff: concerns that Plaintiff was not a suitable candidate for the position of Perkes's senior staff attorney because he was not a \"team player\" in the editing process, and that he \"only did criminal cases\" and Perkes needed help with his civil docket. Further, evidence exists that other Justices and employees expressed these and other concerns about Plaintiff and his work product to Defendant, and that Defendant acted in response to these concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

The summary judgment record in this case also lacks evidence of any disciplinary action or opposition to Plaintiff's employment with the Court, which spanned more than 20 years, prior to the adverse action. Although Defendant, four other Justices, and two Court employees have now provided evidence that they concurred in the ultimate decision not to hire Plaintiff because of legitimate concerns about his personality and work product, these concerns surfaced as an impediment to Plaintiff's employment only at the time of the adverse action, and the Court cannot ignore the contrary assessments of Plaintiff by Justice Vela for whom he actually worked, by Justice Perkes who wanted to hire him, and by Perkes's junior attorney who had worked with Plaintiff and was amenable to doing so again. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to refute \"each independent ground asserted for not wanting him back at the court\" to raise a fact issue as to pretext, but in fact Justice Vela cast doubt on those reasons, and in particular the reasons given by the relevant decisionmaker-that Plaintiff was not a team player in the editing process, and that he did only criminal cases. (Dkt. No. 96 at p. 25). Further, Justice Perkes testified that the concerns raised to him by Justice Benavides and Defendant did not dissuade him from hiring Plaintiff. Only after Perkes discounted those reasons did Defendant \"take it en banc,\" and even though the record contains evidence that the other Justices voted to disapprove of Plaintiff's hiring on the basis of their own opinions about him and his work, evidence also exists that Defendant instigated the vote, told the other Justices that he \"personally\" had problems with Plaintiff's hiring, and ultimately asked Ramirez and Gsanger to call him about\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   decision on Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Citing to Title VII precedent, Defendant also submits that Plaintiff cannot create an inference of pretext through evidence of \"past practices\" of the Court, because he \"cannot show that any similarly situated applicant or situation...received more favorable treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108115\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 25 (citing\n   <em>\n    Okoye v.

That Plaintiff offered a professional opinion on whether Defendant had committed a crime to his immediate supervisor, Justice Vela, and that he formed his opinion on the basis of information given him by Vela at work, do not (as Defendant submits) alter the analysis; it is the forwarding of that opinion to others on his own accord that constitutes the speech at issue, and as of the date of the adverse action,\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   and Fifth Circuit precedent had dismissed the idea that speech concerning the \"subject matter\" of a plaintiff's employment or \"facts that he happened to learn while at work\" necessarily falls outside First Amendment protection.\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    547 U.S. at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Charles v.

(Dkt. No. 91 at p. 38). However, the majority has already concluded that precedent made reasonably clear, as of 2014, that Plaintiff's complaint to the SCJC was made outside his chain of command, and even conceding to the dissent that the Texas Supreme Court has the ability to review SCJC sanctions, this Court cannot ignore Plaintiff's uncontested argument that the SCJC remains an independent state agency with disciplinary power over Texas judges, not their staff. (Dkt. No. 94 at p. 40);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 33.002 (SCJC is \"an agency of the judicial branch of state government [that] administers judicial discipline\" but \"does not have the power or authority of a [state] court\"); TEX. CONST. art. V, \u00a7 1 (a)(6) (addressing sanctions which may be imposed or recommended by SCJC against \"[a]ny Justice or Judge of the courts established by this Constitution or created by the Legislature\"). The focus is not the chain of command of the subject of Plaintiff's complaint, but of the speaker himself. Therefore, no reasonable judge could have believed that Plaintiff spoke within his own chain of command when he complained of possible judicial misconduct to the SCJC or, for that matter, to the Travis County DA's Office by virtue of any jurisdiction it may have had to investigate crimes involving state judicial officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Moreover, even accepting the dissent's characterization of the judiciary as \"its\n   own self-regulator,\" the Court does not read\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   to allow public entities to self-regulate in a constitutional vacuum. As Plaintiff points out, whether speech is made \"outside the chain of command\" is a basis-but not the only basis-for determining whether that speech falls within the confines of\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   . As\n   <em>\n    Cutler\n   </em>\n   observed,\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   involved \"intra-office speech,\" yet the fact that the prosecutor may have spoken within his chain of command did not determine the Supreme Court's holding; rather,\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   \"concluded that the deputy's speech was not entitled to First Amendment protection because it was made pursuant to his official duties, specifically in fulfillment of his responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case.\"\n   <em>\n    Cutler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203353\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/462/\">\n    767 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   472 (citing\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    547 U.S. at 414, 421-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

No. 94 at pp. 40-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Consistent with this precedent, the Fifth Circuit's decision at the pleading stage did not consider whether Plaintiff spoke outside his chain of command in concluding that Plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded the second element of his First Amendment retaliation claim, nor is any such consideration vital to a determination of whether Defendant is entitled to qualified immunity. Rather, where an employee does not speak in the course of performing his job,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his duty to speak has an \"analogue to speech by citizens who are not [public] employees,\"\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   and pre-2014 precedent make sufficiently clear that an employer lacks the \"automatic\" ability to discipline him for reporting governmental misconduct. As of 2014, it was not reasonable for any state judicial official to believe that by requiring a briefing attorney to take an oath reiterating an ethical obligation that he already had, a state court of appeals through a sitting justice could effectively squelch the very speech that obligation compelled, by retaliating against the attorney for reporting the justice's alleged misuse of public funds. In this Court's view, guiding precedent rendered resolution of the narrow question posed by the second prong of the qualified-immunity inquiry \"beyond debate\" in the present case, and gave anyone in Defendant's shoes the requisite \"fair\" and \"reasonable\" warning that Plaintiff's letters and complaint constituted citizen speech.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176901\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/580/\">\n    845 F.3d at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074340\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/631/#p638\">\n    726 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   638 ;\n   <em>\n    Kinney v.

Although this Court's prior order denying Defendant's motion to dismiss considered and rejected Defendant's appeal to Eleventh Amendment immunity, it did so under a different set of facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 42 at pp. 17-18). As the Court previously observed, it is well-established that a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff meets the\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit by seeking relief \"against individual persons in their official capacities as agents of the state,\" that is \"injunctive in nature and prospective in effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Aguilar v.

Further, the Fifth Circuit has held that \"a request for reinstatement [under \u00a7 1983 ] is sufficient to bring a case within the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity, as it is a claim for prospective relief designed to end a continuing violation of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

At the time that Defendant first asserted the absence of any \"continuing\" First Amendment violation (and the Court rejected that argument), Perkes still served as a Justice for the Thirteenth Court, and Plaintiff's reinstatement to the position of staff attorney would have constituted injunctive relief designed to end the particular violation of federal law asserted here-Defendant's retaliatory interference in Perkes's hiring of Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 42 at pp. 17-18); (Dkt. No. 91, PERKES DEP. at p. 10). It is undisputed that Perkes has since lost his bid for reelection, and that his term ended on December 31, 2016, in which case Defendant now takes the position that any ongoing violation authorizing reinstatement has also ended. (Dkt.

Moreover, to accept Defendant's position would be to adopt a view of the Eleventh Amendment as a shifting jurisdictional bar, triggered not by the nature of the relief requested but by practical considerations affected (as in this case) by litigation tactics and the passage of time. Shifting practical considerations do, of course, come into play in determining whether reinstatement is \"appropriate\" or \"feasible,\" and the Court agrees with Defendant that Justice Perkes's exit from the bench is a factor counseling against this remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt.

No. 91 at p. 39). If the extent of Defendant's involvement in Plaintiff's \"un-hiring\" was his mere participation in discussions and the communication of the fruit of those discussions to Perkes, and if the fruit was not marred by a retaliatory motive on the part of Defendant, then no constitutional violation occurred. However, the record at least calls into question the extent of Defendant's involvement, and whether retaliation on account of Plaintiff's speech played a motivating role in that involvement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"37\">\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    The Fifth Circuit's determination that speech pursuant to an employee's official duties is speech \"in the course of performing his job\" pre-dated the alleged retaliation in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176901\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/580/\">\n     845 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    595 (citing\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896406\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/689/#p692\">\n     480 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    693-94 ;\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554857\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/304/#p313\">\n     518 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    313 ;\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067717\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/494/#p497\">\n     511 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    498 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"38\">\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    Defendant's Motion cites to\n    <em>\n     Prof'l Ass'n of Coll.
