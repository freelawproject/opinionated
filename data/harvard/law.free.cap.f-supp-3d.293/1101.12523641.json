SHUBB, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Suzanne Ryan-Beedy initiated this action against defendants Ditech Financial, LLC (\"Ditech\") and the Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York as Trustee for the Benefit of the Certificate Holders of the CWALT, Inc. (\"the Bank of New York Mellon\") for damages and equitable relief resulting from defendants' alleged acts or omissions concerning the residential mortgage loan modification transactions and subsequent foreclosure of plaintiff's property. Presently before the court are separate Motions to Dismiss by Ditech and the Bank of New York Mellon. (Docket Nos. 18, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2004, plaintiff obtained a $295,000 loan from American Mortgage Network, Inc. in order to refinance her property in Tahoma, CA (\"the subject property\"). (First Amended Compl. (\"FAC\") (Docket No. 16) \u00b6 14.) The subject property is a rental property and is not plaintiff's primary residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) This loan was secured by a Deed of Trust on the property, which was assigned to the Bank of New York Mellon on April 16, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By July 2015, plaintiff was in default in the amount of $137,559.18. A Notice of Trustee's Sale of the Property was recorded on October 27, 2015, and the sale was set for November 25, 2015. Subsequently, on November 25, 2015, plaintiff filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. (FAC \u00b6 16.) Accordingly, the sale did not proceed that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in August 2016, her husband contacted who he thought was the Bank of New York Mellon, but in reality he spoke with a representative from Residential Credit Solutions, plaintiff's mortgage servicer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Unbeknownst to plaintiff, the Bank of New York Mellon had hired Residential Credit Solutions to service the subject loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Residential Credit Solutions representative allegedly told plaintiff's husband that due to accounting errors in the loan, plaintiff owed less than had been represented to her and was in fact \"nearly caught up\" on the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The representative further explained that if plaintiff stopped making her Chapter 13 payments and began making payments on the loan directly, Bank of New York Mellon would correct the accounting errors, modify the loan, and the loan would be brought current. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The agent also allegedly told plaintiff's husband that plaintiff should not begin making payments until she received the modification documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 11, 2016, relying on these representations from the Residential Credit Solutions agent, plaintiff moved to dismiss her Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case. In her dismissal, she explained that her \"financial and legal situation had unexpectedly changed.\" (Bank's Req. for Judicial Notice, Ex. R. (Pl.'s Decl. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Bankruptcy).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's motion was granted and her Bankruptcy Case was dismissed on August 12, 2016. However, she was unable to get anyone from Bank of New York Mellon or Residential Credit Solutions to help her obtain a loan modification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By this point, plaintiff's loan servicer had changed to Ditech, but plaintiff did not have actual knowledge of this. On or about June 13, 2017, Ditech caused a Notice of Trustee's Sale to be recorded, with a sale date noticed for July 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) However, Ditech did not send notices to plaintiff's primary residence in Folsom, California, and instead only sent notices to the subject property in Tahoma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of this, plaintiff did not learn of the noticed sale until on or about June 23, 2017, when a friend informed plaintiff of the notice that had been posted on the door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff subsequently contacted the number on the Notice of Trustee's Sale on June 27, and it was during this conversation that plaintiff first learned that Ditech was, and had been, her loan servicer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The next day, plaintiff contacted Ditech directly, inquiring into how she could prevent the sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) During this conversation, plaintiff was informed that Ditech had been sending all communications to plaintiff's former attorney from a previous litigation that had ended in settlement years earlier, and not to her bankruptcy attorney whose representation post-dated the prior litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 29, 2017, plaintiff spoke with a Ditech representative named \"Kevin\" who informed her that if she submitted a complete modification application prior to the scheduled sale date, the foreclosure would be automatically placed on hold as the application was reviewed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In response, plaintiff faxed and mailed her application documents to Ditech. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.) On July 5, 2017, plaintiff checked the status of her application online and confirmed that all documents had been received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) However, on July 6, Ditech informed plaintiff that she in fact needed to send one more document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Plaintiff immediately complied and faxed that document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A Ditech representative\n   named \"Paul\" then confirmed with plaintiff that her document had been received and the application was now complete. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite this, the scheduled foreclosure sale occurred the next day, on July 7, 2017, and the subject property reverted to Bank of New York Mellon via a credit bid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the foreclosure, plaintiff spoke with a Ditech representative named \"Sean\" and explained to him that she and her husband had spoken to at least seven Ditech agents who had ensured them that if plaintiff submitted a complete modification packet before the sale date, the sale would definitely be postponed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) \"Sean\" explained that those agents had not been telling the truth, that the sale was never going to be postponed, and that Ditech often rejected modification applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Days later, on or about July 17, 2017, after the foreclosure had occurred, plaintiff learned that Ditech had taken over as her loan servicer in or around February 2016, while her Chapter 13 Bankruptcy had still been in effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on December 8, 2017, alleging: (1) Intentional Misrepresentation/False Promise; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Promissory Estoppel; (4) Negligence; (5) Wrongful Foreclosure; (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (7) Violation of Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead \"only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Claims four through ten are alleged against the Bank of New York Mellon and Ditech, the loan servicer. Plaintiff alleges that an agency relationship existed between Ditech and Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as well as between Residential Credit Services, a non-party, and Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The Bank of New York Mellon allegedly authorized both of these financial institutions to represent and bind the Bank in regard to a modification of the loan. Plaintiff therefore argues that because both of these entities were acting as a servicer of the subject loan and agent of the Bank of New York Mellon, the Bank as principal is liable for all of the alleged acts of its agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Claims One and Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's first and second claims are alleged against the Bank of New York Mellon for intentional misrepresentation/false promise and negligent misrepresentation. These two claims are based on\n   plaintiff's allegations that a Residential Credit Solutions employee attempted to induce plaintiff to give up her Chapter 13 bankruptcy protections by convincing her that the Bank of New York Mellon would engage in a loan modification process with her. In reality, plaintiff alleges, the Bank of New York Mellon never had any intention of engaging in this process or of approving a loan modification. These claims are further based on the allegation that this Residential Credit Solutions representative never informed plaintiff that Ditech was her loan servicer. Plaintiff argues that as a result of these statements, she dismissed her bankruptcy case, lost her bankruptcy protections, and thus the subject property was sold at a trustee's sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The elements of a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation/false promise, which is a subspecies of fraud, are (1) a material misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud or induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.\n   <em>\n    White v.

Although plaintiff is unable to name the specific representative, she has pled a specific misrepresentation/false promise (i.e. the \"promise\" to work with plaintiff to modify her loan), the general time period in which the statement occurred, the fact that the statement came from a representative of Residential Credit Solutions, and the fact that the communication took place over the phone. Accordingly, \"the court finds plaintiff[ ] [has] sufficiently pled the time, place, and specific content of\" the alleged misrepresentation \"so as to allow defendant to defend against plaintiff's misrepresentation claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202118527\">\n    2014 WL 2118527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10, citing\n   <em>\n    Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v.

In the complaint, plaintiff alleges that Bank of New York Mellon never had any intention of working with plaintiff on a loan modification.

According to the Bank, the sole cause of plaintiff's foreclosure was non-payment of her loan, and thus plaintiff has not, and allegedly cannot, state a complete causal relationship between the foreclosure and the bank's alleged misrepresentations. (Bank's P. &amp; A. at 10.) However, plaintiff specifically alleges that she \"was ready, willing and able to continue making her Chapter 13 payments\" when she was induced by the Bank to stop making the payments in reliance on\n   their promise. (FAC \u00b6 19.) Further, she alleges that she had a number of other options to save her home from foreclosure, including selling the subject property to her husband or reinstating her bankruptcy protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Accordingly, accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, had it not been for the Bank's promises plaintiff could have saved her home from foreclosure, and thus her failure to do so was caused by the Bank's false promises. Therefore, plaintiff has adequately pled causation and satisfied the resulting damage requirement. Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiff has adequately pled her first and second causes of action and will deny the Bank's Motion to Dismiss as to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Claim Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff's third claim for promissory estoppel requires (1) a clear and unambiguous promise; (2) reliance by the party to whom the promise is made; (3) reasonable and foreseeable reliance; and (4) injury as a result of that reliance.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341595\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/167/1108/#p1114\">\n    167 F.Supp.3d at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Clear and Unambiguous Promise\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"A promise is an indispensable element of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    Aceves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20App.%204th%20218\">\n    192 Cal.

(FAC \u00b6 63.) The bank \"promised to work with [plaintiff] to\n   <em>\n    modify\n   </em>\n   the loan.

These causes of action are based on allegations that plaintiff spoke with various Ditech representatives, after learning that Ditech was in fact her loan servicer, who told her that the foreclosure sale scheduled for July 7, 2017, would be postponed if plaintiff submitted a complete loan modification application. (FAC \u00b6 88.) Although plaintiff submitted a completed modification application before the scheduled sale date, and received confirmation from a Ditech representative named \"Paul,\" Ditech went ahead with the foreclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34-35.) After the foreclosure, \"Sean,\" another Ditech representative, purportedly told plaintiff that the agents she had previously spoken with had not told the truth and he explained that the sale was never going to be postponed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff alleges that she forewent a multitude of other options to prevent foreclosure, including reinstating her bankruptcy, because she had been told a foreclosure would not occur. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 888, 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In response to these allegations, defendants argue that (1) plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to plead falsity or a lack of reasonable grounds to believe the statements to be true and (2) plaintiff cannot allege justifiable reliance based on an oral agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Ditech argues, and plaintiff does not deny, that plaintiff fails to allege that \"Sean knew the other alleged speakers from Ditech or talked with them about their alleged statements to Plaintiff, her Loan, or any potential modification thereof.\" (Ditech P. &amp;. A. at 7 (Docket No. 18).) However, that omission is of no import. Plaintiff does not allege that Sean's statements were false, but rather that his statements, which the court must accept as true for the purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion, provide plaintiff with information and belief that the prior representatives' statements were false, and were either known to be false, made without the requisite intent to perform, or made without a reasonable basis for believing they were true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Further, California courts have concluded that an oral representation that a foreclosure sale would not take place constitutes a material misrepresentation of fact if the sale does in fact occur despite the assurances to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    Lueras v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lueras\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff was told that his upcoming foreclosure sale would be postponed so he could finalize his loan modification, but his home was sold at a foreclosure\n   sale a few days later. In that case, the court determined that this type of misrepresentation is sufficient to form the basis of a claim for both negligent and intentional misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20804\">\n    163 Cal.Rptr.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court finds that here plaintiff has in fact alleged sufficient facts to plead these causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This court is similarly unpersuaded by defendants' second argument-that plaintiff was not permitted to rely on an oral promise that a foreclosure sale would be postponed because this agreement falls within the statute of frauds and therefore needed to be in writing. As explained above, the promise alleged to be false is that if plaintiff submitted a complete modification application before the date of the sale, the foreclosure sale would be postponed. Plaintiff does not allege that the promise itself was the loan modification; the promise instead was merely one to stop a foreclosure, and as such had no impact on the terms of the loan itself. Therefore, it cannot be considered a promise to modify a contract, which would need to be in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants attempt to rely upon\n   <em>\n    Secrest v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Secrest\n   </em>\n   court held that even if the statute of frauds were to otherwise apply, which the court here finds that it does not, full performance by one side takes the agreement out of the statute of frauds \"and the party who performed may enforce it against the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20275\">\n    84 Cal.Rptr.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, even if the statute of frauds applies, plaintiff's full performance would nullify such a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Bank of New York Mellon argues that plaintiff's supposed full performance does not qualify as \"sufficient consideration for an oral modification agreement,\" and thus full performance by plaintiff does not suffice.\n   <em>\n    Mehta v.

Cal. 2010). However, the only case law defendant cites in support of this argument is inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Mehta\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff alleged that defendant's employee orally agreed that the scheduled sale would not go forward.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219702\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/737/1185/#p1197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the employee's \"statement placed no conditions or expectations on Plaintiff,\" and thus could not satisfy the consideration requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219702\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/737/1185/#p1197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, in the present case, in exchange for the promise to postpone the sale, plaintiff had to give up her Chapter 13 bankruptcy protections and submit a completed loan modification application, which she did. Accordingly, the court determines that plaintiff's compliance with these conditions is sufficient to remove the agreement from the statute of frauds, and therefore the court will deny defendants' Motions to Dismiss with regard to claims four and five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Claim Six\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff's sixth claim is again for promissory estoppel, this time based on Ditech's purported promises to postpone the foreclosure sale if plaintiff submitted a complete loan modification application. Both defendants move to dismiss this claim based on one argument-that plaintiff could not have reasonably relied on these promises, and thus has failed to plead promissory estoppel, because the alleged promises were made orally and as such are unenforceable. However, as explained above, Ditech's promise to negotiate did not need to be in writing.

The court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges the foreclosure was wrongful in that it violated rules prohibiting dual tracking-the practice by which a lender processes a loan modification while simultaneously pushing foreclosure. Plaintiff avers that the Bank failed \"to properly review her complete modification application and simply [moved] forward with the foreclosure sale despite assurances that the foreclosure sale would necessarily be postponed upon submission of the complete application.\" (FAC \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the rule prohibiting dual tracking \"applies only to 'owner-occupied residential real property.' \"\n   <em>\n    Badame v.

In that case, the court ruled that California Civil Code \u00a7 2923.6, which prohibits dual tracking, was not directly applicable to the case because the lender's actions predated the provision.

However, in this case plaintiff is not attempting to set aside the sale due to alleged procedural irregularities.
