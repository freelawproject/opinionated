The Commissioner confirmed receipt of the amended ethics complaint in a letter to Tschida dated September 21, 2016. (Doc. 15-9 at 23.) The Commissioner's letter again stressed the confidentiality requirement. (Doc. 15-9 at 23.)

(Doc. 15-4 at 1.) Tschida attached to his amended ethics complaint a cover letter to the House members that accused the Commissioner of purposely delaying a decision. (Doc. 15-4 at 1.) Tschida had filed his amended ethics complaint six weeks before his disclosure. (Doc. 15-4 at 2.) The general election took place November 8, 2016.

The Commissioner cited the following reasons to dismiss Tschida's amended ethics complaint: 1) it failed to state a violation; 2) it lacked sufficient allegations; and/or 3) it was frivolous. (Doc. 15-9 at 1.) The Commissioner also determined that the dismissal decision extinguished the confidentiality requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-2-136\">\n    Mont.

With respect to the Governor and other elected officials, the concept of \"independence\" gains no traction. Montana's partisan election system anticipates and fully expects elected officials to promote the policies and interests of their respective political parties. Montana also need not concern itself with the fear that infirm, incompetent, or even corrupt elected officials would hesitate to resign in the face of an ethics complaint and thereby tacitly admit to the validity of the complaint.

The Lack of Narrow Tailoring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if the Commissioner could establish that the confidentiality provision promotes a compelling state interest as applied to elected officials, the Montana Legislature has failed to tailor narrowly the restrictions on protected speech. The Commissioner contrasts Montana's confidentiality provision with the similar provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Lind.\n   </em>\n   Hawaii's statute required confidentiality throughout the entire review process-permanently if the commission found no probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Lind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532760\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1115/#p1117\">\n    30 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Commissioner argues that Montana's statute mandates confidentiality only \"before a probable cause determination.\" (Doc. 67 at 27.)

The confidentiality provision imposes no temporal limitation on the Commissioner to make any \"decision,\" whether it relates to probable cause or a final decision on the merits. The Commissioner determined in resolving Tschida's amended ethics complaint that the confidentiality provision only lasts through the probable cause determination. (Doc. 15-9 at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Commissioner admitted to having placed a lower priority on reviewing Tschida's amended ethics complaint in favor of resolving campaign finance complaints. (Doc. 65 at 2.) The Commissioner previously had pledged to address campaign finance complaints \"in real time\" before the pending 2016 general election. (Doc. 65 at 2.) The Commissioner did not issue a decision on Tschida's amended ethics complaint until November 21, 2016, some two weeks after the general election. (Doc. 65 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Commissioner contends that the \"pressing workload\" at election time provides a reasonable explanation for any delay in resolving Tschida's complaint until after the election. (Doc. 67 at 32.) The Court offers no view on the reasonableness of the Commissioner's explanation for the delay in resolving Tschida's amended ethics complaint. The Court simply notes that the confidentiality provision contains no mechanism to prevent the Commissioner from suppressing a complainant's political speech regarding the filing of the complaint against an elected official for as long as the Commissioner deems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As applied to Tschida's amended ethics complaint, the statute operated to allow\n   the Commissioner to suppress Tschida's speech regarding his filing of the amended ethics complaint against the Governor at the time that it proved most relevant in violation of the First Amendment. This conclusion does nothing to encourage qualified citizens to run for elected offices. It represents the trade-off we must accept, however, to live in a free society. It further comports with our \"profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be unlimited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on governmental public officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n    376 U.S. at 270-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Commissioner supports this argument by pointing out that unelected state employees comprise the largest group potentially subject to an ethics complaint. (Doc. 67 at 20.) The parties agree that 14,283 public employees work for the State of Montana. (Doc. 68 at 3).

For example, Tschida suggests that the Commissioner could post disclaimers on the Commissioner's website to emphasize that complaints represent merely allegations not endorsed by the State of Montana. Tschida suggests that the Commissioner could inform subject of the ethics complaints of the availability of consulting with legal counsel regarding potential civil torts against complainants who file frivolous or libelous ethics complaints. And finally, Tschida argues that the legislature could enact civil or criminal penalties for knowingly filing a false ethics complaint. (Doc. 71 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Tschida's critiques of the confidentiality provision miss the mark with respect to state employees. The confidentiality provision need not be the least speech-restrictive\n   means to advance the state's important interest in protecting the privacy of state employees. The Montana Legislature has determined that the ideas posited by Tschida would achieve less effectively the important interest in protecting the privacy of state employees than the confidentiality provision, as added by amendment in 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner Broadcasting, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 662,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39619\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/622/#p662\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The First Amendment affords this limited discretion to the Montana Legislature in determining how best to protect the important privacy interests of state employees, including O'Leary, who find themselves the subject of an ethics complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39619\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/622/#p662\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The First Amendment protects Tschida's disclosure of the amended ethics complaint that he filed against the Governor.

Code Ann. \u00a7 2-2-136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) imposes a content-based restriction on political speech that subjects the provision to strict scrutiny as applied to Tschida's complaint against the Governor. The Commissioner has failed to demonstrate that the confidentiality provision serves a compelling governmental interest in protecting the privacy of state elected officials against claims of official misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Further, the legislature failed to tailor the statute narrowly. The statute provides the Commissioner with limited guidance on how to evaluate probable cause. The statute proscribes no length of time in which the Commissioner must make the \"decision\" regarding probable cause. Accordingly, the confidentiality provision violates Tschida's First Amendment right to engage in political speech as applied to his complaint against the Governor.\n   <em>\n    Lind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532760\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1115/#p1117\">\n    30 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1118 ;\n   <em>\n    Stilp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703747\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/405/\">\n    613 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Tschida's claims fail, however, to meet the high standard for a facial challenge as the Commissioner has demonstrated that the confidentiality provision survives a First Amendment challenge under some circumstances. Montana's interest in protecting the privacy of unelected state employees, including O'Leary, exceeds that of elected state officers. Protection of the privacy of non-elected state employees qualifies as an important state interest.\n   <em>\n    NASA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    562 U.S. at 156-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5983674,12439788\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/134/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Billings Gazette II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715780\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/372/409/\">\n    313 P.3d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Montana Legislature tailored the confidentiality requirement to that end by suppressing disclosure by the complainant only of the full complaint as filed. The confidentiality provision allows the complainant to disclose the allegations underlying the complaint and accompanying documents. The Commissioner has further limited application of the confidentiality provision up to the time that the Commissioner makes a probable cause determination.
