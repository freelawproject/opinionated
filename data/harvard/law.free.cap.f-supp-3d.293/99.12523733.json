In the FBI's responsive supplemental declaration, it clarified that the 119 shelves of \"94\" classification files contain records dated 1991 and earlier. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 10. For files after 1991, the files are stored numerically by case number, instead of by file classification, which makes it more difficult to discern which are \"94\" files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Although the FBI discovered a listing of the locations of all \"94\" classification file numbers created during an inventory of all FBI files, the list only contains the location of the file, and not the subject matter of the file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Because each of the approximately 99,700 files on the list would have to be manually pulled, opened, and reviewed to determine if it was responsive to Mr. Shapiro's request, the FBI determined that this approach would be too unwieldy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FBI then adjusted their approach and attempted to locate responsive records by searching within Sentinel for documents in the \"94\" file classification originating from its headquarters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This resulted in 8,326 hits, each requiring its own individual review for responsiveness. Seidel Decl. \u00b6 13. The FBI reviewed the first 100 hits and found that none were responsive to FOIA (the subject of this request) or the mosaic theory (the subject of Mr. Shapiro's other requests).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given the volume of hits, and lack of indication that these files contain the records that Mr. Shapiro seeks, the FBI argues that this search is unreasonably burdensome and not reasonably likely to identify responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I agree with the FBI. Its declarations have explained that for files dated 1991 or before, there are 119 shelves with \"94\" files, and that identification within these\n   files for records relating to FOIA or the Privacy Act requires a line-by-line review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Files dated after 1991 are not organized in a manner such that identification of \"94\" files is readily achievable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Even though a listing of all \"94\" files exists, the list contains nearly 100,000 files and does not provide further detail to help focus the FBI's inquiry on the subject of Mr. Shapiro's request, \"94\" files pertaining to FOIA or the Privacy Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. A search conducted by electronic means that limited the scope of the FBI's request to \"94\" files originating from the FBI's headquarters produced over 8,300 hits, each of which requires manual review.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, not all \"94\" files have been automated; a fully comprehensive review would therefore require the FBI to conduct both the paper-based and electronic review. Second Hardy Decl. \u00b6 25. The FBI's collective five and a half hour paper-based review and electronic review of the first 100 hits did not flush out any indication that further review would likely contain records responsive to Mr. Shapiro's request, and I have no reason to believe the expenditure of further limited FBI resources would be worth the effort. I therefore find that to require the FBI to continue these reviews would be unreasonably burdensome.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. v.
