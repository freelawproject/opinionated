At a status conference held on August 15, 2017, the Court ordered the parties to submit briefs on this issue. (Doc. 44.) Pursuant to that order, the parties have filed extensive memoranda. (Docs. 45, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff JMCB (\"Plaintiff\") argues that the Court should remand this matter. Defendants The Board of Commerce &amp; Industry (the \"Board\") and Louisiana Department of Economic Development (\"LDED\") (collectively, the \"State Defendants\") and former Defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC (\"SPL\") (collectively with the State Defendants, the \"Defendants\") contend that there is jurisdiction in this case and that remand is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court has carefully considered the law, the facts in the record, and the arguments of the parties and is prepared to rule. For the following reasons, the Court finds (1) that there is jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (\"CAFA\"); (2) that the Tax Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"TIA\"), does not bar this action; and (3) that comity, the Eleventh Amendment, and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , do not justify remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Article VII, Section 21(F) of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 provides that the Board, with approval from the governor, \"may enter into contracts for the exemption from ad valorem taxes of a new manufacturing establishment or an addition to an existing manufacturing establishment, on such terms and conditions as the\n   [B]oard, with the approval of the governor, deem in the best interest of the state.\" (Doc. 1-2 at 2 (quoting La. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 21 (F) ).) The constitutional provision specifically defines \"manufacturing establishment\" and \"addition to a manufacturing establishment,\" and LDED regulations govern the administration of the exemption. (Doc. 1-2 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in its Class Action Petition (\"Petition\") that it \"currently owns property (land) in Cameron Parish which is subject to ad valorem taxes for which no exemption is available.\" (Doc. 1-2 at 7.) The Petition further claims that SPL applied for and entered into a contract with the State Defendants for the above tax exemptions. (Doc. 1-2 at 3-5.) According to the Petition, a LDED worksheet recommending approval during the process stated that the contract amount was $6 billion and that the \"ad valorem tax was $1,447,200,000\". (Doc. 1-2 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff now prays for a judgment declaring that the contract between the State Defendants and SPL is, for various specified reasons, \"an improper act of the Board in violation of ... Article VII, Section 21(F), and declaring that the Contract is null and void and without legal effect[.]\" (Doc. 1-2 at 12-13.). Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of itself and as representatives of the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Any and all individuals and businesses that own property in Cameron Parish, State of Louisiana that is subject to ad valorem taxation, and any and all Cameron Parish governmental bodies that are entitled to receive Cameron Parish ad valorem property taxes, as of October 12, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically excluded from the class are Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC, its successors and assigns, and all members of the judiciary, their spouses, and their immediate family members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 1-2 at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CAFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants asserted in their notice of removal that this Court has jurisdiction under CAFA and argue that the requirements for the statute are met. Plaintiff discusses the policy behind CAFA and maintains that it was not intended for this type of case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In short, the Court agrees with Defendants. Pursuant to CAFA, a court has subject matter jurisdiction if \"(1) the number of individuals in the proposed class exceeds 100; (2) minimal diversity of citizenship exists; that is, at least one plaintiff and one defendant are from different states, and (3) the amount in controversy, exclusive of interests and costs, is greater than $5,000,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

First, Plaintiff alleges in the Petition that \"there are several thousand individuals and businesses, and several applicable governmental bodies in Cameron Parish which would qualify as a member of the proposed class.\" (Doc. 1-2 at 11.) Thus, the proposed class exceeds 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, there is minimal diversity. \"For purposes of [CAFA,] ... an unincorporated association shall be deemed to be a citizen of the State where it has its principal place of business and the State under whose laws it is organized.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(10). \"[A] limited liability company is an 'unincorporated association' as that term is used in ... \u00a7 1332(d)(10) [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Ferrell v.

Further, SPL has submitted uncontroverted evidence establishing (1) it is organized under the laws of Delaware; and (2) its headquarters is in Texas, where its officials control SPL's business activities; where its \"highest ranking officials\" are based; and where its management and strategic planning (among other operations) are conducted. (Doc. 46-2). Thus, SPL is clearly a citizen of Delaware and Texas. Meanwhile, JMCB alleges that it is a \"Louisiana domestic limited liability company.\" (Doc. 7 at 7.) Thus, based on either the allegations of the complaint or the unrebutted evidence, there is minimal diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   And third, the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied. \"The defendant, as the removing party, bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the jurisdictional amount has been met.\"\n   <em>\n    Nolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206194621\">\n    2013 WL 6194621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The ad valorem tax at issue is worth approximately $1.4 billion. (Doc. 1-2 at 4.) Thus, Defendants have established each requirement for jurisdiction under CAFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, the Court rejects the Plaintiff's argument that \"there is no indication that class actions involving matters of state tax administration, like the ones raised in this case, were intended to fall within CAFA's ambit.\" (Doc. 45 at 2.) First, as Cameron LNG, LLC, argues in a related case, the plain language of CAFA provides that \"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   civil action\" if the requirements are met. (\n   <em>\n    JMCB, LLC v. Bd. of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commerce &amp; Indus.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-75 (M.D. La.), Doc. 63 at 1-2 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (emphasis added) ).) Second, as to legislative intent, the Senate Report on CAFA unambiguously stated: \"Overall, new section 1332(d) is intended to expand substantially federal court jurisdiction over class actions. Its provisions should be read broadly, with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.\" S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 43. And third, as SPL asserts: \"CAFA contains specific provision outlining the types of cases that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to CAFA, and the tax cases are not on the list.\" (Doc. 55 at 2 n.1 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(9) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1332(d)(5) (primary\n   defendant exception)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) That is, state tax cases are not a specifically enumerated exception to CAFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Indeed, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   exception to CAFA applies. This is significant because, while the removing parties have the burden of proving that the above CAFA requirements have been met,\n   <em>\n    Nolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206194621\">\n    2013 WL 6194621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citation omitted), the party seeking to remand a class action removed under CAFA has the burden of proving that a CAFA exception applies.\n   <em>\n    Frazier v.

Here, Plaintiff's failure to meet its burden is an additional basis for denying its request to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lastly, SPL's dismissal from this suit (which, as noted above, is still the subject of certain pending motions) does not eliminate CAFA jurisdiction. \"It is well-established that the time-of-removal rule prevents post-removal actions from destroying jurisdiction that attached in a federal court under CAFA.\"\n   <em>\n    Cedar Lodge Plantation, L.L.C. v.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Cedar Lodge\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that plaintiff could not \"avoid federal jurisdiction through a post-removal amendment\" of adding a new defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The same reasoning applies here.

The Court now turns to the other alleged bases for remanding the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. TIA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that the TIA does not bar this action based on the plain language of the statute, the law's purpose, and binding Supreme Court precedent. Conversely, Plaintiff says that the Court's decision in this case on the validity of SPL's contract \"would directly affect whether the assessment, levy and collection of\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   taxes on SPL's\n   property, which is subject to the exemption contract, should be restrained or should proceed during the term of the contract.\" (Doc. 52 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 45 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court again agrees with the Defendants. The TIA provides: \"The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is a suit by private citizens to invalidate a contract between the State Defendants and SPL because said agreement was allegedly in violation of the Louisiana constitution. (Doc. 1-2 at 11-13.) Plaintiff is seeking to prevent SPL's entitlement to ad valorem tax exemptions. (Doc. 1-2 at 1-2.) As Cameron LNG, LLC, stated in the related proceeding, \"JMCB seeks to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     enforce\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , not to restrain, the collection of property tax levied by local taxing authorities within Louisiana.\" (\n   <em>\n    JMCB v.

Each circuit's test emphasizes that if the federal declaratory judgment action raises only issues of state law and\n   a state case involving the same state law issues is pending, generally the state court should decide the case and the federal court should exercise its discretion to dismiss the federal suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The second aspect of the inquiry is fairness. The circuits' varying formulations all distinguish between legitimate and improper reasons for forum selection. Although many federal courts use terms such as \"forum selection\" and \"anticipatory filing\" to describe reasons for dismissing a federal declaratory judgment action in favor of related state court litigation, these terms are shorthand for more complex inquiries. The filing of every lawsuit requires forum selection. Federal declaratory judgment suits are routinely filed in anticipation of other litigation. The courts use pejorative terms such as \"forum shopping\" or \"procedural fencing\" to identify a narrower category of federal declaratory judgment lawsuits filed for reasons found improper and abusive, other than selecting a forum or anticipating related litigation. Merely filing a declaratory judgment action in a federal court with jurisdiction to hear it, in anticipation of state court litigation, is not in itself improper anticipatory litigation or otherwise abusive \"forum shopping.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The third aspect of the analysis is efficiency. A federal district court should avoid duplicative or piecemeal litigation where possible. A federal court should be less inclined to hear a case if necessary parties are missing from the federal forum, because that leads to piecemeal litigation and duplication of effort in state and federal courts. Duplicative litigation may also raise federalism or comity concerns because of the potential for inconsistent state and federal court judgments, especially in cases involving state law issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Trejo\n   </em>\n   factors clearly address these three categories of issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Sherwin-Williams Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096806\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/383/#p387\">\n    343 F.3d at 390-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).

Consequently, this factor also does not warrant remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Trejo\n   </em>\n   factor, there is no indication of forum shopping by either party; indeed, as\n   <em>\n    Sherwin\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   stated: \"the fact that 'federal forums are sought by some manufacturers in an attempt to avoid the state court system,' does not necessarily demonstrate impermissible forum selection when the declaratory judgment out-of-state plaintiff invokes diversity.

Each of these factors is either neutral or inapplicable.
