Jan. 4, 2018),\n  <em>\n   appeal docketed\n  </em>\n  (Jan. 25, 2018). Judicial Watch, Inc. submitted a FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for documents related to the FBI's relationship with Mr. Steele. When the FBI failed to timely respond, Judicial Watch filed suit. The FBI ultimately refused to confirm or deny the existence of any such documents, issuing a so-called \"\n  <em>\n   Glomar\n  </em>\n  response.\" Both parties have now moved for summary judgment. Because the FBI's\n  <em>\n   Glomar\n  </em>\n  response was proper and Judicial Watch has failed to carry its burden to show public acknowledgment of the requested documents, the Court will grant the Department's motion and deny Judicial Watch's.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   I. Background\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  As reported extensively by the media, during the 2016 election former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele compiled a 35-page dossier on then-candidate Donald Trump.\n  <em>\n   James Madison Project\n  </em>\n  , --- F.Supp.3d at ----,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20294530\">\n   2018 WL 294530\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , at *1. The dossier allegedly includes \"allegations that the government of Russia possesses compromising personal and financial information about President Trump.\"\n  <em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20294530\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </em>\n  The question of who commissioned and paid for the Trump Dossier has been a subject of much contention in media and political circles.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 28, 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   reported that the FBI had once intended to pay Steele to continue looking into ties between then-candidate Trump and the Russian government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The story concluded that the FBI did not pay Steele and noted that the FBI declined to comment on the report. Eight days later, on March 8, 2017, plaintiff Judicial Watch, Inc. filed a FOIA request with the FBI seeking three categories of documents related to the\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   story:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1.

That same day, on May 16, 2017, the FBI issued a letter that asserted a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to Judicial\n   Watch's request, refusing to confirm or deny the existence of any responsive documents on the basis of six separate FOIA exemptions. Hardy Decl. Ex. C, at 1. The parties subsequently filed briefs for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Congress enacted FOIA \"to promote the 'broad disclosure of Government records' by generally requiring federal agencies to make their records available to the public on request.\"\n   <em>\n    DiBacco v.

But Congress also recognized that legitimate governmental and privacy interests could be harmed by the release of documents and thus carved out nine exemptions from FOIA's reach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FBI has asserted six separate FOIA exemptions that it contends justifies its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judicial Watch does not challenge the applicability of any of these exemptions, except for a brief argument that the Department has failed to \"demonstrate the production of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pl.'s Mem. P. &amp; A. Opp'n Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s MSJ\") at 5. Even if that were so, at least three of the six exemptions asserted-Exemptions 1, 3, and 6-do not require that the release of documents would interfere with ongoing investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), (3), (6). In any event, the Department has provided a detailed affidavit from an FBI employee that sufficiently justifies all of the asserted exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Instead, Judicial Watch mainly argues that the FBI has publicly acknowledged the requested records' existence, thereby defeating its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. Pl.'s MSJ at 3-5. As evidence of public acknowledgment, Judicial Watch points exclusively to an October 21, 2017 tweet from President Trump's personal Twitter account that reads: \"Officials behind the now discredited 'Dossier' plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.\" Pl.'s MSJ at 4. Judicial Watch argues that this tweet acknowledged the existence of records responsive to its FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As noted, a plaintiff must \"pinpoint an agency record that both matches the plaintiff's request and has been publicly and officially acknowledged by the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051488,3769723\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1330/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, this tweet does not publicly and officially acknowledge the existence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   documents related to the first and third parts of Judicial Watch's FOIA request-which sought records of communication between the FBI and Mr. Steele and records produced in preparation for any meetings or conversations between the FBI and Mr. Steele,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. Ex. A. The tweet makes no reference to any meetings or communications between the FBI and Steele. As such, it does not constitute a public acknowledgment of the existence of any documents within the scope of the first and third parts of Judicial Watch's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nor does it constitute an official acknowledgment of any documents within the scope of the second part of Judicial Watch's request, which seeks documents related to \"the proposed, planned, or actual payment of any funds to Mr. Steel and/or Orbis Business Intelligence,\" Hardy Decl. Ex. A, at 1. Given the\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   story that inspired Judicial Watch's FOIA request, the FBI has consistently and reasonably interpreted that request as seeking documents related to payments\n   <em>\n    by the FBI\n   </em>\n   to Mr. Steel or his company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 41; Def.'s Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 7-8; Def.'s Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Cross-Mot. Summ. J. at 4-5. Judicial Watch has never contested this characterization of its FOIA request before the FBI or in this Court. While the President's tweet could arguably suggest that the FBI has some records concerning who paid for the Trump Dossier, it does not acknowledge that there are records that\n   <em>\n    the FBI\n   </em>\n   paid for it. Because Judicial Watch must point to a public acknowledgment of the specific records it seeks,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051488,3769723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1330/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this tweet is insufficient to constitute public acknowledgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since there has been no public acknowledgment of the existence of any specific records responsive to Judicial Watch's request (as reasonably construed by the FBI), the FBI's assertion of a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was appropriate in this case. The Court will therefore grant the Department's motion for summary judgment and deny Judicial Watch's cross motion.
