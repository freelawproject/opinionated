After considering the oral arguments of counsel, upon review of the entirety of the record and for the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   its previously issued tentative rulings,\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   Special Master John H.

The Court\n   <strong>\n    AWARDS\n   </strong>\n   the Brenneises\n   <strong>\n    $934,364.10\n   </strong>\n   in attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The original focus of this lengthy litigation was whether Defendant San Diego\n   Unified School District (\"the District\") complied with the IDEA by providing Plaintiff T.B. a free appropriate public education (\"FAPE\") for the 2006-2007 school year. The parties first litigated the dispute over the course of 27 days during the summer of 2007 in a due process hearing before the State of California's Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\"), Special Education Division. On October 3, 2007, Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ) Susan Ruff issued a 75-page written decision (\"OAH Decision\"), concluding that the District had failed to provide T.B. with a FAPE for the 2006-2007 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By the time the ALJ issued her decision, a new school year (2007-2008) had begun. The parties continued to discuss modifications to an Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\") that would comply with the OAH Decision, govern the new school year, and permit T.B. to attend school. Ultimately, they failed to reach mutually agreeable terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2008, both parties appealed the OAH Decision to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2)(A) (\"any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection, shall have the right to bring a civil action...in a district court of the United States, without regard to the amount in controversy.\"). The Brenneises sought judicial review of those aspects of the OAH Decision upon which the District prevailed, as well as statutory attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1. The District separately sought review of the aspects of the OAH Decision that went in the Brenneises' favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1, Case No. 08cv39. The Court consolidated the two appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2010, the Court issued an order finding that the ALJ correctly determined that the District denied T.B. a FAPE for the 2006-2007 school year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 118. Thereafter, the Brenneises moved for an award of approximately $1.4 million in attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 159. In March 2012, the Court issued a ruling granting in part, and denying in substantial part, the request for fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 237, 238. The Court determined that the Brenneises are a prevailing party under the IDEA, and entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 238 at 13. However, the Court applied a statutory bar on fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D), and awarded the Brenneises a total of only $55,433.91 in attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, the Court found that the Brenneises were not entitled to any fees or costs incurred after May 4, 2007, when they rejected a final pre-hearing settlement offer from the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 31, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the Court's award of attorneys' fees and costs, and remanded the matter for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    T.B. v.

The Ninth Circuit concluded,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the District's settlement offer was not more favorable from the perspective of the Brenneises, such that this Court should not have enforced the statutory bar on post-settlement offer fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358891\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358891\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/451/\">\n    at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

No. 86, App. Case No. 12-56060. Thereafter, the parties filed a joint motion requesting that the Ninth Circuit refer the case to mediation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. Doc. No. 90. The circuit court granted the motion, and the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 276. The Ninth Circuit subsequently issued an order granting the Brenneises' motion for attorneys' fees, in part, concluding that the Brenneises are entitled to a fee award, but directing this Court to calculate the amount of the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 17, 2016, the District filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. Doc. No. 99. On April 18, 2016, the Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. Doc. No. 106. On May 16, 2016, the Court spread the Ninth Circuit's mandate and resumed jurisdiction over the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 285, 286.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In November 2016, the assigned magistrate judge held a mandatory settlement conference on the issue of attorneys' fees and costs, but the parties did not reach a settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 330. On January 18, 2017, the Brenneises filed a supplemental motion for attorneys' fees and costs, which the District opposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 340, 344.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 17, 2017, the Court provided notice to the parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(b)(1) of the forthcoming appointment of a Special Master in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

The Court's Order provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 54(d)(2)(D), the Court may appoint a Special Master to assist the Court in determining an award of attorneys' fees. Upon due consideration, the Court finds that the determination of reasonable hourly rates for the Brenneises' counsel and their staff, the reasonable hours expended at each stage of this litigation, the lodestar calculation, and the resulting fee award, will be unusually complex and place an exceptional burden on the Court.

As an initial matter, the Brenneises argue that the Central District of California, where counsel maintain their offices, is the appropriate relevant community when determining the reasonable billing rate for all phases of this case. The Court previously determined that \"San Diego is the relevant legal community,\" and noted that\n   \"[t]his community charges rates lower than attorneys who practice in our neighbor to the North.\" Doc. No. 238 at 24. The Court instructed the Special Master not to revisit this aspect of its 2012 ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 360 at 3. Accordingly, he did not. As such, this is technically not an objection to the Report, as the Special Master was prohibited by the Court from considering the issue. In any event, after taking into consideration the oral arguments of counsel, the Court declines to reconsider its previous determination. San Diego is the relevant community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Furthermore, the Court notes that a review of recent case law regarding the award of attorneys' fees in IDEA actions in the Central District demonstrates that counsel's requested rates are much higher than the rates found to be reasonable by courts in that jurisdiction. Rather, the rates are not dissimilar from those charged in this District, and are comparable with the Special Master's recommended rate of $450 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Essentially, the Brenneises argue that as this case moved from the administrative level, to district court, and on to the Ninth Circuit, that the proceedings became more complex. The Court disagrees. The Special Master correctly notes in his Report that the facts and general landscape of the case once it moved to this Court remained the same, and the issues on appeal narrowed considerably.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Brenneises further object to the Special Master's recommendation that the Court not use current billing rates to compensate for the delay in payment of the fee award. Counsel for the Brenneises argued during the February 9 hearing that the District used a \"scorched earth\" tactic in this case, contributing substantially to the protraction of the litigation, resulting in the delay in payment, and justifying the use of current billing rates in calculating the lodestar.

However, as the circuit court notes in its opinion, the \"district court has\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to compensate delay in payment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514652\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In determining whether to exercise this discretion, the Court agrees with the Special Master that the use of current billing rates is not appropriate. The Brenneises' complaint regarding the litigation tactics of the District does not ring hollow,\n   but the Court stands by its observation, originally made in 2012, that \"\n   <em>\n    [b]oth\n   </em>\n   sides are responsible for creating and fostering the animosity that impaired an efficient resolution to the case.\" Doc.

Furthermore, as noted above, recent case law on attorneys' fee awards in IDEA cases in the Southern California region generally demonstrate that the Special Master's recommended hourly rate of $450 is consistent with rates found reasonable by other courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203334015\">\n    2017 WL 3334015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20123671\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

The District contends that the Court should continue to use the previously determined rate of $425 per hour for that phase of the proceedings. However, the District does not object to the reasonableness of the $450 per hour rate for the remainder of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The District's argument that the Court should not deviate from the $425 per hour rate it found reasonable in its 2012 Order is unavailing. \"Lower courts are free to decide issues on remand so long as they were not...decided explicitly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Here, the Ninth Circuit was silent as to the reasonableness of the hourly rates as determined by the Court in its 2012 Order. Upon due consideration, the Court explicitly gave the Special Master authority to revisit the rates when calculating the lodestar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 360 at 3. In doing so, the Special Master has recommended a reasonable rate based in large part on the District's own evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

The Court appointed the Special Master to make findings and recommendations as to this exceedingly difficult task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 360 at 3. The Special Master has undertaken a meticulous review of the Brenneises' counsel's billing records, as well as the District's general objections and individual objections to specific billing entries,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to formulate his recommendations concerning the compensable time expended by the Brenneises' counsel and their staff at each stage of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   With respect to the Special Master's recommendations, the Brenneises primarily object to the disallowance of counsel's time spent traveling between Torrance, California, the location of their offices, and San Diego. The District's objections are far more comprehensive. The District raises multiple objections to the Special Master's calculations, including the Special Master's recommended rulings on objections to individual billing entries, and requests that the Court make additional deductions to the compensable time calculation for the following reasons: duplicative work, overstaffing, and lack of contemporaneous billing records for time keeping during the due process hearing and at the district court level; additional billing issues at the district court level; non-recoverable time, before, during, and after the due process hearing; time spent in this Court on the merits of the Brenneises' claims after November 18, 2009, the date the Brenneises filed their response in opposition to the District's motion for partial summary judgment as to its IDEA claim; and excessive time spent on the Ninth Circuit appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Compensable Hours: OAH Due Process Hearing (2006-2007)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Special Master recommends the Court find that the Brenneises' counsel and their staff reasonably expended 2533.3 hours of compensable time for their work during the administrative stage of these proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 57. This includes compensation for the majority of the time requested. A significant portion of the Special Master's deductions are attributable to his recommendation that the Brenneises' counsel and their staff not be compensated for time spent traveling between Torrance and San Diego.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53. The Special Master notes that the Brenneises failed to provide any evidence that it is customary in the San Diego legal community to charge for travel time. He also points out that billing for travel time is generally allowed in cases where the prevailing party shows that it would not have been able to hire competent local counsel to handle the work, an argument which he recommends the Court reject in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With respect to the administrative proceedings, the Court specifically instructed the Special Master to consider whether any particular billing entries should be reduced or deducted pursuant to Section 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii) of the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 360 at 4. Pursuant to this section of the IDEA, \"[a]ttorneys' fees may not be awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action, or, at the discretion of the State, for a mediation described in subsection (e).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(ii). The Special Master reviewed counsel's billing records, as well as the objections raised by the District, and determined whether time should be deducted on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 43. The District objects to the Special Master's recommended deductions, arguing that many more time entries involved work done in relation to IEP implementation, particularly after the due process hearing had concluded. However, as he explains in his Report, the Special Master deducted time in accordance with the accuracy of the information available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Compensable Hours: District Court Litigation (2008-2012)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Special Master has subdivided the Brenneises' fee request for work in this Court performed through 2012 into several parts including: (a) fees incurred in defense of the IDEA claim in the District's complaint (upon which the Brenneises prevailed, rendering them entitled to a fee award in this action); (b) fees incurred in the prosecution of the claims in the Brenneises' complaint for work that was common to the work done on defense of the District's IDEA claim; (c) fees incurred in the prosecution of the third cause of action in Plaintiffs' second amended complaint relating to the CDE compliance complaint (including the unsuccessful 2008 interlocutory appeal by the District); and (d) fees incurred filing a motion for reconsideration of the Court's 2012 award of attorneys' fees and costs. As noted above, in calculating the reasonable hours expended by the Brenneises' counsel and their staff during this stage of the proceedings, the Special Master considered the District's myriad objections to counsel's billing records. The\n   most substantial objections are discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   a)\n   <em>\n    Apportionment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Brenneises seek fees for time expended successfully defending against the District's IDEA claim and succeeding on their fees-on-fees claim regarding the CDE compliance complaint. The Brenneises acknowledge that fees should not be awarded for all aspects of the pre-appeal litigation in this Court. To this end, the Brenneises segregate out the time expended on their unsuccessful IDEA claim, and their civil rights claims. However, the District objects to the Brenneises' apportionment of time between successful and unsuccessful claims. The District contends that these time entries should be reduced across the board by fifty percent to account for the fact that only some of the time could be attributed to the defense against the District's first cause of action. Likewise, the District objects to individual billing entries for work performed in relation to all claims, i.e., attendance at the Early Neutral Evaluation conference, settlement activities, and communications with the client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 180-1 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Special Master concludes that the fifty percent reduction proposed by the District does not have a reasoned basis, and citing\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , recommends that the District's \"apportionment\" objection be overruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The issue is whether the first claim in the District's complaint is \"related\" to the other claims in the District's complaint and the claims in Plaintiffs' second amended complaint as that term is used in\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   . All the claims in the District's complaint and Plaintiffs' second amended complaint relate to the same basic set of facts: the assessments and IEP meetings relating to T.B.'s 2006-2007 school year and the conduct of and results from the related OAH hearing. Activities such as the ENE and other similar events are common to the case as a whole and Plaintiffs are entitled to fees spent on these activities without a deduction of 50% or any other percentage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   I reviewed all the time entries on the District's Exhibit A, and find that they all apply equally to Plaintiffs defense of the IDEA claim in the District's first cause of action and to other related claims in the case.

No. 180-1 at 11-12. The Special Master considered each of these grounds for the District's objections, and\n   recommends that the Court sustain the objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 61-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   c)\n   <em>\n    Protraction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The District objects to a number of billing entries on the ground the work performed led to the unreasonable protraction of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 180-1 at 46-57. The District contends that the Brenneises engaged in a number of unnecessary delaying tactics to prevent the District from filing a motion for summary judgment on its appeal of the OAH decision. The Brenneises respond that the District bears the responsibility for unreasonably protracting this litigation. The Special Master considered both parties' arguments regarding the issue of protraction, and recommends that all the objections on the ground of \"protraction\" be overruled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

No. 65 at 6. On May 20, 2011, the District served a Rule 68 offer of judgment limited to the third cause of action in the second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 151-1. The terms of that offer provided for a judgment in the amount of $7,113.50 for fees incurred in connection with a CDE compliance complaint, \"plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by plaintiffs on the Third Claim for Relief (and prior versions thereof in earlier pleadings in this case) prior to the date of this offer in an amount to be set by the Court.\" Doc.

The Special Master recommends that the Brenneises receive a limited award for those non-taxable costs which are allowable and sufficiently documented. The Court briefly summarizes his recommendations below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Special Master recommends that the following charges incurred during the due process hearing be reimbursed to the Brenneises: 1) the use of an attorney service in the amount of $150.00 for delivering or serving a legal document relating to the OAH hearing; and 2) Lexis-Nexis costs in the amount of $288.29 for research.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

This results in an award of $438.29 for non-taxable costs incurred during the administrative stage of these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Special Master also recommends that nearly all of the non-taxable costs incurred by the Brenneises in defense of the District's IDEA claim be denied, largely due to the failure to properly document the expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 75.

However, like the attorneys' fees award for that stage of the litigation, the Special Master recommends that this amount be reduced by fifty percent, resulting in a total of $29.90.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Brenneises object to the Special Master's recommended reduction of their requested award of non-taxable costs.

According to the Brenneises, their counsel expended a total of 242.6 hours performing work related to this action during this time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

No. 382 at 2. In the Court's view, while the Brenneises \"are entitled to fees incurred during the adjudication of the due process complaint and for fees incurred in obtaining the reimbursement of those fees..., receiving 'fees on fees on fees' is too attenuated from the adjudication of the due process complaint to be reimbursable.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

However, the Court has re-examined counsel's billing records, and finds that consistent with the Special Master's recommendation that an award of \"fees on fees\" be allowed in this action, the Brenneises' are entitled to a limited award of \"fees on fees\" for work performed between January 19, 2017 and March 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Brenneises' counsel billed 83.9 hours for work performed in relation to the supplemental briefing on their motion for an award of attorneys' fees under the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 376-1 at 6-12. The District objects to the majority of billing entries during this three-month time period as \"excessive, unnecessary, unreasonable protraction of the litigation.\" Doc. No. 378-1 at 9-16. The Court has reviewed each of the billing entries to which the District objects, and agrees that a reduction is appropriate based on the excessive amount of time preparing a reply brief in support of the Brenneises' supplemental motion for attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(F)(iii). The Brenneises have proposed to deduct 22.5 hours from the total amount of time spent by counsel working on the briefing for the supplemental fee motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 376 at 4. The\n   Court finds that this proposed deduction is sufficient to address the excessive amount of time spent by counsel on the preparation of the reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Accordingly, the Brenneises request reimbursement for 61.4 hours expended by counsel between January 19, 2017 and March 19, 2017. The Court finds this amount of hours reasonable. At the rate of $450 per hour, which the Court finds reasonable for the reasons set forth in the Special Master's Report, the calculation of the lodestar results in a total award of fees incurred between January 19, 2017 and March 19, 2017 in the amount of $27,630.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

Finally, the Court must determine whether the total award of attorneys' fees and costs should be reduced based on the Brenneises' limited or partial degree of success at each stage of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Statutory Reduction: IDEA Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The IDEA provides several grounds for reducing a plaintiff's fee award:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   (F) Reduction in amount of attorneys' fees.

No. 190 at 6. In addition, post-remand, the Brenneises have raised a new argument. According to the Brenneises, the District unreasonably protracted this litigation by knowingly misrepresenting to this Court and the Ninth Circuit that its May 3, 2007 settlement offer was timely and qualified as a statutory offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

The Brenneises assert that the District purposefully misrepresented throughout\n   this litigation that the District's last settlement offer was made more than ten days before the OAH due process hearing began on May 14, 2007. Instead, the Brenneises argue that although the offer letter is dated May 3, 2007, the fax cover sheet indicates that the offer was not \"made,\" i.e. sent via facsimile to the Brenneises' counsel, until May 4, 2007, one day late. This one-day discrepancy is essential, the Brenneises assert, because \"the District's misrepresentation of the timeliness of the May offer resulted in this Court reaching a conclusion that it would not have otherwise reached.\" Doc. No. 340 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Brenneises' argument is without merit. There is no indication in the record that the District purposefully concealed the timing of their final settlement offer at any stage in this litigation. In May 2007, the District could not have hidden the fact that it faxed the settlement offer to counsel on May 4, 2007 - the fax cover letter is dated as such.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Instead, counsel countered the offer later that day, which the District ultimately rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 180-3 at 8. As for the current litigation, the cover letter with the May 4, 2007 fax header has been a part of the record in this case since September 2011.

As such, it may reduce the Brenneises' award of attorneys' fees and costs if it finds that the Brenneises unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(F)(i). The District urges the Court to make this finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 180 at 17. In a nutshell, the District argues that the Brenneises have unreasonably protracted this litigation at every stage, beginning with their refusal to attend the August 30, 2006 IEP team meeting, and as such, the Court should drastically reduce the fee award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Special Master considered the issue of unreasonable protraction of the litigation as a whole, and recommends that the Court decline to find that either party unreasonably protracted the litigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   I considered the evidence offered by both sides on the issue of prolonging the proceedings and recommend that the Court find that both sides litigated this case very aggressively, but not to the point where they unnecessarily prolonged\n   the proceedings.

In fact, in paragraph 18 of her decision (on page 7) the ALJ commented as to Mr. Wyner, \"[Student's mother] ...was represented during the 2006-2007 school year by one of the most respected special education attorneys in the field.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   There were no awards of sanctions at any level of this proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   The lawyers may not have always gotten along with each other, but based on the evidence presented, I recommend the Court find that neither side engaged in improper conduct that prolonged the proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Doc.

Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   the Special Master's recommendation and declines to find that either the Brenneises or the District unreasonably protracted this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

The District urges the Court to reduce the Brenneises' fee award on this basis; however, the Special Master has recommended a reasonable hourly rate in line with other attorneys in San Diego of comparable skill. The Court adopts the recommended rate of $450 per hour. Therefore, a reduction of the fee award under this section of the statute is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

As noted above, the Special Master has recommended that the Court reduce the Brenneises' fee award for work performed by their counsel in relation to the single-day, failed Ninth Circuit mediation, by fifty percent under this provision of the IDEA. The Special Master also recommended a reduction for excessive time spent working on the 2017 fee application. In addition, the Court relied on this factor as a justification for reducing the compensable hours spent by the Brenneises' counsel on certain work done between January 19, 2017 and March 19, 2017. The Court declines to make any further reductions under this provision of the IDEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Equitable Reduction: Degree of Success\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The Court must also determine whether to reduce the Brenneises' award of attorneys' fees and costs based on the Brenneises' relative degree of success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <em>\n    i.

However, taking into consideration the scope of the due process hearing and the terms of the amended IEP as ordered by the ALJ subsequent to the due process hearing, the Court finds that the Brenneises' success, although significant, does not \"justify the fee amount requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1625060\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/802/1131/#p1141\">\n    802 F.2d at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Only nine of the issues involved matters upon which the Brenneises completely failed to succeed-assessment-related matters and issues surrounding the August 2006 IEP. The other nine issues related to the December 2006 IEP, and the transition plan for moving T.B. out of garage school and into public school. As noted above, the ALJ ultimately determined that the December 2006 IEP was adequate in most respects, but not all. Approximately 20% of the ALJ's factual findings and legal conclusions related specifically to the issues upon which the Brenneises prevailed; in the end, the Brenneises lost six out of the nine issues they raised related to the December 2006 IEP. Yet an 84%, 80%, or even 66% reduction in fees is too harsh in light of the results obtained-acknowledgment that T.B. could not attend school based on the District's proposed IEP without\n   placing his health and safety at risk, and amendments to the IEP resolving the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The District urges the Court to focus on the \"big picture\"-this litigation involved a single school year and a one hundred-page IEP that the ALJ amended in only three respects. The Brenneises exhort the Court to consider the \"bottom line\"-the District denied T.B. a FAPE for the 2006-2007 school year by failing to provide the health services necessary for him to attend public school. At the time, T.B. was a 12 year-old boy who was \"very unhappy about having to remain in the 'garage school,' particularly as he was entering adolescence. He longed to socialize with his peers and have a more normal life.\" Doc. No. 159-3 \u00b6 11. He lost that opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   With all these considerations in mind, the Court finds that a fifty percent reduction in the award of fees and costs\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   for work performed by the Brenneises' counsel and their staff during the due process proceedings strikes a more appropriate balance than \"apportion[ing] the fee award mechanically on the basis of [the Brenneises'] success or failure on particular issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    461 U.S. at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The resulting award will sufficiently compensate counsel for the time and effort spent attempting to secure an IEP that would have allowed T.B. to attend school with his peers, while not rewarding the Brenneises for litigating numerous, unsuccessful claims at the due process hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   b)\n   <em>\n    District Court Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   As set forth above, the fee award for litigation in this Court prior to the Ninth Circuit appeal does not include time expended by the Brenneises' counsel and their staff solely on the Brenneises' unsuccessful IDEA claim and their civil rights claims. With respect to the remaining claims, the Special Master overruled the District's objection to fees for work that was common to all claims on the grounds that the successful and unsuccessful claims were related.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 366 at 64. After making appropriate deductions, the Special Master's recommended award of fees and costs represents a forty percent reduction to the amount of fees and costs requested by the Brenneises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The Court adopts the Special Master's finding that the claims litigated in this Court are related, and therefore must proceed to step two of the\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   analysis and consider \"whether [the Brenneises'] significant accomplishments in this case justify the fee amount requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1625060\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/802/1131/#p1141\">\n    802 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1142 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    461 U.S. at 434-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   , 106 S.Ct. at 2691-92 ). The Brenneises ultimately prevailed defending against the District's IDEA claim, which confirmed the ALJ's finding after the due process hearing that the District had denied T.B. a FAPE for the 2006-2007 school year. As a prevailing party, the Brenneises succeeded on their claim for an award of attorneys' fees and costs under the IDEA. The Court finds that no further reduction of the fee award for work performed during this stage of the litigation is appropriate. The Special Master's recommended award fairly reflects the success achieved over the course of four years of contentious, hard-fought litigation in this Court, while not rewarding the Brenneises for time spent pursuing their unsuccessful claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   c)\n   <em>\n    Ninth Circuit Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Likewise, the Brenneises did not seek an award of fees for work performed by their counsel on appeal related to their\n   unsuccessful civil rights claims. The Special Master found that no reduction in the lodestar was appropriate for work done common to successful and unsuccessful claims, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   [T]he parties asserted a variety of claims, but they all arose out of a common set of facts. Moreover, much of the work on the appeal, from preparing the notice of appeal, to participation in the mediation, preparation of the appeal briefs, and participating in a moot court to prepare for oral argument for the successful claim for fees under the IDEA, is intertwined with the same tasks performed for the claims for the civil rights claims for which no fees are sought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Doc. No. 366 at 99. The Court agrees, and finds no further reduction is appropriate under the second step of the\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   analysis. The Brenneises succeeded entirely on their appeal of this Court's award of attorneys' fees and costs, as well as their claim for \"fees on fees\" in relation to the CDE compliance complaint.
