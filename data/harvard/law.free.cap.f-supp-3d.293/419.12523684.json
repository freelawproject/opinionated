In 2006, Saleh's\n   husband, Sultan Naji Alshaif, a U.S. Citizen, submitted a Form I-130 petition to the State Department, seeking a visa on behalf of Saleh.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Saleh's husband's death, the I-130 petition was approved and transferred to the National Visa Center, where it was assigned the case number SAA2006762013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2015, Saleh-having fled the civil war in Yemen for Djibouti-was interviewed by U.S. officials at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. At that interview, Saleh received a notice from an Embassy official stating that her \"immigrant visa [was] approved,\" and that the Embassy would \"now prepare your visa and immigration packet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Saleh did not, however, receive a visa and immigration packet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Rather, Saleh's visa application was listed as being in \"administrative processing\" on the website of the Consular Electronic Application Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As of late December 2016, Saleh had still not received her visa.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 28, 2016, Saleh and the Alshaifs filed the initial petition for a writ of mandamus in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 (\"Pet.\").

On May 10, 2017, the Court issued an order directing the Government to file a formal motion to dismiss and setting a briefing schedule for that motion. Dkt. 21. On May 22, 2017, the parties filed a joint stipulation, providing that the Government would forgo filing a motion to dismiss and that petitioners instead would file an amended petition. Dkt. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 5, 2017, petitioners filed their First Amended Petition. Dkt. 23. It abandoned the challenges to the Government's failure to issue a passport to Zakaria Alshaif, challenging only the refusal of Saleh's immigrant visa application. On July 10, 2017, the Government filed a motion to dismiss, Dkt. 26, as well as a memorandum of law, Dkt. 27 (\"Gov't Br.\") and declarations in support, Dkts. 28-29. The Government seeks dismissal of the Amended Petition for lack of jurisdiction, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim, under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Br. at 9-10. On July 28, 2017, petitioners filed a brief in opposition, Dkt. 31, and on August 4, 2017, the Government submitted its reply, Dkt. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 23, 2018, this Court commissioned supplemental briefing as to two questions related to the doctrine of consular non-reviewability. Dkt. 33. After seeking and receiving extensions, on February 7, 2018 the Government submitted its brief, Dkt. 36 (\"Gov't Supp. Br.\"), and on February 16, 2018, the petitioners submitted theirs, Dkt. 40 (\"Pet.

They note (1) the lack of evidence tending to show that Saleh, a lifelong housewife, has a connection to terrorism, which, they contend, is itself \"a sufficient demonstration of bad faith,\" Pet. Br. at 4; and (2) what they argue is evidence that the consular decision denying Saleh's visa was \"in retaliation\" for the filing of the initial petition in this case,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2140\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the governing case law, however, neither of these considerations, viewed separately or together, is sufficient to show the consular officer's bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, the lack of record evidence of the applicant's connection to terrorism cannot, by itself, support a claim of a bad faith. This Court must \"take literally the statement in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   that courts may not 'look behind' exclusion decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Because a court may not look behind an exclusion decision to examine the evidence supporting it, it follows that the\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   to that principle cannot be based on the lack of known supporting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Petitioners' second argument, however, presents a more difficult question, as to which the Court has benefited from the parties' thoughtful supplementary submissions. A viable claim of retaliatory decision-making might well justify \"look[ing] behind\" an exclusion decision,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2140\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy,\n   <em>\n    J.,\n   </em>\n   concurring in the judgment). The Government concedes that a decision made \"\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   in retaliation for the filing of [Saleh's] mandamus petition\" would provide a basis to look behind the consular officer's decision. Gov't Supp. Br. at 2. Accordingly, the Court assumes that well-pled allegations that a consular official's decision was made in retaliation for the filing of a mandamus petition would provide a sufficient basis to look behind that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Petitioners' claim of retaliation, however, is not pled with requisite specificity or plausibility to state a claim of bad faith. Petitioners' sole basis to claim retaliation is this: \"Defendants' refusal of Plaintiff Ameera Abdu Saleh's visa application was a retaliatory act in response to her filing the instant case against them.\" Am. Pet. \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet. Br. at 4.

The Court directed the parties to\n   address, in particular: (1) whether the consular decision denying Saleh's visa application occurred sufficiently close in time to the filing of her initial petition to support a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation; (2) whether the fact that the consular decision was issued the day before the Government's deadline to respond to the initial petition in this case could support the inference that that decision had been motivated by Saleh's lawsuit, as opposed to the reason stated in the Refusal Worksheet,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Pet. \u00b6 27; Dkts. 16-17; (3) whether the fact that the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti had earlier indicated approval of Saleh's immigrant visa in November 2015, Am. Pet. \u00b6 20, before denying it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, would support the inference that the denial was motivated by this lawsuit; and (4) whether Saleh's claimed non-association with terror organizations might support the inference that the consular denial of her visa application was based on a different, and illegitimate reason, Am. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although the matter is not entirely free from doubt, the Court is now persuaded that these factual allegations do not plausibly support the inference that the consular official acted in retaliation for Saleh's filing of a mandamus petition. At the outset, the Court notes that the familiar burden-shifting framework used in the Title VII context to analyze claims of retaliation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973), is inapplicable here. In Title VII cases, a plaintiff must make out only a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, in which case the \"burden of production shifts to the employer to demonstrate that a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason existed for its action.\"\n   <em>\n    Raniola v. Bratton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124431\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/610/#p625\">\n    243 F.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (2d Cir. 2001). Such a plaintiff makes such a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case by showing that \"(1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) her employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took adverse employment action against her; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged adverse action and the protected activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Summa v. Hofstra Univ.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p125\">\n    708 F.3d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 (2d Cir. 2013). That burden-shifting framework eases a plaintiff's pleading burden, by allowing the plaintiff to rely on inferences of an impermissible motivation that arise from factors such as the proximity of an employee's protected activity and an employer's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    McDonnell-Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework, however, ill fits the context here, given the Supreme Court's command that a petitioner challenging a consular decision must make an \"affirmative showing of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Din,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/#p2140\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy,\n   <em>\n    J.,\n   </em>\n   concurring in the judgment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also inconsistent with the limited review available to those aggrieved by consular officials' decisions. Unlike decisions reviewable under Title VII, the decisions of consular officials need only be \"\n   <em>\n    facially\n   </em>\n   legitimate and bona fide.\"\n   <em>\n    Mandel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p767\">\n    408 U.S. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p767\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shifting the burden of production to the Government once a petitioner has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of retaliation is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Mandel.\n   </em>\n   It would compel the Government to adduce evidence that its decision had a valid basis, whereas, under the case law, the Government has already done so simply by noting the valid statutory basis which the consular official cited in denying Saleh's visa. The Court therefore considers simply whether petitioners' allegations plausibly plead retaliatory action, without regard to whether those allegations make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court considers, first, the factor of temporal proximity. As the Government persuasively argues, in the context here, no inference of retaliation plausibly arises from the fact that the consular decision denying Saleh's visa application came some four months after the filing of her initial petition. The initial mandamus petition, after all, demanded action-that the State Department act on Saleh's pending visa application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 51-55. That the Department thereupon acted does not signal retaliation. By the same measure, the proximity of the consular official's denial (April 26, 2017) and the deadline (April 27, 2017) which the Court had set for the Government's answer does not bespeak retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court next considers the allegation that Saleh's visa application, while never finally approved, had allegedly been earmarked for approval prior to the filing of a mandamus petition. That allegation, too, in context, does not support an inference of retaliation. By way of background, a visa application follows a several-step path.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of State,\n   <em>\n    The Immigrant Visa Process,\n   </em>\n   https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/the-immigrant-visa-process.html.

And a visa that is in \"administrative processing\" cannot be said to have received final approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nine Iraqi Allies Under Serious Threat Because of Their Faithful Serv. to the United States v.

It states: \"Your immigrant visa is approved. The Embassy will now prepare your visa and immigration packet. We cannot guarantee how long this will take.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

But the undisputed fact that afterwards-yet before Saleh's lawsuit was filed-her application was placed in \"administrative processing\" undermines any claim of a final decision approving the visa,\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nine Iraqi Allies,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342101\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/268/#p284\">\n    168 F.Supp.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reaching the same conclusion as to the procedures applicable to the Special Immigrant Visa programs). Indeed, petitioners ultimately concede that, before the April 26, 2017 denial of her visa application, \"Ms. Saleh did not have a final decision on her visa.\" Pet. Supp. Br. at 4. Given this intervening development, the later denial of the application does not give rise to a meaningful inference of retaliatory intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In so concluding, the Court is constrained to note that the State Department's own regulations (and website) do not appear to contemplate a decisional route precisely like the one that Saleh's application appears to have followed prior to the filing of her lawsuit. The Department instructs that \"[w]hen a visa application has been properly completed and executed before a consular officer in accordance with the provisions of INA and the implementing regulations, the consular officer must either issue or refuse the visa under INA 212(a) or INA 221(g) or other applicable law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.81\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
