SCHREIER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 25, 2017, plaintiffs, Stephen and Dianne Landon, filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, bad faith, punitive damages, and vexatious refusal to pay against defendant, American Family Mutual Insurance Company. Docket 1. American Family moves to dismiss Count II (bad faith) and Count III (punitive damages) of the complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Docket 5. Plaintiffs oppose the motion. Docket 9. For the reasons that follow, the court denies American Family's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts alleged in the complaint, accepted as true, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2014, a hailstorm damaged plaintiffs' home and numerous other homes in their Sioux Falls, South Dakota, neighborhood. The hailstorm caused extensive\n   damage to plaintiffs' shake shingle roof. At the time of the hailstorm, plaintiffs had in effect a homeowner's insurance policy with American Family that listed hail damage as a covered loss. After the hailstorm, plaintiffs timely filed a claim to American Family for the damage caused to their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime after the plaintiffs submitted their claim, an authorized agent of American Family inspected plaintiffs' home and determined that the roof, gutters, and downspouts were damaged by the hailstorm. Based on that inspection, American Family determined that $2,810.75 was a reasonable amount to repair the damage. American Family had notice that the homes adjacent to plaintiffs' home as well as other homes in the neighborhood also suffered extensive hail damage. These homes, some of which were insured by American Family, were compensated for the full replacement value of the damage caused to the homes by the hailstorm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs repeatedly told American Family that $2,810.75 was insufficient to fix the damage caused to their home by the hailstorm. Despite plaintiffs' numerous requests that American Family cover the full replacement value of the damage caused to their home, American Family continued to rely on its initial investigation when assessing the value of the damage to plaintiffs' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A court may dismiss a complaint \"for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

American Family first argues that plaintiffs' claims for bad faith and punitive damages are subject to dismissal because they fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). American Family next argues that even if plaintiffs' claims for bad faith and punitive damages are not subject to a heightened pleading requirement, the claims are still subject to dismissal because they fail to satisfy the notice pleading requirement of Rule 8(a)(2). Because this case is before the court on diversity jurisdiction, the court will apply South Dakota's substantive law and federal procedural law to resolve American Family's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Gasperini v.

Thus, in order to determine whether first-party bad faith claims are grounded in fraud, the\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   court examined the foundation of South Dakota's law regarding third-party bad faith claims for guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270864\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/921/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 925-26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kunkel v.

The court's review revealed no case that had applied Rule 9(b) to a first-party bad faith case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, given the lack of authority supporting American Family's argument, the\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   court found \"that the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b) do not apply to first-party bad faith claims under South Dakota law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 927. The\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   court then evaluated Haney's complaint using Rule 8(a)(2) and concluded that the complaint stated a plausible claim for relief sufficient to defeat American Family's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 927-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, plaintiffs urge the court to adopt the rationale from\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   and deny American Family's motion to dismiss. Docket 9 at 4-6. American Family argues that\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   -if the decision is correct-is distinguishable from the plaintiffs' case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket 6 at 6. The distinguishing fact, according to American Family, is that unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs here have \"erased any distinctions that may exist between bad faith and fraud by asserting a theory of bad faith that is inescapably grounded in fraud.\" Docket 11 at 2. Thus, because plaintiffs \"proceed on a theory of fraudulent bad faith,\" American Family argues that Rule 9(b) is the applicable pleading standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To support its argument that plaintiffs are required to comply with Rule 9(b), American Family notes that plaintiffs' complaint explicitly alleges fraud by statin\n   g that \"American Family's actions, including its claims-handling process, were undertaken with oppression, fraud, and malice.\" Docket 1 \u00b6 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   American Family further argues that plaintiffs' theory of bad faith appears to allege that (1) American Family fraudulently designed its claim handling process to deny and delay paying valid claims and (2) American Family fraudulently and maliciously applied this practice when denying plaintiffs' claim. Docket 6 at 6 (citing Docket 1 \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, 45). Thus, according to American Family, plaintiffs' explicit use of the word fraud, combined with their theory of fraudulent bad faith, is sufficient to bring plaintiffs' complaint under the Eighth Circuit's statement that \"[c]laims 'grounded in fraud' must meet [ Rule 9(b)'s] heightened pleading requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Streambend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076100\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/1003/#p1010\">\n    781 F.3d at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs vehemently disagree with American Family's interpretation of their theory of bad faith as well as with American Family's attempt to distinguish the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   . Docket 9 at 4-6. Plaintiffs contend that their single use of the word \"fraud\"-which is located in the punitive damages count of the complaint-does not require them to meet Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiffs further contend that American Family's failure to cite a single case where a court required a party to allege a first-party bad faith claim with particularity undermines American Family's entire argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Plaintiffs also note that while their use of the word \"fraud\" in the complaint was intentional, the term was not used in isolation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing Docket 1 \u00b6 45) (stating that the word fraud was used as a part of the string of terms \"oppression, fraud, and malice\"). Instead, plaintiffs argue that their sole purpose in using the word \"fraud\" in their complaint, was to mirror SDCL \u00a7 21-3-2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is the South Dakota statute that triggers plaintiffs' right to recover punitive damages. Docket 9 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having reviewed the various arguments presented by the parties, the court concludes that plaintiffs are not required to plead their allegations with particularity under Rule 9(b). Several considerations inform the court's conclusion. First, because \" Rule 9(b) is a special pleading requirement, contrary to the general approach of Rule 8, 'its scope of application should be construed narrowly and not extended to other legal theories or defenses.' \"\n   <em>\n    Haney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270864\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/921/\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

Here, plaintiffs have met that burden by alleging, in part, that (1) they had an insurance policy with American Family that listed hail damage as a covered loss at the time of the storm, (2) American Family inspected their home and refused to pay for the full extent of the damage, and (3) American Family knew or had a reckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for offering only $2,180.50 for the damage to plaintiffs' home even though plaintiffs insisted that $2,180.50 was insufficient to fix the damage to plaintiffs' home and due to the fact that American Family had already paid for the full damage that the hailstorm caused to homes owned by other American Family insureds in plaintiffs' neighborhood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket 1 at 2-4.

The court finds that plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for relief under South Dakota's substantive law regarding first-party bad faith. Plaintiffs' allegations of bad faith are subject to review under the pleading standard for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), and are not subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Because plaintiffs have stated a plausible first-party bad faith claim, their claim for punitive damages also survives American Family's motion to dismiss.
