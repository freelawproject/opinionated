(ECF No. 74). Guild filed a response. (ECF No. 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Also before the court is Guild's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 76). Prestwick filed a response (ECF No. 83), to which the HOA joined (ECF No. 86), and to which Guild replied (ECF No. 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The present case involves a dispute over real property located at 247 Prestwick Court, Mesquite, Nevada 89027 (the \"property\"). (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 29, 2011, Mesquite 52 LLC deeded the property to Anibal C. Estrada (\"Estrada\"). (ECF No. 1). Estrada obtained a mortgage loan in the amount of $180,285.00 from Guild, using the property as collateral. (ECF No. 75). The loan was insured by Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Estrada granted Guild a deed of trust, which Guild subsequently recorded. (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Estrada then became delinquent on his HOA assessments. (ECF No. 75). On or about December 21, 2012, the HOA filed a notice of delinquent assessment lien in the amount of $1,253.27 via its foreclosure agent, Alessi &amp; Koenig, LLC (\"Alessi &amp; Koenig\"). (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 6, 2013, Alessi &amp; Koenig then filed a notice of default and election to sell under homeowners association lien, claiming a lien in the amount of $2,469.81.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alessi &amp; Koenig mailed copies of the notice of default and election to sell to Estrada, MERS, Guild, and other interested parties. (ECF No. 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 10, 2013, Alessi &amp; Koenig recorded a notice of foreclosure sale, claiming a lien in the amount of $4,538.40.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; (ECF No. 1). Copies of the notice of foreclosure sale were mailed to Estrada, Guild, and other interested parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The notice of sale was also published in the Nevada Legal News.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 6, 2013, Alessi &amp; Koenig conducted the public foreclosure sale of the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prestwick purchased the property for $20,100.00 at the foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 18, 2013, Alessi &amp; Koenig recorded a trustee's deed upon sale conveying the property to Prestwick. (ECF No. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the foreclosure sale extinguished the deed of trust, MERS executed an assignment of deed of trust assigning all beneficial interest and all rights accrued or to accrue under the deed of trust to Guild. (ECF No. 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 12, 2015, Guild filed the underlying complaint against the HOA and Prestwick, alleging six causes of action: (1) declaratory relief regarding the facial unconstitutionality of NRS 116; (2) declaratory relief that the foreclosure sale amounted to an unconstitutional taking under NRS 116; (3) the transfer to Prestwick was voidable under NRS 112.190 ; (4) declaratory relief that the HOA sale was commercially unreasonable and therefore void; (5) declaratory relief that the HOA sale was unconstitutional as it was preempted by\n   federal law; (6) and quiet title. (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 22, 2017, the court denied both Prestwick (to which the HOA joined) (ECF No. 43) and Guild's (ECF No. 40) motions for summary judgment. (ECF No. 53). On March 8, 2017, Magistrate Judge Ferenbach granted the parties' stipulation to reopen and extend discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the instant motion, Prestwick again moves for summary judgment against Guild seeking quiet title and declaratory relief in its favor. (ECF No. 70). The HOA (ECF No. 74) and Guild (ECF No. 76) each also filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

At issue in\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   was the constitutionality of the \"opt-in\" provision of NRS Chapter 116, not the statute in its entirety. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held that NRS 116.3116's \"opt-in\" notice scheme, which required a HOA to alert a mortgage lender that it intended to foreclose only if the lender had affirmatively requested notice, facially violated mortgage lenders' constitutional due process rights.\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n    832 F.3d at 1157-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Guild's motion for summary judgment will be denied as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Guild also argues the foreclosure sale amounted to a deprivation of property under the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The deprivation of property must be caused by a state actor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JP Morgan Chase Bank v.

Guild argues that the purchase price ($20,100.00) at the foreclosure sale (November 6, 2013) was grossly inadequate because it was 9.8% of the property's fair market value. (ECF No. 75). In support, Guild provides that its appraisal valued the property at $205,000.00 at the time of the foreclosure sale. (ECF No. 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The appraisal report attached to Guild's motion, however, states that the defined value of the property was \"as of March 31, 2017\" (ECF No. 75), more than three years after the foreclosure sale, not at the time of the foreclosure sale. Further, the six comparable sales listed in the report received insurable clear title. Here, due to nature of the property's sale, no title company would be willing to issue title insurance. Thus, Guild has not set forth any competent evidence that the sale price was grossly inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Guild also contends that the \"misleading\" language in section 7.2 of the HOA's CC &amp; Rs operated to \"chill\" bids at the foreclosure sale, resulting in a depressed\n   price. (ECF No. 75). This exact argument was addressed and rejected by the court in\n   <em>\n    SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC v. U.S. Bank N.A.\n   </em>\n   , 130 Nev. Adv. Op. 75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20408\">\n    334 P.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418-18 (2014). Language in the CC &amp; Rs has no impact on the superprioriety lien rights granted by NRS 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Guild further contends that because the Alessi &amp; Koenig law firm had previously represented Prestwick on a couple of unrelated quiet title actions in the past, its role conducting the foreclosure sale amounts to unfairness. (ECF No. 75). Based on the evidence, this argument fails. First, Alessi &amp; Koenig the law firm and Alessi &amp; Koenig the collection company are separate entities. (ECF No. 84). Second, Alessi &amp; Koenig's representation of Prestwick ended at least a year in advance of the foreclosure sale on November 6, 2013.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Guild offers no evidence that the sale was improperly conducted as a result of the prior relationship between Prestwick and the separate Alessi &amp; Koenig entity. Instead, Guild merely speculates and concludes that this past and independent relationship amounted to unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Accordingly, Guild's commercial reasonability argument fails. as it fails to set forth evidence of fraud, unfairness, or oppression.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 70653,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201423938\">\n    2017 WL 1423938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.2 (\"Sale price alone, however, is never enough to demonstrate that the sale was commercially unreasonable; rather, the party challenging the sale must also make a showing of fraud, unfairness, or oppression that brought about the low sale price.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Bona Fide Purchaser Status\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Guild contends that Prestwick cannot qualify as a bona fide purchaser because it \"threw [itself] into a depressed market\" and had knowledge of the contested nature of \"these sales.\" (ECF No. 75 at 23). Guild also argues that the CC &amp; Rs raise a presumption against bona fide purchaser status here, as \"the CC &amp; Rs disclaim everything.\" (ECF No. 74 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Prestwick argues that it is a bona fide purchaser because it paid value for the property and it lacked notice of a competing or superior interest in the property. (ECF No. 70). Because Guild has not proven that the superpriority portion of the HOA lien was paid in advance of the foreclosure sale, Prestwick was not put on inquiry notice. An investigation would have only confirmed that the interest acquired by the buyer at the foreclosure sale would have priority over the deed of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the court concludes that Guild failed to properly raise any equitable challenges to the foreclosure sale, the court need not address Guild's argument that Prestwick was not a bona fide purchaser for value.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 70653,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201423938\">\n    2017 WL 1423938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    SFR Investments\n   </em>\n   , NRS Chapter 116, and the trustee's deed upon sale, the foreclosure sale extinguished the deed of trust. Guild has failed to raise any genuine issues to preclude summary judgment in Prestwick's favor. Therefore, the court will grant Prestwick's motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In addition, in upholding the validity of the foreclosure sale, the court will grant the HOA's motion for summary judgment as well. (ECF NO. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Prestwick's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 70) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the HOA's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 74) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Guild's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 76) be, and the same hereby is, DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The clerk is instructed to enter judgment accordingly and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The 2015 Legislature revised Chapter 116 substantially. 2015 Nev.
