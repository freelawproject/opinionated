No. 9.] Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendant asks the Court to find that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On November 17, 2017, Plaintiff filed her resistance. [Dkt. No. 18.] Defendant filed a reply on December 26, 2017. [Dkt. No. 21.] For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Jeri Pickrell filed suit against Defendants LivaNova PLC, Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH, and Sorin Group USA, Inc. on May 31, 2017. The suit, on behalf of Plaintiff herself and all similarly situated persons, alleged two counts: Medical Monitoring (Count I) and Declaratory Relief Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. (Count II). On September 25, 2017, Plaintiff dismissed LivaNova PLC as a defendant. On October 11, 2017, the Court dismissed Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH as a defendant. Therefore, Sorin Group USA, Inc. is the only remaining defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   LivaNova Holding USA, LivaNova PLC, and Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH (hereinafter Defendant) sold a 3T Heater-Cooler System (hereinafter 3T machine) to both Mercy Medical Center (MMC) in Des Moines, Iowa, and University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) in Iowa City, Iowa. The 3T machine was used to regulate blood temperature during certain surgeries. On February 2, 2016, UIHC announced\n   that approximately 1,500 of its surgery patients (between the dates of January 1, 2012, and January 22, 2016) had been exposed to a potentially fatal subspecies of non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) because of alleged defects in the 3T machine. On August 29, 2016, MMC announced that 2,600 of its surgery patients (between the dates of July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2016) had been potentially exposed to NTM because of the 3T machine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both MMC and UIHC posted information regarding NTM and the 3T machine on their websites. Both websites also included information regarding the necessity of follow-up treatment and advised that asymptomatic patients do not require testing or treatment. Although the chances of contracting NTM are extremely low (estimated to be less than one percent by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), due to the slow-growing nature of the bacterium, it can take anywhere from two weeks to five years for symptoms of an infection to develop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 19, 2016, Plaintiff underwent open heart surgery at MMC, during which a 3T machine was used. Therefore, Plaintiff's surgery fell within the exposure window provided by MMC. Plaintiff has not suffered from any symptoms related to NTM. Additionally, she has not been diagnosed with NTM. In her Complaint, Plaintiff specifically states that her suit only involves individuals \"who are currently asymptomatic for nontuberculous mycobacterium (or \"NTM\") infection\" and that \"[c]laims for actual injury from an NTM infection are excluded from the claims brought in this class action.\" [Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 52.] Accordingly, Plaintiff has not alleged any injury from Defendant's acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, Defendant alleges that Plaintiff's medical monitoring claim must be dismissed because Iowa law does not recognize a claim for medical monitoring. Additionally, Defendant claimed that even if Iowa did recognize a claim for medical monitoring, Plaintiff fails to allege any actual need for medical monitoring. Second, Defendant alleged that Plaintiff's declaratory relief claim should be dismissed because she lacks a substantive basis on which to seek declaratory relief.

Therefore, this Court must predict what the Iowa Supreme Court would decide if confronted with a claim of medical monitoring. In paragraphs 64 and 65 of the Complaint, Plaintiff bases her exposure to NTM on Defendant's negligence. Thus, this is a claim rooted in negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Iowa, a cognizable negligence claim must include an actual injury suffered by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vossoughi v. Polaschek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892258\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/859/643/#p649\">\n    859 N.W.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649-650 (Iowa 2015) (finding that legal malpractice claims, which \"sound in negligence\", must include a showing that \"the attorney's breach of duty caused 'actual injury, loss, or damage' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ruden v.

This Court finds that the Iowa Supreme Court would be unlikely to adopt a medical monitoring cause of action rooted in a negligence theory, especially absent an actual injury. Due to Iowa's requirement that negligence claims include an actual injury, this Court concludes that the Iowa Supreme Court, if confronted with the opportunity to recognize a medical monitoring cause of action, would either decline to do so or would require an actual injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges no injury from Defendant's acts, and she acknowledges that she is asymptomatic. She is requesting damages that are based on a speculative future need for medical treatment and testing that are rooted in a cause of action that does not exist under Iowa law. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff has not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted and, thus, Count I of the Complaint is hereby dismissed. As a result, the Court need not resolve the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff has no cognizable claim for medical monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In her Response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff urges this Court to certify the medical monitoring issue to the Iowa Supreme Court. However, as Defendant argues in its Reply Brief, the Plaintiff has failed to move for certification, so the issue is not ripe for this Court's ruling. The Court, therefore, declines to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Declaratory Judgment Act does not create a cause of action without an underlying claim. As the only underlying claim pled by the Plaintiff is for medical monitoring, which the Court dismissed above, the Plaintiff lacks standing to assert a claim under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Thus, the Court agrees with the Defendant that because there is no cognizable claim for medical monitoring, the Plaintiff cannot bring a claim for declaratory relief, as there is no \"actual controversy\" before the Court.
