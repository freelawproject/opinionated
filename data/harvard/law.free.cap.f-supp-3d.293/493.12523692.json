No. 54] and Defendants John Smith and Michael Ruzzo [Dkt. No. 53] seeking summary judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The Court has considered the written submissions of the parties, as well as the arguments advanced at the hearing on May 22, 2017. For the reasons stated on the record that day, as well as those that follow, the City of Atlantic City's motion is granted and John Smith's and Michael Ruzzo's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Ruby Conde brings this action individually and on behalf of the Estate of, her son, Derrek Denzel Mack (\"Mack\"). Mack was shot and killed by Defendant Atlantic City Police Officer John Smith on December 17, 2012. According to the Complaint, law enforcement officers responded to the area of Baltic Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in response to information that two individuals, with a concealed weapons, were observed in the area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith Stat., Def. Ex.2; Am. Compl., \u00b6 16. Upon the arrival of Officer Tweedle, Mack ran. Am. Compl. at \u00b6 18. Mack, alleged as unarmed, ran for approximately one block when Smith, who had arrived on the scene and began to pursue Mack on foot, drew his weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24. According to Plaintiff, Mack stopped running and signaled surrender by raising his arms in the air.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Defendant Smith fired his weapon three times striking Mack twice in the back; a third shot missed Mack and struck a nearby vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As a result of the two bullet wounds, Mack collapsed on the sidewalk and remained in a prone position. There is video evidence of the scene, taken by a bystander's cell phone, after Mack was shot. Defendant Atlantic City Police Officer Michael Ruzzo and other back up officers arrived on the scene of the shooting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    iPhone\n   </em>\n   video, Ex. 7; Am. Compl. at \u00b6 26. As will be discussed infra, video evidence demonstrates that for approximately five\n   minutes, no one provided medical assistance to Mack, however, records indicate that Ruzzo called an ambulance approximately one minute after Mack was shot. Instead of rendering medical aid to Mack, Ruzzo took Smith to the hospital and left the scene. Am. Compl. at \u00b6 30. Despite Ruzzo's departure, several other law enforcement officers can be seen on the video in close proximity to Mack, who was face down on the ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    iPhone\n   </em>\n   video, Ex. 7. Mack succumbed to the injuries sustained in the shooting, but it is unclear from the record whether Mack was dead on arrival at the Atlantic City Medical Center Emergency Room or he died at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As will be discussed in detail, there are some disputed facts related to whether Mack was actually in possession of a gun on the day of the incident. Officer Smith claims that he witnessed Mack holding a firearm during his pursuit of the fleeing Mack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith Stat., Ex.2. In addition, there is testimony from other Atlantic City police officers stating that Mack had a gun and that a gun was recovered from the area where Mack was shot and fell. None of the non-police witnesses testify that they saw Mack with a weapon; the testimony does not confirm the presence of a weapon, but does not exclude the possibility that Mack was armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Conde brings several causes of action against the Defendants, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , including a deadly force claim against Smith (Count I), a state created danger claim against Ruzzo and Smith (Count II), a denial of medical assistance claim against all of defendants (Count III), a municipal liability claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

Detective Kevin Fair was part of the pursuit of Mack. He states that when he first observed Mack, he did\n   not see a gun. Fair Dep., Ex. 5, p. 6. Mack was running and then tripped in the street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Once Mack got up, Fair saw a silver handgun and alerted police by way of radio and verbal shout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fair testifies that he yelled to Smith that Mack was armed when Smith joined the pursuit and was within a closer proximity to Mack than Fair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

Sparks further states that both Mack and Davis failed to abide by officers' commands to stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Detective Lieutenant Sarkos arrived on the scene to find Mack on the ground, handcuffed, and with a handgun just nearby.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sarkos' Rpt., Ex. 4.

Not only did Smith observe Mack with a gun, but his recitation of the facts is consistent with that of Ridley and Fair.

The Atlantic City Police Department conducted an internal review and took no action against the officers. The Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office brought the case before a Grand Jury that found the conduct was \"lawful and justified\" and issued a no bill.

Here, Smith was informed by other officers at the scene that Mack was armed, an observation Smith alleges he also made personally. Even assuming all of the officers and Ms. Ridley were lying about the presence of the gun and the video evidence is perhaps unreliable, Smith arrives on the scene with information that the man he is pursuing is armed. Mack, despite demands to stop, continues to flee and evade arrest and, according to several witnesses, slows his pace as he raises his\n   hands. Of the witnesses who could see both of Mack's hands raise in the air and Mack's torso, the undisputed evidence shows that, at the very least, the possibility existed for Mack to reach into his waistband, where Smith and others state he holstered the weapon.

In this regard, the state-created danger theory of liability operates as an exception to that general rule and requires plaintiffs to meet a four part test: \"(1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct; (2) the state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience; (3) a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant's acts ...; and (4) the state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

The state created danger theory rests on the denial of medical care. Because there is nothing in the record to support a claim of actions that shock the conscience, and summary judgment has been granted on the excessive force claim, summary judgment is granted on the state created danger theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Claims Against The City of Atlantic City, (Count IV), Wrongful Death (Count VI) and Survivorship (Count VII).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff's Claims in Counts II and IV as against Atlantic City are predicated upon a showing of liability against Ruzzo and Smith.\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Exs. B, C. There is notable confusion as to the date stamp on the video: the date stamp indicates a date of November 30, 2012, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pascal has represented that this video, which allegedly depicts Mack, is dated December 17, 2012 and was introduced as admissible evidence during the Dirty Blok Trials.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex. D. The Court has reviewed the video and finds it grainy and difficult to positively identify any of the individuals with certainty and/or identify any objects that may or may not be in the possession of the depicted person. However, still shots of the video produced in Defendants' Exhibit \"C\" which more clearly depict Mack with a gun in his waist band. This evidence suffers from the mislabeled date stamp on the top of the frame; however, the Assistant United States Attorney's statement alleges that the photo was taken on December 17, 2012.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    According to Plaintiff, no surveillance video or photographs of Derreck Mack taken on December 17, 2012 by any law enforcement officials has been produced. The date stamp of the FBI surveillance video is November 30, 2012. As a result, and despite the letter by the United States Attorney's Office, Plaintiff claims there is no proof that Mack was armed on December 17, 2012.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Det.
