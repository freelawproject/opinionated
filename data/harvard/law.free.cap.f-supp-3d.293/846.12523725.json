In the interim, Standard had paid those benefits to third-party defendant James Stevens. In a third-party claim, Standard asserts that, if it is required to pay benefits to Opheim, it is entitled to a constructive trust over the benefits it has paid to Stevens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unless indicated otherwise, the parties do not appear to dispute the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff's decedent Lisa K. Opheim (formerly Lisa Nichols) was employed by Peoples Bank of Rock Valley, Iowa, as a trust administration/operations assistant. One of her employment benefits was life insurance coverage pursuant to a group life insurance plan, governed by ERISA, under which Peoples Bank was a participating employer, the policy holder was Iowa Bankers Insurance and Services, Inc. (Iowa Bankers), of Johnston, Iowa, and Standard was the insurer and plan administrator. The plan provided for basic accidental death and dismemberment (ADD) benefits in the total face amount of $115,000, basic term life insurance benefits in the face amount of $65,000, and additional term life insurance benefits in the face amount of $65,000. In her original application for these benefits, dated October 15, 2009, Lisa Opheim designated plaintiff Douglas Opheim (Opheim) as the primary beneficiary of her ADD insurance benefits and basic group term life insurance benefits, but designated James Stevens, her father, as the primary beneficiary of her additional term life insurance benefits. Appendix (docket no. 14) at 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Subsequently, on November 16, 2010, Lisa executed a change of beneficiary form designating Opheim as the beneficiary of her additional term life insurance benefits, indicating an effective date of November 22, 2010, the date of her marriage to\n   Opheim. Appendix at 132. The plan provided, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Naming A Beneficiary\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Beneficiary means a person you name to receive death benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   You may name one or more Beneficiaries. Two or more surviving Beneficiaries will share equally, unless you specify otherwise. You may name or change Beneficiaries at any time without the consent of a Beneficiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Your Beneficiary designation must be the same for Life Insurance and AD&amp;D Insurance death benefits. Your Beneficiary designations for Life Insurance and your Supplemental Life Insurance may be different.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   You must name or change Beneficiaries in writing. Your designation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   1. Must be dated and signed by you;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   2. Must be delivered to the Policyholder or Employer during your lifetime;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   3. Must relate to insurance provided under the Group Policy; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   4. Will take effect on the date it is delivered to the Policyholder or Employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appendix at 71. Peoples Bank had a copy of the November 16, 2010, designation form in its files, which showed a hand-written note in the upper righthand corner by Gary De Jager, the human resources director for Peoples Bank, indicating that the form had been mailed to Iowa Bankers on December 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106. Standard did not find a copy of the November 16, 2010, designation in its file, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lisa Opheim died in a car accident on or about October 1, 2014. On or about October 10, 2014, Peoples Bank submitted claim information for her life insurance benefits, signed by Mr. De Jager, to Standard and/or Iowa Bankers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223. That claim identified the \"name of Beneficiary\" as Opheim and his relationship to Lisa Opheim as \"Spouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 21, 2014, Standard paid Opheim $130,000 plus interest in benefits for the basic term life insurance and the additional term life insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108 (transaction summary report). On January 15, 2015, Standard also paid Opheim $115,000 in ADD benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On or about March 2, 2015, however, Kim Smothers, a Life Benefits Analyst for Standard, called Opheim, and that same day sent him a letter, informing him that he had been paid the $65,000 in additional life insurance benefits in error. Appendix at 136. Ms. Smothers's explanation for the mistake, in her letter, was the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Unfortunately, [the October 15, 2009,] designation was overlooked when we initially reviewed the claim, likely because we were focused on the change form Mrs. Opheim completed on October 31, 2013, adding Dependents Life and naming her step-children as beneficiaries. As a result, all the benefits were paid to you, including the $65,000 Additional Life, which should have actually been paid to Mr. Stevens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appendix at 136. In her letter, Ms. Smothers \"ask[ed] that [Opheim] send us a $65,000 check payable to Standard Insurance Company,\" and stated that Standard would then send a check to Stevens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Opheim sent Standard a check dated March 14, 2015, in the amount of $65,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152. Standard received the check on March 24, 2015, then sent Stevens a $65,000 check enclosed in correspondence dated April 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Subsequently, on November 24, 2015, Opheim sent Ms. Smothers the following email:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Dear Ms. Smothers,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   In your letter dated 3/2/15, attached, you indicated that Lisa's father, James Stevens, was beneficiary for Lisa's Additional Life Benefits. You referenced her Beneficiary Designation dated 10/15/09.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I accepted that and assumed there was some mistake on Lisa's and my end. I assumed that, somewhere, Lisa and I hadn't made the proper indications to name me as the beneficiary of all her insurance policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   I offer, however, a beneficiary change form dated 11/16/10, also attached, that, as far as I can tell, does name me as the primary beneficiary effective 11/22/10 (the date we were married) for her Group Term Life (GTL) and Additional Life (ADDL) policies. I ran across this form last weekend while cleaning out some files. Is this the correct form for your company? Am I interpreting the form correctly? ADDL stands for Additional Life, correct or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Please review this and get back to me either by email or phone at [redacted]. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Appendix at 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As mentioned, above, Peoples Bank also had a copy of the November 16, 2010, designation form in its files. Mr. De Jager wrote a letter, dated December 11, 2015, to Ms. Smothers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 131, which Opheim attached to an email to Ms. Smothers on December 11, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. In his letter, Mr. De Jager explained that he had found a copy of the November 16, 2010, designation in Lisa Opheim's employee file with Peoples Bank, and that, based on his handwritten note at the top righthand corner of the designation form, he stated that he had mailed a copy of the form to Iowa Bankers on December 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 106 (copy of designation with Mr. De Jager's notation). Nevertheless, Standard points out that there is no document in the Administrative Record memorializing actual transmittal of the November 16, 2010, designation to the policyholder, and that Standard was unaware of the existence of that designation until Opheim sent his email on November 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Brandy Sears, a Senior Life Benefits Analyst for Standard, reviewed the situation and, on December 21, 2015, emailed Ms. Smothers, in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Hi Kim-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I took a look at this claim and also reviewed it with Hector this morning. Here is my recommendation for a plan of action:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1. We need to contact the group and find out why we didn't receive this designation with the claim? Normally we would receive all designations with the claim and we need to confirm why this didn't happen here. We want to resolve any break down in the process or eliminate an issue that could arise again in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   2. The account manager and NAC will need to be involved at this point. The reason behind this is that we paid the claim in good faith based on the information that we received with the claim. Typically in this situation, where we receive an updated designation after payment on the claim, we would attempt to get the funds back. However, since we paid the claim in good faith based on the information we had in the file at the time of claim we would advise the \"updated beneficiary\" that they would need to work it out with the \"prior beneficiary\".\n   <strong>\n    NOTE\n   </strong>\n   : This is not a typical situation based on our prior recovery of funds and taking this approach may not be appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   3. [Redacted].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   4. We may need to look at making a business decision on this claim. The problem here is more that we paid out the claim correctly (based on the updated designation), had\n   money returned, and then paid out again (to the wrong person based on the updated designation). Due to the claim circumstances this may be the appropriate plan of action, however, we will want to do the above 3 steps first before we get to this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Appendix at 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On January 29, 2016, Ms. Smothers sent Opheim a letter that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , acknowledged that the letter from Peoples Bank \"confirms that the November 16, 2010, beneficiary designation form was received in their office and mailed to the Policyholder, Iowa Bankers Benefit Plan Trust, on December 1, 2010.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112. Ms. Smothers's letter then stated, \"Unfortunately, this form was not mailed to The Standard with Mrs. Opheim's life insurance claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the remainder of her letter, Ms. Smothers set out Standard's resolution of the matter, as far as it was concerned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   At this time The Standard is faced with competing claims to this benefit, between you and Mr. Stevens. As an impartial stakeholder we are not required to determine who among competing claimants has a valid right to these funds. The Standard paid this benefit to Mr. Stevens in good faith, based on the information we received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Therefore, we ask that you and Mr. Stevens come to some mutually agreeable resolution. Please contact us if you need assistance. Otherwise, we will consider this matter closed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Appendix at 112-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On December 1, 2016, ten months after receiving Ms. Smothers's letter that Standard considered the matter \"closed,\" Opheim filed a petition in the Iowa District Court for Sioux County against Standard asserting claims of breach of contract and equitable fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 30, 2016, Standard removed this action to this federal court on the ground that this court had federal question jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), because the action is controlled by ERISA. On January 13, 2017, Standard filed its Answer And Third-Party Complaint, denying Opheim's claims, asserting various defenses, and asserting third-party claims against Stevens for a constructive trust and unjust enrichment. Stevens filed his Answer to the Third-Party Complaint on January 29, 2017, denying Standard's claims and asserting various affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On March 21, 2017, after conferring with the parties, Chief United States Magistrate Judge C.J. Williams entered a Scheduling Order For A Claim Review Case Filed Under ERISA. Notwithstanding Opheim's and Stevens's jury demands in their pleadings, the parties apparently agreed to submit all claims for disposition by the court pursuant to a briefing schedule. Consequently, on June 1, 2017, Standard filed a Redacted Administrative Record; on July 31, 2017, Opheim filed his Brief In Support Of Claim; on September 12, 2017, Standard filed its Memorandum Of Law In Opposition To Plaintiff's Claim And In Support Of Its Dismissal, including arguments for a constructive trust on the benefits paid to Stevens, if the court determines that Standard wrongfully paid the benefits in question to Stevens; on October 12, 2017, Stevens filed his Memorandum Of Law In Opposition To [Third-Party] Plaintiff's Claim; and on November 1, 2017, Opheim filed his Reply Brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This case is now ripe for decision on the merits on the parties' written submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Opheim's Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Opheim's claims against Standard, as pleaded, are for breach of contract, based on Standard's failure to pay him the additional term life insurance benefits, and equitable fraud, for misrepresenting facts concerning the rightful beneficiary of those benefits. The parties do not dispute that the life insurance benefits at issue are pursuant to a plan governed by ERISA. Under the preemptive force of ERISA, Opheim's claims are for denial of benefits and equitable relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will consider those claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Opheim's denial of benefits claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Opheim argues that, while regulated, ERISA plans are governed by established principles of contract and trust law. For example, he argues that a contract may benefit and give rights to third parties. He argues that he is obviously the intended beneficiary of Lisa Opheim's life insurance, because the November 16, 2010, designation expressly names him as the intended beneficiary of all three kinds of life insurance. He points out that Standard originally paid him the benefits at issue, then demanded repayment. He contends that, when Standard was presented with the November 16, 2010, designation, Standard (through Brandy Sears) admitted that the additional term life insurance benefits were paid to the wrong person when they were paid to Stevens, but Standard nevertheless still refuses to correct its mistake. Opheim argues that Standard's contention that it paid Stevens the benefits \"in good faith\" does not change the fact that the plan required that the benefits be paid to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Standard argues that it did not abuse its discretion under the plan, because its decision to demand repayment of the benefits from Opheim and then to pay the benefits to Stevens complied with the \"plan documents rule,\" which requires plan administrators to manage ERISA plans in accordance with the documents and instruments governing them. To put it another way, Standard argues that the \"plan documents rule\" required it to look solely at the directives in the plan documents, not at the intent of the parties, in determining how to disburse benefits. Standard contends that it is undisputed that it did not have a copy of the November 16, 2010, designation in\n   its files at the time it made its benefits decision or that the latest beneficiary designation in its file was the October 15, 2009, designation naming Stevens as the beneficiary of the benefits at issue. Thus, Standard argues that it was required to pay the benefits to Stevens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In reply, Opheim argues that this case is distinguishable from those on which Standard relies. He also argues that, while Lisa Opheim met the requirements of the plan for an effective change of beneficiary by submitting the November 16, 2010, beneficiary designation to Peoples Bank, Standard breached the requirements of the plan by denying his claim to be repaid the benefits after he claimed them on the basis of that beneficiary designation. He contends that, when Standard denied that claim, Standard neither referenced the parts of the plan upon which the decision was based, nor notified him of his right to have that decision reviewed, as Standard was required to do under ERISA. Instead, he argues that Standard simply tried to wash its hands of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

The court first summarized the facts, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   In 1991, RoJane Lewis obtained life insurance under a group policy issued by Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company to her employer, Inacom Corporation. She submitted a beneficiary designation form granting sixty percent of the death benefit to her husband, Alan Lewis, and twenty percent to each of her daughters, Katherine and Kristina Matschiner. RoJane died in April 2005. When Hartford located the designated beneficiaries in June 2007, Katherine Matschiner advised that Kristina had a more recent beneficiary designation and that Alan Lewis intended to disclaim his share of the $122,000 death benefit. Hartford contacted Alan, who stated that he wished to collect his share of the death benefit and submitted a signed claim form. The daughters also submitted claim forms, and Kristina faxed Hartford a copy of a November 2000 divorce decree in which a Nebraska state court awarded Alan and RoJane, individually, the \"cash values of any life insurance policies currently owned by him or her or the cash proceeds ... to be received therefrom.\" When neither daughter submitted a more recent beneficiary designation, Hartford paid the policy benefits in accordance with the 1991 designation in its files.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When Katherine responded in June 2007 and advised that her sister had a later beneficiary designation, Hartford asked that it be submitted. Instead, Kristina faxed a copy of the divorce decree. Hartford's attempt to obtain more information from defunct [former employer of the deceased] went unanswered. After Alan submitted a claim for his share of the death benefit, he complained to the Nebraska Department of Insurance when Hartford did not promptly pay the claim. The Department demanded that Hartford explain the delay. Hartford then paid the death benefit in accordance with the 1991 beneficiary designation form, the only designation in its files. After these payments, the Matschiners' attorney sent Hartford a beneficiary designation signed by RoJane in\n   December 1997 granting forty percent of the life insurance benefit to Alan and thirty percent to each daughter. This document was found in RoJane's \"personal files.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 886-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   concluded that the \"plan documents rule\" was applicable, and required payment of the ex-husband's percentage under the designation in the files, not as stated in the divorce decree.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record does include a 1997 designation reducing Alan's share from sixty to forty percent of the death benefit. Though in writing and apparently in proper form, there is no evidence this designation was submitted to the Policyholder, or directly to Hartford, before the death benefit was paid [as required by the plan documents]. When Katherine Matschiner advised Hartford of a later designation in June 2007, Hartford asked for a copy. If the Matschiners had complied before the death benefit was paid, Hartford might well have been obliged to pay in accordance with this later designation because the Policyholder was out of business and the policy otherwise terminated. But the Matschiners did not comply, and Hartford promptly paid the claims submitted by the three beneficiaries in accordance with the only designation in its files, as the policy required.\n   <em>\n    The policy expressly provided that Hartford is not liable for further payment of amounts paid under an earlier designation before it received a later designation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   In these circumstances, applying the plan documents rule, summary judgment in favor of Hartford is clearly warranted.

Rather, the \"plan documents rule\" demonstrates that Standard abused its discretion in refusing to pay Opheim the benefits he was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, the circumstances differ in all pertinent respects from those presented in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner.\n   </em>\n   Lisa Opheim\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   sign a beneficiary designation form eliminating Stevens as a designated beneficiary of the additional term life insurance benefits and replacing him with Opheim and\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   submit it to her\n   <em>\n    employer\n   </em>\n   , Peoples Bank, as required by the plan documents in this case for the designation to become effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix at 71 (stating that the designation would \"take effect on the date it is delivered to the Policyholder or Employer\"). This is exactly the opposite of the\n   situation in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , where the plan participant never submitted a signed designation as required by the plan documents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , the record, here, does include the November 16, 2010, designation changing the beneficiary to Opheim and that new designation was in writing and clearly in proper form, but unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , this designation\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   submitted to the proper entity, Lisa Opheim's employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appendix at 71. Also unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , Opheim promptly provided the November 16, 2010, designation after discovering it, and submitted verification from Lisa Opheim's employer that the designation had been properly submitted under the terms of the plan. Appendix at 125 and 131. Finally, unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   , the policy at issue, here,\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   expressly provide that Standard is not liable for further payment of amounts paid under an earlier designation before it received a later designation.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, Standard's failure to pay benefits in accordance with the November 16, 2010, designation was an abuse of discretion, because the Opheims did everything the plan required to effectuate the change of beneficiary to Opheim, while Standard did not do what the plan documents required to determine the proper beneficiary. As noted, above, the plan documents at issue, here, expressly provided that the designation would \"take effect on the date it is delivered to the Policyholder or Employer.\" Appendix at 71. Thus, the fact that the November 16, 2010, designation was not in Standard's file does not establish compliance with the \"plan documents rule\"-indeed, that fact is irrelevant-because that rule requires Standard to act \"in accordance with the documents and instruments\" of the plan and, more specifically, to \"hew[ ] to the directives of the plan documents,\" not merely to act in compliance with the documents in its file.\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D) and\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/\">\n    555 U.S. at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679152\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/285/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Standard acted arbitrarily in not investigating why the employer's identification of the beneficiary did not match the one in Standard's file from the October 15, 2009, designation. Yet, even without such notice from the employer suggesting a possible change of beneficiary, Standard acted arbitrarily and capriciously by not verifying with either the employer or the policy holder that no change of beneficiary designation had been received,\n   <em>\n    before paying benefits\n   </em>\n   , where the plan documents designated the employer or the policy holder, rather than Standard, as the proper entities to receive an effective beneficiary designation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matschiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786364\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/885/#p887\">\n    622 F.3d at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Hartford's attempt to obtain more information from defunct [former employer of the deceased] went unanswered.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Standard also abused its discretion when it failed to take any action to remedy its payment to the \"wrong\" beneficiary, even after a senior life benefits analyst for Standard reviewed the situation and admitted that Standard had paid the \"wrong\" beneficiary, and acknowledged that this was not the \"typical\" situation in which such an error might occur.

Opheim's equitable relief claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Opheim's second claim is for equitable fraud, based on Standard's alleged misrepresentation of facts concerning the rightful beneficiary of those benefits. As explained, above, under the preemptive force of ERISA, this claim is one for equitable relief. I find it unnecessary to reach this claim or the parties' arguments about whether or not it presents a proper equitable claim under ERISA, where Opheim has obtained complete relief on his denial of benefits claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

Arguments of the parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Opheim also argues that, if I order Standard to pay him the claimed benefits, I should also order Standard to pay for the attorney fees that Opheim incurred seeking to recover those benefits. He contends that, notwithstanding Standard's supposed \"good faith\" in demanding return of the benefits initially paid to him, Standard acted in bad faith when he demonstrated that Standard's determination that Stevens was the proper beneficiary was wrong, because the November 16, 2010, beneficiary designation was effective, and asked Standard to correct the error. He argues that bad faith is apparent, because Standard chose to try to wash its hands of the matter, even after a senior life benefits analyst who reviewed the case conceded that Standard had paid benefits to the wrong beneficiary and that this was not a typical situation of prior payment of benefits. Opheim also argues that Standard has the ability to pay attorney fees, and that such an award would help to deter other insurers from just wiping their hands in similar situations, in disregard of whether the payment was made to the rightful beneficiary. Finally, he argues that the merits of his position are strong, while the merits of Standard's position are weak, because Standard has simply refused to fulfill its obligations under the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Standard argues that, for the same reason Opheim's claims should fail, his request for attorney fees should also fail. Standard disputes that Opheim can be a prevailing party. Standard also argues that it did not act in bad faith, because, for\n   example, it did not deny liability altogether. Standard contends that an award of attorney fees to Opheim would reward potential beneficiaries who fail to exercise diligence during the claim review process, but also contends that the case uniquely impacts Opheim, not all participants or beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

As to Standard's degree of culpability or bad faith, I have already concluded that the Opheims did what the plan documents required, but Standard acted arbitrarily-and I now add, in bad faith.

Standard also attempted to wash its hands of the matter, contrary to its obligations under the plan terms. Standard clearly has the ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees, and Standard expressly concedes as much. Contrary to Standard's contentions, an award of attorney fees against Standard could deter other plan administrators acting under similar circumstances from such arbitrary and bad faith conduct and, instead, encourage them to comply strictly with the plan documents, as required by the \"plan documents rule.\" Finally, considering the relative merits of the parties' positions, I have already concluded that the Opheims did what they were required to do under the plan, while Standard did not, and Standard's arguments to the contrary do not bear close scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Under these circumstances, Opheim is entitled to an award of attorney fees against Standard.

Standard clearly has the ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees. Again, an award of attorney fees against Standard could deter other plan administrators acting under similar circumstances from such arbitrary and bad faith conduct and, instead, encourage them to comply strictly with the plan documents, as required by the \"plan documents rule.\" Had Standard done so, Stevens likely would\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   have been embroiled in this lawsuit.
