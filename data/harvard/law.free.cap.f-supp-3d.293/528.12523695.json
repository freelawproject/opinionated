In December 2013, Edward and Vickie Fangman (represented by the same counsel involved in this case) filed a complaint against Genuine Title involving essentially identical allegations in the Circuit Court of Baltimore County that was removed to this Court in January 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fangman v. Genuine Title, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. RDB-14-0081 (D. Md.), at ECF No. 1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   \").) The Fangmans alleged that Genuine Title, in exchange for the referral of title services on their mortgage loan, paid cash kickbacks to loan brokers and provided \"marketing materials for free or at a drastically-reduced rate (collectively 'Free Marketing Materials') for various loan officers who were part of the mortgage lending process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fangman,\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, ECF No. 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a part of discovery in the\n   <em>\n    Fangman\n   </em>\n   action, Plaintiffs' counsel served a document subpoena on First Mariner Bank on July 14, 2014.

(\n    <em>\n     Bezek\n    </em>\n    , Mem. 17, ECF No. 4-2.) In early 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel used these records to identify and notify affected borrowers and prospective plaintiffs.

That First Amended Complaint in\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    alleged violations of RESPA, Maryland's state-law analog to RESPA, and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.

This Court applied that test in the\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    action in the context of Plaintiffs' counsel's significant investigatory efforts, which by June 2015 had successfully identified borrowers referred to Genuine Title between 2006 through 2013.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fangman v.

In terms of due diligence, this Court found:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    Plaintiffs' counsel has undergone a large-scale review of Defendant Genuine Title's computer system. It is only through this review, aided by early discovery and a proprietary software system, that potential plaintiffs have been identified.

Compl. at \u00b6 94, ECF No. 138. In light of these unique circumstances, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that equitable tolling is warranted in this case and that all Plaintiffs, with the exception of the Eagle National Plaintiffs, brought their claims within one year of the date they could have first known of their cause of action through due diligence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <em>\n     Fangman,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208315704\">\n     2015 WL 8315704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Following discovery concerning Genuine Title's business practices and relationship with other lenders, some defendants (e.g., Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and PNC) have struck class settlements which have been the subject of public filings and class notices.

(\n    <em>\n     See CFPB v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n    </em>\n    , Case No. RDB-15-0179 (D. Md.) (\"\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    \").) The pendency and ultimate settlement of the\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    in January 2015 was widely publicized. Specifically, the CFPB issued a press release on January 22, 2015, and local and national news media, including\n    <em>\n     The Baltimore Sun\n    </em>\n    , CNN, and the\n    <em>\n     Wall Street Journal\n    </em>\n    , published stories about the case.

The CFPB issued a press release on April 29, 2015 in which the CFPB outlined the enforcement action against Genuine Title based on the same facts alleged by the\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs. On May 1, 2015, the CFPB and Maryland Attorney General announced a settlement with Genuine Title, and this Court entered a Stipulated Final Judgment and Order approving the settlement. (\n    <em>\n     See Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 18.) As with the\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , the\n    <em>\n     Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    settlement was also reported by various news media outlets and other publications in May 2015. (\n    <em>\n     See Dobbins,\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 17-4.) The settlement orders in these enforcement actions explicitly contemplate related litigation by affected consumers (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g., Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , Genuine Title Order 5, ECF No. 18), but neither the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nor the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland required that any financial institutions issue formal notices to the public (\n    <em>\n     see Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , JPMorgan Chase Order, ECF No. 10;\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , Wells Fargo Order, ECF No. 11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n     <em>\n      Bezek et al v.

Plaintiffs assert that they cannot be charged with the knowledge of their own attorneys from before the attorney-client relationship was established. (Mem. Opp'n 25, ECF No. 7-1.)

Even if Plaintiffs' counsel's knowledge is not relevant to the due diligence analysis, counsel's in-depth investigation into Genuine Title's records certainly bears heavily on the question of whether \"extraordinary circumstances\" stood in Plaintiffs' way and prevented timely filing.\n    <em>\n     Menominee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 755\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Extraordinary Circumstances\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In an effort to establish the \"extraordinary circumstances\" element, the Plaintiffs assert that \"affirmative misrepresentations on HUD-1 forms constitute independent acts of concealment,\" (Mem. Opp'n 8, ECF No. 7-1 (citing\n    <em>\n     In re Community Bank of No. Va. Mortg. Lending Prac.

Opp'n 5). At oral argument, Plaintiffs claimed that the Defendant's\n    <em>\n     ongoing\n    </em>\n    failure to disclose the true nature of its relationship with Genuine Title by sending notices to all customers known to have used Genuine Title's services constitutes an act of\n    <em>\n     continued\n    </em>\n    concealment by the Defendant. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs contend that they have satisfied the extraordinary circumstances element because they \"could not have known about this illegal Kickback Scheme until contacted by counsel on or about August 24, 2017.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    12 (citing Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 95, 97, 117).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Defendant argues that Plaintiffs failed to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity, especially when nondisclosure on a HUD-1 is insufficient to warrant equitable tolling of a RESPA violation claim. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply 18-20, ECF No. 8.) The Defendant generally argues that Plaintiffs' theory \"re-writes RESPA and makes Plaintiffs' counsel-and not the terms of the legislation passed by Congress-the master of the RESPA statute of limitation.\" (Mem. 5, ECF No. 4-2.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Even assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that the initial HUD-1 non-disclosure and alleged \"sham\" agreements establish fraudulent concealment\n    with sufficient particularity,\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    the circumstances causing Plaintiffs' delay were not \"extraordinary\" nor were the circumstances \"beyond [their] control.\"\n    <em>\n     Menominee,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Plaintiffs' counsel filed suit against Genuine Title back in December 2013, subpoenaed Defendant First Mariner regarding its relationship with Genuine Title in July 2014, and acknowledged comprehensive access to Genuine Title's data by June 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    , ECF Nos. 1, 150-3, 150-2.) Accordingly, the Defendant's alleged continuing fraudulent concealment was simply not the only circumstance delaying the filing of this lawsuit. In spite of this fact, Plaintiffs argue that this Court should focus on the Defendant's \"ongoing\" failure to broadly notify customers of a potential claim related to Genuine Title. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mem. Opp'n 16 n.11, ECF No. 7-1.) Plaintiffs' view of equitable tolling essentially demands that this Court order the Defendant, and similarly situated lenders, to send out such notices to stop the ongoing equitable tolling of any RESPA claim by any Genuine Title customer. This theory swallows RESPA's one-year statute of limitations, which was set by Congress, and asks this Court to regulate lenders in a way that was specifically not requested by those federal and state enforcement agencies that have actively investigated Genuine Title and its associated financial institutions. (\n    <em>\n     See Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    (RDB-15-0179), JPMorgan Chase Order, ECF No. 10;\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    , Wells Fargo Order, ECF No. 11.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Furthermore, the Defendant's alleged concealment effort did not \"st[and] in [Plaintiffs'] way\" up until the time they were contacted by counsel.\n    <em>\n     Menominee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 755\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In other words, it was\n    <em>\n     within the Plaintiffs' control\n    </em>\n    to discover a basis for their action in May 2015 at the latest,\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    more than two years prior to being contacted by counsel on August 24, 2017 and filing the Complaint on September 29, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601457\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/750/\">\n     at 756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Unlike in the\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    case, the Plaintiffs in this case could have discovered a substantial amount of public information on Genuine Title's illegal scheme that was brought to light through the\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    and enforcement litigation. The publicly available information was sufficiently specific and applicable to the Plaintiffs that contact by counsel was not the only method by which they could have learned of their claim. Although Plaintiffs argue that the public record does not specifically mention First Mariner or Tony Sergi, Plaintiffs do not dispute that in 2010 and 2012 they knowingly used Genuine Title for their title and settlement services. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64, 73, ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs here allege that Genuine Title provided kickbacks to First Mariner in the\n    form of referring cash, free marketing materials, and marketing credits (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 17-7), the same methods alleged in\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     see Fangman\n    </em>\n    , Second Am. Compl. 9-12, ECF No. 138), the\n    <em>\n     Genuine Title Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    RDB-15-1235, Compl. 9-10, ECF No. 1), and the\n    <em>\n     Lender Enforcement Action\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    RDB-15-0179, Compl. 3, 5, ECF No. 1). These three lawsuits produced public court records and publicly available news coverage on the same Genuine Title practices at issue in this case. (\n    <em>\n     See Bezek\n    </em>\n    , ECF Nos. 4-4 through 4-9.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Plaintiffs have made no allegation that the Defendant's actions or a lack of access to public records, news, the internet, TV, or a phone placed such information outside their reach.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    They merely argue that they were not yet on \"notice\" of the need to search for such information. The issue of notice, however, is not relevant to the extraordinary circumstances analysis, which asks whether the circumstances combine to render \"critical information,\n    <em>\n     reasonable investigation notwithstanding\n    </em>\n    , undiscoverable.\"\n    <em>\n     Gould\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807330\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/738/#p745\">\n     905 F.2d at 745-46\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Supermarket of Marlinton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413062\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/119/#p122\">\n     71 F.3d at 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requiring the plaintiff to show that it \"failed to discover those facts within the statutory period, despite ... the exercise of due diligence\").

Plaintiffs' counsel has already secured significant awards for their efforts to hold Genuine Title and other financial institutions accountable for violating RESPA. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fangman\n    </em>\n    , Final Approval Order regarding Wells Fargo settlement, ECF No. 411.) Genuine Title went bankrupt, and Plaintiffs do not allege that the Defendant continues to receive illegal kickback payments through deceiving Plaintiffs or their fellow class members. Plaintiffs allege that between\n    2009 and 2014 they were \"deprived of impartial and fair competition between settlement service providers in violation of RESPA, denied kickback-free settlement services, and paid more for said settlement services\" because Genuine Title used a portion of those settlement payments to provide at least $34,000 in kickbacks to Angela Pobletts and $8,000 to Tony Sergi. (\n    <em>\n     Bezek\n    </em>\n    , Compl. \u00b6 54, 55, 90, ECF No. 1.) While the purported class may have some interest in accountability and financial compensation, Congress firmly expressed an interest in providing certainty to the real estate market when it set the RESPA statute of limitations at one year.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Given this context, it would not be unconscionable or grossly unjust to enforce RESPA's one-year statute of limitations.
