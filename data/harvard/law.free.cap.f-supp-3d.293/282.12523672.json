Mason, Ronald Fountain, and Tim Colaneri (collectively \"City Defendants\"), and the County of Rensselaer and Michael Sikirica (\"Dr. Sikirica\") (collectively \"County Defendants\"), are the following three motions pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) : County Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint; County Defendants' motion to dismiss City Defendants' cross-claims; and City Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Dkt. Nos. 12, 29, 40, 41.) For the reasons set forth below, County Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is granted in part and denied in part, County Defendants' motion to dismiss City Defendants' cross-claims is granted, and City Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, liberally construed, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges that, on September 21, 2008, Plaintiff's four-month-old son, Matthew, became ill and was transported by ambulance to Samaritan Hospital in Troy, New York. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 31.) There, the treating emergency room doctor noted the most likely differential diagnosis to be septic shock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later on September 21, 2008, Matthew was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Albany Medical Center, where he was treated by Dr. Walter Edge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Edge incorrectly concluded that Matthew\n   had suffered a skull fracture and was the victim of a physical assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on Dr. Edge's diagnosis, City Defendants took Plaintiff into custody and interrogated him for a total of about nine-and-one-half hours broken into an initial two-hour session and a subsequent seven-and-one-half-hour session. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In between those two sessions, Plaintiff expressed suicidal thoughts and was involuntarily hospitalized for approximately fifteen hours in a secure psychiatric unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was released from the psychiatric unit to Mason and Fountain, who are City of Troy police officers, and the interrogation continued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Throughout the interrogation, City of Troy police officers Mason, Fountain, and Colaneri used numerous tactics to elicit a confession from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ultimately, they succeeded in their efforts and Plaintiff confessed that on three occasions during the week preceding Matthew's death, he \"slammed\" Matthew down on to a mattress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, a videotape of Plaintiff's interrogation showed Plaintiff demonstrating the \"slamming\" motion, which consisted of him holding a clipboard to symbolize Matthew in his hands, raising his hands over his head, quickly lowering them with great force toward the ground, and throwing the clipboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on this confession, on September 23, 2008, Plaintiff was charged with murdering Matthew. On September 25, 2008, Rensselaer County medical examiner, Dr. Sikirica, met with Mason, then performed an autopsy of Matthew in the presence of Mason and Rensselaer County District Attorney Richard R. McNally, Jr., and Assistant District Attorney Christa Book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notwithstanding the medical evidence that Matthew died of septic shock caused by a bacterial infection and that Matthew had streptococcus pneumonia bacteria in his bloodstream, Dr. Sikirica failed to document sepsis in his autopsy report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, in furtherance of a conspiracy with City Defendants, Dr. Sikirica falsely recorded the cause of Matthew's death to be severe closed head injuries with cerebral edema due to blunt force trauma, and the manner of death to be homicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Sikirica then conveyed his autopsy report to prosecutors for use in the prosecution of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, on September 26, 2008, Plaintiff was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of Matthew. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's criminal case proceeded to trial in October 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The prosecution presented Plaintiff's confession, the videotaped demonstration of how he threw Matthew onto the mattress, Dr. Sikirica's autopsy report, and testimony of Dr. Sikirica who put forth his diagnosis that Matthew died of head trauma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found Plaintiff guilty of second degree murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was sentenced to twenty-five years to life in prison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In February 2014, the New York Court of Appeals found that Plaintiff's confession was not voluntary and thus, reversed his conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2014, Plaintiff was re-tried on the murder of Matthew. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the re-trial, the prosecution relied on Dr. Sikirica's findings, as outlined in the autopsy report, that Matthew's death was caused by a severe closed head injury with cerebral edema due to blunt force trauma, and the manner of death was a homicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the defense proved that Matthew suffered no recent acute trauma and instead died of septic shock caused by a bacterial infection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The jury in the re-trial acquitted Plaintiff on June 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City of Troy and County of Rensselaer have unconstitutional policies, customs, or practices that include inadequate\n   screening, hiring, retaining, training, and supervising of their employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City of Troy is aware from sources including lawsuits, notices of claim, complaints, news reports, internal investigations, and failed prosecutions that many Troy police officers, including Mason, Fountain, and Colaneri, engage in misconduct and unlawful interrogation techniques pursuant to Troy Police Department policy, custom, or practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite such notice, the City of Troy failed to take corrective action and that failure caused the officers here to violate Plaintiff's civil rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The County of Rensselaer was also aware from lawsuits, notices of claims, complaints, news reports, and failed prosecutions that Dr. Sikirica was not acting independently, did not adequately investigate prior medical history of decedents, and had similarly ignored obvious medical evidence, which supported the finding that a child had died of natural causes, and provided a cause of death and medical diagnosis consistent with the urging of police officers who were seeking a homicide conviction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff included the citations to web addresses of \"URLs\" of two news articles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The first news article discussed Joseph McElheny, who was charged in the May 2010 death of his four-month-old daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second news article discussed Michael Davis, who was charged in the February 2015 death of his two-and-one-half-year-old daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Generally, based on these factual allegations, the Amended Complaint asserts the following six claims: (1) a claim of malicious prosecution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Mason, Fountain, Colaneri, and Dr. Sikirica; (2) a claim of violation of Plaintiff's right to a fair trial pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Mason, Fountain, Colaneri, and Dr. Sikirica; (3) a claim of failure to intervene pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Mason, Fountain, Colaneri, and Dr. Sikirica; (4) a claim of conspiracy pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Mason, Fountain, Colaneri, and Dr. Sikirica; (5) a claim of municipal liability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the City of Troy; and (6) a claim of municipal liability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the County of Rensselaer.

Parties' Briefing on County Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Generally, in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, County Defendants argue as follows: (1) Plaintiff's causes of action are time-barred; (2) Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against Dr. Sikirica for failure to intervene; (3) based on Plaintiff's factual allegations, Dr. Sikirica is protected from liability as a matter of law by the doctrine of absolute immunity or qualified immunity; and (4) Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged facts giving rise to a claim of municipal liability against the County of Rensselaer. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 41, Attach. 1 [Cnty. Defs.' Supp. Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, in opposition to County Defendants' motion to dismiss, City Defendants argue as follows: (1) dismissal is premature; and (2) City Defendants filed a cross-claim against County Defendants seeking indemnification/contribution from County Defendants as to any damages awarded to Plaintiff against City Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 27 [City Defs.' Aff. in Opp'n].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Generally in opposition to County Defendants' motion, Plaintiff argues as follows: (1) Plaintiff's claims against Dr. Sikirica for malicious prosecution and fabrication of evidence are not time-barred\n   because the statute of limitations for these claims did not accrue until Plaintiff was acquitted after his second trial; (2) Dr. Sikirica is not entitled to absolute immunity because the functions performed by him were investigative, and he is not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the litigation because the Amended Complaint adequately pleads facts that, if true, would not entitle him to qualified immunity; and (3) Plaintiff's claim for municipal liability is plausible on its face because it alleges facts plausibly suggesting that his constitutional rights were violated by the County's failure to train and supervise Dr. Sikirica. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 48 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Generally in their reply, County Defendants argue as follows: (1) Plaintiff's causes of action are time-barred because they began to accrue in February 2014, when his conviction was reversed; (2) Plaintiff failed to state a claim against Dr. Sikirica for failure to intervene because the Amended Complaint did not allege facts plausibly suggesting that Dr. Sikirica had an affirmative duty to intervene or that he knew that Plaintiff's confession was coerced, and because Plaintiff did not oppose this portion of County Defendants' motion; (3) Dr. Sikirica should be afforded absolute immunity because his judgment as medical examiner is functionally comparable to that of judges; (4) Plaintiff's opposition fails to establish that Dr. Sikirica was a \"complaining witness\" exposing him to liability for malicious prosecution; and (5) Plaintiff has not alleged facts plausibly suggesting a theory of municipal liability regarding the County of Rensselaer because Plaintiff points to only two other unsubstantiated allegations of an incorrect cause-of-death determination by Dr. Sikirica. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 54 [Cnty. Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Parties' Briefing on County Defendants' Motion to Dismiss City Defendants' Cross-Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Generally, in support of their motion to dismiss City Defendants' cross-claims, County Defendants argue that City Defendants cannot seek indemnification and contribution on a claim brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 33, Attach. 3 [City Defs.' Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Generally, in their reply, County Defendants argue that, even under the authorities cited by Plaintiff City Defendants' cannot seek indemnification and contribution on a claim brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Parties' Briefing on City Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Generally, in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, City Defendants argue as follows: (1) Plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution is time-barred; (2) in any event, probable cause existed for the prosecution of Plaintiff; (3) Plaintiff's claim for violation of his right to a fair trial is time-barred; (4) Plaintiff's claim that City Defendants failed to intervene on his behalf is time-barred; (5) Plaintiff's conspiracy claim is time-barred; (6) Plaintiff's municipal claim is also time-barred; (7) Plaintiff failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting a theory of municipal liability; and (8) based on Plaintiff's allegations, the police officers (Mason, Fountain, and Colaneri) are protected\n   from liability as a matter of law by the doctrine of qualified immunity. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40, Attach. 2 [City Defs.' Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Generally, in opposition to City Defendants' motion, Plaintiff argues as follows: (1) Plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution is not time-barred because it did not accrue until he was acquitted after his second trial on June 12, 2014; (2) Plaintiff has rebutted the presumption of probable cause created by his indictment because he has alleged that City Defendants coerced Plaintiff's confession and conspired with Dr. Sikirica to issue a false autopsy report, which resulted in the indictment; (3) Plaintiff's fair trial claim is not time-barred because it did not accrue until he was acquitted after his second trial on June 12, 2014; (4) Plaintiff's failure-to-intervene claim is not time-barred because City Defendants still had a duty to intervene up to and until Plaintiff was acquitted after his second trial; (5) Plaintiff's conspiracy claim is not time barred because it flows from the use of fabrication of medical evidence at trial in furtherance of Defendants' efforts to undermine Plaintiff's rights and thus accrued after Plaintiff was acquitted; (6) Plaintiff's municipal liability claim is not time-barred because it relates to the malicious prosecution and fair trial claims, which were timely filed; (7) Plaintiff's claim for municipal liability is plausible on its face because it sufficiently pled that the constitutional violations were a result of the unconstitutional policies, customs, or practices of City Defendants; and (8) taking the allegations in the Amended Complaint as true, City Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 47 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Generally, in their reply City Defendants argue as follows: (1) Plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution is time-barred because once the Court of Appeals deemed Plaintiff's confession coerced, the issue had been decided in his favor; (2) Plaintiff's claim for violation of his right to a fair trial is also time-barred because it began to accrue when his conviction was overturned on February 20, 2014; (3) Plaintiff's claim for failure to intervene is time-barred because it is based on conduct that occurred in 2008 and City Defendants were not involved in the prosecution; (4) Plaintiff's conspiracy claim ought to be dismissed because there is no allegation that the conspiracy included a private party and the conspiracy claim is time-barred; (5) Plaintiff's municipal liability claim also fails because Plaintiff failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting such a claim and failed to cite to any other similar instance in which Troy Police Department officers violated the rights of an individual; (6) Plaintiff's municipal liability claim is time-barred because it accrued at the latest when Plaintiff's criminal conviction was remanded; (7) probable cause existed to prosecute Plaintiff even without the use of the confession that was later deemed coerced; and (8) based on Plaintiff's allegations, the police officers (Mason, Fountain, and Colaneri) are protected from liability as a matter of law by the doctrine of qualified immunity.

GOVERNING LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It has long been understood that a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), can be based on one or both of two grounds: (1) a challenge to the \"sufficiency of the pleading\" under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) ; or (2) a challenge to the legal cognizability of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Onondaga Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/#p211\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211, nn. 15-16 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) (McAvoy, J., adopting Report-Recommendation on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because such dismissals are often based on the first ground, a few words regarding that ground are appropriate. Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a pleading contain \"a\n   <em>\n    short and plain\n   </em>\n   statement of the claim\n   <em>\n    showing\n   </em>\n   that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) [emphasis added]. In the Court's view, this tension between permitting a \"short and plain statement\" and requiring that the statement \"show[ ]\" an entitlement to relief is often at the heart of misunderstandings that occur regarding the pleading standard established by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the one hand, the Supreme Court has long characterized the \"short and plain\" pleading standard under Fed. R. Civ.

On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held that, by requiring the above-described \"showing,\" the pleading standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires that the pleading contain a statement that \"give[s] the defendant\n   <em>\n    fair notice\n   </em>\n   of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/#p211\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.17 (citing Supreme Court cases) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Supreme Court has explained that such\n   <em>\n    fair notice\n   </em>\n   has the important purpose of \"enabl[ing] the adverse party to answer and prepare for trial\" and \"facilitat[ing] a proper decision on the merits\" by the court.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/#p211\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.18 (citing Supreme Court cases) ;\n   <em>\n    Rusyniak v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   These allegations plausibly suggest that the indictment was produced by fraud, perjury, the suppression of evidence or other police conduct undertaken in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Therefore, City Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As discussed above in Point III.A.4. of this Decision and Order, City Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's conspiracy cause of action is denied to the extent that Plaintiff's conspiracy claim relates to a conspiracy to maliciously prosecute him, and granted to the extent that Plaintiff's conspiracy claim relates to a conspiracy to violate his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   After carefully considering the matter, the Court determines that, for the reasons set forth in City Defendants' memoranda of law and as set forth more fully above in Point III.A.5. of this Decision and Order, Plaintiff did not adequately plead municipal liability. (Dkt. No. 40, Attach. 2, at 11 [City Defs.' Mem. of Law]; Dkt. No. 59, at 7 [City Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In the alternative, the Court finds that, as set forth above in Point III.A.5. of this Decision and Order, Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   cause of action against the City of Troy was untimely. Here, at the absolute latest Plaintiff should have known of the City of Troy's custom, policy, and practice, of \"unlawful interrogation tactics that resulted in or were likely to result in coerced false confessions,\" is February 20, 2014. (Dkt. No. 47, at 17 [citing Dkt No. 31, \u00b6 69].) By February 20, 2014, Plaintiff had (1) personally experienced City Defendants' interrogation tactics, (2) years after the interrogation to obtain the necessary sleep, sustenance, and wherewithal to recognize that his confession was inaccurate, (3) the opportunity to witness City Defendants testify in his criminal trial, and (4) received a favorable ruling from the Court of Appeals confirming that his confession was coerced as a matter of law. (Dkt. No. 31, \u00b6\u00b6 35-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Therefore, the statute of limitations on Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City of Troy began when his criminal conviction was overturned by the New York State Court of Appeals on February 20, 2014. Plaintiff did not file his Complaint for three years and 112 days after February\n   20, 2014, and has never indicated that his delay was due to a lack of awareness of any alleged policy or custom. Accordingly, Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City of Troy must be dismissed as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

(Dkt. Nos. 47, at 17; Dkt. No. 48 at 13 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].)
