Johnson opposes the motion. [Doc. No. 27]. For reasons assigned below, the Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant employed Plaintiff, an Army veteran who served in the first Gulf War, in July of 2003. At all relevant times, Defendant employed Plaintiff as an Operations Specialist at its document storage facility in Monroe, Louisiana. From 2003 to 2011, Plaintiff took three medical leaves of absence. Plaintiff alleges that he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 2011 through the end of his employment in 2015, Amanda Stephenson supervised Plaintiff. Plaintiff claims that Stephenson harassed him from approximately October of 2014 to December of 2014. [Doc. No. 22-3, pp. 18-42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 10, 2014, Plaintiff called Human Resources and complained that Stephenson improperly coached and counseled him for allegedly failing to listen to her request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103-04. Plaintiff did not report any disability-based harassment. [Doc. No. 22-2, p. 8]. Aside from this call, Plaintiff testified that he has no memory of ever calling Human Resources to complain about Stephenson. [Doc. No. 22-3, p. 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after December 10, 2014, Plaintiff asked his manager, Bill Rankin, for a transfer to Defendant's separate facility to \"get away from [Stephenson].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. Plaintiff did not inform Rankin of any disability-based harassment. [Doc. No. 22-2, p. 2]. Rankin granted Plaintiff's request. [Doc. No. 22-3, p. 57].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 20, 2015, Plaintiff came to work in a depressed mood and did not feel like himself. [Doc. No. 22-3, pp. 59, 62]. When he arrived, he spoke with his coworker, Anita McNair, on an outside patio. [Doc. Nos. 22-2, p. 4; 22-3, p. 61]. After he spoke to McNair, Plaintiff spoke with Vernice Teasley, a supervisor, in the mail room. [Doc. No. 22-3, p. 67]. Plaintiff testified that, when speaking with Teasley, he \"just couldn't hold it together anymore\" and that he was crying, depressed, and tired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. He testified that he was angry with Stephenson and that he possibly wanted to confront her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71. When asked if it was possible he could have told Teasley he wanted \"to kill the b****,\" Plaintiff answered, \"I guess anything's possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then clarified that he did not tell Teasley he wanted to kill Stephenson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72. Plaintiff stated, though, that he did not have a clear memory of what he told her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While still upset and crying, Plaintiff went outside and spoke with Rankin, who helped calm Plaintiff. Plaintiff asked Rankin why Stephenson was picking on him and then asked, \"What is she trying to do; make me hurt her or something? ... I didn't go in the army, spend 22 years to\n   come out and hurt no civilians.\" [Doc. Nos. 22-2, p. 5; 22-3, p. 75]. When asked if \"there would be a tipping point as to when\" Plaintiff might hurt Stephenson, Plaintiff responded that he did not know \"in that state.\" [Doc. No. 22-3, p. 75].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 20 and 21, 2015, Angela Bordelon, Vice President of Chase's Global Security Department, interviewed Rankin, Teasley, McNair, and Stephenson about Plaintiff's statements on January 20. Teasley reported that Plaintiff stated \"he was mad enough to kill the B___.\" [Doc. No. 22-4, p. 13]. Others reported that Plaintiff actually stated \"he was going to kill the b****.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Plaintiff \"adamantly denies ... that he threatened to kill anyone.\" [Doc. No. 27-3, p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McNair informed Bordelon that Plaintiff stated he would pay Stephenson a visit before leaving town if he was discharged. [Doc. No. 22-4, pp. 11-12]. In addition, Paul Pendler, Vice President of Chase's Employee Assistance Program, spoke with Plaintiff on January 20 about the threatening comments and Plaintiff reported that he had no recollection of making threatening statements. [Doc. Nos. 22-2, p. 6; 22-4, p. 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Rankin's conversation with Plaintiff on January 20, he sent Plaintiff home for a few days; thereafter, Plaintiff immediately went to his doctor for help and took an extended medical leave of absence. [Doc. No. 22-2, p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 29, 2015, Human Resources determined that Plaintiff's December 10, 2014 complaint concerning Stephenson's improper coaching and counseling was valid and that the \"coaching and counseling\" would be removed from Plaintiff's file. [Doc. No. 22-3, p. 103].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant extended Plaintiff's leave of absence multiple times. He was scheduled to return to work on April 5, 2015. On April 2, 2015, after receiving notice that Plaintiff was expected to return on April 5, Bordelon interviewed Plaintiff via telephone. Plaintiff told her that he could not remember making any threatening statements about his supervisor, Stephenson, and did not remember saying he wanted to \"kill the B****.\" [Doc. No. 22-5, p. 4]. Ultimately, Plaintiff's leave of absence was extended through May 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant maintains that, \"[b]ased on its investigation into Plaintiff's two threatening comments on January 20 (that he was mad enough to 'kill the B****,' and that he did not want to hurt civilians), and the third comment that was reportedly made the week before January 20 (that he would 'pay a visit' to Amanda if he got fired), ... Plaintiff's conduct violated its Violence Free Workplace Policy [\"the Policy\"].\" [Doc. No. 22-2, p. 7]. Plaintiff, however, maintains that he did not engage in any conduct that violated the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant maintains that, because Plaintiff violated the Policy, it \"decided to terminate [his] employment once he was released by his doctors to return to work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 22-2, p. 7]. To reiterate, Plaintiff's leave of absence was extended through May 31, 2015. However, Defendant discharged Plaintiff on May 28, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit in state court on October 10, 2016, claiming that Defendant violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Louisiana Employment Discrimination Law (\"LEDL\") by allowing \"an intolerable and hostile working environment to exist,\" discriminating against\n   him because of his disability, and discharging him in retaliation for complaining about his supervisor's alleged harassing conduct. [Doc. No. 1-1, p. 5-9]. Defendant removed the proceeding to this Court on November 23, 2016. [Doc. No. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 7, 2017, Defendant moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. [Doc. No. 22]. Plaintiff responded on December 29, 2017 [Doc. No. 27], and Defendant replied on January 12, 2018 [Doc. No. 28].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The investigation also revealed that a week prior, [Plaintiff] 'complained all morning' about his supervisor, and 'mentioned that Amanda and Matt were too predictable and that if he got fired he would pay them both a visit before leaving town.' \" [Doc. Nos. 27, p. 3; 22-4, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The \"investigation\" that Hanna refers to includes interviews with multiple employees. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 22-4]. Plaintiff focuses on only two statements. First, Plaintiff argues that a statement, allegedly uttered by him to Teasley and then repeated by Teasley to Bordelon in an interview, is hearsay within hearsay. [Doc. No. 27, p. 4]. In an email, Bordelon wrote, in pertinent part, that Teasley reported to her that Plaintiff, referring to Stephenson, stated \"he was mad enough to kill the B___.\" [Doc. No. 22-4, p. 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   First, Plaintiff's alleged statement is not hearsay. Hearsay is a statement that: \"(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence\n   <em>\n    to prove the truth of the matter asserted\n   </em>\n   in the statement.\" FED. R. EVID. 801(c) (emphasis added). Plaintiff's statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e. that Plaintiff was actually mad enough to kill Stephenson); it is offered to demonstrate the effect it had on Defendant. Specifically, Defendant offers the statement to establish its state of mind leading to its decision to discharge Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delphin v.

Defendant does not seek to establish that the words were\n   <em>\n    true\n   </em>\n   , it seeks to establish that the words were\n   <em>\n    said.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, Teasley's statement is also not hearsay. Teasley stated that Plaintiff uttered certain words. Defendant does not offer Teasley's statement to prove that Plaintiff did utter those words the truth of what Teasley asserts), it offers the statement to prove that\n   <em>\n    Teasley\n   </em>\n   reported Plaintiff's alleged threat. Defendant, in other words, offers Teasley's statement to show its effect on Defendant's state of mind. The relevant inquiry, again, is not whether Plaintiff uttered the threat, but whether Defendant discharged Plaintiff because it, in good faith, thought that Plaintiff uttered the threat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Bordelon's email recounting Teasley's report is admissible as a record of a regularly conducted activity, which is an exception to the rule against hearsay. Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) provides that the following is not excluded by the rule against hearsay:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   A record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (A) the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Hanna avers that she \"maintain[s] or [has] access to Human Resources documents and files relating to individuals employed by Chase\" and that the exhibit was \"made by (or made from information transmitted by) a person with personal knowledge of the events[,] ... made or entered at or\n   near the time of events reflected in the Notes[,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   made as a \"regular practice[,]\" and was \"kept in the course of Chase's regularly conducted business activity.\" [Doc.

Moreover, Plaintiff does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that a statement, allegedly uttered by him to Teasley and then repeated by Teasley to Rankin, is inadmissible hearsay within hearsay. [Doc. No. 27, p. 4]. Plaintiff's alleged statement, found in a report from Defendant's human resource system, Answer Key Notes, was, \"I'm going to kill that b****.\" [Doc. No. 22-4, p. 4]. This statement, as well as the employees' statements relaying and recounting the statement, is, for the same reasons discussed above, not hearsay. Likewise, the report in Answer Key Notes is, for the reasons discussed, admissible as a record of a regularly conducted activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Having found that Defendant's proffered evidence is admissible, and reiterating that Defendant has produced legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for discharging Plaintiff, the Court next finds that Plaintiff has failed to genuinely dispute that Defendant's reasons for discharge were pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that Defendant \"suddenly reactivated the 'investigation' into\" his actions when \"Defendant was told that [Plaintiff] was returning from medical leave.\" [Doc.

Plaintiff adds, \"This impetus resulted in the termination ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969244\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/471/#p476\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Essentially, Plaintiff argues that the timing of discharge, shortly after Defendant learned that he would return from medical leave, is suspicious.
