DEGUILIO, Judge, United States District Court\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At the start of his senior year at L.C. Ward Education Center (\"Ward\"), Plaintiff Donald Kissinger, Jr. (\"Kissinger\"), applied for special permission to drive to school. He did not complete the necessary application process prior to the start of the academic year, but nonetheless began driving himself and other students to and from school, in violation of Ward's rules. School authorities confronted Kissinger about his noncompliance on August 26, 2015. Based on his responses to their questions, they suspected he had drugs in his car, which on that day was parked off school grounds, about one block away. A school official and a Fort Wayne police officer accompanied\n   Kissinger to his car, where a search of the vehicle produced a marijuana pipe and burnt marijuana residue. The police officer handcuffed Kissinger and placed him under arrest. Kissinger subsequently agreed to attend another school for the semester in lieu of expulsion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kissinger filed this action against Fort Wayne Community Schools (\"FWCS\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for maintaining an unconstitutional policy in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. He also brings individual claims against Gradlin Pruitt (Ward's principal), Darrel Armstead (Ward's administrative assistant), and Officer Barry Pruser of the Fort Wayne Police Department (Ward's school resource officer), for subjecting him to an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Kissinger also asserted claims against those individuals under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) and 1986, but he has since voluntarily dismissed those claims along with a separate Fourteenth Amendment claim against FWCS and Pruitt.

For example, Ward's students may not drive themselves to and from school (as\n   opposed to taking a school bus) except under special circumstances, after submitting an application to and receiving approval from the administrative staff. In the administration's experience with students at Ward, \"cars and illicit activity-particularly drug activity-go together,\" and this rule seeks to combat that issue. [Pruitt Decl. \u00b6 11] If granted permission to drive, students must park in the school parking lot. In addition, students may never transport one another to and from school, and may not congregate in or around each other's vehicles at any time. According to the administration, riding together in cars increases the likelihood that students will engage in illegal conduct and drug use. [Pruitt Decl. \u00b6 11]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ward's official policies allow for student searches based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. If the staff approves a student's request to drive, the school's handbook warns students:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Any vehicle parked on school grounds or driven without the administration's approval\n   <em>\n    and parked elsewhere\n   </em>\n   is still subject to search in accordance with the FWCS search and seizure policy providing that the administration has reasonable suspicion to believe an unethical or illegal act may have taken place in or by using said vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [Ward Handbook at 12-13] (emphasis added). As a part of the FWCS system, Ward's students must also comply with the FWCS-wide rules,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, which further state that \"[a]uthorized school personnel may conduct a search of a student ... automobile, if they have reasonable suspicion for a search.\" [FWCS Handbook at 32] According to FWCS, a search conducted under \"reasonable suspicion\" includes a search of a particular item that will lead to the discovery of \"[a]nything that represents a danger of physical harm or illness to students, teachers, assistants or others, whether on school property, at a school-sponsored or school-supervised event\n   <em>\n    or otherwise\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Path to Ward\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kissinger and his parents agreed for him to attend Ward rather than face expulsion from his traditional FWCS school, Snider High, for possessing drugs. [Pruitt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Exh. 3] In May 2015, while at Snider, Kissinger told a fellow student that he had smoked marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This led to a search of Kissinger's vehicle, where a school administrator and a police officer found cigarette butts, prescription medication, acetaminophen pills, two knives, and marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kissinger had previously faced drug-related disciplinary action at Snider, including a 2013 suspension for possession of marijuana. [Pruitt Decl. \u00b6 7, Exh. 4] According to the corresponding report, Kissinger smelled of marijuana at school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He admitted to smoking marijuana two weeks prior, and a subsequent search of his locker produced \"shake.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Time at Ward in August 2015\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Kissinger enrolled for the 2015-2016 academic year at Ward, which began on or around August 15, 2015. Before the school year started, Kissinger and his mother requested that he be allowed to attend Ward for half days so that he could work the other half. They also requested that Kissinger be allowed to drive to and from school, so that he could leave straight for work after class. Ward's principal of nearly ten years, Mr. Pruitt, approved this request, conditioned on Kissinger turning in the required application and documentation of his work schedule, and that he follow all of Ward's driving-related rules as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kissinger and his mother agreed to these terms, but he did not live up to his end of the agreement. During the first two\n   weeks of class, Kissinger: drove to and from school on several occasions without turning in his application, despite several reminders; did not park in the school parking lot despite multiple, explicit instructions from Ward's administration; and repeatedly drove other students to and from Ward, including during the times he represented to the administration that he would be at work. The administration finally informed Kissinger that, if he did not submit the necessary application by August 26, 2015, then he would not be allowed to drive to school and would be placed back on full class days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    The Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kissinger drove himself and another student to Ward on August 26, 2015. He parked on Weibke Street, about one block away from Ward's campus. The administration questioned Kissinger as to why he had not turned in his application and whether he had driven another student to school that day. He provided untruthful responses. For example, Kissinger denied knowing where he was supposed to park, despite having previously been explicitly shown by Mr. Armstead. He also denied driving another student to school that morning, which was false. Based on Kissinger's evasiveness and several other factors, Mr. Pruitt suspected that Kissinger had contraband (specifically, drugs) in his car and ordered a search. Kissinger led a school administrator, Mr. Armstead, and the school resource officer, Officer Pruser, to his off campus vehicle. While Kissinger and Officer Pruser stood by, Mr. Armstead searched the vehicle and found a marijuana pipe containing burnt marijuana residue. Kissinger, Mr. Armstead, and Officer Pruser all returned to the school, where Officer Pruser handcuffed Kissinger and placed him under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kissinger argues that FWCS maintains an unconstitutional search policy, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, because the policy allows for the search of student vehicles parked off campus and \"not involved in a school-sponsored activity.\" [DE 49 at 3] He likewise argues that Pruitt, Armstead, and Pruser subjected him to an unreasonable search and seizure when they searched his off campus vehicle for contraband. Finally, he contends that the individual defendants committed false arrest and false imprisonment at the scene of the search and in placing him under arrest, and that FWCS and the City can both be held liable for these Indiana state law torts under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Moreover, such a parking location might actually be closer in proximity to the school than a designated parking lot on school grounds lying beyond athletic fields or other school facilities. Under Kissinger's interpretation of the law, a search of the vehicle parked across the street would always require a warrant based on probable cause-a requirement, that, in certain circumstances, interferes with school officials' crucial ability to maintain the \"swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in schools.\"\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p333\">\n    469 U.S. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p333\">\n    105 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Here, Kissinger's vehicle was merely a block away from school property.

Given that, and the heightened risk established by Kissinger's two recent reprimands for possessing marijuana and\n   <em>\n    knives\n   </em>\n   in his car, the Court finds that the individual defendants appropriately limited the scope of their search, and thus did not violate Kissinger's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p333\">\n    at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959437\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/325/#p333\">\n    105 S.Ct. 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Kissinger notes that the administration did not know the location of Kissinger's car when Mr. Pruitt ordered the search. [DE 49 at 17] True, but the Court must address the reasonableness of the search itself, not the order to search. Ward's administrators knew Kissinger parked only a short block away from campus by the time they reached the car and before they began the search itself. Had Kissinger parked so far away as to render any search unreasonable, the administration could have made that determination and aborted the plan to search Kissinger's car. The Court recognizes that the appropriate scope of a search is impacted by the vehicle's proximity to the school, and it is not the Court's intent to suggest that a potential threat to the school's security alone justifies an unreasonable expansion of the search area. Rather, in keeping with\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   , this ruling is limited to the particular circumstances of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case, which include the relatively close proximity of the vehicle to the school's campus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    d.
