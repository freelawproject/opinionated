LUDINGTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of a car accident that occurred on January 9, 2015. Thomas Saunders was crossing the street in a crosswalk at the corner of Saginaw Road and Main Street in Midland, Michigan, when he was struck by a vehicle owned and operated by Daniel James Girard. Thomas Saunders suffered catastrophic injuries leaving him incapacitated. He received extensive medical treatment at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital, Mary Free Bed Medical Group, and Covenant Medical Center (collectively, the \"Medical Providers\"). Between February 2015 and May 2016, the Medical Providers collectively incurred approximately $750,000 in charges for Thomas Saunders' treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Charlene Saunders is Thomas Saunders' mother, legal guardian, and appointed conservator. Charlene Saunders pursued a third party no-fault action for noneconomic damages against Mr. Girard on behalf of Thomas Saunders, and ultimately reached a settlement agreement. On October 31, 2016, the Midland County Probate Court issued an order approving the settlement of the tort claim against Mr. Girard. Mr. Girard's liability insurer was Citizens Insurance Company of the Midwest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Saunders was a participant in her employer's health benefit plan, the TJX Companies, Inc. FlexPlus Plan (the \"TJX Plan\" or \"TJX\"). Thomas Saunders was a covered individual under the TJX Plan. Ms. Saunders was also insured under a no-fault automobile insurance policy issued by Citizens Insurance Company of the Midwest (the \"Citizens Policy\") pursuant to the Michigan No-Fault Act, M.C.L 500.3101 et seq. Thomas Saunders was also a covered individual under the Citizens Policy. Both the TJX Plan and the Citizens Policy contain coordination of benefits (COB) provisions purporting to exclude coverage for benefits covered under other plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TJX entered into an administrative services contract (ASC) with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (BCBSMA), under which BCBSMA acted as TJX's third party claims administrator. Between April and August of 2015, the Medical Providers sent BCBSMA billing forms, itemized statements, and medical records documenting the claim for Mr. Saunders' treatment. BCBSMA paid some of these charges before it determined that Mr. Saunders' was covered under a no-fault auto insurance policy with Citizens, though the amount paid is not reflected in the parties' papers. The Medical Providers also furnished Citizens with billing forms, itemized statements, and medical records documenting the claim for Mr. Saunders'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   treatment. Citizens did not furnish payment for these charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case involves two separate actions: one initiated by Charlene Saunders (the Saunders Action) (16-14176) and one initiated the Medical Providers (the MFB Action) (17-10826). On September 13, 2017, well into the proceedings, the parties stipulated to consolidate the cases. ECF No. 29. Both actions involve at least the same core legal question: whether the TJX Plan or Citizens is the primary insurer responsible for Saunders' medical expenses. All parties have filed their own substantive claims for relief addressing the priority issue including: Saunders' complaint against TJX and Citizens; TJX's crossclaim against Citizens; Citizens' crossclaim against TJX; and the Medical Providers' complaint against TJX and Citizens. The following is a brief summary of the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 29, 2016, Plaintiff Charlene Saunders (Saunders), as guardian and conservator for Thomas Saunders, filed a complaint against the TJX Plan and Citizens.

Additionally, the Medical Providers seek a money judgment against the party deemed primary, directing them to pay past due medical expenses, interest, costs, and fees. ECF No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 28, 2017, Citizens filed a crossclaim against the TJX Plan. Counts I and II seeking declaratory relief that the TJX Plan is first in priority.

TJX argues that the TJX Plan contains a coordination of benefits (COB) provision that excludes coverage for benefits payable under any other health plan. TJX states that the TJX Plan is a self-funded ERISA plan governed by ERISA and federal common law. As such, TJX contends that the Michigan No-Fault act is preempted by ERISA, that the TJX Plan's COB provision controls, and that Citizens is primarily liable for the Medical Provider's charges. The TJX Plan then moved for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the crossclaim for declaratory relief on the priority issue. ECF No. 27. The brief in support of TJX's motion for judgment on the pleadings is substantially identical to the brief in support of its motion to dismiss Saunders' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 21, 2017, Citizens moved for summary judgment on counts I and II of its crossclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 34.

ECF No. 41. The Medical Providers argue that their charges are not in dispute. They also seek penalty interest under M.C.L. 500.3142 if Citizens is found to be the primary insurer, as a non-fault insurer cannot delay payment based on a\n   priority dispute without subjecting itself to penalty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The following two motions will be addressed first: Defendant TJX and BCBSMA's motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the crossclaim (ECF Nos. 27, 32); and Defendant Citizens' motion for summary judgment with respect to the crossclaim. (ECF No. 34). The adjudication of these two motions will resolve the priority dispute. Accordingly, Defendant TJX's motion to dismiss Saunders' complaint (ECF No. 13) will be denied as moot. Finally, Plaintiff Medical Providers' motion for summary judgment on its claims against Citizens, BCBSMA, and TJX (ECF No. 41) for payment of medical expenses, interest, costs, and fees will be addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   TJX moves for judgment on the pleadings with respect to its crossclaims. \"The standard of review for a [motion for] judgment on the pleadings [under rule 12(c) ] is the same as that for a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

Kelsey-Hayes Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7629759\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/93/243/#p250\">\n    93 F.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (6th Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As Citizens notes, the SPD language differs from the Benefits Description in several respects. Yet Citizens points to no misrepresentations or material inconsistencies in the SPD. The SPD states: \"[a]ny Plan without a coordinating provision will always be the primary plan and will pay first,\" whereas the Benefits Description contains no such provision. SPD at 119, ECF No. 34-4. First, in the no-fault context, this provision is superfluous. It is tautological to say that a plan without a coordination of benefits provision will not coordinate benefits, but will be primary. Neither the presence nor absence of this provision from the plan documents changes the legal rights of the beneficiaries or insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Furthermore, this provision does not apply to the priority conflict between the TJX Plan and Citizens, as Citizens does indeed have a coordination of benefits provision. Thus, any inconsistency between the SPD and Benefits Description presents no danger that an insured will be misled regarding their right to benefits nor does it \"defeat a reasonable expectation of coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Regents of University of Michigan v. Employees of Agency Rent-A-Car\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302692\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/336/#p339\">\n    122 F.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (6th Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Additionally, Citizens notes that the \"Birthday Rule\" is omitted from the SPD but does appear in the Benefits Description, and that both documents contain inconsistent versions of the priority rule regarding children of separated or divorced parents. These inconsistencies between the SPD and the Benefits Description are immaterial. They do not undermine the Benefits Description's COB, which clearly disavows primary coverage and subordinates itself to no-fault insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To the contrary, when read in its entirety, the SPD actually makes it clearer that the intent of the Benefits Description is to subordinate itself to all no-fault automobile coverage. Specifically, the SPD clarifies the example used in the Benefits Description regarding Massachusetts no-fault law, and makes it clear that the intent of the plan is to subordinate itself to all similar policies, not just Massachusetts no fault policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Your benefits will be adjusted if benefits are payable under another plan ... This includes: ... personal injury protection coverage under Massachusetts G.L. c90, s. 34A and medical payment coverage (\"Medpay Coverage\") under Massachusetts law,\n   <em>\n    or similar provisions of subsequent statutes or statutes of other jurisdictions; and provisions of a motor vehicle, homeowner's, property and casualty or any other insurance policy covering hospital, medical, dental or other health care expenses without regard to fault.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302692\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/336/#p339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The COB provision in the Benefits Description is unambiguous. It is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation, namely that it disavows primary coverage and subordinates itself to no-fault insurance. The Citizens Policy also contains a\n   COB provision that excludes coverage for benefits payable under another plan. Thus, there is an irreconcilable conflict between the Citizens Policy and the TJX Plan. As ERISA preempts the Michigan No-Fault Act, this conflict must be resolved in favor of the TJX Plan, the terms of which \"must be given full effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorn Apple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523940\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/371/#p373\">\n    31 F.3d at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The pleadings on the crossclaims, and the plan and policy documents referenced therein, establish the TJX Plan and BCBSMA's claims as a matter of law, and demonstrate the legal insufficiency of Citizens' claims.

Am. Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 17-3 (17-10826). The Medical Providers claim the following amounts to be due and owing, adjusted for contractual discounts, and exclusive of statutory interest: Mary Free Bed Hospital: $480,055.49 in Facility Charges and $242.97 in psychology charges: MFB Medical Group: $1,618.64; Covenant Medical Center: $216,271.25.

Nor does Citizens identify any other information it wishes to obtain. Rather, Citizens suggests that it simply has not yet reviewed the records: \"In the event that this Court should determine that Defendant Citizens is first in priority, then Citizens would be entitled to examine all of the charges in order to confirm the reasonableness and relatedness of the charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

With respect to penalty interest under M.C.L. 500.3142, the Medical Providers make two arguments: 1) that a no-fault carrier may not rely on a priority defense without subjecting itself to penalty interest, and 2) that penalty interest is automatic, irrespective of good faith, where a no-fault carrier refuses to pay benefits and is later found to be liable. Mot. Summ. J. at 20. The Medical Providers focus on the\n   <em>\n    recoverability\n   </em>\n   of penalty and statutory interest, but not on the question of\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   may recover that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The cases relied upon by the Medical Providers all predate the\n   <em>\n    Covenant\n   </em>\n   decision.

Notably, they point to no language in the assignment agreement purporting to assign them the insured's right to recover statutory or penalty interest.
