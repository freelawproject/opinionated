MIDDLEBROOKS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon the United States' Motion for Default Judgment (\"Motion\") against Defendant Stephen Wise, as Trustee for the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust (\"Defendant\"), filed on January 19, 2018. (DE 23). On September 15, 2017, the Clerk of the Court entered default against Defendant Wise after his failure to answer or otherwise defend the action after being personally served with process on August 10, 2017. (DE 17). As of this date, no answer, motion, or other responsive pleading has been filed and the time to do so has lapsed. The United States' complaint seeks to reduce to judgment the unpaid federal tax liabilities assessed against Rosemarie Ross prior to her death and to foreclose federal tax liens on real property that belonged to Ross but that she transferred to the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust without adequate and full consideration. For reasons stated below, the United States' Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) authorizes a court to enter default judgment against a defendant who fails to plead or otherwise defend.

The assessments were based on the Form 941 return signed and filed by Rosemarie Ross for Wise Temporaries, Inc. for the first quarter of 2005, which showed the amount of tax due and that insufficient federal withholding deposits had been made. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   These assessments are presumed correct.\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

For this reason, this non-taxpayer defendant could not challenge the tax liabilities at issue in this action, which were assessed against another individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since the assessments and notice and demand for payment, neither Rosemarie Ross nor her estate has made payment on her delinquent tax account. The literal transcripts maintained by the IRS show that the unpaid balance of penalty and interest for these years is $597,173.71, plus fees and statutory additions thereon as provided by law from December 31, 2017. (DE 23, Ex. A, Decl. of Amount Due, \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The above-described assessments resulted in tax liens arising against all property and rights to property of Rosemarie Ross on the date of assessment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206321\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Court is authorized to order those liens foreclosed and property of the taxpayer sold under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207403\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 30, 2002, Rosemarie Rose and her then husband Alfred Curtenius purchased the real property located at 5720 SE Miles Grant Road, Stuart, Florida 34997 (\"Grant Road Property\") as tenants by the entireties. Alfred Curtenius died on May 6, 2004, and exclusive ownership of the Grant Road Property vested in Rosemarie Ross on that date as a matter of law. (Compl. \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By quit claim deed recorded in the Martin County land records on December 4, 2007, Rosemarie Ross conveyed legal title to the Grant Road Property to Stephen Wise and James B. Ross, Rosemarie Ross's son and husband, as Trustees of the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust, a sham trust and nominee entity. James B. Ross has since died, leaving Stephen Wise as the sole trustee. (Compl. \u00b6 20). The documentary stamps on the quit claim deed show that only nominal consideration was paid for the property. (Compl. \u00b6 21). Generally, the transfer of property subject to a tax lien under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206321\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is made subject to the tax lien.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In order to defeat the federal tax lien, defendant would have had to achieve the status of \"purchase\" as that term is defined by the Internal Revenue Code, but the lack of adequate and full consideration supporting the transfer prevents the defendant from obtaining this status.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206323\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (h)(6). It necessarily follows that the transfer of the Grant Road Property to the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust is subject to the tax lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The factual assertions in the complaint establish that the penalty and interest at issue were properly assessed and have not been paid. The complaint also establishes that the taxpayer owned the Grant Road Property exclusively in 2006, when the assessment was made, and then transferred title afterward to the defendant without consideration, with the tax liens following the property. These allegations are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Thus, final default judgment against Stephen Wise, as Trustee of the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust is warranted. Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that The United States' Motion for Default Judgment against Stephen Wise, as Trustee of the Rosemarie Curtenius Residential Trust (DE 23) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
