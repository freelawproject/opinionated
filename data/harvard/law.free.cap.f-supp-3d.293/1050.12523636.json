This action addresses whether the EPA's most recent year-long delay in implementation of formaldehyde emission standards exceeds its statutory authority under the Formaldehyde Standards in Composite Wood Products Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202697\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Formaldehyde Act\" or the \"Act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History of the Formaldehyde Standards Act and Agency Regulations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Formaldehyde Act was passed by Congress and signed into law in 2010 and was codified as Title VI of the Toxic Substances Control Act (\"TSCA\") ). The Formaldehyde Act set out emission standards for domestically manufactured and imported composite wood products and the directed the Administrator of the EPA, by no later than July 1, 2013, to promulgate implementing regulations that would ensure compliance with the new emission standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture and fabrication of composite wood products, such as hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard. These products are comprised of wood pieces, chips, particles, and fibers bonded together with formaldehyde-based resin. These composite wood products containing formaldehyde are incorporated into a variety of household products, including paneling, flooring, cabinets, shelving, furniture and countertops.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2089%2C676\">\n    81 Fed.

The carcinogen has been correlated with nasopharyngeal cancer, eye, nose and throat irritation, increased risk of chronic respiratory symptoms, decreased pulmonary function, and\n   increased risk and severity of childhood allergies and asthma.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2089%2C676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the legislative history of the Formaldehyde Act, it is clear that Congress was concerned with severe adverse health effects of formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products following reports of cases of toxicity from storm victims who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Survivors of the storm were housed in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\"). The hastily-manufactured temporary trailers and shelters made of composite wood products were provided to displaced people after the hurricane. The trailers were widely provided to a high number of people in vulnerable populations, especially children, the elderly, and people with preexisting health problems. Worsened by the hot and humid aftermath of the storm, many occupants of the FEMA trailers containing high levels of formaldehyde reported significant adverse health consequences, such as nosebleeds, headaches, eye and skin irritation, asthma and respiratory problems, and other ailments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   156 Cong.

In 2007, following news of adverse health effects caused by the FEMA trailers, CARB approved the Airborne Toxics Control Measure to reduce formaldehyde emissions from hardwood plywood, particleboard, and medium-density fiberboard and finished products made with composite wood products.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2017%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2093120\">\n    Cal.

Advocates such as Plaintiffs and others urged the EPA to adopt the CARB standards on a national basis under the Toxic Substance Control Act. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Fields Decl., Ex. 3.) The EPA declined to adopt the California standards, indicating that it did not have sufficient information to make the necessary findings under the TSCA to regulate exposure to the chemical. The EPA indicated that the California standards could not be adopted nationally under the regulatory authority granted to the EPA by the TSCA, without \"independently determining that formaldehyde in the relevant materials presents or will present an 'unreasonable risk' under [the TSCA].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C507\">\n    73 Fed.

The Formaldehyde Act sought to codify the California standards and to establish national emission standards for acceptable levels of formaldehyde in domestic and imported composite wood products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 111-169, at 1 (2010);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. 111-509, pt. 1, at 7-8 (2010). In the passage of the Act, the House found that \"[f]ormaldehyde is a chemical known to have adverse effects on human health. It has been recognized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a known carcinogen and by the Environmental Protection Agency as both an irritant and a probable human carcinogen.... In addition, inhalation of formaldehyde can cause nose and throat irritation, difficulty breathing, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, and nausea. Other effects include coughing, wheezing, chest pain, bronchitis, and severe allergic reactions.\" H.R. Rep. 111-509, pt. 1, at 7-8 (2010). \"Despite its known harmful effects, formaldehyde is widely\n   used in a variety of applications.

The Act specifically directed the EPA to ensure that, within 180 days after promulgation of its regulations, the new emission standards \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   apply to hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard sold, supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202697\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The requirement of an expeditious compliance date set at 180 days after promulgation of the agency's implementing regulations was a compromise made by Congress to balance both the severe health concerns caused by formaldehyde in wood composite products against the time it would take industry and the agency to adapt to and structure enforcement of the new emission standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 111-169, at 7 (2010) (as originally introduced, the statute would have become effective within 180 days of enactment, but it was amended to provide that the emission standards would become effective 180 days after the date of promulgation of the EPA's regulations, finding that the \"change in the effective date will allow sufficient time for industry to comply with the requirements and sufficient flexibility for EPA to promulgate and implement the regulations.\"). In the passage of the Act, Congress specifically set the tight deadline for compliance with stricter emission standards after regulations were promulgated as an effort both to address the significant adverse health effects of formaldehyde in household wood products and to eliminate the competitive advantage that foreign suppliers who had not been subject to the California standards had in the marketplace. H.R. Rep. No. 111-509, pt. 1, at 7-9 (2010), 14-15; 156 Cong. Rec. H4704 (daily ed. June 23, 2010) (statement of Rep. Matsui).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The sole relevant exception to this mandatory 180-day effective date for enforcement of the stricter emission standards is incorporated in the section of the Act entitled \"sell-through provisions.\" That section addresses the phase-in of the emission standards by establishing, with reference to the date of manufacture, the date at which the stricter standards would apply to the sell-through, or preexisting, inventory of composite wood products. As was made clear in the legislative history, the \"bill before the House today provides greater clarity regarding the actual emission standards that the EPA must promulgate and mandates 'sell-through' provisions that ensure fair treatment for merchants seeking to sell inventory manufactured\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the emission standards take effect.\" 156 Cong.

In passing the Formaldehyde Act, patterned after the California standards, Congress recognized that there must be a phase-in time to allow the sale or use of supplies of composite wood products and finished wood goods already in the pipeline that would not comply with the stricter standards. The CARB rule provided that the transitional phasing out of existing inventory would be designated based on dates of sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20Regs.%20tit.%2017%2C%20%C2%A7%2093120.12\">\n    Cal.

However, following the housing crisis in 2008, noncompliant inventories had not been sold at the rate expected. Accordingly, CARB was compelled to extend the sell-by date multiple times. In contrast, Congress adopted in its sell-through provision the designation of the manufacture date instead of the sale date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Act also provides that stockpiling of inventoried goods and products is forbidden. Stockpiling is defined as the manufacture or purchase of noncompliant wood products between the enactment of the Formaldehyde Act (July 7, 2010) and 180 days after promulgation of the implementing regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202697\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C).

In addition, the new rule re-designated the manufacturing date established by the Formaldehyde Rule to one year later than it had previously. Based on this extension of deadlines, the EPA set both the manufacturing and emission standards compliance dates to December 12, 2018, more than three years after the Formaldehyde Act had originally directed the EPA to require compliance.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044%2C533\">\n    82 Fed.

Accordingly, the current deadline for domestic industry to comply with the emission standards far exceeds the mandatory 180-day deadline after promulgation of the Formaldehyde Rule and years after the Congressional deadline. Plaintiffs contend the Delay Rule is unlawful because it exceeds the EPA's statutory authority under the Formaldehyde Act to ensure compliance with new emission standards expeditiously. Accordingly, by filing this suit, Plaintiffs seek an order declaring the Delay Rule contrary to and in excess of the EPA's authority under the Formaldehyde Act, and request that this Court issue an order vacating and setting aside the year-long extension of the compliance deadlines set out by the EPA's Delay Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Although any reasonable agency interpretation of the statute should be given deference and should not be substituted by the court's own view, the agency's interpretation of the statute must yield to clear congressional intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, the Court must begin by identifying the precise scope of the statutory authority Congress has granted to the EPA by virtue of passing the Formaldehyde Act. The Act explicitly provides that the emission standards shall be made effective no later than 180 days after promulgation of the agency's regulations enforcing the Act. In the section setting out the background and need for legislation, the House specifically indicated that \"[u]nder the bill, the new limits will go into effect 180 days after EPA issues its regulations.\" H.R. Rep. 111-509, pt. 1, at 9 (2010). The language of the bill itself states that \"[e]xcept as provided in an applicable sell-through regulation promulgated pursuant to subsection (d), effective beginning on the date that is 180 days after the date of promulgation of those regulations, the emission standards ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   apply to hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard, and particleboard sold supplied, offered for sale, or manufactured in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202697\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is clear from the legislative history of the statute that Congress was foremost concerned with the expeditious implementation of emission standards designed to protect both the health of vulnerable populations affected by the use of composite wood products as well as domestic manufacturers who were, in large part, compelled to abide by California emissions levels and not able to compete fairly with imported goods that had not been subject to the same manufacturing standards. However, it is clear that Congress also was aware of the need to provide sufficient time for industry to comply with the new standards as well as to address the status of goods that were already in the pipeline at the time the stricter standards would take effect. The expeditious deadline set by Congress in the body of the Act addressed these dueling goals and incorporated flexibility for the EPA to promulgate and implement regulations aimed at enabling industry time to comply with stricter standards as well as to sell off or use existing inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The relevant exception provided in the Act to the short time frame for implementation of the emission standards is the sell-through provision. This provision allows the EPA to designate the date of implementation for industry participants who retain preexisting inventory of composite wood products and finished goods containing regulated products and allows the EPA to designate the inventory sell-through requirements with reference to the date the products were manufactured. The provision states that the date of manufacture \"shall be no earlier than the date 180 days following the promulgation of the regulations pursuant to this subsection.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202697\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The sell-through provision clearly applies to existing inventories and cannot change the effective date set by Congress for mandatory compliance with emission standards governing new production. The parenthetical in the sell-through exception permits the EPA to set the date of manufacture as the designation to determine the universe of inventory of noncompliant wood products to be sold and used until the inventories ran out. In order to give meaning to the provisions of the Formaldehyde Act which require timely compliance with the new emission standards and prohibit stockpiling, the universe of eligible inventories must not continue to accrue after the 180 days following promulgation of the Formaldehyde Rule. Accordingly, the Court finds that the designation of a manufacturing date \"no earlier than 180 days following promulgation of the regulations\" found in the sell-through provision of the Formaldehyde Act must fall on the 180th day after the regulations take effect. The EPA's interpretation to set the manufacture date beyond 180 days from promulgation of their regulations and thereby resetting the compliance date accordingly violates the Act's mandatory expedient compliance deadline and the prohibition against stockpiling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Court owes deference to the EPA's interpretation of the statute, the Court is compelled to give meaning to the statutory provisions and cannot endorse an interpretation that permits the EPA to exercise its authority \" 'in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p125\">\n    529 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p125\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    ETSI Pipeline Project,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600427\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/495/#p517\">\n    484 U.S. at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"600427\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/495/#p517\">\n    108 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"[A]n administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/#p125\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The clear purpose of the Act and the plain meaning of its core provisions was to set expeditious emission compliance standards (not to exceed 180 days past the promulgation of implementing regulations) and to allow the sell off or use of preexisting noncompliant inventory but to prohibit stockpiling. This clear purpose and plain meaning cannot be reconciled with the EPA's suggestion that a year-long extension of the designated date of manufacture in the sell-through provisions permissibly leads to a commensurate year-long extension of the mandatory compliance deadlines. The EPA's interpretation creates inconsistency within the full text of the Act, renders the 180-day compliance deadline superfluous, leads to the absurd result of permitting the perpetual delay of the effectiveness of the Formaldehyde Rule, and fails to satisfy the stated purpose of the Act.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. Br., Ex. H.)

But \"even if a party may be deemed not to have raised a particular argument before the agency, EPA retains a duty to examine key assumptions as part of its affirmative burden of promulgating and explaining a nonarbitrary, non-capricious rule and therefore ...
