Plaintiffs bring claims arising under state law as well as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 2). Presently before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 55). For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is granted with respect to Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims, and the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The summary judgment evidence shows the following facts, which are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 30, 2008, Decedent tragically killed himself after a standoff with police. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 1; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 1). At the time of his suicide, Decedent was snorting OxyContin daily. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 17; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 17). Decedent was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and he suffered from panic attacks. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14). At the time of his death, Decedent was not taking his medications for his bipolar disorder. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 13; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 13). Leading up to his suicide, Decedent was depressed and was spiraling out of control. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 18; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 18). During a domestic dispute between Decedent and Plaintiff Toni Briggs, Decedent's wife, about his drug use, Toni asked Decedent to leave. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-23). Decedent stated, \"If that's the way you feel about it, you'll never have to worry about me again.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 24; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 24). Decedent grabbed and loaded his shotgun, stating, \"You wanted this, this is what you want.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 25; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 25). Decedent then went into a rage and began loading multiple guns; Toni believed that Decedent was going to shoot himself. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27). Decedent told Toni, \"Get out of here; you don't want to see this.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 28; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 6:40 PM, Toni called 911 because she was afraid that Decedent would kill himself. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). She informed the operator that Decedent was \"in the bedroom with a gun-says it's a long gun [and] cocked\"; the operator could hear Decedent yelling in the background. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 31; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 31). At 6:43 PM, the operator heard Decedent \"yelling that he's gonna shoot the cops if they come.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 33; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 33). Decedent pointed a gun at his throat, and then at Toni, saying, \"This is it for both of us.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b636-38). Before Toni left the apartment, Decedent was pulling more guns out of the closet and loading them. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ogden police officers and a Monroe County sergeant, Sgt. Bums, and sheriff's deputy, Deputy McKenzie, were dispatched to the scene. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-44; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-44). Upon their arrival, Plaintiff Toni Briggs said to law enforcement, \"You have to help my husband, he's suicidal, he's got [bipolar], mental issues,\" and informed them that Decedent had firearms. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 49-50). Toni informed the officers that Decedent had a drug problem and was snorting OxyContin. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 52; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 52). Sgt. Burns requested activation of the MCSO SWAT team and the Hostage Rescue Team (\"HRT\"). (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 55-56; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 55-56). The HRT's mission is to establish communication and negotiate a peaceful resolution of the situation. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 84; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 84). Sgt. Burns also attempted to call out to Decedent about six times, yelling, \"Police Department, we'd like to talk to you,\" but Decedent did not\n   respond. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 58; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The officers remained in the apartment building on the inner perimeter until relieved by the SWAT team to ensure that Decedent remained in his apartment. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 59-60). On at least two occasions, the officers could hear Decedent loading firearms through the apartment door and could hear Decedent on the telephone sounding upset. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63). The officers evacuated the building because of public safety concerns, but they maintained the inner perimeter during the evacuation to ensure that Decedent stayed in his apartment. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66). SWAT members then replaced the officers on the inner perimeter of the apartment building, and other law enforcement officers established an outer perimeter. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 71-72). Lt. Fowler, the SWAT Commander on the day of the incident, arrived on the scene at about 7:02 PM. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 77; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 77). The SWAT Commander has sole responsibility for tactical command at any incident where SWAT is summoned. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 78; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 78). At the scene of an incident, if different units are deployed to the scene, the units report to their own commanders, and each unit commander reports to the incident commander. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 87; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The HRT also arrived, readied the rescue phone, and gave it to the SWAT team to deliver. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 96, 107-09; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 96, 107-09). HRT operating procedures provide that \"suspect(s) should be isolated as quickly as possible,\" which includes \"[i]solating or diverting the phone service, including ... hard line phones, cell phones, cable modems, and cable phone access.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 113; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 113). It is common practice to isolate the individual's telephone line so that only law enforcement can speak with the individual. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 116; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 116). HRT sought to isolate Decedent's phone line but was unsuccessful. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 117; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 117). As a result. Decedent's family members who had arrived on the scene continued to speak with Decedent by telephone. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 117; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Various family members, including Plaintiff Eunice Briggs (Decedent's mother), Decedent's sister, Lori Briggs, and Decedent's father, arrived at the complex shortly after 7:00 PM. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 151; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 151). Law enforcement sequestered family members in a vacant apartment, out of the view of Decedent's apartment, and had them remain there or in its immediate vicinity. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 153; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 153). Two MCSO deputies remained with the family. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 154; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 154). Law enforcement would not allow Lori Briggs to go to Decedent's apartment. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 155; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 155). While Lori was sequestered in the vacant apartment, Decedent called her cell phone and asked to speak with Plaintiff Toni Briggs, but law enforcement would not let Toni speak with Decedent. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 156-57; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 156-57). Law enforcement warned family members that if they continued to contact Decedent via telephone, Decedent's phone line would be terminated. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 159; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 159). Later, Lori telephoned Decedent again, and a hostage negotiator \"yelled at\" her, saying she should not be speaking with him. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 161; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At about 8:42 PM, law enforcement terminated Decedent's telephone line. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 118-122; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 118-122). To communicate with Decedent after his phone line was terminated, HRT and the SWAT team decided to use a rescue\n   phone, which is a 1-foot by 1-foot box with a sign on it that reads \"telephone inside, pick it up\" and has a buzzer. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 123, 125; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 123, 125). The SWAT team delivered the rescue phone to Decedent's apartment by lowering it from the roof to Decedent's balcony. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 131; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 131). After delivering the rescue phone, law enforcement attempted to contact Decedent, but Decedent never retrieved the rescue phone or spoke with law enforcement. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 136; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 136). At 10:50 PM, SWAT members made several announcements, using the public address system, for Decedent to retrieve the phone. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 137; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 137). When the announcements were made, Decedent turned up the music in his apartment. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 138; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At 10:53 PM, after attempts to contact Decedent had failed, law enforcement heard a gunshot. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 141; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 141). At about 11:01 PM, after further attempts to get Decedent to retrieve the rescue phone, law enforcement deployed CTS gas rounds into Decedent's apartment, and then waited 12 minutes before entering. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 143-47; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 143-47). Upon entry, the SWAT team discovered that Decedent was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 148; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs were not in the apartment when Decedent shot himself and did not observe Decedent shoot himself. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 170). Plaintiff Toni Briggs did not witness or hear the rescue phone delivery, Decedent's suicidal gunshot, or the law enforcement actions that followed the gunshot. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 168-70; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 168-70). Defendants were not inside Decedent's apartment when he shot himself; they made no promises to Decedent on March 30, 2008; they had no conversations with him on that date; and Decedent was not in custody at the time of his death. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 171-74; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 171-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties' sole factual dispute concerns the activities and involvement of Sheriff O'Flynn on March 30, 2008. Defendants contend that Sheriff O'Flynn was not personally involved in making decisions or taking actions regarding the following alleged acts or omissions: (1) that Defendants should have attempted to begin negotiations with Decedent sooner than they did; (2) that Defendants should not have terminated Decedent's phone line; (3) that Defendants should have allowed family members to communicate with Decedent; (4) that Defendants should not have used the rescue phone but instead should have attempted to communicate with Decedent by another means; (5) that SWAT personnel should not have delivered the rescue phone; (6) that the rescue phone should not have been lowered from the roof to the balcony; and (7) that SWAT team members should not have made the announcement asking Decedent to retrieve the rescue phone. (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 176). Plaintiffs dispute Defendants' contention that Sheriff O'Flynn was not personally involved (Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 176), stating that Sheriff O'Flynn went to the scene of the incident to supervise the actions of his agents and to ensure that the situation was properly handled, and that he stated to Plaintiff Toni Briggs, \"[D]on't worry, everything is under control; we're doing everything we can to help [Decedent]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 30, 2009, Plaintiffs commenced this action against the County, MCSO, and Sheriff O'Flynn in his official and individual capacities, alleging claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and various state laws arising out of the March 30, 2008, incident. (Dkt. 1). The operative complaint\n   is Plaintiff's amended complaint, filed on June 26, 2009. (Dkt. 2). Plaintiffs initially named twelve defendants. Seven defendants-the Town of Ogden, the Ogden Police Department, various officials with the Ogden Police Department, and Sergeant Thomas Burns-were dismissed by stipulation. (Dkt. 25; Dkt. 39). The case was then referred to United States Magistrate Judge Marian W. Payson pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) and (B) for supervision of pretrial non-dispositive matters. (Dkt. 5). On April 17, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. (Dkt. 42). Plaintiffs sought court permission to remove two more defendants-MCSCO Deputies Shannon and Mackenzie-and to add four employees of MCSO as defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 29, 2016, Judge Payson issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that the motion for leave to amend be granted in part and denied in part. (Dkt. 48). Judge Payson recommended that Plaintiffs' motion be granted insofar as it sought dismissal of the claims against Shannon and Mackenzie, and denied to the extent that Plaintiffs sought leave to amend to add four new defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23). This Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in its entirety on October 18, 2016. (Dkt. 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 29, 2016, the three remaining defendants-the County, MCSO, and Sheriff O'Flynn-filed a motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 55). Plaintiffs responded on April 14, 2017. (Dkt. 64). Defendants filed reply papers on April 25, 2017. (Dkt. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment should be granted if the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Plaintiffs distinguish\n   <em>\n    Cutlip\n   </em>\n   , arguing that in that case, the responding police officers engaged in negotiations with the decedent for two hours, whereas here, law enforcement made a show of force outside Decedent's apartment, refused his requests to talk with them, and prevented his family from contacting him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Plaintiffs contend that, given Decedent's fear that he would be shot by the police, their refusal to disabuse him of that notion was the functional equivalent of placing him in custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Cutlip.\n   </em>\n   Here, it is undisputed that law enforcement sought to prevent Decedent from leaving his apartment. In their statement of undisputed facts, Defendants state that officers \"remained in [Decedent's apartment] building to secure the inner perimeter and\n   <em>\n    ensure Decedent remained in his apartment.\n   </em>\n   \" and that they \"maintained the inner perimeter during the evacuation [of the building] because they wanted to\n   <em>\n    ensure Decedent stayed in his apartment\n   </em>\n   while they evacuated the building.\" (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 60, 66). Officers also maintained an outer perimeter \"comprised [of] people surrounding all four sides of the apartment building for containment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73). Furthermore, as Plaintiffs note, law enforcement terminated Decedent's telephone line so that he could no longer communicate with friends and family members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 111-122). In\n   <em>\n    Cutlip,\n   </em>\n   there was no suggestion that law enforcement\n   had taken similar steps to confine the decedent or to similarly restrain his liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case is more similar to\n   <em>\n    Christiansen v.

Plaintiffs also acknowledge that law enforcement attempted to make contact with Decedent through a rescue phone (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 136; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 136), as well as by calling out to Decedent six times (Dkt. 55-1 at \u00b6 58; Dkt. 64-2 at \u00b6 58), but Decedent did not engage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the Court has already concluded that neither the special relationship nor the state-created danger exception applies, the Court also concludes that, even if one of those exceptions did apply, Defendants' conduct does not shock the conscience. There is no suggestion that Defendants intended to cause harm to Plaintiffs or Decedent. Although Plaintiffs contend that Defendants took the wrong approach to diffusing the situation, they do not argue that Defendants acted maliciously.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , Defendants did not worsen Decedent's position. They responded to reports of a suicidal individual and made efforts to save Decedent while protecting the safety of bystanders. Defendants' conduct does not shock the conscience. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is therefore granted with respect to Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     New York State Law Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs also assert claims arising under New York state law for wrongful death, negligence, loss of consortium (Plaintiff Toni Briggs only), intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress as to Decedent, negligent infliction of emotional distress as to Toni Briggs, and negligent training, retention, and supervision. (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 68-122).

The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In the instant case, discovery has been completed and the parties' positions on summary judgment have been thoroughly briefed. This Court has not, however, previously ruled on any motion affecting the merits, and the state law issues differ substantially from the two federal issues decided herein. Therefore, the benefit of the pretrial proceedings already conducted will not be lost if the case is remanded, and the factors of judicial economy and convenience do not weigh significantly for or against remand. Refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction will not result in unfairness, particularly because the action was commenced in state court and plaintiff will not be required to bring a new action. Most importantly, the factor of comity favors remand. The remaining claims concern quintessentially state-law matters.... As the Second Circuit recently noted, \"concerns of comity and of federalism ... encourage remanding to the state courts cases in which state court adjudication can properly claim primacy of interest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064176\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/54/186/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064176\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/54/186/\">\n    at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sunnen v.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   , discovery has been completed and the parties have briefed the state law claims, but the Court has not ruled on a dispositive motion, and the state law issues are significantly different from the federal \u00a7 1983 claims. Although the case did not arise in state court, the Court concludes that exercising supplement jurisdiction over the state law claims would be inappropriate. Plaintiffs' state law claims are numerous-Plaintiffs raise claims under state law for wrongful death, negligence, loss of consortium, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligent training, retention, and supervision. (Dkt. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 68-122). Those claims are not so straightforward as to weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction, in the interest of judicial economy. The Court concludes that the balance of factors weighs against exercising supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 55) is granted in part and denied in part. The motion is granted with respect to Plaintiffs' claims under \u00a7 1983, and those claims are dismissed with prejudice. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims arising under New York state law. Accordingly, those claims are also dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiffs originally named 12 defendants, but nine of those defendants have since been dismissed from this action.
