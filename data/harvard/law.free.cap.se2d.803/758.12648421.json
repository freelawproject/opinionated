Torrent (\"Torrent\"), challenge in these consolidated appeals of right the decision of the State Corporation Commission (\"Commission\") upholding the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1. This statute suspended the Commission's biennial base rate reviews for Appalachian Power Company (APCO) and Virginia Electric and Power Company, d/b/a Dominion Virginia Power (\"Dominion Power\") under Code \u00a7 56-585.1 until the years 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Old Dominion's Petition Challenging Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Old Dominion, an association of large industrial customers of APCO, filed a petition asking the Commission for: (a) a declaratory\n   judgment that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 violates Article IX, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution of Virginia and, accordingly, that APCO is required under Code \u00a7 56-585.1 to make biennial review filings in 2016 and 2018; and (b) an order directing APCO to make such filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the petition, Old Dominion asserted that even though the Commission's constitutional authority to regulate electric utility rates under Article IX, \u00a7 2 is expressly \"[s]ubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law,\" this provision does not grant to the General Assembly the power to transfer the Commission's ratemaking authority to itself. While giving the General Assembly \"wide latitude to determine the standards that must be used by the Commission in regulating rates,\" according to Old Dominion, \"the Constitution reserves for the Commission-and the Commission alone-the power to set electric utility rates.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks in petition omitted.) \"By suspending biennial reviews and prohibiting the Commission from changing base rates (except at the utility's request, on a temporary basis, in emergencies),\" Old Dominion argued, Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 unconstitutionally \"fixes the base rates that a utility will charge its customers for a period well into the future, and deprives the Commission of any power to reduce or otherwise regulate those rates.\" In other words, \"[i]t leaves the Commission utterly powerless to protect customers from unfair and unreasonable base rates, even when the rates are designed to provide significant excess revenues for the utility and its shareholders.\" By doing so, the statute, in Old Dominion's view, unconstitutionally prohibits the Commission from discharging \"its constitutional power and duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After Old Dominion filed the petition, VML, comprised of representatives of local governments and other political subdivisions in Virginia located within APCO's service area, and Torrent, a Virginia residential customer of Dominion Power proceeding pro se, among others, filed responses with the Commission in support of Old Dominion, making the same argument that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 is unconstitutional under Article IX, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Attorney General of Virginia, APCO, and Dominion Power filed responses with the Commission opposing Old Dominion's\n   petition, arguing that the statute is constitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These respondents asserted that the plain language of Article IX, \u00a7 2 clearly and unambiguously subordinates the Commission's ratemaking authority to limitations established by the General Assembly. They argued that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 is, indeed, no different in effect than the limitations imposed upon the Commission's ratemaking authority under Code \u00a7 56-585.1's biannual regulatory regime-which Old Dominion was in fact seeking in its petition to enforce. They also pointed to other such legislation, emphasizing in particular the General Assembly's deregulation of certain electric utilities in 1999 that capped base rates for seven years. Furthermore, they asserted, this Court's decision\n   in\n   <em>\n    VEPCO\n   </em>\n   controls. There, this Court held that the subject-to-such-requirements language in Article IX, \u00a7 2, clause 3, is \"clear and unambiguous\" in subordinating the authority of the Commission to regulate electric rates \"to the power of the General Assembly to command otherwise.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120108\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/214/457/#p463\">\n    214 Va. at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C. Commission's Final Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Concluding that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 is constitutional under Article IX, \u00a7 2, the Commission issued a final order denying Old Dominion's petition, to which Commissioner Dimitri dissented. The dissent discussed extensively what it views as the statute's negative public policy outcomes. The Commission rejected the public policy arguments against the statute made by Old Dominion, the dissent and others, as immaterial. The Commission focused instead on the purely legal issue of whether Old Dominion had carried its burden of overcoming the presumption in favor of the statute's constitutionality-which the Commission acknowledged is among the strongest presumptions in Virginia law. Thus, its \"duty in this case,\" the Commission explained, \"is to decide the legal question of constitutionality without regard to our public-policy preferences and not to conflate the two.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Commission reasoned that the temporary base rate freeze under Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 on the base rates it had previously set for\n   APCO and Dominion is \"not unprecedented and must be considered in light of [this] Court's unequivocal instruction that any alleged unconstitutionality must be clear and palpable and that any reasonable doubt renders the statute constitutionally valid.\" As such, the Commission determined, this temporary rate base freeze \"can reasonably be considered [as falling] within the 'criteria and other requirements' \" that may be prescribed by the General Assembly under Article IX, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Commission expressly rejected the theory implicit in the arguments made by Old Dominion, the dissent and other proponents of the petition challenging Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 to the effect that Article IX, \u00a7 2\"grants to the Commission a plenary power to legislate that is both\n   <em>\n    exclusive of\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    superior to\n   </em>\n   , that of the General Assembly. Under this theory, the General Assembly apparently can enact purely\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    not substantive\n   </em>\n   , criteria and requirements, or it can enact some substantive criteria and requirements as long as they don't cross a line, which is neither clearly located or defined.\" (Emphases in original.) In any event, while under this theory the General Assembly \"can 'prescribe' how the Commission regulates rates,\" it \"cannot 'remove' the rate-setting authority.\" Based on such a test, the Commission explained, numerous ratemaking related legislative enactments prior to Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 would have been unconstitutional-with no limiting principle having been proposed. This would include the 1999 Virginia Electric Utility Restructuring Act's removal of the Commission's authority to set rates for electric utilities in favor of deregulation. That legislation would have been unconstitutional because \"the General Assembly could never make the\n   <em>\n    public policy\n   </em>\n   decision to deregulate services of the types of companies listed in Article IX, \u00a7 2 [i.e., railroad, telephone, gas and electric companies] by removing the Commission's authority to set the rates for such services and thereby allowing prices to be set by the market.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Eschewing this interpretation of Article IX, \u00a7 2, the Commission concluded \"[t]here is no historical evidence that those who adopted the 1971 Constitution intended such a grant of plenary policy-making power to the Commission,\" quoting as support for its conclusion\n   <em>\n    VEPCO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120108\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/214/457/#p463\">\n    214 Va. at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he authority of the [Commission] ... is\n   <em>\n    subordinate\n   </em>\n   to the power of\n   the General Assembly to command otherwise.\"), and\n   <em>\n    Potomac Elec.

Thus, the Commission deduced, the proponents \"would have us return to ground that [their] own argument, if accepted, would render infirm,\" thereby undermining the logic of their challenge to Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.

The Court held that it did not for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the Court rejected VEPCO's assertion that the clause \"[s]ubject to such criteria and other requirements as prescribed by law\" merely reserved to the General Assembly the power to prescribe procedural rules for the Commission. The Court noted that Article IX, \u00a7 3 expressly provided that \"[t]he Commission may prescribe its own rules of practice and procedure not inconsistent with those made by the General Assembly. The General Assembly shall have the power to adopt such rules, to amend, modify, or set aside the Commission's rules, or to substitute rules of its own.\" The Court held that if the \"subject to\" clause from Article IX, \u00a7 2 meant only that the General Assembly could prescribe procedural rules for the Commission, as VEPCO argued, the \"subject to\" clause and the \"rules of practice and procedure\" sentences in Article IX, \u00a7 3 would be redundant, and such an interpretation is impermissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 464-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, it rejected VEPCO's assertion that Article IX, \u00a7 2 allowed the General Assembly to overrule the Commission when it came to the regulation of railroad, telephone, gas, and electric\n   <em>\n    facilities\n   </em>\n   , but not when it came to regulating their rates, charges,\n   and services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regarding the Commission's regulation of rates, charges, and services, VEPCO argued, the Constitution permitted the General Assembly only to dictate \"the method\" by which the Commission acted. The Court disagreed and held that what VEPCO described as \" 'the method' \" was fully encompassed by the words \"[s]ubject to such criteria ... as may be prescribed by law,\" which, again, would impermissibly make the words \"and other requirements\" redundant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 465,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 776-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   that \"the authority of the [Commission] to regulate the rates charged by electric companies ... is subordinate to the power of the General Assembly to command otherwise,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 465,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is the foundation for the majority's holding today that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 does not contravene Article IX, \u00a7 2. The majority's position is certainly reasonable:\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   is long-established precedent. Nevertheless, I believe it was wrongly decided. Upon careful consideration, I conclude that VEPCO was correct in 1974 when it asserted that the Commission's constitutional authority to set electric rates could not be superseded by statute. Because the Court's error is one of constitutional interpretation, stare decisis must yield to a detailed re-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The principal defect in the\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   decision is its selective view of which provisions\n   would be impermissibly made redundant. For example, by choosing to reject VEPCO's second argument because it would (in the Court's view) give the words \"criteria\" and \"requirements\" the same meaning and thereby impermissibly make them redundant, the Court ruled that \"any difference between [the 'subject to' clause and the 'except as' clauses] becomes insubstantial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 465,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the Court adopted the position that the \"subject to\" and \"except as\" clauses had the same meaning-and therefore were redundant-but that the words \"criteria\" and \"requirements\" could not have the same meaning because they would then be impermissibly made redundant. This interpretation is indefensible.\n   \"It is a general rule that the words of a Constitution are to be understood in the sense in which they are popularly employed, unless the context or the very nature of the subject indicates otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

It does not mean that the General Assembly may suspend that power and duty. By contrast, the \"except as\" clause (which is also unambiguous)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   permit the General Assembly to eliminate or reassign the Commission's power and duty to regulate\n   <em>\n    facilities.\n   </em>\n   Read in context, the meaning of the two clauses is clear. First, \"[s]ubject to such [standards] and other [prerequisites] as may be prescribed by law, the Commission shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating the rates, charges, and services ... of\n   railroad, telephone, gas, and electric companies.\" Second, \"the Commission shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating\" \"the facilities of railroad, telephone, gas, and electric companies,\" \"except as may be otherwise authorized by this Constitution or by general law.\" Because these two clauses have different meanings and effects, they cannot be redundant. The Court therefore erred in\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   by giving them the same meaning. It was incorrect in light of both the plain meaning of the words used and the structure of the sentence. Making them redundant is also impermissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, the \"subject to\" clause in Article IX, \u00a7 2 has a different meaning and effect from the \"rules of practice and procedure\" sentences in Article IX, \u00a7 3. \"Such criteria and other requirements\" are not the same as \"rules of practice and procedure.\" \"Criteria and other requirements\" to engage in rate-making are obligations\n   <em>\n    the Commission\n   </em>\n   must satisfy; \"rules of practice and procedure\" include obligations\n   <em>\n    those appearing before the Commission\n   </em>\n   must satisfy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This substantive difference between Article IX, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 is illustrated by comparing the actual requirements set out in \u00a7 156(b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   of the Constitution of 1902 and the Commission's current rules of practice and procedure. The former provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [b]efore the commission shall prescribe or fix any rate, charge, or classification of traffic, and before it shall make any order, rule, regulation or requirement directed against any one or more companies by name, the company or companies to be affected by such rate, charge, classification, order, rule, regulation or requirement, shall first be given, by the commission, at least ten days' notice of the time and place, when and where the contemplated action in the premises will be considered and disposed of, and shall be afforded, a reasonable opportunity to introduce evidence and to be heard thereon, to the end that justice may be done, and shall have process to enforce the attendance of witnesses....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Constitution of Virginia \u00a7 156(b) (1902).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This requirement has now been reduced to an obligation to provide \"reasonable notice of the time and place at which [a party] shall be afforded an opportunity to introduce evidence and be heard.\" Va. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 3. It is certainly within the General Assembly's Article IX, \u00a7 2 power to require by statute that such \"reasonable notice\" consist of at least ten days' notice, as the former constitution did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   By contrast, the Commission's rules of practice and procedure require, for example, that \"[e]ach document must be filed on standard size white opaque paper, 8-\u00bd by 11 inches in dimension, must be capable of being reproduced in copies of archival quality, and only one side of the paper may be used. Submissions filed electronically shall be made in portable document format (PDF).\" 5 VAC \u00a7 5-20-150. This obligation is imposed on those who file documents with the Commission, not on the Commission itself. Thus, while \"rules of practice and procedure\" may also include \"criteria and other requirements,\" the former address more subjects and in greater detail than the latter, and they operate on different objects. Thus, because the \"subject to\" clause in Article IX, \u00a7 2 does not have the same meaning as the \"rules of practice and\n   procedure\" sentences in Article IX, \u00a7 3 when examined in context, they cannot be impermissibly made redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Consequently,\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided because both pillars of its rationale are flawed.

Therefore, in both cases, the Commission's rate-making authority was conferred directly by the Constitution of 1902 through \u00a7 156(b). It was not contingent on a delegation or grant of authority from the legislature to set rates for other utilities by statute under \u00a7 156(c), unlike\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1955\n   </em>\n   , which involved an electric company.

The Commission on Constitutional Revision (\"the CCR\") affirmatively acted in 1969 to draft a constitution that elevated the Commission's authority over electric rates from a power merely delegated by the General Assembly to one with a direct constitutional foundation (like the Commission's authority over telephone and railway rates under the Constitution of 1902). It noted that the Commission lacked direct constitutional authority to set the rates of \"companies furnishing gas and electricity, two of the most vital services provided to citizens of Virginia.\" Report of the Commission on Constitutional Revision 285 (1969). It proposed that the Commission \"be given exclusive and paramount jurisdiction\n   to regulate the rates, charges, and services of\" such companies, just as it had existing authority over railroad and telephone companies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20S.E.2d%20139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Article IX, \u00a7 2 unquestionably places electric rates on equal footing with railroad and telephone rates. Consequently, whatever rate-making power the Commission has derives directly from the people, who adopted the Constitution of 1971, and cannot be only \"delegated by the General Assembly.\" Therein lies the error in relying on a case that predates the Constitution of 1971 without examining its foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority notes that the General Assembly altered the CCR's draft by adding the \"subject to\" clause to Article IX, \u00a7 2. Relying on\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   , it holds that this clause subordinates the Commission's rate-making authority to the General Assembly. But reflect for a moment on the implication of that holding. It means that rather than\n   <em>\n    elevating\n   </em>\n   the Commission's authority over electric rates to a direct constitutional foundation equal to that it already\n   had over railroad and telephone rates under \u00a7 156(b) of the Constitution of 1902, the Constitution of 1971 instead\n   <em>\n    diminished\n   </em>\n   the Commission's authority over railroad and telephone rates to a mere statutory foundation like that it had over electric rates under \u00a7 156(c) of the Constitution of 1902. In other words, the majority's holding turns Article IX, \u00a7 2 upside-down, allowing the Commission to set railroad and telephone rates only with the legislature's indulgence, in effect eliminating the Commission's independence as the \"additional\" branch of government recognized in\n   <em>\n    C&amp;P\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; Western.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Surely, if that seismic result had truly been the intention of the General Assembly when it appended the \"subject to\" clause to the CCR's draft of Article IX, \u00a7 2, there would be\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   mention of it in the record of its proceedings and debates. Yet the only mention of the clause or reason for adding it to the draft was made by Senator Edward L. Breeden, Jr., of Norfolk, chairman of the Committee on Insurance and Banking that proposed the amendment. He said that the intention was \"to give legislative control over the\n   <em>\n    general aspects\n   </em>\n   of rate-making.\" Proceedings and Debates for the Senate of Virginia Pertaining to the Amendment of the Constitution 269 (Extra Session 1969, Regular Session 1970) (emphasis added). This slender reed will not bear the weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing-not the language in the CCR's report, the language on the floor, or the language in Article IX, \u00a7 2 as adopted by the people-supports the dramatic result to which the majority's holding inexorably leads: that the General Assembly intended to\n   <em>\n    weaken\n   </em>\n   the Commission's longstanding, pre-existing power over railroad and telephone rates rather than\n   <em>\n    strengthen\n   </em>\n   its power over electric rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I agree with the majority that the Commission has no authority to act simply because it is mentioned in the Constitution. To the contrary, as the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo, LLC v. Meeks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20Va.%20286\">\n    286 Va. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20S.E.2d%20176\">\n    749 S.E.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"its jurisdiction must be found either in constitutional grants or in statutes which do not contravene that document.\" But Article IX, \u00a7 2 does more than merely mention\n   or create the Commission; it vests the Commission with power to set rates. The General Assembly need do nothing for the Commission to exercise this power, granted by the people. Consequently, it is not \"delegated by the General Assembly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C. IF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN SUSPEND THE COMMISSION'S RATE-MAKING POWERS FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS, IT CAN SUSPEND THEM FOREVER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   If it is true, as the majority holds, that the Commission's rate-making authority is \"subordinate to the power of the General Assembly,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at ---- (quoting\n   <em>\n    VEPCO 1974\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2120108\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/214/457/#p463\">\n    214 Va. at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20S.E.2d%20771\">\n    201 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   777 ), then the General Assembly has the power to permanently divest the Commission of that power at will. That sobering outcome thwarts the\n   purpose behind creating the Commission in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As the Court acknowledged in 1920, before the Constitution of 1902 created the Commission \"the State, through the legislature, certainly had plenary power over the rates of all public service corporations, but the power had never been exercised. The avowed purpose of the convention, known to all, was to exercise the dormant power of the State for the control of such corporations. It provided for the organization of the commission, and made it the governmental department of the State for the exercise of such powers.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Richmond v.

At oral argument, the Commonwealth repeatedly avoided the issue of whether the asserted \"subordination\" of the Commission to the General Assembly allowed the legislature to do so. It reiterated that its position was solely that Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 merely froze the existing rates set by the Commission, in effect suspending the Commission's rate-making power. But if Article IX, \u00a7 2 confers on the General Assembly the power to suspend the Commission's authority, there is no limit to the duration for which such a suspension may last. Thus, this interpretation restores the precise evil that led the people to create the Commission in 1902; they did so to ensure that\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   was exercising the power to set the rates of public service corporations. The conclusion that the General Assembly has the power to\n   suspend the Commission's authority indefinitely, which follows inexorably from the majority's opinion, would thwart that will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Commonwealth responded at oral argument that if some limiting principle were required to prevent the General Assembly from suspending the Commission's authority for too long, democracy was the limiting principle-i.e., that the voters would reprimand the legislature. The majority adopts this aphorism as its answer, too. Together, they seem to envision that after some period of sufficient duration, a majority of voters in a majority of the districts will revolt, uniting under the banner that the Commission's authority must be restored, and secure a bicameral legislative majority to compel that outcome. Despite having been previously elected to legislative office, I cannot begin to speculate how many years would have to pass before the esoteric issue of the Commission's constitutional authority to set rates rose to predominate over other public policy issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   But more to the point, the people already have endured a period of legislative inaction in the field of rate-making. They spoke clearly against it when they created the Commission in 1902. They granted the Commission rate-making authority over railroads and telephone companies then, and expanded that power to include electric companies in 1971. Nothing in the text or history of Article IX, \u00a7 2 counsels otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   D. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For these reasons, I reject the conclusion that the Commission's rate-making authority is subordinate to the General Assembly. The clear and unambiguous language of Article IX, \u00a7 2 allows the legislature to control the general aspects of rate-making by establishing, by statute, standards and prerequisites for the Commission's exercise of its constitutional power. Article IX, \u00a7 2 does not empower the General Assembly to suspend the Commission's rate-making authority, whether for one year or forever. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority's holding to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    VEPCO argued that the words \"except as may be otherwise authorized by the Constitution or by general law, the facilities of railroad, telephone, gas, and electric companies\" expressly permitted the General Assembly to supersede the Commission's authority to regulate facilities by statute, so the \"subject to\" clause at the beginning of the sentence could not have the same effect on the Commission's authority to regulate \"rates, charges, and services.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The majority's conclusion that \"[a] law suspending the Commission's\" rate-making process \"fits comfortably\" within the definition of \"requirement,\"\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 765, is unclear to me. Even accepting the majority's alternative definition of \"requirement,\" Code \u00a7 56-585.1:1 does not impose some condition that the Commission must fulfill before it sets rates. There is no requirement or prerequisite that the Commission may satisfy in order to proceed to setting rates. To the contrary, the statute simply prohibits the Commission from setting rates, regardless of what it does first.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    This interpretation shows that VEPCO was incorrect to argue that the \"subject to\" clause merely empowered the General Assembly to establish rules of practice and procedure. However, it also illustrates that the Court went too far in rejecting VEPCO's mistaken interpretation.
