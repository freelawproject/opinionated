(Child). Ashburn argues it is no longer equitable that the paternity order, wherein Ashburn acknowledged paternity of Child, have prospective application because genetic tests show Ashburn is not Child's biological father. He also argues the family court failed to (1) conduct an analysis on the potential adverse impact of the determination on the public interest and (2) consider the best interests of Child. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ashburn and April Rogers (Mother) were involved in a relationship lasting from late 1999 to early 2000. Mother became pregnant during this time and she gave birth to Child in October 2000. Ashburn is Caucasian, Mother is African-American, and Child is biracial. Mother informed Ashburn that he was the only Caucasian with whom she had been intimate. At the time, Ashburn was enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and stationed at Parris Island in Beaufort, South Carolina. Ashburn did not attend Child's birth and did not visit Child until the Marine Corps required him to when Child was seven months old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, Ashburn was served with an Administrative Process Notice of Financial Responsibility and Paternity Determination, and an administrative conference was held on\n   March 28, 2001. Although Ashburn was given the opportunity to request genetic testing at the conference, he waived it. The family court prepared an Administrative Process Order of Financial Responsibility that Ashburn and Mother signed. The order required Ashburn to pay $100.00 semi-monthly in child support. In the order, Ashburn admitted to being the natural father; the order states \"[non-custodial parent] freely and voluntarily acknowledged paternity\" of Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2002, Ashburn signed an agreement with the Department of Social Services (DSS) requesting genetic testing, but he failed to submit a sample. In 2003, Ashburn was re-stationed in Japan, and contact ceased between Ashburn, Mother, and Child. Thereafter, Ashburn did tours of duty in Iowa and Hawaii, and as of June 2014, he was serving in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2012, Mother requested the family court modify Ashburn's child support obligation. The following month, Ashburn requested visitation with Child, and the parties agreed to arrange a visit. Ashburn met with Child in Charleston, South Carolina. During this visit, Ashburn obtained a genetic sample from Child and submitted his and Child's genetic samples with a drug-store DNA kit for paternity testing. The test excluded Ashburn as Child's biological father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on the results of the self-conducted DNA test, Ashburn filed an independent action to disestablish paternity in April 2013 on the grounds of fraud and material mistake of fact. DSS scheduled genetic testing of Ashburn and Child, and the results confirmed Ashburn was not the biological father of Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the June 2014 hearing on the petition to disestablish paternity, Mother testified she could not understand the results of the DNA test because Ashburn was the only Caucasian man with whom she had been intimate. However, in responding to the family court's examination, Mother subsequently admitted she had become intoxicated one night while at a party with a Caucasian male friend and \"something\" could have happened-this was apparently around the time of Child's conception. The family court found there was no extrinsic fraud to support relief from the previous determination\n   of paternity and Ashburn was the legal father of Child. Ashburn filed a motion for reconsideration arguing for the first time, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, \"it [was] no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\" The family court denied the motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Did the family court err in finding Ashburn is Child's legal father despite genetic testing proving he is not Child's biological father?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to correct errors of law and to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Mr. T v.

Based on the results of a self-conducted DNA test, Ashburn filed an action in 2014 seeking to disestablish paternity of Child. Arguably, Ashburn would be barred by res\n   judicata from contesting paternity because the 2001 order establishing paternity is between the same parties and arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as his current claim seeking to disestablish paternity. However, the analysis does not end there because it is necessary to address whether the circumstances warrant precluding the application of res judicata and granting Ashburn relief from the 2001 order establishing paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our courts have not directly applied Rule 60(b)(5), whether brought by motion or independent action, to relieve a father from a previous order establishing paternity but have intimated that it is possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mr. T\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086347\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/378/127/#p131\">\n    378 S.C. at 136, 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086347\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/378/127/#p131\">\n    662 S.E.2d at 418-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing a motion to dismiss and remanding for development of the record and finding that a previous determination of paternity is subject to attack under Rule 60(b)(5) if the appropriate circumstances are met);\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

Ashburn had no contact with Child until the visit in Charleston when Child was twelve years old.
