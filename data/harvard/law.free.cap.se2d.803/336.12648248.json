MIMS\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal, we consider the extent to which a corporate taxpayer must include in its Virginia taxable income royalties paid to an intangible holding company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kohl's Department Stores, Inc. (\"Kohl's\") is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. It operates retail stores throughout the United States, including Virginia. Kohl's Illinois, Inc. (\"Kohl's Illinois\"), a corporation organized under the laws of Nevada,\n   is an affiliate of Kohl's. Kohl's Illinois operates retail stores in select states, none of which are in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kohl's Illinois also owns, manages, and licenses certain intellectual property. Kohl's entered into a license agreement with Kohl's Illinois for the use of this intellectual property. Pursuant to this agreement, Kohl's paid $441,942,347 in royalties to Kohl's Illinois during the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009 and $481,788,205 during the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2010. When calculating its federal taxable income for these years, Kohl's deducted these royalty payments from its income as an ordinary and necessary business expense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20162\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Conversely, Kohl's Illinois included the royalties as income in its taxable income calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, Kohl's Illinois did not ultimately pay state income taxes on a substantial portion of the royalties. Each state in which Kohl's Illinois filed a return only taxed an apportionable share of its taxable income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This left a substantial portion of the royalties untaxed, as they were not fairly attributable to Kohl's Illinois's activities in most states. In this capacity, Kohl's Illinois functions as an intangible holding company (\"IHC\"). James A.

Code \u00a7 58.1-400. In 2004, the General Assembly sought to close the IHC loophole by enacting an \"add back\" statute, Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a). Department of Taxation, 2004 Special Session I,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fiscal Impact Statement for HB 5018 (estimating that the add back statute would increase the Commonwealth's tax revenue by\n   $34 million in 2005). Under Code \u00a7 58.1-402(A), corporate taxpayers calculate their Virginia taxable income by starting with their federal taxable income and then making certain adjustments. The add back statute requires corporations to add to their federal taxable income \"the amount of any intangible expenses and costs\" paid to their \"related members to the extent such expenses and costs were ... deducted in computing federal taxable income.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties do not contest that Kohl's royalty payments were \"intangible expenses and costs\" paid to a \"related member.\" However, Kohl's claims that they fall within the \"subject-to-tax\" exception to the add back statute. This exception provides that the \"addition shall not be required for any portion of the intangible expenses and costs if ... [t]he corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by ... another state.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). Kohl's Illinois included the royalties as income in each of its state tax returns. This income was then apportioned and taxed by each of these states. The royalties, in Kohl's view, therefore qualify for the subject-to-tax exception, and Kohl's did not add them back when calculating its Virginia taxable income for the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009. Kohl's further requested a refund for the royalties it mistakenly added back to its taxable income for the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In February 2011, the Virginia Department of Taxation audited Kohl's returns for both of the taxable years at issue. The auditor recognized that Kohl's Illinois paid income tax on a portion of the royalties, through the apportionment process, in many of the Separate Return States. The auditor allowed a \"partial exception\" to the add back statute corresponding to the amount of the royalties that was actually taxed in these states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Kohl's Illinois did not pay taxes on most of the royalties, and the auditor required that this untaxed portion be added back to Kohl's taxable income. The Department then issued a Notice of Assessment to Kohl's for the taxable year that ended on January 31, 2009 in the amount of $1,165,318.16 in tax plus $120,682.26 in interest. For the taxable year that ended on January 30, 2012, the Department issued a Notice of Assessment in the amount of $681,582.84 in tax plus $29,466.79 in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Kohl's appealed to the State Tax Commissioner, requesting corrections to both Notices of Assessment. The Commissioner found that the auditor correctly \"reduced the royalty add back exception to the portion of [Kohl's] royalties paid to [Kohl's Illinois] that corresponds to the portion of [Kohl's Illinois's] income subjected to tax in other states.\" Accordingly, the Commissioner upheld the assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kohl's then filed an \"Application for Correction of Erroneous Assessment and Refund of Corporation Income Taxes\" in the circuit court. Kohl's primarily contended that the royalty payments only needed to be included in Kohl's Illinois's taxable income, regardless of whether they were actually taxed, to fall within the subject-to-tax exception. The Department responded that only the portion of the royalty payments that was actually taxed by other states qualifies for the exception. Kohl's alternatively argued that even if the exception only covers the amount that was actually taxed, the Department's calculation of that amount was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties submitted a joint stipulation of facts, wherein they agreed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   it shall not be necessary for Kohl's to put on evidence of the amounts of the [subject-to-tax] exception or the resulting additional [corporate income tax] and interest that follows from [the circuit court's] ruling on the application of [the add back statute]. After [the circuit court's] ruling, the parties will confer and attempt to agree on any additional [corporate income tax] and interest amounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Both parties moved for summary judgment, agreeing \"that the sole issue for the [circuit court] to decide is the extent to which Kohl's\n   is entitled to the [subject-to-tax] exception to the add back statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4134543\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-cir/91/499/#p504\">\n    91 Va.

The circuit court issued an opinion denying Kohl's motion for summary judgment and granting the Department's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 506. It held that \"to fall within the [subject-to-tax] exception, the intangible expenses paid to a related member must not only be subject to a tax in another state, but that tax must actually be imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 505.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Applicability of the Subject-To-Tax Exception\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As in the circuit court, the primary contention between the parties on appeal is the extent to which Kohl's is entitled to the subject-to-tax exception of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). The statute provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   B. There shall be added to the extent excluded from federal taxable income:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   8. a. ... [T]he amount of any intangible expenses and costs directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred to, or in connection directly or indirectly with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members to the extent such expenses and costs were deductible or deducted in computing federal taxable income for Virginia purposes. This addition shall not be required for any portion of the intangible expenses and costs if one of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) The corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by Virginia [or] another state....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Kohl's argues that all of the royalties fall within the subject-to-tax exception because they were included in the taxable income of Kohl's Illinois. In its view, if income is included in the computation of a corporation's taxable income in another state, then it is \"subject to a tax based on or measured by net income.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). The Department responds that while all of the royalties were included in the taxable income of Kohl's Illinois, a substantial portion of these royalties was not attributable to any state in which Kohl's Illinois filed its returns and, as a result, not subject to a tax imposed by another state. In other words, Kohl's argues that the subject-to-tax exception applies on a \"pre-apportionment\" basis, while the Department argues that the subject-to-tax exception applies on a \"post-apportionment\" basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In resolving this dispute, we note that because the Department is charged with the responsibility of administering and enforcing the tax laws of the Commonwealth under Code \u00a7 58.1-202, its interpretation of a tax statute is entitled to great weight.\n   <em>\n    Webster Brick Co. v.

The Court's primary objective is to give effect to the legislative intent, which \"is initially found in the words of the statute itself, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, we do not rely on rules of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99548\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/254/88/#p91\">\n    254 Va. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=488%20S.E.2d%20345\">\n    488 S.E.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As stated above, the subject-to-tax exception applies when \"[t]he corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by ... another state.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). It is not clear from this language whether the General Assembly intended the exception to apply on a pre- or post-apportionment basis. Notably, the phrase \"subject to a tax\" is not defined by the Code. Seeking to provide a definition, Kohl's points out that the term \"taxable\" is defined as \"subject to taxation.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1688 (10th ed. 2014). From this definition, Kohl's reasons that the royalty payments need only be \"taxable\"-regardless of whether they are actually taxed-to fall\n   within the subject-to-tax exception. But this does not settle the issue, for the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution mandate that only the amount of a corporation's income that is fairly apportionable to a given state is legally subject to that state's income tax.\n   <em>\n    Container Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 463 U.S. at 164,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6192779\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/159/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In fact, both of the parties' positions find support in the statute's language. Because the royalties were included in Kohl's Illinois's taxable income, they were, to a certain extent, \"subject to\" the income taxes of other states. At the same time, a substantial amount of the royalties was not apportioned to, and thereby not legally \"subject to\" the income tax of, any state in which Kohl's Illinois filed a return. Phrased differently, an income tax could only be \"imposed by\" another state on the post-apportioned amounts of the royalties. Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). This principle is demonstrated in Kohl's 2009 Virginia Income Tax Return, which indicates that less than 4% of Kohl's \"taxable income\" was \"\n   <em>\n    apportioned\n   </em>\n   to Virginia,\" and that only this post-apportioned amount was \"\n   <em>\n    subject to\n   </em>\n   Virginia Tax.\" (Emphases added.) Thus, the General Assembly's decision to limit the applicability of the subject-to-tax exception to when the income is \"subject to\" an income tax \"imposed by\" another state suggests that it intended the exception to apply on a post-apportionment basis. Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, looking only at the plain language of the statute, it is doubtful and uncertain whether the General Assembly intended the subject-to-tax exception to apply on a pre- or post-apportionment basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Newberry Station Homeowners Ass'n v.

We therefore hold that the subject-to-tax exception applies only to the extent that the royalty payments were actually taxed by another state. That is, the exception applies on a post-apportionment,\n   rather than a pre-apportionment, basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B. Kohl's Alternative Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Kohl's alternatively argues that the Department erred in calculating the amount of the royalties that falls within the subject-to-tax exception. The Department allowed a \"partial exception\" to the add back statute to the extent that the royalty payments were apportioned and taxed in many of the Separate Return States. However, Kohl's Illinois's income was also included in Kohl's taxable income calculations in the Combined Return States. Additionally, Kohl's was required to add the royalties back to its taxable income when calculating its taxable income for Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, and it added a portion of the royalties back when calculating its taxable income for Georgia and New Jersey (collectively, the \"Addback States\"). Kohl's argues that to the extent the royalties were apportioned to and taxed by all of the above states, they fall within the subject-to-tax exception. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The subject-to-tax exception applies when \"[t]he corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by Virginia [or] another state.\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1). This statute only requires that the \"item of income received by the related member\"-in this case, the royalties-be taxed by another state. It does not require that the related member be the entity that pays the tax on that \"item of income.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12647222\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/796/409/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nevertheless, the Department notes that the add back statute only applies to any intangible expenses paid to a \"related member,\" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a), and that the subject-to-tax exception only applies to \"[t]he corresponding item of income received\n   <em>\n    by the related member.\n   </em>\n   \" Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(1) (emphasis added). From these provisions, the Department reasons that the Court can only look to Kohl's Illinois's tax returns when determining whether the royalty payments were subject to a tax in another state. In essence, this argument asserts that for the royalty payments to fall within the subject-to-tax exception, the tax must have been paid by the related member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Simply, Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) contains no such requirement. To the extent that the royalties were actually taxed by the Separate Return States, Combined Return States, or Addback States, they fall within the subject-to-tax exception regardless of which entity paid the tax. The Department should have allowed this portion of the royalties to be excepted from the add back statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The circuit court correctly determined that only the portion of the royalties that was actually taxed by another state falls within the subject-to-tax exception. However, it erred by failing to hold, in accordance with Kohl's alternative argument, that Kohl's Illinois need not be the entity that pays this tax for the exception to apply. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's judgment and remand the matter for a determination of what portion of the royalty payments was actually taxed by another state and, therefore, excepted from the add back statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   JUSTICE McCLANAHAN, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE LEMONS and JUSTICE KELSEY join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I disagree with the Court's holding in Part II.A. of its opinion that Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1)\"applies on a post-apportionment, rather than a pre-apportionment, basis.\" In my view, the Court has inserted an apportionment calculation into this provision that is not supported by the provision's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) provides that the addition to taxable income of royalties paid to a related member \"shall not be required for\n   <em>\n    any portion\n   </em>\n   of the intangible expenses and costs\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   ...

Therefore, to the extent there is doubt as to whether Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) applies on a post-apportionment basis, thus requiring the addition to taxable income of some portion of royalties, that doubt should be resolved in Kohl's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Furthermore, the stated purpose of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a) was to close a loophole in connection with Delaware holding companies, not corporations for which income is subject to tax. The fiscal impact statement referenced by the majority, Department of Taxation, 2004 Special Session I, Fiscal Impact Statement for H.B. 5018, states that the addback statute \"[c]loses certain loopholes related to Delaware holding companies.\" The legislative summary accompanying H.B. 5018 similarly states that the bill \"[r]equires additions to federal taxable income for certain deductions for intangible and interest expense, but provides certain safe-harbors related to Delaware holding companies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.B. 5018, Summary as Passed,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ?ses=042&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb5018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the original purpose as stated in the legislative summary and fiscal impact statement accompanying H.B. 5018 reflect the General Assembly's intention to close loopholes related to holding companies for which income is not subject to tax in any state, such as Delaware holding companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Construing Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) to require the addition to income of royalties paid to a corporation for which income is subject to tax in another state would exceed the stated purpose of the legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the efforts to amend Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1) to impose an apportionment limitation on its application reveal that the provision contains no such limitation. As discussed in Part I, the General Assembly failed to enact bills proposed during the 2010 and 2013 legislative sessions, both of which included language that would have codified the apportionment limitation adopted by the Department. Budget bills enacted in 2014 and 2016 contain provisions purporting to place an apportionment limitation on the application of Code \u00a7 58.1-402(B)(8)(a)(1).

Even if there were doubt as to whether the provision contained such a limitation, statutory construction principles require that we resolve it in favor of Kohl's.
