Background and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For more than 35 years, Aaron J. Cole worked as a machinist for Norfolk Southern Railway Company (\"NSRC\"). During this time, he was regularly exposed to toxic substances and dust, including asbestos. In 1996, he filed a complaint in the circuit court alleging that he contracted \"occupational pneumoconiosis, including but not limited to asbestosis\" as a result of NSRC's negligence. His complaint also alleged that he suffered\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   from extreme nervousness, mental anxiety and fear of contracting mesothelioma, lung cancer and/or other cancers and/or other conditions caused by exposure to harmful and toxic dust and/or conditions including, but not limited to, cor pulmonale. In addition, [Cole], because of his occupational pneumoconiosis, now has an increased risk of contracting mesothelioma, lung cancer, and/or other cancers and/or other conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 15, 2000, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby Cole, who was 78 years old and represented by counsel, signed a release of liability in exchange for $20,000. In pertinent part, the release states that Cole\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   does hereby RELEASE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE [NSRC] ... from all liability for all claims or actions for pulmonary-respiratory occupational diseases and/or other known injuries, physical, mental or financial, suffered or incurred by [Cole], including, but not limited to: (a) medical, hospital and funeral expenses, (b) pain and suffering, (c) loss of income, (d) increased risk of cancer, (e) fear of cancer, (f) any and all forms of cancer, including mesothelioma [,] (g) and all costs, expenses and damages whatsoever, including all claims, debts, demands, actions, or causes of action of any kind, in law or equity, which [Cole] has or may have at common law or by statute or by virtue of any action under [FELA] ..., in whole or in part, arising out of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Exposure to toxic substances, including asbestos, silica, sand, coal dust, work place dust and all other toxic dusts, fibers, fumes, vapors, or mists used by NSRC during [Cole's] employment by NSRC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 16, 2009, Cole was diagnosed with lung cancer ; he died on November 14, 2010. Alan B. Cole, as the executor of Cole's estate, filed a complaint in the circuit court alleging under FELA that Cole's death was the direct and proximate result of NSRC's\n   negligence. In a plea in bar, NSRC argued that the complaint should be dismissed because the claim was released as part of the settlement of Cole's 1996 asbestosis action. Cole responded that the release was void under \u00a7 5 of FELA, which states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [a]ny contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this act ... shall to that extent be void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2055\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon consideration of an evidentiary stipulation submitted by the parties, the circuit court granted NSRC's plea in bar. It acknowledged that a federal circuit split has resulted in two tests for evaluating the validity of releases under \u00a7 5 of FELA, but concluded that the release was valid under either test. We granted Cole this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

First, the release specifically purports to release NSRC from \"all liability for claims or actions for pulmonary-respiratory occupational diseases ... including ... increased risk of cancer, ... fear of cancer, ... [and] any and all forms of cancer, including mesothelioma.\" While this language is not \"conclusive,\" it is nonetheless \"strong ... evidence\" that Cole intended to release all future cancer claims that might arise from his exposure to asbestos.\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Next, and most significantly, the release's language is similar to much of the wording contained in Cole's 1996 asbestosis complaint. There, Cole specifically put at issue his \"fear of contracting ... lung cancer and/or other cancers\" and \"increased risk of contracting mesothelioma, lung cancer, and/or other cancers,\" demonstrating that he was aware of these risks. He then settled this claim with a release that specifically absolved NSRC from \"any\" liability related to Cole's \"increased risk of cancer, ... fear of cancer, ... [and] any and all forms of cancer.\" Given this similar wording, it was reasonable for the circuit court to conclude that when the parties executed the release they knew, and intended to resolve, all the issues raised in Cole's complaint, including any future cancer claims arising from his exposure to asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nevertheless, Cole argues that the circuit court should have determined that the release was invalid under the risk of harm test because it contains \"boilerplate.\" However, the risk of harm test does not dictate that all releases containing such commonly-used provisions are void. Rather, the Third Circuit merely said in\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   that such a release may be attacked by an employee as not reflecting his intent. Cole did attack the release on this basis in the proceedings below, but the circuit court nevertheless found that the evidence demonstrated Cole's intent to release any future claim for lung cancer. The fact-intensive risk of harm test is intentionally designed to allow trial courts to resolve these sorts of factual questions.\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We recognize that [the risk of harm test] is a fact-intensive process, but trial courts are competent to make these kinds of determinations.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the circuit court's factual conclusion that Cole intended to release all future cancer claims when he executed the release, including the present lung cancer claim, is not plainly wrong or without evidentiary support. Thus, applying the risk of harm test, the release of this claim did not violate \u00a7 5 of FELA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; Western Railway v.

Ayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    538 U.S. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). In\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court indicated, in dicta, that a plaintiff who successfully recovers for an asbestosis claim \"may bring a second [FELA] action if cancer develops\" despite the fact that both diseases arose from the same asbestos exposure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 152-53 &amp; n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From this comment, Cole reasons that the critical inquiry when determining whether a controversy exists is whether the claim sought to be released has accrued at the time the release is signed. If a claim has yet to accrue, Cole suggests that it is not a controversy that may be released under \u00a7 5 of FELA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This argument mirrors the approach taken by the Court of Appeals of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    Fannin v.

In\n   <em>\n    Fannin\n   </em>\n   , the court began by acknowledging, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Callen\n   </em>\n   , that \"where controversies exist\" parties may settle FELA claims without offending \u00a7 5 of FELA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%20291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%20291\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Callen's\n   </em>\n   holding \"only applies to claims which have already arisen\n   <em>\n    at the time the release is signed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   emphasis in original). That is, a \"release is valid only ... where it disposes of an accrued FELA claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%20291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It therefore concluded that a release that attempts to waive a claim prior to its accrual is an attempt by the railroad to \"exempt itself from liability\" and void under \u00a7 5 of FELA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%20291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20N.E.2d%20291\">\n    at 295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Cole's argument is not persuasive. First, in\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court did not address the release of claims under \u00a7 5 of FELA. Its primary holding was that a plaintiff may, after successfully prosecuting an\n   <em>\n    asbestosis\n   </em>\n   claim, recover damages for \"mental anguish ... resulting from the fear of developing cancer.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    538 U.S. at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Court seemed to affirm in dicta that asbestosis claimants may bring a second action if cancer later develops from the same asbestos exposure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 152-53 &amp; n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But plainly this dicta does not demand the result for which Cole advocates. While an employee who has previously recovered for asbestosis may bring a second claim if cancer later develops, this does not mean that he cannot settle his known risk of a future cancer claim as part of his initial asbestosis action if desired. This is especially true where, as here, the asbestosis complainant places the increased risk of future cancer at issue in his complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the \"asbestosis claimants [in\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   ] did not seek, and the trial court did not allow, discrete damages for their\n   <em>\n    increased risk\n   </em>\n   of future cancer\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   does not compel us to adopt the approach taken by the Ohio Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Fannin\n   </em>\n   , we reject it for the same reasons we reject the bright-line test. It represents an overly narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    Callen\n   </em>\n   that requires an employee to be actually suffering from an injury before it can be released. There is nothing to suggest that \u00a7 5 of FELA was intended to place such a limiting effect on the ability of parties to settle known risks of future claims without litigation. The approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Fannin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   like the bright-line test, requires an unrealistic view of how parties compromise claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under the risk of harm test, which we adopt as the rule of decision in the Commonwealth, a release does not violate \u00a7 5 of FELA if it is executed as part of a negotiated settlement of a FELA claim and is limited to those risks that were known to the parties at the time of its execution. The focus of this test is not whether a release explicitly lists a potential future claim, but whether the parties intended to release such a claim. The evidence in the present case supports the circuit court's factual finding that Cole intended to release the present lung cancer claim as part of the settlement of his asbestosis action. Accordingly, applying the risk of harm test, the release in 2000 of the present lung cancer claim was not void under \u00a7 5 of FELA. We therefore affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, we note that the risk of harm test has been adopted by the majority of courts that have considered the issue.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v.
