The plaintiff was employed to haiil material from a house on the. west side .of Charles St., above S\u2019aratOga St'., and, coming to the house on the 4th of July for.a load,-found-a ridge of stones, occasioned by the work referred .to, along the west side of the street in front of and beyond the house. ,A-t this time he made no- attempt to cross over' the stones, but, stop-. ping his -horse on- the east 'side of -the Street, carried the materials, with the assistance of persons working in the 'house', to the cart. , On the 8th of July, the street being obstructed as before,- he made his first load in the same manner, but on his return -for a second load, not finding any one to help him, and. the materials being heavy, he attempted to lead his horse over the stones. While so doing, the horse stumbled, and in failing struck the plaintiff on, the,.leg and broke it. The- horse\u2019was sound and steady, and the plaintiff was- leading him 'carefully. The plaintiff having brought suit agajnst the city for damages, the defendant 'offered evidence that the plaintiff had been cautioned by the \u2022 owner of the materials to be careful in crossing the ridge, because he-thought it was dangerous; and, that the work which caused the obstruction had been carefully and promptly done by experienced and competent workmen. - At the trial the Court submitted the question of negligence, both on the part of the plaintiff and defendant, to the jury; verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, on appeal by the defendant, it was Hisld :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>That this instruction was proper, the act of the plaintiff not being contributory</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"APZ\">negligence in law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b260-6\">Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\"><em>Exception. </em>\u2014 The plaintiff offered three prayers, the first of which is stated in the opinion of the Court, the others are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">2.

No attempt was made by the plaintiff at this time to cross over the stones, but stopping his horse on the east side of the street, he carried with the assistance of persons working in the house, the materials, to the cart. On the 8th of July, finding , the street still obstructed by .the pile of stones, he loaded his cart in the same manner, but when he returned for a second load, not finding any one to help him, and the materials being, heavy, he attempted to lead the horse over the stones and in so d.oing, the horse stumbled, and in falling.struck the plaintiff on the leg and broke it. Th,e horse vsras sound and steady and the plaintiff was carefully leading, himn over. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Evidence was offered by the defendant to prove that the whole work in laying the mains occupied about five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>days and that it was carefully and promptly done, the men employed being experienced and competent workmen. The plaintiff' was cautioned to be careful in crossing the ridge of stones, because the witness thought it was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Upon these facts the Court instructed the jury :</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">1st. That if the defendant \u201cpulled up the pavement and allowed the same <em>negligently </em>to remain for a considerable length of time, by reason of which the plaintiff' in the course of his employment and duty, and without any negligence or fault on his part, had his leg broken, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">2nd. That if' the defendant found it necessary to lay water mains on Charles street, along and at the point where the plaintiff was injured, and the whole work was done by the employes in a proper manner, and with reasonable care and diligence, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">3rd. That if the plaintiff did not use reasonable care and diligence, and the injury complained of could have been avoided had he done so, then he was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The question of negligence both on the part of' the plaintiff and defendant, was fairly put to the jury. The defendant contends, however, that the attempt on the part of the plaintiff' to lead his horse over the pile or ridge of stones, was, such a <em>glaring act of carelessness </em>as <em>to amount in laxo to </em>contributory negligence, and that the Court erred in refusing so to instruct the jury. Negligence is the want of such care as men of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances; and the question as to whether tire act of the plaintiff <em>amounted in law to </em>negligence, depended upon the danger which might reasonably be expected to result therefrom. If the danger was so great that no sensible man would have incurred it, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>this' dfcourse ijaise.d a, question of. .fact, which ; we think\" was \u2018properly, submitted ,to-, the jury.-' This '-case' is 'not unlike <em>Clayards vs. Dethick &amp; Davis, </em>64 <em>Eng.
