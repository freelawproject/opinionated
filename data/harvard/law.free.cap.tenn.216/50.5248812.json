Montesi, Sr., re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ferred to herein as defendant, committed suicide by jumping from the Memphis-Arkansas bridge in Memphis, Tennessee, on June 11, 1962. Her son, Thomas Paul Lancaster, and her mother, Mrs. Mary Ellen Easley, brought this action as next of kin for her alleged wrongful death under T.C.A. sec. 20-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">In substance, the declaration alleged that for a considerable period of time prior to her death the deceased had been under the domination and control of defendant; that he had subjected her to punishment of the most sadistic type; that it was his design to master, possess and control her for his own illicit purposes, with the result that she had lost all ability to resist his domination and live a virtuous life; that she had been alienated and divorced from her husband; that all of this became so much of a burden on her that she finally committed suicide by jumping from the Memphis-Arkansas bridge; and that her death was negligently and willfully caused by his wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">More specifically, the declaration alleged that during the period of their illicit relationship, the defendant \u201chad not only used her but had inflicted, on many occasions, punishment of the most sadistic type; that he had broken her leg, burned her with a cigarette, blacked her eyes, kicked her, and caused her to be bruised and discolored over large areas \u2019 \u2019; that \u2018 \u2018 on many occasions the deceased has escaped from the defendant and on one occasion had gone to the State of Alabama,\u201d only to have defendant forcibly bring her back to Memphis to continue her illicit relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The declaration further alleged that on June 10, 1962, the day prior to her suicide, the defendant took deceased to Alabama where they remained overnight; that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>attempted to reach relatives, but was. prevented from doing so by defendant; and that en route back to Memphis she attempted to commit suicide by 'leaping from the moving car in which they were traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Upon their return to Memphis, defendant took the deceased to their apartment where she called a mutual \u25a0friend, and in the presence of the defendant, related the abuse imposed upon her, \u201cand stated that she was going to \u2018end it all\u2019 \u201d The mutual friend talked to the defendant on the phone and asked him to hold her, take her to the \u25a0hospital, do anything, but do not leave her alone, whereupon, the defendant replied: \u201cHell, I\u2019m gone.\u201d He then allegedly left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Finally, the declaration alleged that after the defendant left, the deceased wrote a suicide note in which she said: \u201cMa Ma, I\u2019m sorry. Louis has beat me enough.\u201d She then left the apartment and went to the Memphis-Arkansas bridge where she took her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendant filed a demurrer asserting that his alleged. wrongful conduct was not, as a matter of law, a proximate cause of the deceased\u2019s death, and that the declaration, therefore, did not state a cause of action. The trial court, W. E. Quick, Judge, ruled in favor of the defendant, sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">Plaintiffs appealed, insisting that under the peculiar circumstances of the case, decedent\u2019s act of jumping from the bridge was not an efficient intervening cause which would interrupt the causation and exc\u00fase defendant, and the defendant\u2019s acts were, therefore, the proximate cau\u00a1?e of, the suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">Since this case is in this Court on a demurrer to the declaration which was sustained by the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>if there is any possible ground on which a cause of action may be predicated,, w\u00e9 must reverse the trial court and remand for trial. <em>Byrd v. Pioneer-Jellico Coal Co., </em>180 Tenn. 396, 175 S.W.2d 542 (1943); <em>Lasarov v. Nunnally, </em>188 Tenn. 145, 217 S.W.2d 11 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">One\u2019s first inquiry, in analyzing a situation such as is before us, is whether the alleged acts of defendant were a cause in fact of the injury. \u201cIf that inquiry shows that defendant\u2019s conduct, in point of fact, was not a factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s damage, that ends the matter. But if it shows his conduct was a factor in causing plaintiff\u2019s damage, then the further question is whether his conduct played such a part in causing the damage as makes him in the eye of the law the author of such damage and liable therefor.\u201d <em>Carney v. Goodman, </em>38 Tenn. App. 55, 61, 270 S.W.2d 572, 575 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Since the sole ground of the demurrer was that his conduct was not the proximate cause, we need only consider \u201cwhether his conduct played such a part in causing the damage as makes him in the eye of the law the author of such damage and liable therefor. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"> In deciding proximate, or legal, causation, it must first be determined whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, and thus whether there was any negligence. Foreseeability is the test for negligence, and the inquiry is whether defendant\u2019s conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm to plaintiff. <em>Spivey v. St. Thomas Hospital, </em>31 Tenn.App. 12, 25, 211 S.W.2d 450 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"AT2\">If the injury to plaintiff could have been foreseen or anticipated by defendant, then there is a duty t\u00f3 use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>care, and negligence may be established. <em>Gentry v. Taylor, </em>182 Tenn. 223, 185 S.W.2d 521 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">- Moreover, if the defendant conld have foreseen that some snch harm of like general character might result to plaintiff from defendant\u2019s acts, and that the injury was within the reasonable range of the risk created by such acts, a duty exists. <em>Friendship Tel. Co. v. Russom, </em>43 Tenn.App. 441, 451-452, 309 S.W.2d 416 (1957); <em>Inter City Trucking Co. v. Daniels, </em>181 Tenn. 126, 178 S.W.2d 756 (1944). Harm in the abstract, not harm in the concrete, is the idea. 1 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Once a duty to plaintiff is established, and negligence of the defendant established, the ultimate question is whether the negligence of defendant was the proximate or legal cause. Before considering the matter further, the following quotation from Street, supra, at page 10, should be noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201cThe terms \u2018proximate\u2019 and \u2018remote\u2019 are thus respectively applied to recoverable and non-recover able damage. The question whether damage in a given case is proximate or remote is one of great importance. It is a question of substantive law, and the determination of it determines legal right. It is unfortunate that no definite principle can be laid down by which to determine this question. It is always to be determined on the facts of each case upon mixed considerations of logic, common sense, justice, policy, and precedent. About all that can here be safely ventured is found in an observation of Appleton, C. J., to the effect that: \u2018 Ordinarily that condition is usually termed the cause whose share in the matter is the most conspicuous and is the most immediately preceding and proximate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the event.\u2019 The best nse that can be made of the authorities on proximate cause is merely to furnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The negligent act of defendant, to be the legal cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, need not be the sole cause. It is sufficient if such act was a substantial factor in causing the harm. <em>Waller v. Skeleton, </em>31 Tenn.App. 103, 115, 212 S.W.2d 690 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">However, there may be conduct, either by plaintiff or a third party, of such nature as to break the chain of causation between defendant\u2019s act and the harm, and so relieve the defendant of liability. Such conduct is known in the vernacular of the law as an independent, intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The same rule of foreseeability is applied to intervening cause. The defendant, in order to be liable, must have been able to anticipate or reasonably foresee what usually will happen. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Wagoner, </em>183 Tenn. 392, 399, 192 S.W.2d 840, 852, 164 E.L.R. 364 (1946). The rule \u201cdoes not require him to anticipate and provide against, what is unusual or * * * remotely possible, but whether it was probable according to the usual experience of persons.\u201d <em>Ward v. Univ. of the South, </em>209 Tenn. 412, 423-424, 354 S.W.2d 246, 250 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Dean Prosser succinctly sums up the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201cAn intervening cause is one which comes into active operation in producing the result after the actor\u2019s negligent act or omission has occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cThe defendant ordinarily.will not be relieved of liability by an intervening canse which conld reasonably have been foreseen, nor by one which is a normal incident of the risk created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">\u201cThe defendant will ordinarily be relieved of liability by an unforeseeable and abnormal intervening cause which produces a result which could not have been foreseen.\u201d Prosser on Torts (1955 ed.), sec. 49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">See <em>Moody v. Gulf Refining Co., </em>142 Tenn. 280, 293, 294, 218 S.W. 817, 8 A.L.R. 1243 (1919); <em>Jones v. Stewart, </em>183 Tenn. 176, 181, 191 S.W.2d 439 (1946); <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Head, </em>46 Tenn.App. 612, 332 S.W.2d 682 (1959); <em>Brown v. Hudson, </em>50 Tenn.App. 658, 363 S.W.2d 505 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In an action for wrongful death, where the intervening cause relied on takes the form of suicide, then the cases both in this jurisdiction and elsewhere have generally held there to be no liability. It is only when the deceased was insane or in a frenzy at the time of death, as a result of the negligence, that some courts have been willing to hold that the proximate cause of the death was the defendant\u2019s wrongful act. See Annotation, 11 A.L.R. 2d 751. .</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Dean Prosser, in his discussion of Intervening Causes, sec. 49 of Prosser on Torts (1955), has this to say pertinent to our consideration of the problem:'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">\u201cSome difficulty has arisen in cases where the injured person becomes insane and commits suicide. Although there are cases to the contrary, it seems the better view that when his insanity prevents him from realizing the nature of his act or controlling his conduct, his suicide is to be regarded either as a direct result and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>no intervening force at all, or as a normal incident of the risk, for which the defendant will be liable. <em>The situation is the same as if he should hurt himself during unconsciousness or delirium brought on by the injury. </em>But if the suicide is during a lucid interval, when he is in full command of his faculties but his life has become unendurable to him, it is agreed that his voluntary choice is an abnormal thing, which supersedes the defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d Prosser at page 273-274.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">In the case of <em>Jones v. Stewart, </em>supra, a young lad of 18 years was falsely accused by his father of breaking into his father\u2019s home and stealing, and allegedly as a result thereof, the young lad committed suicide. Mr. Justice Tomlinson, speaking for the Court, affirmed the judgment of the trial court in sustaining a demurrer to a cause of action for wrongful death. The Court relied on several decisions in foreign jurisdictions where liability had been denied under similar circumstances, and quoted from <em>Salsedo v. Palmer, </em>278 F. 92, 99 (2d Cir., 1921):</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201c \u2018An act of suicide resulting from a moderately intelligent power of choice, even though the choice is determined by a disordered mind, should be deemed a new and independent, efficient cause of the death that immediately ensues.\u2019 \u201d 183 Tenn. at 179, 191 S.W.2d at 440. The Court declared these decisions from foreign jurisdictions \u201cresulted from the necessary application of the general rule which has always prevailed in Tennessee,\u201d and was stated by our Supreme Court in <em>Chattanooga Light &amp; Power Co. v. Hodges, </em>109 Tenn. 331, 70 S.W. 616, 60 L.R.A. 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In <em>Eckerd\u2019s, Inc. v. McGhee, </em>19 Tenn. App. 277, 86 S.W.2d 570 (1935), the defendant was accused of selling a poison to plaintiff, a minor, in violation of a statute making such a sale to a minor negligence per se. Plaintiff alleged that in a fit of despondency, while she was temporarily insane and not able to comprehend what she was doing, she purchased the poison from defendant and took same, and that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The court, in holding for the defendant, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cIn the instant case, we are of the opinion that the act of Martha McGee in swallowing the bichloride tablets and iodine was the proximate cause of her injuries, <em>unless her reason and memory were, at the time, so far obscured that she did not know and understand what she was doing, and was, therefore, not a responsible human agency.\u201d </em>19 Tenn. App. 287, 86 S.W.2d 575 (italics ours).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Applying- the reasoning of these cases to the one at bar, we think that the demurrer to the declaration of plaintiffs was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The strongest possible construction of the facts as alleged is that the deceased was tired of her situation in life, and that it had become unendurable to her, and that she wrote a note to her mother in which she said, \u201cMa Ma, I\u2019m sorry. Louis has beat me enough.\u201d That then, she left her apartment and went to the Memphis-Arkansas bridge, and took her own life. Although it is alleged that she was \u201cbereft of reason,\u201d it cannot be said that she did not know and understand the nature of her act. <em>Eckerd\u2019s, Inc. v. McGhee, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Whether a declaration states a cause of action is to be determined by a consideration of the facts alleged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Evans v. Thompson, </em>59 Tenn. (12 Heiskell) 534, 546 (1873), not the conclusions of the pleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">We think that the facts alleged here establish an efficient, intervening, and unforeseeable cause. Thus, the proximate, or legal, cause of. the harm complained of was the voluntary and free act of the deceased in taking her own life. Her voluntary act was an abnormal thing, which supersedes defendant\u2019s liability. Prosser, supra, sec. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the trial court in dismissing the action is affirmed, with costs adjudged against appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Petition to Eehear</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The plaintiffs, Thomas Paul Lancaster and Mrs. Mary Ellen Easley, have filed a courteous petition to rehear. This petition again argues the position taken by these parties in the original hearing and does not present any new matter not considered by the Court in our original opinion. For this reason the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
