On September 26, 1987, plaintiff was operating his automobile. He moved from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the right lane to the left lane and in doing so \u201ccut off\u201d the unidentified vehicle. While plaintiffs car was stopped at the next intersection, the unidentified vehicle stopped beside him. A passenger emerged from the unidentified vehicle, approached plaintiff\u2019s window and punched plaintiff, causing serious eye injury. The unidentified vehicle and the assailant immediately left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Plaintiff commenced this action against his insurer, Allstate, alleging a right to personal injury protection benefits (PIP) and benefits pursuant to UM coverage. The parties settled the PIP claim, but litigated UM coverage through cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The trial court felt compelled by <em>Smaul v. Irvington General Hosp., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1987), to enter judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>Smaul </em>involved a PIP claim by a person who was assaulted pud robbed when he stopped to ask directions of two pedestrians. In addition to beating plaintiff and taking his money, the perpetrators attempted to steal his car. The Supreme Court held that PIP coverage was applicable because the assault \u201calthough not foreseen or expected [was] in the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract, a \u2018natural or reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the automobile, and thus a risk against which they might reasonably expect those insured under the policy would be protected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478 quoting <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 38 (App.Div.1973), aff\u2019d 65 <em>N.J. </em>152 (1974). The Court also focused on the automobile\u2019s involvement in the incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">[P]laintiff sought directions so that he could drive his car to his destination, he was sitting in his car when the assault occurred, and a purpose of the assailants\u2014not emphasized by either court below but acknowledged in Allstate\u2019s Statement of Facts\u2014was to steal the car after yanking plaintiff out of the driver\u2019s seat. The effort to take the automobile removes, for us, any doubt about this case falling within the statutory requirement of an \u201caccident involving an automobile.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The statute applied in <em>Smaul </em>mandated PIP benefits for an insured \u201cwho sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>involving an automobile____ <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The UM coverage is also mandated by statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-14, and is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.la as being applicable, in part, to \u201cbodily injury ... sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured or hit and run motor vehicle____\u201d Thus, there is superficial similarity between the PIP phrase \u201caccident involving an automobile\u201d and the UM phrase \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of a vehicle, although the PIP wording is broader. <em>See Darel v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n. Ins. Co., </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>416, 422 (1989). However, differences between the purpose and function of each coverage are significant and transcend any similarities in language.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">UM coverage requires an injury \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of the <em>uninsured </em>vehicle. Benefits are available only if the covered party, the plaintiff in this case, establishes that he is \u201clegally entitled to recover damages from the operator or owner\u201d of the uninsured or hit and run vehicle. PIP benefits, on the other hand, more closely resemble accident, disability and medical coverages in which fault is irrelevant. This distinction is significant because UM coverage is mandated as a substitute for the liability insurance which should have been covering the uninsured vehicle. <em>Fernandez v. Selected Risks Ins. Co., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>236, 240 (UM coverage designed \u201cto ease the financial burden on the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund and to provide insured motorists with protection from uninsured, financially irresponsible motorists.\u201d); <em>accord, Gorton v. Reliance Ins. Co., 77 N.J. </em>563, 571 (1978); <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 284, 292 (1974); <em>Beltran v. Waddington, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 268 (App.Div.1978) (mandated U.M. coverage provides \u201ccoverage against the negligence of uninsured and unknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>motorists to be provided by one\u2019s liability carrier\u201d thereby relieving financial pressures on Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto v. Toro, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 229 (Law Div.1974) (UM coverage \u201calleviate[s] the economic hardship imposed upon victims of negligently operated automobiles where compensation is otherwise thwarted either by reason of lack of knowledge of the tortfeasor\u2019s identity or his financial irresponsibility.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In construing a statute we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>County of Monmouth v. Wissell, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>35 (1975). Sources of legislative intent are the language of a statute, the policy behind a statute, concepts of reasonableness and legislative history. <em>Shapiro v. Essex Cty. Freeholders Bd., </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>87 (Law Div.1980), aff\u2019d 183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24 (App.Div.1982), aff\u2019d 91 <em>N.J. </em>430 (1982). \u201c[Statutes are to be read sensibly rather than literally and the controlling legislative intent is to be presumed as \u2018consonant to reason and good discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schierstead v. Brigantine, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>220, 230 (1959) (citations omitted). And \u201cwhere a literal reading of the statute leads to absurd consequences \u2018the court must restrain the words\u2019 and seek the true legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, quoting <em>In re Merrill, </em>88 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>261 (Prerog.Ct.1917). In construing a statute we assume that the Legislature intended a reasonable approach, and the statute should be construed to effect a reasonable approach. <em>Roman v. Sharper, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>338, 341 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Applying these principles in light of the legislative purpose in requiring UM coverage, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s injury did not arise \u201cout of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1. In <em>Sciascia v. American Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352 (Law Div.1982), aff\u2019d o.b., 189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236 (App.Div.1983), we affirmed a Law Division decision that a death caused by a gunshot fired from a moving automobile was not within UM coverage. In that case, it had been the assailant\u2019s intention to shoot out the windshield of a parked car to avenge the recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>destruction of the uninsured driver\u2019s windshield. Although the Law Division concluded that the incident constituted an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1, <em>accord, Smaul, supra, </em>the court determined that the incident \u201cwas not one which, in the contemplation of the parties to the UM contract, was a natural and probable incident or consequence of the use of an automobile by an uninsured motorist.\u201d <em>Sciascia, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359. Despite <em>Smaul, </em>decided five years after <em>Sciascia, </em>we consider <em>Sciascia </em>to have been decided correctly. We persist in this point of view because, as previously indicated, the PIP and UM coverages satisfy significantly different needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The coverage required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1 protects an injured party who does not have recourse against an automobile liability insurance policy. <em>See Gorton v. Reliance Ins. Co., supra; N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1e.(2). Automobile liability insurance would not provide coverage for an intentional criminal act, <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1986), because \u201call or virtually all\u201d auto liability policies contain exclusions for intentionally caused harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 11. <em>Cf. Malanga v. Manufacturers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>220, 225 (1958) (public policy prohibits indemnification of a person for a loss incurred as a result of his own intentional wrongdoing). Thus, if UM coverage applies to injuries sustained through an intentional criminal attack effected through an instrumentality (in this case a fist) other than an automobile, then UM coverage, conceived as a first party substitute for third party liability coverage, would provide substantially greater protection than the third party coverage it replaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>We do not suggest that UM and automobile liability coverages are perfectly symmetrical,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but we perceive no \u2022 legislative intent to establish UM coverage as a form of general crime insurance based on an indirect nexus between an automobile and the criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4 has been amended, in part, to provide PIP coverage for \"bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile.\u201d <em>L. </em>1983, <em>c. </em>362, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The definition of uninsured motor vehicle includes a motor vehicle to which a bodily injury liability insurance policy is applicable \u201cbut the liability insurer denies coverage.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1e.(2)(b). Consequently, a vehicle insured under a policy containing an exclusion for intentional torts would be an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of the statute. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">We do not decide whether UM coverage applies to an intentional assault in which the uninsured automobile is the instrument of harm. Compare <em>Leatherby Ins. Co. v. Willoughby, </em>315 So.2d 553 (Fla.Dist.Ct. of Appeal, 1975) and <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Roberts, </em>261 N.C. 285, 134 <em>S.E.2d </em>654 (1964), which held that UM coverage applied to assault with an automobile, with <em>McCarthy v. Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corp., </em>16 A.D.2d 35, 224 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>909 (App.Div.1962), aff'd, 12 N.Y.2d 922, 188 <em>N.E.2d </em>405, 238 N.Y.S.2d 101 (1963), which held that it did not.
