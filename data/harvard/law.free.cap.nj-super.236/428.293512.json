The effect of the change was to negate the offset of poor financial results of one affiliate against the profits of another when calculating, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.2 and 17:29A-5.3, the amount of excess profits to be redistributed to policyholders as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The applicable statutory excess profits scheme for private passenger automobile insurance companies was enacted as Chapter 357 of the Laws of 1983, codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.2 to 17:29A-5.5. The introductory statement to the legislation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">This bill requires private passenger automobile insurers to file with the Department of Insurance annual financial disclosure statements containing detailed information on the financial results of their operations in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">This bill also establishes statutory standards for reporting and determining excess profits earned by insurers on private passenger automobile insurance in New Jersey, and for refunding any excess profits to policyholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">Companies with less than 0.5% of the New Jersey private passenger automobile market are exempt from the financial disclosure provisions of this bill but not from the excess profits requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">This bill is modeled after the financial disclosure and excessive profits laws of the State of Florida.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">A. 1983, <em>c. </em>357, Introductory Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">The text of the statute is annexed as Appendix A hereto. An implementing regulation was made effective April 7, 1986 as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-20.1. That regulation is annexed as Appendix B hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In 1988, the Legislature repealed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.2 to 17:29A-5.5, and substituted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.6 to 17:29A-5.16 as an excess profits statute for private passenger automobile insurance carriers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.7, which is part of that act, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">A separate profits report shall bo filed for each insurer and each insurer in an insurance holding company system. Each insurance holding company system shall file a separate combined profits report for all insurers in its system. The excess profits computation for an insurance holding company system shall be performed on its combined profits report, except that the commissioner may order an adjustment in the combined profits report if in his judgment, upon examining each insurer\u2019s profits report in the insurance holding company system, one or more of the insurers in that system are excessively subsidizing other insurers in that system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On May 15, 1989, regulations were adopted, codified under the same section numbers as the 1986 regulations, i.e., <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-20.1 to .10. These regulations are consistent with the policy of the 1988 legislation as to excess profits reporting. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.9 sets the due date for the first profits report required by the 1988 Act as July 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Thus, the consolidated matters before us affect only reporting and excess profits assessment in 1988, the limited period between the change in policy as to excess profit calculations of group affiliated insurers and adoption of the 1988 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">It is not disputed that in 1986 and 1987 the Commissioner evaluated excess profits on an insurer-group basis. As noted, the 1986 version of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-20.1 to .10 expressly set forth that reporting methodology. Moreover, the Department of Insurance prescribed reporting forms which recognized the group-wide data submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">On May 27, 1988, without prior notice, the Commissioner ordered that the reporting for excess profit purposes must henceforth be filed only on an individual insurer basis. When assessments of excess profits were later made on that basis as well, these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">We reverse because we agree that modification of the previous administrative policy on excess profits, a policy consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>with the reporting regulations, should have been effected through the rule-making procedures of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 to 52:14B-15. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cAdministrative rule\u201d or \u201crule,\u201d when not otherwise modified, means each agency statement of general applicability and continuing effect that implements or interprets law or policy, or describes the organization, procedure or practice requirements of any agency. The term includes the amendment or repeal of any rule, but does not include: (1) statements concerning the internal management or discipline of any agency; (2) intraagency and interagency statements; and (3) agency decisions and findings in contested cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The term \u201cinsurer\u201d was not specifically defined in the 1983 legislation, but was defined in the 1986 implementing regulations and forms to include a group of affiliated insurers. See Appendix B, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-20.3, .4. Several years of established policy and practice confirmed departmental acceptance that the method of computing excess profits would parallel the method established for reporting the data used for the computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Rule making is necessary when \u201cmany or most\u201d of the following criteria are present in an agency action which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(1) is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy. These relevant factors can, either singly or in combination, determine in a given case whether the essential agency action must be rendered through rule-making or adjudication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\"><em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 331-32 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Here, all six <em>Metromedia </em>factors are present. Most significant of these is the undisputedly \u201cmaterial and significant change\u201d from the Department\u2019s clear past position.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>The core of the Commissioner\u2019s response to the argument that formal rule-making procedures were here required is a contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-5.4 unambiguously requires that each insurer which transacts private passenger automobile insurance in this State must establish a plan for redistribution of excess profits. The Commissioner reasons that because L.1983, c. 357 was enacted as a supplement to L.1944, c. 27 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-1 to 17:29A-5), the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-1(g) definition of \u201cinsurer\u201d is applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is argued, the 1988 Departmental order which required filings on an individual insurer basis, and the later determination of excess profits on that basis, was not a rule-making interpretation, but merely a straight forward implementation of the unambiguous statutory definition of \u201cinsurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Had the 1988 order and rulings under review reflected the Department\u2019s consistent interpretation of the 1983 legislation since its enactment, a court might well affirm the 1988 order and rulings as reasonable without the necessity for further regulation. We recognize that groups of sister companies are not authorized as groups to do insurance business in New Jersey. Nonetheless, the 1986 filing regulations, and the excess profit policy respecting groups which consistently followed those regulations, did not unreasonably interpret the existing excess profit legislation, particularly as the expressed intention of the 1983 Act was to follow the path earlier blazed by the State of Florida. Florida\u2019s law utilizes group-based data and excess profit determinations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">As the 1986 regulations, and the parallel departmental policy respecting excess profit calculations on a group basis were not invalid <em>per se, </em>we hold that modification thereof should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>been effected in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4 to 52:14B-4.9, and the teachings of <em>Metromedia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We add our recognition that a historic and primary function of state insurance regulation is to protect consumers by monitoring the solvency of companies whose ability to carry out their contracts is critical to the financial security of victims covered thereunder. The Legislature has wisely added to this regulatory function a dimension of consumer protection against unreasonable profits by private passenger automobile insurance carriers. When the \u201crules,\u201d written or unwritten, governing excess profits determination are to be changed, a wise accommodation of these two functions requires that the industry be apprised of this in time to adjust underwriting and other legitimate management practices accordingly. Further, it is important that the public and the industry should be noticed so that they may bring to the regulators\u2019 attention views as to the probable consequences of a material change.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In the present cases, the effect of the 1988 order will be to require certain insurance companies within a group to refund to their insureds large amounts of \u201cexcess profits\u201d earned in years when the Departmental policy was different. Affiliated companies in the same group will then swallow large losses generated during those years. We do not presume to evaluate the consequences or authenticity of those losses. It is clear to us, however, that, absent reliance on the earlier policy, some things would have been done differently in the years retroactively affected, and that there must now be some material consequences to insurers and the public as a result of the changed policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and the <em>Metromedia </em>standards is not only a matter of fairness, but a means of informing regulators of possibly unanticipated dimensions of a contemplated rule. Here, for example, hearings on the new rule might well have presented the Commissioner with issues such as impact on solvency of given insurance companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and impact on market availability of voluntary private insurance, to be considered with the benefits of returning excess premiums to insureds of profitable companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We reverse and remand for recalculation of excess profits under the 1988 order, consistent with the methods employed in the two prior years.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">17.-29A-5.2.
