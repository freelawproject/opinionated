He was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation and a $25 Y.C.C.B. penalty. Approximately three months later, the Middlesex County Probation department issued a warrant for his arrest and a notice charging him with having violated his probation by failing to report to his probation officer as ordered, failing to notify his probation officer of a change of address, and failing to pay his $25 V.C.C.B. penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Mr. Hyman was eventually arrested on the warrant for violation of probation, but not until approximately six years after its issuance. By that time his term of probation had expired. He pleaded guilty to having violated the conditions of probation, his probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment on his 1981 conviction for aiding and abetting robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Before this court, defendant claims that his arrest was illegal because it was not properly authorized and because it took place more than six years after the commencement of his probation. We disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Defendant was arrested pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(2), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">A probation officer or peace officer, upon request of the chief probation officer or otherwise having probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a condition of the order or that he has committed another offense, may arrest him without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>In this case, the probation officer who signed the authorization for defendant\u2019s arrest had probable cause to do so because Mr. Hyman\u2019s violations of probation\u2014failure to report, failure to notify his probation officer of a change of address, and failure to pay his V.C.C.B. penalty\u2014were within the knowledge of the probation department. Although a violation of probation is not itself a crime, the statute authorizing the arrest of a probationer \u201cupon request of the chief probation officer or otherwise having probable cause to believe that the defendant has failed to comply with a requirement imposed as a condition of the order [for probation]\u201d is constitutional because of the special status of a probationer. <em>State v. Bollinger, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 562 (App.Div.1979); <em>see Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>868, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>3164, 3168, 97 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>709 (1987), <em>State v. Garcia, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 338 (App.Div.1984). Furthermore, even if defendant\u2019s arrest were illegal, the validity of his conviction for violation of probation would be unaffected. <em>State v. Mulcahy, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>398, 404-405 (App.Div.1985), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 107 <em>N.J. </em>467, 483 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">A defendant may be incarcerated for violation of probation only if the revocation proceeding was commenced within the period of probation either as originally fixed or as tolled pursuant to statute. <em>R. </em>3:21-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-2; <em>State v. DeChristino, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291 (App.Div.1989); <em>cf. State v. Gibson, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 526-531 (App.Div.1978). Defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation on September 21, 1981. When he was arrested on September 29,1987, more than five years had elapsed. The State cites <em>State v. Williams, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481 (App.Div.), certif. den. 69 <em>N.J. </em>80 (1975), for the proposition that the period of defendant\u2019s probation was tolled while he \u201cremain[ed] away or hidden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485. However, that case was based upon a statute which has been repealed since the decision was rendered. <em>See State v. DeChristino, supra. </em>The only pertinent tolling statute currently in force is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3c which states, \u201cThe com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>mencement of a probation revocation proceeding shall toll the probationary period until termination of such proceedings----\u201d The legality of the revocation of defendant\u2019s probation and of his resentencing for the 1981 crime therefore depends upon whether the revocation proceedings were \u201ccommenced\u201d prior to September 21, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In <em>State v. DeChristino, supra, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">Neither ... statute nor any court rule prescribes how a probation proceeding shall be commenced, but neither is there any provision that arrest of the probationer or effective service of notice upon him is necessary to constitute \"commencement\u201d of the probation proceeding for purposes of tolling the probation period. Although the issue is not before us in the present case, we assume that the preparation of a formal notice of violations and the issuance of a warrant for the probationer\u2019s arrest would constitute the \u201ccommencement of a probation revocation proceeding\u201d which would toll the probationary period, provided that reasonably diligent efforts to effect service were unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In <em>DeChristino, </em>we did not have to decide what constituted the \u201ccommencement\u201d of a probation revocation proceeding because there no steps at all had been taken to initiate such a proceeding before expiration of the probationary period. In the present case, the State contends that the issuance of a notice of violation of probation and the authorization for defendant\u2019s arrest on December 16, 1981, constituted the \u201ccommencement\u201d of a probation revocation proceeding. However, there is no evidence in the record whether the probation department made \u201creasonably diligent efforts to effect service\u201d within the probationary period. Faced as we now are with the necessity of deciding whether proof of such efforts is essential, we hold that a defendant, like Mr. Hyman, who concededly attempted to evade apprehension is estopped from contending that the State was not \u201cdiligent\u201d in seeking to find him. Consequently, the issuance of the notice of violations and the warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest tolled the expiration of his probation period and the 1987 revocation proceedings were commenced within time.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
