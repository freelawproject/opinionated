This suit is based on the fact that during successive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>transports by the Piscataway Police and the Middlesex County Sheriffs Department she was restrained by leg shackles. According to her deposition, she told one of the arresting police officers, defendant Alice Townsend, that she had a \u201cphysical problem\u201d with one leg. This complaint was at no time repeated either to the Piscataway Police or to anyone else during her transportation to the correction facility where she was detained. Although she did not experience any pain during the arrest, she claims she later developed tendonitis in her left leg as a result of the shackling. Thus, she sues the arresting \u2022 officers, the Township of Piscataway and the County of Middlesex for personal injury. She grounds her claim for relief in alleged constitutional violations pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 and pursuant to the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-1(a) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-2(a). This appeal is taken from summary judgments in favor of all defendants dated June 14, 1988, and January 23, 1989. The import of the trial court\u2019s finding was that, on the undisputed facts, placing leg shackles on the plaintiff was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental function and that excessive force was not used in carrying out the arrest. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The summary judgment procedure \u201cis designed to provide a prompt, businesslike and inexpensive method of disposing of any cause which a discriminating search of the merits in the pleadings, depositions and admissions on file, together with the affidavits submitted on the motion clearly shows not to present any genuine issue of material fact requiring disposition at a trial.\u201d <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74 (1954) (citation omitted). Where there is no genuine issue of fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the procedure is properly invoked. <em>United Advertising Corp. v. Metuchen, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>193, 196 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim of a constitutional deprivation under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 relies upon an asserted violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. It has been held, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>that the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment is not applicable to pretrial detainees. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>520, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1861, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>447 (1979). Such claims must be analyzed in terms of due process. <em>Id., </em>441 U.S. at 535, 99 S.Ct. at 1872, 60 L.Ed.2d at 466. \u201cDue process requires that a pretrial detainee not be punished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>441 U.S. at 535, n. 16, 99 S.Ct. at 1872, n. 16, 60 L.Ed.2d at 466, n. 16. The Eighth Amendment guaranty applies only after a \u201cformal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>fn. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The test applied in \u00a7 1983 cases is that of \u201cthe objective reasonableness\u201d of an official\u2019s conduct. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>800, 818, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2727, 2738, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>396, 410 (1982). \u201cObjective reasonableness\u201d is also the standard under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States where a claim arises from the seizure of one\u2019s person. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1865, 1868, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>443 (1989). We are required to \u201c \u2018balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1, 8, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1694, 1699, 85 L.Ed.2d 1, 7 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>696, 703, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2637, 2642, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Stated differently, a determination must be made as to whether a reasonable relationship exists between the physical restrictions imposed during pretrial detention and the fulfillment of a legitimate governmental function. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>at 538, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1873, 60 L.Ed.2d at 468. The same standard has been held applicable in New Jersey in determining questions of good faith arising under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3. <em>Hayes v. Mercer County, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 621-622 (App.Div.1987), certif. den. 108 <em>N.J. </em>643 (1987). As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Kirk v. City of Newark, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>173, 187 (1988), the question of \u201cobjective rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>sonableness\u201d ordinarily arises on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3 specifically provides that a public employee \u201cis not liable if he acts in good faith in the execution or enforcement of any law.\u201d The officers here were acting under the auspices of a lawfully issued warrant. While, for purposes of security, opinions may differ as to the necessity for the leg shackles, nothing in the circumstances presented takes this precaution outside the broad range of reasonableness. It has been held, after all, that the use of shackles while transporting a prisoner is within the sound discretion of a custodial officer to prevent escape and protect the public safety. <em>State v. Jones, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>596, 599-600 (Law Div.1974). Before the shackles were applied, plaintiff informed her custodians only of the fact that she had a \u201cproblem\u201d with her leg. No further details were furnished, the statement was at no time repeated during the period of her arrest or detention and plaintiff does not allege that the restraints were applied maliciously or so as to inflict pain. We conclude that the conduct of the arresting officers was objectively reasonable both within the sense of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 and under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Plaintiff further protests that she was not given an opportunity to provide the court with a report of Henry Branche, a purported expert in police practices, in support of her claim. We have read the Branche report. It merely sets forth the the contents of various ordinances concerning the use of restraining devices and concludes with Mr. Branche\u2019s opinion that the use of leg shackles in this case constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The proffered conclusion implicates a question of constitutional law and clearly falls outside the area of Mr. Branche\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
