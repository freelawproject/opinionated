We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-16\">In April 1994, Washington was convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine. This court affirmed Washington\u2019s conviction and sentence in July 1997. Washington then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari; his petition was denied on October 6, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Washington v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 895, 118 S.Ct. 239, 139 L.Ed.2d 169 (1997). Following the denial of his certiorari petition, Washington completed and signed pro se a form \u00a7 2255 motion, dating the motion October 6, 1998. Washington\u2019s motion was received by the clerk of the district court on October 21,1998. The Government moved to dismiss, contending that Washington had failed to file his motion within \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. The district court dismissed Washington\u2019s motion as untimely. We review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-20\">AEDPA provides that, barring other circumstances not relevant here, the one-year limitation period to file a motion to vacate runs from the \u201cdate on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This court has yet to address at what point a conviction becomes final in cases where a defendant is unsuccessful on appeal and thereafter files a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The courts that have addressed the question have uniformly held that the time period begins to run when the Supreme Court either denies certiorari or issues a decision on the merits. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>203 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Marcello, </em>212 F.3d 1005, 1008 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 188, 148 L.Ed.2d 130 (2000); <em>Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570 (3d. Cir.1999); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>180 F.3d 349, 352 (1st. Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1126, 120 S.Ct. 958, 145 L.Ed.2d 831 (2000); <em>United States v. Simmonds, </em>111 F.3d 737, 744 (10th Cir.1997). We are persuaded by the analysis of our sister circuits and hold that Washington\u2019s conviction became final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>on October 6, 1997, the day the Supreme Court denied his certiorari petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\">The question therefore becomes whether Washington\u2019s motion was filed within AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a) provides that \u201c[i]n computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by ... any applicable statute, the day of the act, event or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a). Here, the time for Washington to file his \u00a7 2255 motion was triggered by the October 6, 1997 denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court. Applying AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations in the light of Rule 6(a) and computing the time from the day following the Court\u2019s decision, we conclude that Washington had until October 7, 1998 to file his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">The district court dismissed Washington\u2019s motion because it was not received by the clerk until October 21, 1998. This was in error. We have previously held that a prisoner\u2019s pro se \u00a7 2255 motion is deemed filed the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing. <em>See Adams v. United States, </em>173 F.3d 1339, 1340-41 (11th Cir.1999). The Government now concedes that the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d should have been applied in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">Under the mailbox rule, the burden is on prison authorities to prove the date a prisoner delivered his documents to be mailed. <em>See Garvey v. Vaughn, </em>993 F.2d 776, 781 (11th Cir.1993). Absent evidence to the contrary in the form of prison logs or other records, we will assume that Washington\u2019s motion was delivered to prison authorities the day he signed it, October 6, 1998. The Government has offered no evidence to support a conclusion that the motion was delivered at a later date. Because Washington\u2019s motion was delivered to prison authorities within one year of his judgement of conviction becoming final, the motion was timely and the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1356-17\">. The district court's finding that the Supreme Court denied Washington\u2019s petition on October 9, 1997 was in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">. At the time it moved to dismiss Washington\u2019s motion as untimely, the Government failed to call to the attention of the district court either the mailbox rule or the facl that it should be applied in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
