It is, therefore, clear to this court that if the Insular district court of San Juan should'render its decision in accordance with the .motion there pending, the previous status of the original litigation would be restored, including the former receivership;.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The rule is well established that in order to avoid unfortunate conflicts of jurisdiction between Federal courts and local courts, that court which first obtained jurisdiction of a controversy shall retain jurisdiction, except in certain limited classes of cases. Nothing has been called to my attention in the pleadings as they now stand in this court which entitles me to interfere at the present time with the proceedings in the Insular district court of San Juan.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">If the. facts are true, as set forth in the second ground of the answer now before me, it seems clear to me that I am without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>jurisdiction. It would, however, be unfair to the complainants to dismiss tbeir bill without giving them an opportunity to deny and prove, if they can, that a mistake has been with reference to the status of the litigation in the Insular district court of San Juan.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">I, therefore, at this time direct and order that the present bill be dismissed unless the complainants shall either amend their bill or join issue upon the second ground of the present answer, on or before the 19th day of February, 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">ISTo receiver will be named by me at this time, but the right is reserved to these complainants to renew their application for a receiver at any time before the date last mentioned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
