It is clear that this court would have no power whatever to transfer a case to a municipal court unless the United States attorney and counsel for the accused both consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Therefore, I am obliged to revoke my action of November 5, 1923, and the case will be recalled from the municipal court, and the trial will take place later in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">To this ruling counsel for the accused excepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Done and Ordered in open court at San Juan, Porto Pico, this 19th day of November, 1923.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
