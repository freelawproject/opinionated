Cassady, an attorney, performed legal services for a client, Rallie P. Rallis, for over 20 years. During that period, Cassady practiced law with several firms and in a variety of capacities. For a 13-month period, Cassady was employed as of counsel by Morgan Lewis. Years later, Rallis sued Cassady, Morgan Lewis, and other firms and attorneys with whom Cassady had been affiliated, for a variety of claims including professional negligence, premised on numerous aspects of Cassady\u2019s and those entities\u2019 representation occurring over a multiyear period. Morgan Lewis provided a defense for several other attorneys, but not for Cassady. After incurring legal fees for his defense, Cassady sought indemnity from Morgan Lewis under Labor Code section 2802,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires employers to indemnify employees for expenses or losses incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties. Morgan Lewis prevailed on a summary judgment motion that disposed of Cassady\u2019s claims, but the trial court subsequently reversed course and granted Cassady a new trial. Morgan Lewis appeals from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial. Under section 2802, an employer must indemnify an employee for attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in defending a third party lawsuit, where such expenses are necessary and the lawsuit is based on the employee\u2019s conduct within the course and scope of his or her job duties. Because proof that the defense costs were incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties is an element of the claim, the employee has the burden to prove the conduct on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>which he or she was sued arose in the course and scope of the employment. To meet that burden on the somewhat unique facts of this case, Cassady bears the burden to prove which expenses he incurred as a result of performance of his duties with Morgan Lewis as opposed to other employers. However, Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion failed to show that Cassady lacked, or could not obtain, sufficient evidence to prove this element of his claim. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we likewise conclude Morgan Lewis failed to meet its burden to prove Cassady lacked evidence to establish his common law indemnity claim. Therefore, the trial court appropriately granted the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">1. <em>The Rallis action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Attorney Cassady served as legal counsel for Rallis and for various corporations and business entities in which Rallis was an officer, director, or shareholder, from 1969 until November 1994. During that period, Cassady practiced with several different law firms, including Morgan Lewis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was Rallis\u2019s principal contact at each firm. As of January 1987, Cassady, practicing as Cassady Corporation, was a partner of Hahn Cazier. In February 1987, substantially all the attorneys and employees of Hahn Cazier joined the Morgan Lewis firm. Cassady was employed by Morgan Lewis as of counsel for approximately 13 months, from February 1, 1987, through March 4, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On January 4, 1995, Rallis sued Cassady, Morgan Lewis, and other firms and attorneys with whom Cassady had practiced while representing Rallis (the Rallis action). Rallis alleged legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligent and intentional misrepresentation, and equitable indemnity, for alleged acts of professional negligence committed by Cassady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and the other defendants between approximately 1982 through 1994. Some of the conduct upon which Rallis\u2019s claims were premised was alleged to have occurred while Cassady was employed by Morgan Lewis; some was alleged to have occurred while Cassady practiced with other law firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Rallis\u2019s revised second amended complaint alleged that Cassady, and the various firms with whom Cassady was associated at the applicable time periods, had advised and represented Rallis in regard to the formation, acquisition, and affairs of various business entities, including Mark Industries, Inc., American Hi-Lift Corporation of California, and Mark Equipment Center of South Florida (MEC-SF). Cassady was also alleged to have been a co-shareholder, officer and director in various businesses which Rallis formed or acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Rallis complaint further alleged that in 1984, MEC-SF terminated Edward Moloney, the company\u2019s general manager and a 10 percent stockholder. During the period 1984 through 1987, Cassady precipitated Moloney\u2019s lawsuit by mishandling negotiations and failing to keep Rallis apprised of the risks and progress of the matter. Rallis also alleged professional negligence and related claims in regard to a plethora of other transactions, including: the acquisition of a competitor in 1984; the sale of a property to a corporate officer in 1984; the sale of MEC-SF\u2019s assets in 1986 and the subsequent windup of its affairs; the handling of distributions to MEC-SF stockholders in or after 1986; a 1988 stock sale and indemnity agreement; a 1990 Mark Industries transaction; and a 1993 proposed stock offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">2. <em>Defense and resolution of the Rallis action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Morgan Lewis retained the law firm of Sheppard Mullin to defend it and certain former Hahn Cazier partners in the Rallis action. Morgan Lewis did not provide a defense to Cassady, who had already retained his own counsel, Baird A. Brown. Brown also defended Cassady Corporation, Cassady &amp; Klein, Ray Klein, and Klein Corporation in the Rallis action. Morgan Lewis subsequently advised Cassady that it would not indemnify Cassady or pay his defense fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">By 1999, all Rallis\u2019s claims had been dismissed either voluntarily, on demurrer, or through summary adjudication and summary judgment. The summary judgments were granted on statute of limitations grounds. Rallis appealed. This court affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>(Rallis v. Cassady </em>(Oct. 24, 2000) B127047, B131724, opn. ordered nonpub. Jan. 24, 2001.) We reversed the judgments in favor of Cassady, Cassady Corporation, Cassady &amp; Klein, and another defendant. We affirmed the judgments in favor of Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Lewis and Hahn Cazier. Cassady and the other remaining defendants entered into a settlement agreement with Rallis, and the case was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">3. <em>The parties\u2019 indemnity claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In July 2002, Cassady sued Morgan Lewis for indemnity, under both section 2802 and the common law. Cassady sought fees and costs of approximately $280,000, plus interest, and the attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in enforcing his section 2802 rights. (\u00a7 2802, subd. (c).) Cassady\u2019s indemnity demand included defense costs arising from his alleged conduct both at Morgan Lewis and while a partner at Hahn Cazier.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Morgan Lewis cross-complained against Cassady and certain other defendants in the Rallis action, seeking (1) contractual indemnity based upon a 1987 agreement between Cassady and Morgan Lewis, (2) reimbursement under section 2865,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) declaratory relief. Morgan Lewis sought approximately $367,000 in fees and costs it incurred defending the Rallis action.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Cassady moved for summary adjudication on Morgan Lewis\u2019s section 2865 indemnity claim. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Morgan Lewis moved for summary judgment against Cassady, on the ground Cassady could not establish essential elements of his claims. Morgan Lewis contended, in regard to Cassady\u2019s section 2802 indemnity claim, that: (1) Cassady did not possess, and could not, reasonably obtain, evidence demonstrating which defense costs he necessarily expended in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties while at Morgan Lewis; and (2) Cassady could not establish Morgan Lewis\u2019s liability under section 2802 based solely on what Rallis alleged Cassady did while employed at Morgan Lewis. Morgan Lewis argued that Cassady\u2019s common law indemnity claim, like the section 2802 claim, \u201cmust fail because Cassady does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain the needed evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Cassady responded, inter alia, that \u201cthe law is that [Morgan Lewis] is responsible for all of Cassady\u2019s fees and costs in the Rallis action except to the extent that [Morgan Lewis] can provide a reasonable basis for apportioning the fees and costs.\u201d Cassady conceded that certain transactions about which Rallis had complained were not indemnifiable because they occurred when Cassady was not employed at Morgan Lewis. Cassady estimated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the cost of defending those actions was $10,000. According to Cassady, the remaining attorney\u2019s fees he incurred defending the Rallis action amounted to approximately $280,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The trial court granted Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion on the grounds advanced by Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The trial court then conducted a bench trial on Morgan Lewis\u2019s cross-complaint, and ruled in Cassady\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">4. <em>Cassady\u2019s motion for a new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Cassady moved, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 657, for a new trial on the ground the trial court committed legal error when granting Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657, subd. (7).) The trial court granted the motion, concluding it had erred when it granted Morgan Lewis summary judgment. In its oral ruling, the court stated that while Cassady had the burden to prove his damages were necessary and in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties during the time he worked with Morgan Lewis, a triable issue of fact existed with regard to how attorney\u2019s fees should be apportioned. The trial court\u2019s minute order granting the motion did not contain a specification of its reasons for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Morgan Lewis timely appealed the new trial order. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(4).) Cassady filed a protective cross-appeal from the portion of the judgment granting summary judgment to Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Morgan Lewis contends Cassady had the burden to prove what portion of expenses he necessarily incurred in direct consequence of his employment with Morgan Lewis, and to distinguish expenses attributable to the time he practiced law elsewhere. The trial court\u2019s original grant of summary judgment was proper, Morgan Lewis asserts, because it was undisputed that Cassady did not possess, and could not reasonably obtain, evidence to make such an apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Cassady urges that apportionment of indemnifiable expenses is not required because at least some of his defense costs arose from the discharge of his duties while at Morgan Lewis, and claims arising from his representation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Rallis while employed at Morgan Lewis and at other firms were factually intertwined. Further, Cassady asserts that if apportionment is required, it should be Morgan Lewis\u2019s burden because Morgan Lewis refused to provide his defense. Finally, assuming he bears the burden of apportioning fees, Cassady urges that Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion was wrongly granted because Morgan Lewis failed to establish Cassady does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, the evidence necessary to make such an apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">1. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A decision granting summary judgment may be challenged by a motion for a new trial. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 858 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]; <em>Scott v. Farrar </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 462, 467 [188 Cal.Rptr. 823].) A new trial may be granted under Code of Civil Procedure Code section 657, subdivision 7, if the original ruling was erroneous as a matter of law. <em>(Ramirez </em>v. <em>USAA Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 391, 397 [285 Cal.Rptr. 757].) Normally, an order granting a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>at p. 859; e.g., <em>Sole Energy Co. v. Petrominerals Corp. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 187, 194 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 790].) However, as Morgan Lewis points out, the trial court\u2019s order granting the new trial was procedurally deficient. Code of Civil Procedure section 657 requires that the trial court state the grounds and reasons for its grant of a new trial in writing, either in the order itself or in a separate statement filed within 10 days. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657; <em>Thompson v. Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 544, 549 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 51]; <em>Stewart v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 468, 484 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 338].) The failure to supply an adequate specification of reasons or grounds renders the new trial order defective, but not void. <em>(Sanchez-Corea v. Bank of America </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 892, 896, 900 [215 Cal.Rptr. 679, 701 P.2d 826]; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center, supra, </em>at p. 550.) Under such circumstances the party seeking a new trial has the burden to sustain his or her position on appeal. <em>(Sanchez-Corea v. Bank of America, supra, </em>at p. 900; <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at p. 550.) Here, the trial court did not prepare the mandated specification of reasons. Accordingly, Cassady has the burden to sustain his position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The ruling at issue is the grant of Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion. \u201cAn order granting summary judgment, of course, is reviewed independently.\u201d <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 860; see <em>Kahn v. East Side Union High School Dist. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 990, 1003 [4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 103, 75 P.3d 30]; <em>State Dept, of Health Services v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1034-1035 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 441, 79 P.3d 556].) Summary judgment should be granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Kahn v. East Side Union High School Dist., supra, </em>at pp. 1002-1003; <em>Tucci v. Club Mediterranee </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 180, 185 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">2. <em>Section 2802.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Section 2802 provides, in pertinent part, \u201c(a) An employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties, or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer, even though unlawful, unless the employee, at the time of obeying the directions, believed them to be unlawful, [f] . . . [][] (c) For purposes of this section, the term \u2018necessary expenditures or losses\u2019 shall include all reasonable costs, including, but not limited to, attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Section 2802 thus requires an employer to indemnify an employee who is sued by third persons for conduct in the course and scope of his or her employment, including paying any judgment entered and attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in defending the action. <em>(Jacobus v. Krambo Corp. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1100 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 425]; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Herald-Examiner </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 449, 461 [123 Cal.Rptr. 683]; <em>Grissom v. Vons Companies, Inc. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 52, 57 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 808]; <em>Plancarte v. Guardsmark </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 640, 647 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 315]; <em>Los Angeles Police Protective League v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 168, 177 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 574].) As long as the employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment, the right to indemnity is not dependent upon a finding that the underlying action was unfounded. <em>(Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>at pp. 1100-1101; but see <em>O\u2019Hara </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union Local #856 </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 151 F.3d 1152, 1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The elements of a section 2802, subdivision (a) cause of action, as delineated by the statutory language, are: (1) the employee made expenditures or incurred losses; (2) the expenditures or losses were .incurred in direct consequence of the employee\u2019s discharge of his or her duties, or obedience to the directions of the employer; and (3) the expenditures or losses were necessary. The second element, at issue here, is met if \u201cthe conduct defended against was within the course and scope of employment.\u201d <em>(Jacobus v. Krambo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101; see <em>Devereaux v. Latham &amp; Watkins </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1583 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 849].) \u201cIn determining whether for purposes of indemnification an employee\u2019s acts were performed within the course and scope of employment, the courts have looked to the doctrine of respondeat superior. [Citations.] [][] Under that doctrine, an employer is vicariously liable for risks broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer\u2014that is, for an employee\u2019s conduct that, in the context of the employer\u2019s enterprise, is \u2018not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>at p. 1101; see also <em>Plancarte v. Guardsmark, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 648; <em>Devereaux v. Latham &amp; Watkins, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1583-1584.) An employee\u2019s conduct may fall within the scope of his or her employment \u201ceven though the act does not benefit the employer, even though the act is willful or malicious, and even though the act may violate the employer\u2019s direct orders or policies.\u201d <em>(Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>at p. 1102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Whether an employee\u2019s acts are within the scope of employment is ordinarily a question of fact, but may be resolved as a question of law when the material facts are undisputed and no conflicting inferences are possible. <em>(Farmers Ins. Group </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1019 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 478, 906 P.2d 440]; <em>Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Here, unlike in the typical section 2802 case, there is no dispute that Cassady\u2019s representation of Rallis while at Morgan Lewis was within the scope of his employment. Instead, the question is the application of section 2802 when the defense costs arose from Cassady\u2019s alleged conduct spanning a period during which he was employed by several different successive employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">a. <em>Morgan Lewis must indemnify Cassady, if at all, only for defense costs arising from Cassady\u2019s representation of Rallis while employed by Morgan Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">When interpreting a statute, we look to the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words, which are generally the most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Stephens v. County of Tulare </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 793, 801-802 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 134 P.3d 288]; <em>Fitch v. Select Products Co. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 812, 818 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 591, 115 P.3d 1233].) The plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>language of section 2802 makes clear that Morgan Lewis is responsible for indemnifying Cassady, if at all, only for those defense costs arising from aspects of Cassady\u2019s representation of Rallis undertaken during the period Cassady was employed by Morgan Lewis. Defense costs arising from Cassady\u2019s conduct when he was practicing law elsewhere do not meet the statutory criteria: They simply cannot have been incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of duties for Morgan Lewis. Requiring Morgan Lewis to indemnify Cassady for costs of defense based on alleged malpractice while he was working at other firms would contradict the express scope of the indemnity provided for by section 2802. Therefore, we necessarily reject Cassady\u2019s theory that Morgan Lewis must indemnify him for nearly all his defense costs because defense of the work-related claims cannot easily be disentangled from defense of the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Cassady, however, contends that, where claims involve a common core of facts and are based on related legal theories, attorney\u2019s fees need not be apportioned. (See, e.g., <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129-130 [158 Cal.Rptr. 1, 599 P.2d 83] [\u201cAttorney\u2019s fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed\u201d]; <em>Bell v. Vista Unified School Dist. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 672, 687 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 263] [\u201cApportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney\u2019s time into compensable and noncompensable units\u201d]; <em>Liton Gen. Engineering Contractor, Inc. v. United Pacific Insurance </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 577, 588 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 200] [where liability of two parties was \u201cso factually interrelated that it would have been impossible to separate the activities involved in [an] arbitration into compensable and noncompensable time units,\u201d allocation was not required]; <em>Drouin v. Fleetwood Enterprises </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 486, 493 [209 Cal.Rptr. 623] [\u201cAttorneys fees need not be apportioned between distinct causes of action where plaintiff\u2019s various claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">But none of these cases assist Cassady, in that they did not involve application of section 2802. Section 2802 is not an attorney\u2019s fees statute; it is an indemnity statute. It expressly conditions the right to indemnity on a showing that the expenditures arose as a direct consequence of the discharge of the employee\u2019s duties. If the expenditures did not arise from discharge of the employee\u2019s duties, indemnity under section 2802 cannot be had. (See <em>Douglas v. Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>On the other hand, where Cassady incurred fees on an issue common to defense of Rallis\u2019s claims arising <em>both </em>from periods he was and was not employed by Morgan Lewis, indemnity is proper. <em>Reynolds Metals Co. </em>v. <em>Alperson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 124, is instructive. In <em>Reynolds, </em>the plaintiff sued on a consignment agreement, which did not include an attorney\u2019s fee provision, and on promissory notes, which did. The action was resolved adversely to the plaintiff, and attorney\u2019s fees were awarded to the defendants. <em>Reynolds </em>concluded that the defendants could <em>not </em>recover fees incurred solely for defending causes of action based on the consignment agreement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 129.) However, the court further reasoned that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s joinder of causes of action should not dilute its right to attorney\u2019s fees. Attorney\u2019s fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 129-130.) Expenses common to both the promissory note and the consignment agreement therefore qualified for the fee award. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Analogously here, the fact Cassady worked for or was associated with more than one employer should not dilute his right to indemnity for costs incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties at Morgan Lewis. Thus, if Cassady\u2019s counsel performed work necessary to defense of a claim or issue predicated on <em>both </em>his conduct while at Morgan Lewis and elsewhere, indemnity for those fees is appropriate. (Cf. <em>Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 129-130.) Such defense costs would fall within section 2802\u2019s ambit because they would have been incurred in the defense of the Morgan-Lewis-related claims, even in the absence of the non-Morgan-Lewis-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">b. <em>Cassady bears the burden of proving which defense costs are attributable to his representation of Rallis while employed by Morgan Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We likewise reject Cassady\u2019s argument that Morgan Lewis should bear the burden of apportioning defense fees between itself and other law firms. As we have observed, one of the elements of Cassady\u2019s section 2802 claim is that the expenditures or losses\u2014here, the costs of defense of the Rallis action\u2014 were incurred in direct consequence of Cassady\u2019s discharge of his duties for Morgan Lewis. As noted, to establish this, it must be shown that the conduct defended against was within the course and scope of Cassady\u2019s employment with Morgan Lewis. (\u00a7 2802, subd. (a); <em>Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Evidence Code section 500 provides, \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.\u201d Under Evidence Code section 500, the plaintiff normally bears the burden of proof to establish the elements of his or her cause of action. <em>(Sargent Fletcher, Inc. v. Able Corp. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1658, 1668 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">In rare instances, the burden of proof set forth in Evidence Code section 500 is altered. \u201cIt is true that \u2018[t]he general rule allocating the burden of proof applies \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law.\u201d The exception is included in recognition of the fact that the burden of proof is sometimes allocated in a manner that is at variance with the general rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 660-661 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179].) In deciding whether to shift the normal allocation of the burden of proof, \u201c \u2018the courts consider a number of factors: the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact, the availability of the evidence to the parties, the most desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact, and the probability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Ibid.; see <em>Sargent Fletcher, Inc. v. Able Corp., supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th at p. 1670.) However, the exceptions to Evidence Code section 500 are \u201cfew, and narrow\u201d <em>(Sargent Fletcher, Inc. v. Able Corp., supra, </em>at p. 1670), and the normal allocation of proof has been altered only on \u201crare occasions\u201d <em>(National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc. v. King Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1346 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 207]). Shifting the burden of proof \u201cfrom the plaintiff to the defendant rests on a policy judgment that there is a substantial probability the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing and the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing makes it practically impossible for the plaintiff to prove the wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1346, and cases cited therein; <em>Sargent Fletcher, Inc. v. Able Corp., supra, </em>at pp. 1670-1671, and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Cassady fails to persuade us that we should alter the normal burden of proof here. The evidence necessary to establish the facts essential to Cassady\u2019s claim\u2014i.e., what work he performed for Rallis while employed at Morgan Lewis\u2014does not lie peculiarly within Morgan Lewis\u2019s knowledge and competence. To the contrary, the relevant evidence is primarily within Cassady\u2019s knowledge and control. (See generally <em>Wolf v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 35-36 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 860].) Cassady, far better than Morgan Lewis, knows what professional services he performed for Rallis during which time periods, and has better access to the relevant evidence. Morgan Lewis is especially unlikely to have ready access to information or evidence about what services Cassady performed for Rallis during periods when Cassady was not employed by Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>No public policy would be served by requiring employers to indemnify for expenses attributable to an employee\u2019s conduct while working for a different employer. \u201cIt would be unfair to force an employer to pay for employee torts that are unconnected with the activities of the business. [Citation.] Forcing liability upon an employer for torts that do not arise from the enterprise contravenes the basic rationale underlying the theory of respondeat superior.\u201d <em>(Bailey v. Filco, Inc. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1567 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 333].) The \u201cobvious purpose\u201d of section 2802 is \u201cto protect employees from suffering expenses in direct consequence of doing their jobs.\u201d <em>(Grissom v.

Here, Rallis alleged malpractice and other claims occurring over a roughly 12-year period. Cassady was employed by Morgan Lewis for only approximately 13 months of that time. No public policy would be served by forcing Morgan Lewis to foot the bill for defense of claims arising from conduct that occurred while Cassady was not employed by the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Finally, Morgan Lewis is not alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing that makes it practically impossible for Cassady to prove his claims. To the extent Cassady may find it difficult to apportion his defense costs because of a lack of detail in his attorney\u2019s billing records, that circumstance cannot be attributed to Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Cassady asserts that apportionment should be \u201ca Morgan Lewis problem, not a Cassady problem\u201d because \u201cMorgan Lewis put itself in this situation by ignoring Labor Code section 2802 and refusing to defend Cassady in the first place.\u201d He argues, \u201cWhere, as here, the employer ignores its duty under section 2802 and forces the employee to defend himself, the burden of apportioning the employee\u2019s defense costs between claims arising from the employment and other claims ought to fall on the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Implicit in Cassady\u2019s argument is the suggestion that certain principles applicable in the insurance law context should apply to section 2802. In the insurance context, in a \u201cmixed\u201d action\u2014i.e., one in which some claims are potentially covered and others are not\u2014an insurer has a duty to defend the <em>entire </em>action \u201cprophylactically, as an obligation imposed by law in support of the policy.\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 49 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766], fn. omitted; see <em>State of California v. Pacific Indemnity Co. </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1535, 1546-1547 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 69]; Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2005) ][ 7:629, p. 7B-40.1.) The insurer\u2019s duty to defend is not apportioned based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the period of coverage. <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., supra, </em>at p. 1548.) When an insurer <em>refuses </em>to defend an action in which a potential for coverage exists, the insured may recover defense costs, including attorney\u2019s fees allocable to the defense of noncovered claims, unless the insurer can prove they were unreasonable or unnecessary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1548-1549, 1555; see also <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 64 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909]; Croskey et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:691.15, at p. 7B-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The instant situation resembles the \u201cmixed\u201d action scenario, in that certain aspects of the defense of the Rallis action are potentially indemnifiable, whereas other aspects\u2014the portions of the Rallis action based upon Cassady\u2019s conduct when he was <em>not </em>employed by Morgan Lewis\u2014are clearly not (at least not by Morgan Lewis). Despite this superficial similarity, insurance principles have no application here. \u201c \u2018An insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and an insured [citations], the insurer making promises, and the insured paying premiums, the one in consideration for the other, against the risk of loss [citations].\u2019 [Citation.] The insurer\u2019s promises require it both to indemnify and to defend its insured. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co., supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1546.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">First, the record is not entirely clear as to whether or when Cassady tendered his defense to Morgan Lewis, or simply sought reimbursement of his attorney\u2019s fees after the fact. Assuming Cassady requested Morgan Lewis defend him, however, Morgan Lewis\u2019s failure to furnish defense counsel does not mean it must later indemnify Cassady for all defense costs. Section 2802 does not impose a duty to defend upon an employer. The existing caselaw on this point is contradictory. (Compare <em>Grissom v. Vons Companies, Inc., supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 57-58 with <em>Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1100.) <em>Douglas v. Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at page 461, stated that section 2802 \u201crequires an employer to defend or indemnify an employee who is sued by third persons for conduct in the course and scope of his employment.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>further reasoned that if an employer \u201celects to run a risk and refuses to defend and indemnify an employee who is sued as a result of acts and conduct within the scope of his employment, then the employer must bear the consequences of Labor Code section 2802 if it is established that the employee was sued as a result of acts and conduct within the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>(Douglas v. Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>at p. 464.) <em>Douglas </em>concluded, \u201cwhen an employer refuses to defend an employee in an action which may or may not be unfounded for conduct which may or may not have been within the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and scope of his employment and it is ultimately established that the action was unfounded and the employee acted within the course and scope of his employment, then the employer has an obligation under Labor Code section 2802 to indemnify the employee for his attorney\u2019s fees and costs in defending the action.\u201d <em>(Douglas, supra, </em>at p. 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><em>Grissom v. Vons Companies, Inc., supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pages 57 through 58, explained why the statement in <em>Douglas </em>was \u201ctoo broad. Section 2802 does not say that an employer must \u2018defend\u2019 an employee. The word \u2018defend\u2019 does not appear in section 2802. The statute merely requires the employer to <em>indemnify </em>the employee for all that the <em>employee necessarily expends </em>in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee\u2019s duties. The focus of the actual words of the statute is on the <em>employee\u2019s </em>expenditure. If <em>that </em>expenditure is necessarily in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee\u2019s duties, then the employer must \u2018indemnify\u2019 (i.e., reimburse) the employee.\u201d <em>(Grissom v. Vons Companies, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 57-58, fn. omitted.) <em>Grissom </em>also pointed to the dictionary definition of \u201cindemnify,\u201d which does not mean \u201cdefend.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 58, fn. 3.) An employer may obviate the need to indemnify for attorney\u2019s fees by providing counsel under some circumstances (see <em>id. </em>at p. 58), but it is not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">More recently, <em>Jacobus v. Krambo Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th 1096, citing <em>Douglas, </em>stated that section 2802 \u201crequires the employer not only to pay any judgment entered against the employee for conduct arising out of his employment but also to defend an employee who is sued for such conduct.\u201d <em>(Jacobus </em>v. <em>Krambo Corp., supra, </em>at p. 1100; see also <em>Plancarte </em>v. <em>Guardsmark, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at pp. 647-648 [section 2802 \u201cobligates the employer not only to pay any judgment entered against the employee for conduct arising out of his employment but also to defend an employee sued by a third person for such conduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On this point, we believe <em>Grissom </em>has the better view. It is certainly true, as <em>Douglas </em>reasoned, that the employer who declines to provide a defense must pay the defense costs if it is determined that the acts for which the employee was sued arose in the course and scope of employment. However, as <em>Grissom </em>reasoned, section 2802 does not expressly include a requirement to defend; it speaks only in terms of indemnification. \u201c \u2018Indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(McCrary Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Metal Deck Specialists, Inc. </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1536 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 624].) Defense and indemnity are distinct concepts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>duty to indemnify requires payment of money, while the duty to defend entails the \u201c \u2018rendering of a service, viz., the mounting and fimding of a defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945, 958 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94]; see Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>][ 7:501.1, p. 7B-1.) Certainly, if the Legislature wished to impose a duty to defend as well as the duty to indemnify, it knew how to do so. (Compare \u00a7 2802 with Gov. Code, \u00a7 995 [expressly providing that, upon request, a public entity \u201cshall provide for the defense of any civil action or proceeding\u201d brought against certain public employees on account of acts or omissions in the scope of employment].) Nor is the indemnity requirement at issue here based upon a contract between the parties. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 2778, subd. 4 [requiring that, when an indemnity contract is interpreted, a person indemnifying is bound to defend actions brought against the person indemnified in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity, absent a showing of a contrary intent].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In any event, section 2802 does not transform an employer into an insurer. Even the authorities that impose a duty to defend have been careful to clarify that the duties imposed by section 2802 are not coterminous with an <em>insurer\u2019s </em>duty to defend. \u201cUnlike an insurer, the employer need not defend whenever there is a mere potential for liability.\u201d <em>(Jacobus </em>v. <em>Krambo Corp., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1100; <em>Plancarte </em>v. <em>Guardsmark, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 648 [same].) As <em>Douglas </em>explained, in a section 2802 action, \u201cthe right of recovery is derived from a statute rather than an insurance policy. Since the statutory right is based upon a state of fact (if he is sued \u2018in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties as such, or of his obedience to the directions of the employer\u2019 etc.) it must logically follow that <em>if the statutorily defined state of facts does not exist then the statutory rights do not arise.\u201d (Douglas v. Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 464, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Further, \u201cThere are significant differences between an insurer and an employer/indemnitor.\u201d <em>(Boyer v. Jensen </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 62, 73 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 124].) \u201cLiability insurers protect insureds against damage or liability from generally defined risks in exchange for a premium. [Citation.] Insurers have a distinct and free-standing duty\u201d to defend their insureds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>(Heppler v. J.M Peters Co. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1282 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 497].) When an indemnity contract imposes the duty to defend, that duty is not triggered until it is determined that the proceeding against the indemnitee is embraced by the indemnity. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Because principles applicable in the insurance context do not apply here, Morgan Lewis\u2019s failure to defend Cassady does not mandate that Morgan Lewis reimburse Cassady for attorney\u2019s fees allocable to the defense of claims premised on Cassady\u2019s conduct while employed somewhere other than Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In sum, we hold Cassady must prove, as an element of his section 2802 cause of action, that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs he seeks arose from the discharge of his duties while at Morgan Lewis. We next turn to the question of whether Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion established Cassady did not possess, and could not obtain, evidence to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">3. <em>Morgan Lewis failed to carry its initial burden on summary judgment that Cassady did not possess, and could not obtain, evidence proving that at least some of the costs of defending the Rallis action were incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">a. <em>Summary judgment standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In moving for summary judgment, a \u201c \u2018defendant. . . has met\u2019 his \u2018burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if\u2019 he \u2018has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant. . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff ... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Aguilar v.

Although he remains free to do so, the defendant need not himself conclusively- negate any such element\u2014for example, himself prove <em>not </em>X.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 853-854, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fns. omitted.) A defendant may show an element cannot be established by presenting evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 855; <em>Kahn v. East Side Union High School Dist., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 1003; <em>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. </em>v. <em>Helliker, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 1155.) Morgan Lewis could satisfy its initial burden to show an absence of evidence through \u201cadmissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>at p. 855), or through discovery responses that are factually devoid. <em>(Union Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653].) Argument alone is insufficient. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>at p. 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In opposing a defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of his or her pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, \u201cmust \u2018set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Aguilar v.

Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion attempted to make that showing primarily in two ways. First, Morgan Lewis\u2019s fact No. 14\u2014which Cassady did not dispute\u2014averred, \u201cCassady and his counsel admit that Cassady\u2019s claim against Morgan Lewis for indemnification under Labor Code section 2802 is based upon the allegations in the Rallis [ajction.\u201d In support, Morgan Lewis offered various discovery and deposition excerpts in which Cassady affirmed that the basis for his indemnity claim was the Rallis action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Douglas v. Los </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 449, Morgan Lewis argues Cassady \u201ccould not establish Morgan Lewis\u2019s liability under [s]ection 2802 based solely on what Rallis <em>alleged </em>Cassady did,\u201d but instead \u201cmust show that the <em>actual conduct </em>for which he was sued was committed while employed by\u201d Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">It is true that the allegations in a complaint do not, at trial, constitute evidence of the truth of the allegations made therein <em>(San Diego Police Officers Assn. v. City of San Diego </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1736, 1744 &amp; fn. 8 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 253]), and a party cannot rely on its own pleadings as evidence to support or oppose a summary judgment motion. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 849; <em>College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 720, fn. 7 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 898, 882 P.2d 894].) But here, Rallis\u2019s complaint was evidence of the lawsuit Cassady was required to defend against. Whether true or not, Rallis\u2019s allegations necessarily defined the scope of the action; Cassady\u2019s defense costs arose from the necessity to defend against the allegations in the complaint. The mere fact Cassady\u2019s indemnity claim was \u201cbased upon\u201d the allegations in the Rallis complaint therefore does not establish a lack of evidence. To the contrary, it is difficult to imagine what else the indemnity claim <em>could </em>have been \u201cbased upon.\u201d Neither the language of Morgan Lewis\u2019s undisputed fact No. 14, nor the evidence cited in support thereof, established an absence of evidence that Cassady was sued, at least in part, because of his representation of Rallis while employed at Morgan Lewis. Instead, undisputed fact No. 14 set forth the unremarkable proposition that Cassady\u2019s defense costs were necessitated by the Rallis action, and the scope of the defense was framed by Rallis\u2019s particular allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Moreover, the evidence cited in support of fact No. 14 did not demonstrate the absence of evidence. One cited interrogatory called for Cassady to specify each act he contended he was sued for in the Rallis action. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Cassady responded by referencing the Rallis complaint and summaries thereof prepared by Morgan Lewis\u2019s attorneys. Given that the interrogatory was expressly framed in terms of what the Rallis action alleged, criticism that the response referenced the complaint seems misplaced. Two of the cited deposition excerpts set forth Cassady\u2019s theory about why he should be indemnified for his representation of Rallis while employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>elsewhere. While Cassady\u2019s theory may have been incorrect, his responses did not demonstrate a lack of evidence that at least some of the defense expenses arose due to his rendering of professional services to Rallis while employed by Morgan Lewis. Thus, undisputed fact No. 14 and the evidence offered in support did not suffice to shift the burden to Cassady to show a triable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><em>Douglas v. Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 449, does not compel a contrary conclusion. In that case, a newspaper reporter was sued over a series of articles he had written, allegedly using documents that had been illegally obtained. After the newspaper refused to defend the action, the reporter obtained his own counsel and later sought reimbursement of his attorney\u2019s fees and costs under section 2802. The trial court held for the newspaper. (50 Cal.App.3d at pp. 456-457.) It held that \u201cif [the reporter] did what [the plaintiff] alleged that he did, it would have been outside the scope of his employment,\u201d and that the newspaper \u201chad no knowledge that what [the reporter] in fact did was outside the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 464.) The appellate court reversed, concluding that the trial court had failed to make a finding on a material issue of fact, and the findings made did not support the judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 462.) The trial court should have made a finding regarding the truth of the reporter\u2019s allegation that the acts for which he was sued were undertaken at the direction of the newspaper. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 457, 463.) In this context, <em>Douglas </em>reasoned that \u201c[t]he test is not what the third person <em>\u2018alleges\u2019 </em>but what were the facts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We do not read <em>Douglas </em>as standing for the principle that a defendant sued for malpractice and related claims cannot reference the allegations of the third party\u2019s complaint as relevant to a determination of the necessary scope of his defense. Instead, <em>Douglas </em>stands for the prosaic proposition that a trier of fact called upon to determine whether conduct was actually within the scope of employment must make a factual finding rather than simply treating the allegations in the third party complaint as true. The problem in <em>Douglas </em>was the trial court\u2019s finding that the facts as alleged in the third party complaint established the reporter\u2019s actions were outside the scope of his employment, whereas the evidence might have shown the contrary. That is not the problem here. Unlike in <em>Douglas, </em>in the instant matter there appears to be no dispute that Cassady\u2019s representation of Rallis, while at Morgan Lewis, was within the scope of his employment. Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment motion did not offer any evidence showing Cassady did not represent Rallis, or did not represent Rallis on the matters underlying the Rallis action, while employed by Morgan Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In a further attempt to prove an absence of evidence, Morgan Lewis presented the following. When Cassady was asked at his deposition for the basis of his claim he should be indemnified for costs arising from his representation of Rallis during periods when he was employed by Hahn Cazier, Cassady responded that it was \u201cdifficult to try to cut this problem with a sharp knife\u201d and that the parties had not \u201cbeen able to do it\u201d in prior discovery. Second, Cassady\u2019s defense counsel\u2019s time entries were not segregated by cause of action or by \u201cwhich allegations [counsel] was focusing on with respect to which entity [Cassady was] with at a particular time.\u201d Third, Cassady\u2019s supplemental response to an interrogatory stated, among other things, \u201cThere is no factual basis to apportion the subject fees and costs. There is no factual basis for partial, full or comparative indemnity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">None of this evidence was sufficient to meet Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment burden. As Cassady points out, the interrogatory response cited by Morgan Lewis was made in response to an interrogatory asking for facts supporting Cassady\u2019s <em>denial </em>of an allegation or affirmative defense and <em>related to Cassady\u2019s defense of Morgan Lewis\u2019s claim for indemnity against Cassady. </em>Morgan Lewis\u2019s claim for indemnity against Cassady was based in part on a contract between the parties, not section 2802. At least as presented on the record before us, the cited evidence does not establish Cassady lacked, and could not obtain, evidence on his section 2802 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The other cited discovery responses suggest it may be difficult for Cassady to prove which defense costs related to his work at Morgan Lewis. They do not, however, establish Cassady cannot obtain evidence to prove at least some of the defense costs were necessary expenditures incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties. (See, e.g., <em>Heppler v. J.M. Peters Co., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4t10h at p. 1297 [\u201c \u2018although time-keeping and billing procedures may make a requested segregation difficult, they do not, without more, make it impossible\u2019 \u201d].) Morgan Lewis fails to consider that other methods besides an attorney\u2019s billing statements could be used in this regard. As Cassady argues, there appears to be no reason why his attorney could not testify regarding the amount of fees expended on claims or issues relating to Cassady\u2019s representation of Rallis while at Morgan Lewis. (See <em>Steiny &amp; Co. v. California Electric Supply Co. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 920] [\u201cAn attorney\u2019s testimony as to the number of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.\u201d].) Other avenues, such as expert testimony, might also be feasible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Buss v. Superior Court, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 42 [expert retained by party determined cost of defense of one cause of action].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>In short, Morgan Lewis\u2019s evidence did not foreclose the possibility of Cassady obtaining evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Nor were the cited discovery responses factually inadequate. As noted above, Morgan Lewis points to no evidence in which, for example, Cassady admitted he did not perform services for Rallis, or did not work on the matters that formed the basis for Rallis\u2019s complaint, while at Morgan Lewis. Morgan Lewis\u2019s failure to ask more pointed and specific questions does not establish an absence of evidence. <em>(Gulf Ins. Co. v. Berger, Kahn, Shafton, Moss, Figler, Simon &amp; Gladstone </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 114, 136 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 534] [\u201cWe cannot assume that all information was provided to an interrogatory that was not propounded.\u201d]; <em>Scheiding </em>v. <em>Dinwiddie Construction Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 80 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 360] [\u201cplaintiff had no duty to volunteer information that was not requested\u201d]; see <em>Gaggero v. Yura </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Indeed, our review of the Rallis complaint suggests that the claims, which may and may not be indemnifiable, are not so fatally intertwined as to make apportionment impossible. For example, Rallis\u2019s second and eighth causes of action are premised entirely on conduct occurring during the period Cassady was employed by Morgan Lewis. The third and fourth causes of action, in contrast, were premised upon alleged conduct occurring at periods when Cassady was <em>not </em>employed by Morgan Lewis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the most part, Rallis alleged particular failings occurring at specified dates or periods. Thus, while it may not be easy for Cassady to prove which defense costs arose from the scope of his employment, it is clearly not impossible. In sum, Morgan Lewis has not met its burden to show Cassady cannot reasonably obtain evidence to prove the elements of his claim. Because Morgan Lewis did not meet its burden to prove no triable issue of fact existed, Morgan Lewis\u2019s summary judgment was improperly granted and the trial court correctly granted Cassady\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">4. <em>The common law indemnity claim.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The order granting a new trial is affirmed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinions expressed herein.

When an employee is sued for actions arising during the course of employment, the employer is often sued as well. Furnishing a defense to the employee may in some cases avoid duplication of efforts and minimize the risk of greater financial exposure later if the employee fails to present a competent defense.

Cassady replied, \u201cwe need to look at what Rallis alleged and it is defending the allegations of Rallis so that if Rallis alleged something that needed to be defended because it was an allegation against Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius then it would be defended. It doesn\u2019t have to do so much or may not be limited to the conduct while I was at MLB.\u201d When asked whether he contended Morgan Lewis was responsible for defense costs relating to Cassady\u2019s conduct after he left the firm, Cassady replied, \u201cit depends in part on what Mr. Rallis alleges.
