We reverse his conviction because section 4573.5, by its plain language, does not apply to controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">The relevant facts in this case are simple and undisputed. In an unrelated case, defendant was required to surrender himself to authorities at Lake County Jail, Hill Road Detention Facility (the facility) in April 2005 after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>being sentenced to a term in county jail. Before doing so, defendant sent a letter to various Lake County officials, including the sheriff, advising them that he was a \u201cqualified patient\u201d pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 11362.7, subdivisions (f) and (h), and a lifetime user of marijuana for chronic pain pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 11362.7, subdivision (f), among other things. He requested that facility officials make an accommodation to him for his use of marijuana for medical purposes, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 11362.785, subdivision (c), and stated that he intended to bring to the facility 72 wafers containing cannabis extract and three ounces of cannabis extract in olive oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">In a written response personally delivered to the defendant, the facility\u2019s chief custody officer and facility commander stated that defendant could not bring his marijuana into the facility, cited section 4573.5, and stated that if defendant chose \u201cto bring onto or possess any drug on facility grounds under my direction you will be arrested and charged with a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">When defendant surrendered himself at the facility, he was searched and a usable amount of marijuana in wafer and oil form was found in his possession. An information was subsequently filed charging defendant with one count of unlawfully bringing a drug into a correctional facility in violation of section 4573.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">A court trial was held, at which the parties stipulated that defendant has a \u201cdoctor\u2019s card\u201d authorizing him to use marijuana for personal medical purposes. The relevant facts were not disputed. Defendant was convicted of violating section 4573.5, and the court subsequently suspended the imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for five years. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">Defendant contends that his conviction should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that he violated section 4573.5, since it only prohibits bringing unauthorized \u201cdrugs, other than controlled substances\u201d into a county correctional facility, which defendant contends does not include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>\u201cmedical marijuana\u201d he brought into the facility. The People contend that section 4573.5\u2019s ambit extends to medical marijuana. We conclude that defendant\u2019s analysis is correct, based upon the plain language of section 4573.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Sections 4573 and 4573.5 are two of several criminal statutes included in chapter 3 of title 5 of the Penal Code, regarding offenses relating to prisons and prisoners. Generally speaking, they criminalize bringing into penal institutions and the like, or possessing or selling in penal institutions and the like or among prisoners, drugs and/or certain controlled substances, among other things. \u201cObviously, the ultimate evil with which the Legislature was concerned was drug use by prisoners. Nevertheless, it chose to take a prophylactic approach to the problem by attacking the very presence of drugs and drug paraphernalia in prisons and jails.\u201d <em>(People v. Gutierrez </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 380, 386 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 561].) \u201cThe obvious purpose of these statutes is \u2018to deter the presence of illicit drugs in custodial institutions\u2019; the statutes are \u2018deemed necessary to ensure orderly administration and security within such institutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 522, 536 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 927].) We construe these statutes together. (See <em>People v. Gutierrez, supra, </em>at p. 386; <em>People v. Buese </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 802, 807 [34 Cal.Rptr. 102] [sections 4573, 4573.5 and 4573.6 were intended to be read \u201czn <em>pari materia </em>and should be construed together\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Sections 4573 and 4573.5 prohibit, respectively, the \u201cbringing into\u201d penal institutions and the like of unauthorized \u201ccontrolled substances, the possession of which is prohibited by division 10 (commencing with section 11000) of the Health and Safety Code,\u201d and \u201cdrugs other than controlled substances.\u201d Section 4573.6 is very similar to section 4573, but focuses on \u201cpossession in\u201d penal institutions and the list of unauthorized controlled substances, the possession of which is prohibited by division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (Division 10). Section 4573.8 is very similar to section 4573.5, except that it too focuses on possession <em>and </em>applies to unauthorized \u201cdrugs in any manner, shape, form, dispenser, or container,\u201d without excluding controlled substances. Section 4573.9 makes it a felony to sell, among other things, unauthorized controlled substances the possession of which is prohibited by Division 10 in penal institutions and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">As we have already stated, section 4573, under which defendant was <em>not </em>charged, states in relevant part that it is a felony to bring any unauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>controlled substance, \u201cthe possession of which is prohibited by Division 10 (commencing with section 11000) of the Health and Safety Code\u201d into a county correctional facility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant contends that since medical marijuana is a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d which, pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 11362.5, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 enacted by proposition (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.5, subd. (a); <em>People v. Konow </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 995, 1002 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 301, 88 P.3d 36]), is excepted from Division 10\u2019s prohibitions against marijuana possession, he could not have been convicted under section 4573. This issue is not before us because the People declined to charge him under this section. Accordingly, we do not determine whether or not defendant could have been convicted pursuant to section 4573. (See <em>People v. Fenton </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 965, 967-968 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 52] [reversing conviction pursuant to section 4573 of a defendant who checked into county jail with a controlled substance, temazepam, for which he had a prescription].) However, the references to controlled substances in Division 10 contained in sections 4573, 4573.6, and 4573.9 are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Defendant <em>was </em>convicted pursuant to section 4573.5, which makes it a felony to bring unauthorized \u201cdrugs, other than controlled substances\u201d into county correctional facilities, among other places.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute that defendant entered a county correctional facility with medical marijuana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>and that he had a \u201cdoctor\u2019s card,\u201d which gave him the right to possess this medical marijuana. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11362.5,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 11362.7 et seq. [the Medical Marijuana Program Act].) Therefore, we are faced with a purely legal question: Is defendant, having brought medical marijuana into a county correctional facility, subject to section 4573.5? We conclude that he is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">\u201c \u2018As in any case involving statutory interpretation, our fundamental task here is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent so as to effectuate the law\u2019s purpose. [Citation.] We [must] begin by examining the statute\u2019s words, giving them a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider the statutory language \u201cin isolation.\u201d [Citation.] Rather, we [must] look to \u201cthe entire substance of the statute ... in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision .... [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.] That is, we [should] construe the words in question \u201c \u2018in context, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.] We must harmonize \u201cthe various parts of a statutory enactment... by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Reeves </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 765, 783 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 4, 110 P.3d 1218], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">We also must bear in mind that \u201c \u2018[i]f there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cWhere the statute is clear, courts will not \u2018interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) \u201cAn exception to that principle is a situation in which to follow a statute\u2019s plain meaning \u2018 \u201c \u2018would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fenton, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 969, quoting <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 102, 113 [145 Cal.Rptr. 674, 577 P.2d 1014].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">We employ these rules of statutory construction to determine whether or not medical marijuana falls into the category of \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d or \u201cdrugs other than controlled substances,\u201d and, if it is a \u201ccontrolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>substance,\u201d whether section 4573.5\u2019s ambit nonetheless extends to a person who brings medical marijuana to a correctional facility, as the People urge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">I. <em>Medical Marijuana Is a Controlled Substance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Sections 4573, 4573.5, 4573.6, and 4573.9 each refer to \u201ccontrolled substances,\u201d but none of them actually define the term. Sections 4573, 4573.6, and 4573.9, however, expressly refer to those controlled substances which possession is prohibited in Division 10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given that we must construe the subject statutes together (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 386; <em>People v. Buese, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.2d at p. 807), we look to Division 10 for a definition of the \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d referred to in section 4573.5 to determine if it extends to defendant\u2019s medical marijuana. Clearly, it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Health and Safety Code section 11007 states that a \u201c \u2018[controlled substance,\u2019 unless otherwise specified, means a drug, substance, or immediate precursor which is listed in any schedule in Section 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057, or 11058.\u201d Health and Safety Code section 11054, which lists schedule I controlled substances, includes marijuana, among others, in subdivision (d). (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11054, subd. (d)(13).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">If this were not sufficient, there are other clear indications within Division 10 that medical marijuana is a controlled substance. Health and Safety Code sections 11362.5, and 11362.7 et seq., relating to medical marijuana, are also in Division 10. Furthermore, Health and Safety Code section 11362.775 provides that certain persons who collectively or cooperatively cultivate medical marijuana shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to criminal sanctions under, among other provisions, Health and Safety Code sections 11366 and 11366.5, each of which expressly applies to \u201ccontrolled substances.\u201d (See <em>People v. Urziceanu </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 747, 782-786 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 859] [noting that the Legislature exempted certain persons who collectively or cooperatively cultivate marijuana for medical purposes from certain criminal sanctions involving controlled substances].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the medical marijuana at issue in the present case is a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as that term is used in section 4573.5. Therefore, we must determine whether, as a controlled substance, it falls within section 4573.5\u2019s ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>II. <em>Section 4573.5 Excludes Controlled Substances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">We are required by rules of statutory interpretation to \u201c[examine] the statute\u2019s words\u201d and give them \u201ca plain and commonsense meaning.\u201d <em>(In re Reeves, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 783.) In doing so, we can only conclude that the Legislature intended to exclude \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d from section 4573.5\u2019s ambit, as section 4573.5 does exactly that by its reference to \u201cany drugs, <em>other than controlled substances.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">The People argue that we should read sections 4573 and 4573.5 together, and construe the reference to \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d in section 4573.5 to mean \u201ccontrolled substance[s], <em>the possession of which is prohibited by Division 10 (commencing with Section 11000) of the Health and Safety Code,\u201d </em>as is stated in section 4573. (Italics added.) Under this construction, defendant\u2019s medical marijuana would fall within the \u201cdrugs\u201d referred to in section 4573.5, since the exclusion of \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d is sufficiently limited so as not to include medical marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The People argue that their interpretation is the only one that makes sense, since we must construe the statutes together, and since the Legislature \u201cchose to take a prophylactic approach to\u201d \u201cthe ultimate evil [of] drug use by prisoners\u201d \u201cby attacking the very presence of drugs and drug paraphernalia in prison and jails.\u201d <em>(People v. Gutierrez, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 386.) They argue further that to construe the statutes as defendant urges would \u201ceffectively nullify the purpose of these statutes,\u201d and result in an \u201cabsurd loophole\u201d that prevents correctional officials from policing medical marijuana in correctional facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">While we agree that the statutes must be read together, we disagree with the remainder of the People\u2019s analysis. The People\u2019s interpretation is obviously incorrect in light of section 4573.5\u2019s plainly worded exclusion of controlled substances, which contains no ambiguity whatsoever. To add the qualification proposed by the People would require that we step beyond our judicial function and rewrite the statute, which we cannot do. \u201cIn the construction of a statute ... the office of the Judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted[.]\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) \u201cWe are not authorized to insert qualifying provisions not included, and may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number><em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 573 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086]; accord, <em>Priebe v. Nelson </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 1112, 1139 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 553, 140 P.3d 848].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Furthermore, while the statutes involved are prophylactic in their approach to drugs and controlled s\u00fabstances in prisons, they nonetheless contain noteworthy parameters and differences. Sections 4573 and 4573.5, which criminalize the \u201cbringing in\u201d of certain unauthorized substances to penal institutions and the like, have retained their parameters regarding drugs and controlled substances as discussed herein since the 1940\u2019s. (Amendments, Deering\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (1992 ed.) foll. \u00a7 4573, p. 248; <em>id. </em>foll. \u00a7 4573.5, p. 251 [referring to \u201cnarcotics\u201d rather than \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d].) Moreover, in 1990, section 4573.5 was amended at the same time as section 4573.8 was enacted. (Stats. 1990, ch. 1580, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5, pp. 7555, 7556.) Yet the Legislature, while it criminalized the unauthorized possession of \u201cchugs in any manner, shape, form, dispenser, or container\u201d in section 4573.8, retained the phrase \u201cany drugs, other than controlled substances\u201d in section 4573.5. (\u00a7\u00a7 4573.8, 4573.5; see Amendments, Deering\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 4573.5, p. 251.) \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Where a statute with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 26 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899].) Therefore, it is significant that the Legislature, while not including the \u201cother than controlled substances\u201d language in the newly enacted section 4573.8, chose not to eliminate it from the revised section 4573.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">We also cannot declare the \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d exception in section 4573.5 to be absurd, as the People suggest. To the contrary, it is conceivable that the Legislature has declined to criminalize the bringing of certain controlled substances, possession of which is allowed as stated in Division 10, into penal institutions and the like so as not to unnecessarily subject their possessors to criminal sanctions. This is also consistent with electorate\u2019s disinclination to criminalize possession of medical marijuana as indicated in Health and Safety Code section 11362.5, which states as one of its purposes \u201c[t]o ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.5, subd. (b)(1)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>The People also argue that correctional officials would lose control over their facilities if we adopt defendant\u2019s interpretation. A virtually identical argument was rejected in <em>People v. Fenton, supra, 20 </em>Cal.App.4th at pages 969-970, in considering whether or not an inmate who brought into a penal institution a controlled substance for which he had a prescription was subject to section 4753.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">The <em>Fenton </em>court pointed out: \u201cThe Director of Corrections has the authority to prescribe and amend rules for the administration of prisons. (\u00a7 5058.) In addition, the counties have the authority to make reasonable rules and regulations for the administration of [the] county jails. (See \u00a7 4019, subd. (c).) The failure of section 4573 to proscribe smuggling prescribed controlled substances into a penal institution does not prevent penal institutions from imposing specific rules on whether controlled substances for which the inmate has a physician\u2019s prescription can be introduced into the institution. In other words, smuggling a prescribed controlled substance into a penal institution is not deemed desirable or permissible just because the Legislature, whether or not inadvertently, has not made it a felony.\u201d <em>(People v. Fenton, supra, </em>20 Cal.App.4th at p. 970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">This same administrative approach can be used to regulate the bringing of medical marijuana into penal institutions, to the extent that a person cannot be convicted under section 4573.5 for doing so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in this opinion is intended or should be construed to stand for the contrary, nor is anything herein intended to suggest that such persons cannot be convicted of criminal conduct under any statute other than section 4573.5 as it is presently stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Kline, P.
