J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXP\">Martha Chamay appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer filed by Chamay\u2019s former attorney, Joseph M. Cobert, and his law firm, Joseph Cobert, a Professional Corporation (the Cobert firm), to Chamay\u2019s fourth amended complaint for professional negligence/legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Because each cause of action is adequately pleaded, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">1. <em>Chamay\u2019s Dispute with Her </em>Neighbors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">In 1995 Chamay and her husband, David Chamay, purchased approximately two and one-half acres of a 60-acre tract in Calabasas subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>certain conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&amp;R\u2019s). The tract had been subdivided in the 1980\u2019s into four lots: three improved lots and one large 26-acre unimproved lot. Richard and Pamela Aronoff purchased the 26-acre unimproved lot in 1998. After land subsidence damaged a sloped portion of the tract directly impacting the Aronoffs\u2019 lot and extending to the primary private road through the tract, the Aronoffs demanded each of the neighbors pay one-fourth of the $72,000 cost to repair the slope, relying on language in the CC&amp;R\u2019s they claimed required contribution when the expenditure for slope repair was for the benefit of the entire subdivision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Chamays refused the Aronoffs\u2019 demand for payment, claiming the CC&amp;R\u2019s did not require their contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">2. <em>The Underlying Lawsuit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Aronoffs sued the Chamays in October 2001, seeking to recover $18,903.64 from the Chamays in a limited civil action. The Aronoffs also sought prejudgment interest and attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the action pursuant to a fee-shifting provision in the CC&amp;R\u2019s.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Chamays, who were \u201cunsophisticated in legal matters,\u201d retained Cobert to represent them in connection with the Aronoffs\u2019 lawsuit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>3. <em>The Retainer Agreement with the Cobert Firm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">According to the written retainer agreement between the Cobert firm and the Chamays, attached as an exhibit to the operative fourth amended complaint, the Cobert firm agreed to provide legal services to the Chamays on a \u201ctime and charge\u201d basis. The agreement specifically states, \u201cNo guarantees of any specific results can be made and our fee is not contingent upon any specific results.\u201d The retainer agreement also provides the Chamays would be billed monthly and, if the Cobert firm did not receive any billing inquiry from the Chamays within 10 days after the billing statement had been sent, the firm would assume the Chamays did not dispute the billing statement\u2019s accuracy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">4. <em>The Cobert Firm\u2019s Representation of the Chamays</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">According to Charnay, Cobert initially recommended the Chamays settle the Aronoffs\u2019 action; however, when Cobert learned during his initial meeting with the Chamays that they had \u201cother unresolved issues with other tract owners,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cobert, recognizing an opportunity to generate significant attorney fees, changed his recommendation and suggested the Chamays vigorously defend the lawsuit and pursue a cross-complaint for declaratory relief, reformation, breach of fiduciary duty and indemnity against the Aronoffs and other neighbors in the 60-acre tract. Believing they had a meritorious defense to the Aronoffs\u2019 lawsuit and a meritorious cross-complaint, the Chamays followed Cobert\u2019s advice and authorized Cobert and the Cobert firm to defend (rather than settle) the action and file the cross-complaint against each of their neighbors. The Chamays\u2019 cross-complaint elicited a separate cross-action by the Chamays\u2019 neighbors to recover homeowners\u2019 assessments that had been withheld by the Chamays. Cobert did not tell the Chamays of their potential exposure to liability for the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees if they did not prevail in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>5. <em>The Underlying Judgment and Attorney Fee Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">After lengthy discovery, unsuccessful summary judgment motions, and a 15-day bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment against the Chamays on the Aronoffs\u2019 complaint, the neighbors\u2019 cross-complaint and the Chamays\u2019 cross-complaint. Chamay was ordered to pay $18,903.64 as repair costs to the Aronoffs, $25,800 in unpaid homeowner assessments (that she alleges Cobert advised her to withhold during the lawsuit) and the aggregate sum of $580,000 for the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in the CC&amp;R\u2019s. For their part, Cobert and the Cobert firm billed Chamay more than $360,000 for services provided in connection with the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">6. <em>The Instant Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">a. <em>The legal malpractice claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The first cause of action for professional negligence in the operative fourth amended complaint<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alleged Cobert and the Cobert firm breached their duty of care by advising Chamay to defend (rather than settle) the Aronoffs\u2019 action and to file a separate action against the other neighbors concerning the Chamays\u2019 right to withhold homeowners\u2019 assessments. Cobert proffered this advice knowing that both actions could expose the Chamays to liability for attorney fees far in excess of the $18,903.64 at issue in the Aronoffs\u2019 lawsuit, but did not inform the Chamays of that possibility. According to Chamay, but for Cobert\u2019s negligence, misrepresentations and omissions, she would have been able to settle the Aronoffs\u2019 lawsuit for no more than $25,000, the maximum recovery available in the limited civil action. Instead, as a result of Cobert\u2019s breach of duty, a judgment was entered against her for more than $600,000. To satisfy the judgment and her own approximately $400,000 attorney fee obligation, Chamay was forced to deplete her personal savings and retirement income and sell her home. Had Chamay been advised of the consequences of not prevailing, including the risk of being held liable for the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees were she to lose at trial, she would not have acceded to Cobert\u2019s advice to go forward with the litigation and would not have continued with the litigation in the face of escalating litigation costs on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>b. <em>Breach of fiduciary duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In her second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, Chamay alleged Cobert and his firm breached their fiduciary duties by billing for tasks never performed, billing at Cobert\u2019s billing rate for tasks performed by his secretaries and office assistants, and assuring Chamay she would recover all of her attorney fees in the action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">c. <em>Breach of contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In her third cause of action for breach of contract, Chamay alleged she and Cobert orally modified the November 2001 written retainer agreement in March 2004 when Cobert agreed not to require payment for any legal bills until the conclusion of the litigation. Other than that modification, the November 2001 retainer agreement, with its corresponding billing rates therein outlined, remained unchanged. Chamay alleges Cobert breached the retainer agreement by inflating the bills and billing for tasks at his billing rate that were never performed or were performed by others with much lower billing rates than those charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">d. <em>Fraud and negligent misrepresentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In her fourth cause of action for fraud and deceit and her fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, Chamay alleged she had repeatedly expressed her concerns to Cobert about the escalating costs in connection with the litigation and continued to pursue the litigation only because Cobert had repeatedly assured her the opposing parties could not prevail and she would recover all her attorney fees from the opposing parties at the end of the litigation. According to Chamay, Cobert made this representation even though he knew or should have known there was a substantial probability Chamay would not prevail on any of the claims in the underlying action and she would be liable for the opposing parties\u2019 fees as well as her own. Chamay alleged Cobert made these representations specifically to induce her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>continue with the litigation so that he could continue to generate attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">7. <em>The Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Cobert and the Cobert firm filed a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint and successfully requested (over Charnay\u2019s objection) the court take judicial notice of the CC&amp;R\u2019s recorded in the official records of the Los Angeles County Recorders Office. The trial court sustained the demurrer to the fourth amended complaint without leave to amend, concluding each of the claims was legally deficient and entered judgment against Charnay.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">On appeal from an order dismissing a complaint after the sustaining of a demurrer, we independently review the pleading to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317]; <em>Berger v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 989, 998 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 583].) We give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, \u201ctreat[ing] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded\u201d but do not \u201cassume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aubry, </em>at p. 967.) We liberally construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 452; <em>Kotlar v. Hanford Fire Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1120 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 246].) \u201cIf the trial court has sustained the demurer, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action. If the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, as here, we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment. [Citation.] If we find that an amendment could cure the defect, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, no abuse of discretion has occurred. [Citation.] The plaintiff has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.\u201d <em>(Schifando </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">2. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">a. <em>Charnay adequately stated a claim for legal malpractice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">To state a cause of action for legal malpractice, a plaintiff must plead \u201c(1) the duty of the attorney to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>(Coscia v. McKenna &amp; Cuneo </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1194, 1199 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 25 P.3d 670].) To show damages proximately caused by the breach, the plaintiff must allege facts establishing that, <em>\u201cbut for </em>the alleged malpractice, it is more likely than not the plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result.\u201d <em>(Viner v. Sweet </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232, 1244 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 70 P.3d 1046]; see Judicial Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instns. (2006) CACI No. 601 [plaintiff must prove he or she \u201cwould have obtained a better result if [defendant] had acted as a reasonably careful attorney\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In the instant case, Charnay alleged she retained Cobert and the Cobert firm to assist her in understanding her rights and obligations under the CC&amp;R\u2019s and to advise her in connection with the Aronoffs\u2019 lawsuit. She alleges Cobert breached his duty of care to her by failing to properly advise her of her obligation to contribute to the slope repair and to pay homeowner assessments required under the CC&amp;R\u2019s and, most particularly, to advise her of her potential exposure to the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees if she did not prevail in the Aronoffs\u2019 action or her cross-action. As for damages, she alleges that, had she been properly advised, she would have settled the lawsuit for no more than the maximum $25,000 amount recoverable in a limited civil action, far less than the $600,000-plus judgment (exclusive of interest) entered against her at the end of the protracted litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">In ruling that Charnay had not alleged damages \u201cproximately caused\u201d by the breach, the trial court reasoned the fourth amended complaint failed to include facts showing the Aronoffs would have agreed to such a settlement. And, according to the trial court, absent such allegations, any suggestion that Charnay would have received a more favorable outcome but for Cobert\u2019s breach is too speculative to state a claim. (See <em>Thompson v. Halvonik </em>(1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>36 Cal.App.4th 657, 663 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 142] (Thompson) [\u201cabsent evidence that Vesper would have settled with respondents under exactly the same circumstances it settled with the Padway firm, actual harm from respondents\u2019 conduct is only a subject of surmise, given the myriad of variables that affect settlements of medical malpractice actions\u201d]; <em>Marshak </em>v. <em>Ballesteros </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1514, 1519 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] (Marshak) [\u201c[P]laintiff simply alleges that the case was worth more than he settled it for. He proffered no evidence to establish the value of his case, other than his own declaration that the family residence was worth more, and the accounts receivable were worth less, than they were valued at for the purposes of settlement. Even if he were able to prove this, however, he would not prevail. For he must <em>also </em>prove that his ex-wife would have settled for less than she did, or that, following trial, a judge would have entered judgment more favorable than that to which he stipulated.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In contrast to <em>Thompson, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th 657, and <em>Marshak, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 1514, both decided on summary judgment, this is not a case where the allegations of the likelihood of settlement or the settlement amount are too speculative, at least to state a claim at this early stage of the proceedings. Chamay adequately alleged she was prepared to resolve the action and that, but for the advice of counsel to defend the action and file a cross-complaint against the neighbors (generating a cross-complaint by them against her), the Aronoffs\u2019 action would have been resolved for $25,000 or less. Contrary to Cobert\u2019s argument (adopted by the trial court in sustaining the demurrer), Chamay need not expressly allege the Aronoffs would have accepted such a settlement; Implicit in the allegation that the case could have been settled for the maximum amount recoverable in a limited civil action is that, having filed a lawsuit seeking less than $19,000, the Aronoffs, at least at an early step of the litigation before they had incurred significant attorney fees, would have been willing to settle the case at or near the $25,000 level.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Alternatively, resolution of the case for an amount close to $25,000 could have been achieved, even without the Aronoffs\u2019 consent, by allowing a default judgment to be entered against the Chamays. Finally, as Chamay argued in the hearing on demurrer, whether the Chamays could have settled the matter for the $25,000 figure alleged as opposed to some greater amount (inclusive of additional attorney fees) is immaterial. Chamay need only allege that, but for Cobert\u2019s malpractice, she would have obtained a \u201cmore favorable result\u201d than the $600,000-plus judgment ultimately rendered against her. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>(Viner v. Sweet, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1244.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of course, whether Chamay will be able to prove the element of damages or any of the other elements of her legal malpractice cause of action remains to be determined. At this stage of the proceedings, however, Chamay has alleged facts sufficient to state a professional negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">As an alternative basis for sustaining the demurrer to her legal malpractice cause of action, the trial court mled the CC&amp;R\u2019s put Chamay on constructive notice of her obligation to pay the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees in any action arising under the CC&amp;R\u2019s. Because she was on notice of her potential liability for the opposing parties\u2019 attorney fees, the court reasoned, she can claim no damages \u201cproximately caused\u201d by Cobert\u2019s failure to advise her of that possibility, notwithstanding her allegation that she relied on Cobert\u2019s advice regarding her rights and liabilities under the CC&amp;R\u2019s. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court erroneously relied on cases holding, when a person enters into an unambiguous written agreement, he or she is presumed to understand it as a matter of law and is estopped from claiming otherwise. (E.g., <em>Jefferson v. Department of Youth Authority </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 299, 303 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 391, 48 P.3d 423] <em>(Jefferson) </em>[\u201c ' \u201cThe general rule is that when a person with the capacity of reading and understanding an instrument signs it, he is, in the absence of fraud and imposition, bound by its contents, and is estopped from saying that its provisions are contrary to his intentions or understanding.\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Palmquist v. Mercer </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 92, 98 [272 P.2d 26] (Palmquist) [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 299, and <em>Palmquist, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d 92, specifically address disputes between contracting parties. Both cases hold a contracting party is legally estopped from circumventing the agreement by declaring the contract\u2019s objective terms do not coincide with his or her subjective intention. Neither case has any application to a legal malpractice action in which a party to a contract alleges she retained a lawyer for the specific purpose of advising her with respect to the meaning of the agreement and asserts she was thereafter damaged by the lawyer\u2019s negligent advice. Whatever the ultimate merit of her malpractice claim, Chamay plainly is not estopped from alleging she relied on her lawyer\u2019s expertise and advice in interpreting her rights and obligations under the CC&amp;R\u2019s. (See, e.g., <em>Neel </em>v. <em>Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 188 [98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421] [classic legal malpractice action involves an attorney\u2019s alleged failure to apply his or her \u201cspecialized skills and knowledge\u201d to a particular set of facts or circumstances].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">b. <em>Chamay adequately stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">To establish a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach of that duty and damages. <em>(Benasra </em>v. <em>Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp LLP </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1183 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 621]; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Lyman </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1101 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 236].) Chamay alleges Cobert breached his fiduciary duty by billing for tasks not performed and by billing at an inflated rate. Although, as the trial court found, the retainer agreement on its face may not have been \u201csubstantively unconscionable,\u201d by alleging Cobert and his firm improperly inflated the billings sent to Chamay by including tasks not performed and incorrectly using higher hourly rates than justified, Chamay has adequately pleaded a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. (See <em>Bird, Marella, Boxer &amp; Wolpert </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 419, 431 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 782] [client who alleged former defense counsel fraudulently inflated his charges stated breach of fiduciary duty claim; all members of the bar owe clients \u201cfiduciary duty to charge only fair, reasonable and conscionable fees\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In ruling Chamay had not adequately pleaded a breach of fiduciary duty claim, the trial court emphasized the retainer agreement required Chamay to dispute the legal bills within 10 days of receipt. Because Chamay did not allege she had fulfilled this contractual \u201ccondition precedent\u201d for challenging the bills, the trial court concluded she could not state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty as a matter of law. The trial court\u2019s reliance on the notice provision in the retainer agreement is unsound: If Cobert breached his fiduciary duty by fraudulently billing Chamay for services not performed at all or by using inflated rates for services performed by others, Chamay\u2019s failure to comply with the contractual notice provision does not immunize that breach, which is based on a duty arising from the attorney-client relationship itself and not the retainer agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In any event, the trial court\u2019s recognition of the 10-day notice provision in the retainer agreement as a defense to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty (or to Chamay\u2019s claim for breach of contract, for that matter) suffers from multiple defects. First, as written, the notice provision does not purport to limit Chamay\u2019s right to file a lawsuit challenging the fee statements if she fails to meet the 10-day requirement; rather, it simply provides that the Cobert firm \u201cshall assume the statement is accurate as presented\u201d if no timely objection is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Second, if the notice provision were interpreted to be an agreement to shorten the applicable limitations period, it would be unreasonable as a matter of law and thus unenforceable. Under California law parties may agree to a provision shortening the statute of limitations, \u201cqualified, however, by the requirement that the period fixed is not in itself unreasonable or is not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Capehart </em>v. <em>Heady </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 386, 388 [23 Cal.Rptr. 851]; see <em>Beeson v. Schloss </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 618, 622-623 [192 P. 292]; <em>Hambrecht &amp; Quist Venture Partners v. American Medical Internat., Inc. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 33].) When, as in this case, defendants have demurred to the complaint based on a contractual limitations period, \u201cthe real question to be determined here is whether the allegations of the complaint show that the limitation is unreasonable. . . . The question is one of law, namely, is the period of limitation, <em>in itself, </em>unreasonable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Capehart, </em>at p. 388.) Whatever the outside limit may be for shortening a limitations period (see, e.g., <em>Tebbets v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 137, 139 [99 P. 501] [holding on demurrer that six month contractual limitations period was not unreasonable]), we have no doubt requiring a client to assert a claim for breach of contract against her attorney within 10 days of receipt of a billing statement is inherently unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Third, as we held in <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1430 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 684], \u201c[A] contractually shortened limitations period has never been recognized outside the context of straightforward transactions in which the triggering event for either a breach of a contract or for the accrual of a right is immediate and obvious. Moreover, no decision upholding the validity of a contractually shortened limitation period has done so in the context of an action against a professional or skilled expert where breach of a duty is more difficult to detect. Instead, most reported decisions upholding shortened periods involve straightforward commercial contracts plus the unambiguous breaches or accrual of rights under those contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Finally, enforcement of the notice provision in the manner suggested by the trial court would abrogate the well-established delayed discovery rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>applicable to actions asserting breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See <em>April Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>KTTV </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 805, 827 [195 Cal.Rptr. 421] [\u201cIt is well-settled that the [delayed] discovery rule applies to causes of action involving breach of a fiduciary relationship\u201d]; cf. <em>Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 188 [An action for professional malpractice, for example, typically involves the professional\u2019s failure to apply his or her specialized skills and knowledge: \u201cCorollary to this expertise is the inability of the layman to detect its misapplication; the client may not recognize the negligence of the professional when he sees it.\u201d]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340.6 [delayed discovery rule applies to legal malpractice actions].) As we have explained in <em>Moreno v. Sanchez, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pages 1430 to 1431, the delayed discovery rule is founded on important public policy considerations; contractual efforts to eviscerate the delayed discovery rule are thus void as against public policy. Accordingly, even if the notice provision were otherwise applicable as a potential defense to Chamay\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim, it would have been error for the trial court not to grant her leave to amend to allege when she discovered the alleged improper billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">c. <em>Chamay adequately stated claims for intentional fraud and negligent misrepresentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The elements of fraud are \u201c \u2018(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or \u201cscienter\u201d); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lazar </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981]; see also <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 385, 402 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 594].) The elements of negligent misrepresentation are similar to intentional fraud except for the requirement of scienter; in a claim for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff need not allege the defendant made an intentionally false statement, but simply one as to which he or she lacked any reasonable ground for believing the statement to be true. <em>(Bily v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407-408 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 51, 834 P.2d 745]; see also <em>Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1239, fn. 4 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>352, 900 P.2d 601] [negligent misrepresentation is a species of the tort of deceit and like fraud, requires a misrepresentation, justifiable reliance and damage].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Chamay alleged at specifically identified times following her execution of the retainer agreement she confronted Cobert about the escalating attorney fees and costs she had incurred in this limited civil action and inquired whether it was worth continuing to litigate the matter. According to Chamay, Cobert assured her on each of these specified occasions that she need not be concerned about the mounting attorney fees because she would definitely prevail and recover those fees from the opposing parties at the end of the action. Chamay alleged Cobert made these representations knowing they were false because he did not believe, and indeed there was no reasonable basis to believe, Chamay could prevail in the action. As a result of Cobert\u2019s misrepresentations, she continued to vigorously litigate the matter and incurred additional attorney fee obligations, both her own and ultimately the opposing parties\u2019. In addition, Chamay alleged Cobert engaged in fraudulent billing practices, including billing for tasks not performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Plainly, as we have explained, the allegations relating to fraudulent billing practices are sufficient to withstand demurrer, and the trial court\u2019s reliance on Chamay\u2019s purported failure to adhere to the 10-day notice provision in the retainer agreement as an immunizing factor is error. The additional justifications proffered by the trial court for rejecting her fraud claim are also erroneous. For example, Cobert argued (and the trial court agreed) that, in light of the plain and unambiguous \u201cno guarantees\u201d clause in the retainer agreement, and the additional clause requiring any modification of the fee portion of the agreement to be in writing,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Chamay could not reasonably rely on any subsequent oral representation declaring her victory certain and her ability to recover all of her attorney fees a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Again, whatever the likelihood of Chamay\u2019s ability at a later stage of the proceedings to demonstrate justifiable reliance on Cobert\u2019s representations concerning her guaranteed success and ability to recover attorney fees, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>has adequately pleaded the element of justifiable reliance. Chamay alleged Cobert falsely told Chamay she need not be concerned about escalating costs because she would recover those costs at the end of the litigation. Chamay relied on that representation in continuing with the litigation rather than making any efforts to resolve it. Whether Chamay\u2019s reliance on that representation was reasonable under the circumstances is not a question properly resolved on demurrer. (See, e.g., <em>Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1239 [\u201c \u2018Except in the rare case where the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable difference of opinion, the question of whether a plaintiff\u2019s reliance is reasonable is a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Finally, the trial court also mled Chamay\u2019s fraud claim was barred under the parol evidence rale because the allegations Cobert assured Chamay she would recoup her attorney fees contradicted the \u201cno guarantees\u201d clause in the written retainer agreement. Invocation of the parol evidence rale in this context is unwarranted. The parol evidence rale, codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1856, subdivision (a), prohibits a party from resorting to extrinsic evidence of a prior or contemporaneous oral agreement to contradict a plain and unambiguous term of a fully integrated agreement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Chamay\u2019s allegations, however, involve promises made subsequent to the execution of the parties\u2019 retainer agreement, not a prior or contemporaneous oral agreement. Accordingly, the parol evidence rale is simply inapplicable. <em>(Marani v. Jackson </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 695, 699, fn. 2 [228 Cal.Rptr. 518] [parol evidence rale excludes only extrinsic evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, not subsequent oral agreements]; <em>Conley v.

In fact, Chamay adequately alleged Cobert breached the retainer agreement by, among other things, billing in excess of the amounts agreed to in the retainer agreement and for tasks not performed. These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The judgment is reversed.
