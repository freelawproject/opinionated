J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVCO\">Although an order granting or denying a special motion to strike filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the antiSLAPP statute (strategic lawsuit against public participation), is, in most instances, immediately appealable (\u00a7\u00a7 425.16, subd. (i), 904.1, subd. (a)(13); but see \u00a7\u00a7 425.17, subd. (e), 425.18, subd. (c)), an order declining to award attorney fees to a plaintiff who successfully opposes an anti-SLAPP motion is not. Accordingly, we dismiss Lynn Doe\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorney fees pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Doe filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (CBS), and Elizabeth Luster, alleging causes of action for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. CBS and Luster each filed a special motion to strike Doe\u2019s complaint under section 425.16. The trial court denied both motions on May 3, 2005, concluding, as to Luster, that she had failed to satisfy her burden of making a threshold showing the challenged causes of action arose from constitutionally protected activity. (See <em>Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">On July 7, 2005 Doe filed a motion for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), which provides in part, \u201cIf the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.\u201d The trial court denied the motion on August 24, 2005, finding Luster\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion \u201cwhile unsuccessful, was not frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Doe filed a notice of appeal. Luster filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing the trial court\u2019s August 24, 2005 order denying the motion for attorney fees is a nonappealable order. Following receipt of a memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>in opposition to the motion to dismiss from Doe and a reply from Luster, we scheduled oral argument on Luster\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">1. <em>Section 425.16 Special Motions to Strike and the Right to an Award of Costs and Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1), a defendant may move to strike the entire complaint or one or more causes of action \u201carising from any act . . . in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue . . . .\u201d If the plaintiff cannot demonstrate a probability of prevailing, the trial court must strike the challenged causes of action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and award the defendant attorney fees and costs. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c); <em>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 186 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 106 P.3d 958].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">If the special motion to strike is denied, the trial court must award reasonable attorney fees to the opposing party but only if the court finds that the motion was frivolous or brought solely for purposes of delay. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Shaw </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182, 198-199 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 154] [\u201cimposition of sanctions for a frivolous anti-SLAPP motion is mandatory\u201d].) In awarding fees to a successful opposing party, section 425.16, subdivision (c), directs the trial court to proceed \u201cpursuant to Section 128.5,\u201d which means the court \u201cmust use the procedures and apply the substantive standards\u201d of that provision. <em>(Decker </em>v. <em>U.D. Registry, Inc. </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1392 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 892]; accord, <em>Moore, </em>at p. 199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>While a party filing a special motion to strike under section 425.16 often seeks an award of attorney fees and costs in the same moving papers, a request for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), may also be made by the successful party\u2014either the moving party or, as here, the party opposing the motion\u2014by a separate, subsequently filed noticed motion. (See <em>American Humane Assn. v. Los Angeles Times Communications </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 488].) Indeed, it would seem better practice to defer the fee application until the motion to strike has been decided since the fees and costs actually incurred can be determined only after the hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1104 [\u201cthe moving defendant will be able to more accurately document the fees and costs actually incurred if the amount is fixed at a later date .... [T]he total cost of the special motion to strike and any related discovery permitted by the court can be more accurately computed if a section 425.16, subdivision (c) motion for fees is filed after the request is granted.\u201d].) Even if the order granting the motion has been appealed, the trial court retains jurisdiction to entertain a motion for attorney fees. <em>(Robertson v. Rodriguez </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 347, 360 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 464].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">2. <em>The Right to an Immediate Appeal of an Order Granting or Denying a Special Motion to Strike Under Section 425.16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">As originally enacted in 1992, section 425.16 contained no provision for an immediate appeal of orders made pursuant to that section. (See Stats. 1992, ch. 726, \u00a7 2, p. 3523.) Orders made pursuant to section 425.16 could be reviewed only as an appeal after judgment (\u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(1), (2)) or by petition for an extraordinary writ. Of course, if granting the special motion to strike resulted in dismissal of the entire action, the appeal after judgment was, of necessity, immediate. (\u00a7 581d; see <em>Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 699 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732] [\u201c \u2018order of dismissal is to be treated as a judgment for the purposes of taking an appeal when it finally disposes of the particular action and prevents further proceedings as effectually as would any formal judgment\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Kahn v. Lasorda\u2019s Dugout, Inc. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1120, fn. 1 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In 1999 the Legislature added former section 425.16, subdivision (j) (now \u00a7 425.16, subd. (i)), providing an appeal may be taken directly from an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>granting or denying a special motion to strike under section 425.16: \u201cAn order granting or denying a special motion to strike shall be appealable under Section 904.1.\u201d (Stats. 1999, ch. 960, \u00a7 l.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Legislature concluded it was necessary to authorize an immediate appeal because, \u201c[wjithout this ability, a defendant will have to incur the cost of a lawsuit before having his or her right to free speech vindicated. When a meritorious anti-SLAPP motion is denied, the defendant, under current law has only two options. The first is to file a writ . . . , which is discretionary and rarely granted. The second is to defend the lawsuit. If the defendant wins, the Anti-SLAPP Law is useless and has failed to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Since the right of petition and free speech expressly granted by the U.S. Constitution are at issue when these motions are filed, the defendant should have the same right to appeal as plaintiffs already have under current law and have the matter reviewed by a higher court.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 1675 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) April 20, 1999; see <em>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">3. <em>An Interlocutory Order Awarding or Denying Attorney Fees Under Section 425.16, Subdivision (c), Is Not Immediately Appealable Under Section 425.16, Subdivision (i)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The existence of an appealable judgment or order is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal. <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074].) A trial court\u2019s order is appealable only when made so by statute. <em>(Griset v. Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 688, 696 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 149, 23 P.3d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As discussed, section 425.16, subdivision (i), provides, \u201cAn order granting or denying a special motion to strike shall be appealable under Section 904.1.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither that statutory provision nor any other authorizes an immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>appeal from the award or denial of attorney fees to the prevailing moving party or from the denial of attorney fees to the prevailing party opposing a special motion to strike. (Because an award of attorney fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion is to be made \u201cpursuant to section 128.5,\u201d and only if the motion \u201cis frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,\u201d if the amount awarded exceeds $5,000, it is appealable pursuant to section 904.1, subdivision (a)(12) [immediate appeal may be taken from order directing payment of monetary sanctions by a party or an attorney for a party if amount exceeds $5,000].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The fundamental purpose of statutory construction is \u201cto ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Burden v. Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672].) \u201cTo discover that intent we first look to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.]\u201d (Tr<em>ope </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 280 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259]; see also <em>People v. Farell </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 381, 386 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 603, 48 P.3d 1155] [best indication of legislative intent appears in the language of the enactment].)  The plain meaning of the actual words used in section 425.16, subdivision (i)\u2014\u201can order granting or denying a special motion to strike\u201d\u2014manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit this exception to the one final judgment rule to the court\u2019s ruling on the special motion to strike itself, not to make related, but ancillary, rulings or orders separately appealable.  This commonsense construction of the language of section 425.16, subdivision (i), moreover, is consistent with the canon that \u201cexceptions to the one final judgment rule should not be allowed unless clearly mandated.\u201d <em>(Kinoshita v. Horio </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 959, 967 [231 Cal.Rptr. 241]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 9 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313] [  when interpreting a statute, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[w]ords must be construed in context, and statutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.\u201d [Citation.] Interpretations that lead to absurd results or render words surplusage are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>avoided.

(See <em>California School Employees Assn. v. Governing Board </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 333, 340 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 878 P.2d 1321] [\u201cOrdinarily, if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for judicial construction.

Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 433 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41]; see also <em>MacIsaac v. Waste Management Collection &amp; Recycling, Inc. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1087-1088 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 650] [looking to legislative history despite unambiguous language of statute at issue].) The Legislature\u2019s concern was that the inability to appeal immediately from the denial of a meritorious special motion to strike defeated the protective purpose of section 425.16. No such similar purpose is served by permitting an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order granting or denying attorney fees following the trial court\u2019s ruling on a special motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The clear, limited language of section 425.16, subdivision (i), notwithstanding, Doe cites four appellate decisions for the principle an interlocutory order denying a motion for recovery of fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), is appealable. None supports the conclusion we have jurisdiction to consider her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\"><em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 275], the earliest of the cases Doe cites, involved a question of attorney fees incurred on appeal following dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 action. The dismissal order itself was appealable as a \u201cjudgment\u201d under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(1). (See \u00a7 581d; <em>Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 699.) The fee order at issue, therefore, was appealable under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(2), as \u201can order made after a judgment.\u201d (See <em>Wilkerson, </em>at pp. 448-449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Similarly, in <em>Moraga-Orinda Fire Protection Dist. </em>v. <em>Weir </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 477 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 13], the Court of Appeal reviewed the denial of a motion to recover attorney fees and costs under section 425.16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>subdivision (c), made after the trial court had denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for writ of mandamus for lack of standing and as untimely. The trial court had ruled (erroneously, the Court of Appeal held)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the special motion to strike under section 425.16 was moot because the mandamus proceedings had already been resolved on the merits. <em>(Moraga-Orinda, </em>at pp. 479-480.) Like the fee order at issue in <em>Wilkerson, </em>the order denying attorney fees in <em>Moraga-Orinda Fire Protection Dist. </em>was appealable under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(2). Neither case supports the conclusion an interlocutory fee order under section 425.16, subdivision (c), is appealable under section 425.16, subdivision (i), and section 904.1, subdivision (a)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Johnston v. Corrigan </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 553 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 657], a case decided by Division Five of this court, falls into the same category. Several cross-defendants moved pursuant to section 425.16 to strike a cross-complaint for indemnity filed by Dennis H. Johnston, the defendant in the main action. <em>(Johnston, </em>at pp. 554-555.) Johnston responded, not by opposing the special motion to strike, but by filing an amended cross-complaint that omitted the moving cross-defendants: \u201c[I]n effect, [Johnston] voluntarily dismissed his cross-complaint against cross-defendants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 555.) The cross-defendants then filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c). The trial court initially denied the motion, then granted a motion for reconsideration and awarded fees and costs to the cross-defendants. <em>{Johnston, </em>at p. 555.) Rejecting the cross-defendants\u2019 argument Johnston was attempting to appeal from a nonappealable order granting reconsideration, Presiding Justice Turner held, the \u201corder awarding attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c) is appealable. [Citations.] The reconsideration order preceded the attorney fee award. Unless reconsideration was granted, no attorney fee order could be entered. Hence, the appeal from an appealable determination, the attorney fee award, allows us to reach the merits of the prior ruling that reconsideration was in order. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Johnston, </em>at p. 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>As in <em>Wilkerson v. Sullivan, supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th 443, and <em>Moraga-Orinda Fire Protection Dist. v. Weir, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.4th 477, the attorney fee order in <em>Johnston v. Corrigan, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th 553, was appealable under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(2), as an order after judgment because it was entered only after the pleading directed to the moving parties had been dismissed. <em>(Nguyen </em>v. <em>Calhoun </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 428, 437 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 436] [\u201c \u2018It is settled that the rule requiring dismissal [of the entire lawsuit] does not apply when the case involves multiple parties and a judgment is entered which leaves no issue to be determined as to one party. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d].) To the extent the language used by Presiding Justice Turner might superficially appear to authorize an appeal from an interlocutory award of attorney fees, it is, of course, \u201caxiomatic that language in a judicial opinion is to be understood in accordance with the facts and issues before the court. An opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1195 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613]; see <em>Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 680 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 495, 123 P.3d 931] [same].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Finally, in <em>Moore v. Shaw, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th 182, Division Three of this court considered on the merits an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s special motion to strike under section 425.16 and the prevailing plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s order, made concurrently with the order denying the motion, denying his request for attorney fees. <em>(Moore, </em>at p. 186.) Although the court specifically noted that the order denying a special motion to strike itself is appealable, citing both the relevant subdivision of section 425.16 and section 904.1 <em>(Moore, </em>at p. 186, fn. 3), it did not address whether the order denying the request for attorney fees, which was the subject of the cross-appeal, was also appealable. Because the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>does not suggest either that the parties raised the jurisdictional issue or that the court considered it, <em>Moore </em>is not authority for Doe\u2019s position that an interlocutory order denying a request for attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), is immediately appealable. <em>(Kinsman v. Unocal Corp., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 680; <em>In re Marriage of Cornejo </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 381, 388 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 81, 916 P.2d 476].) No other published decision has explicitly considered, let alone held, an order awarding or denying attorney fees pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c), that is not appealable as a post-judgment order under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(2), or as an award of sanctions under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(12), is nonetheless immediately appealable under section 425.16, subdivision (i), and section 904.1, subdivision (a)(13).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Luster proposes we grant her motion to dismiss this appeal while distinguishing <em>Moore v. Shaw, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th 182, and similar cases, explaining an order granting or denying attorney fees may be immediately appealable if it was made concurrently with, or \u201cas part of,\u201d an order granting or denying the special motion to strike. That suggestion, while understandable, seems disingenuous. The special motion to strike and the motion for attorney fees present the trial court with separate, albeit related, issues\u2014 issues, which as discussed above, need not be presented to the court at the same time. (See, e.g., <em>American Humane Assn. v. Los Angeles Times Communications, supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1103.) If the motion for fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), is filed after the trial court rules on the special motion to strike\u2014as it was in the case at bar\u2014the order awarding or denying those fees is not an \u201corder granting or denying a special motion to strike\u201d; and no plausible argument can be made that such an order is immediately appealable under section 425.16, subdivision (i). There similarly is no creditable argument that combining the two motions\u2014one that results in an immediately appealable order; one that does not\u2014somehow transforms the nonappealable order into one that is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Luster\u2019s motion to dismiss Doe\u2019s appeal is granted.

The moving defendant\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken \u2018in furtherance of the [defendant]\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,\u2019 as defined in the statute.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 197] and <em>Liu </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 745 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 807]. In <em>Bernardo </em>the trial court struck the entire action under section 425.16; the fee award was a postjudgment order. <em>(Bernardo, </em>at pp. 338-339.) In <em>Liu </em>the cross-complainants dismissed their cross-complaint prior to the hearing on the cross-defendant\u2019s section 425.16 special motion to strike. The cross-defendant appealed from the denial of her motion for attorney fees, successfully arguing a defendant who is voluntarily dismissed, with or without prejudice, after filing a section 425.16 motion to strike, is nevertheless entitled to have the merits of the motion heard as a predicate to a determination of the motion for attorney fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c). <em>(Liu, </em>at p. 751.) All three cited cases, like <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Corrigan, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th 553 itself, involved the appeal of a postjudgment (or postdismissal) order regarding attorney fees, not an interlocutory appeal like Doe\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em> </em>Although not cited by Doe, in several other published cases the Court of Appeal reviewed the merits of an interlocutory attorney fee order made by the trial court under section 425.16, subdivision (c), concurrently with its order granting or denying the special motion to strike itself.
