He asserts that, under the MDO Act, the district attorney has no authority to file a petition unless the medical director of the treating state hospital determines that the severe mental disorder is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment. This contention is meritorious and we shall reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In 1989, when defendant was 19 years old, he pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd acts on a child under 14 years of age under section 288. He was sentenced to a determinate term of eight years in state prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In January 1994, after completing his term of imprisonment, he was committed to Atascadero State Hospital as a condition of parole pursuant to section 2962.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In July of 1996 the medical director of the hospital determined that defendant met the criteria for continued involuntary treatment under section 2970 (fn. 5, <em>post, </em>at p. 85) and recommended that the district attorney file a petition for continued treatment under that statute. In August 1996 the district attorney filed the petition. In September defendant agreed to the one-year extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In June of 1997 the medical director of Patton State Hospital, to which defendant had been transferred, determined that he met the criteria for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>continued involuntary treatment under section 2970 and recommended that the district attorney file a recommitment petition. In September 1997 the district attorney filed the petition. In October defendant agreed to the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">This pattern continued until May 2004. At that point, defendant had returned to Atascadero State Hospital. Psychiatrist Dr. David Fennell, acting with the endorsement of the medical director of the hospital, determined that defendant\u2019s mental disorder was in remission and could be kept in remission without treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Dr. Fennell decided that, after more than 10 years of treatment, changes in defendant\u2019s medication had been extremely effective in getting him into remission of his manic symptoms. Defendant had shown steady improvement and was no longer showing overt signs or symptoms of his bipolar mental disorder. Dr. Fennell was of the view that defendant\u2019s other mental disorder, pedophilia, may have been activated by the hypersexuality of his mania, attributable to his bipolar illness. As a result of eliminating the mania, defendant\u2019s medications had reduced his sex drive. He was showing no overt signs of mental illness. In Dr. Fennell\u2019s opinion, defendant also met the statutory criteria for a finding that his disorder could be kept in remission.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Nevertheless, the deputy district attorney assigned to the matter concluded that he had independent authority under the MDO Act to file a petition for continued treatment. In June 2004, by an ex parte application, he persuaded a superior court judge to sign an order directing the State Department of Mental Health and the staff at Atascadero State Hospital to make defendant\u2019s mental health records available to Dr. Amy Phenix, a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">On July 23, 2004, the district attorney filed a petition for continued involuntary treatment of defendant pursuant to section 2970 et seq. The petition alleges that the district attorney has good cause to believe that defendant has a severe disorder that is not in remission, or cannot be kept in remission without treatment. It incorporates an \u201cEvaluation Pursuant to [section] 2970\u201d authored by Dr. Phenix.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">A jury trial on the petition was scheduled for December 2004. Defendant made an in limine motion to bar trial testimony by Dr. Phenix. During the hearing defendant moved to dismiss the petition because Dr. Fennell, on behalf of the medical director, had determined that he did not meet the criteria for recommitment. The trial court denied the motion in limine and the oral motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">At defendant\u2019s seven-day trial in early 2005, Dr. Fennell, who at that point was acting medical director at Atascadero State Hospital, testified to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>evaluation of defendant\u2019s remission as related above. Dr. Phenix testified that while defendant\u2019s bipolar disorder was in remission, she did not believe that the pedophilia disorder was in remission. In her opinion, the nature of defendant\u2019s pedophilia is that it has a long and pervasive course. She believes that defendant requires further treatment with Depo-Provera to suppress his testosterone level. She is doubtful that if defendant were released he would manage his mental disorder appropriately, including taking his medications for his bipolar disorder. In her opinion defendant did not satisfy the statutory criteria for a finding that his disorder could be kept in remission because he unreasonably dropped out of a substance abuse treatment group.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The jury returned a verdict that defendant \u201csuffers from a severe mental disorder that causes him to represent a substantial danger of physical harm to others.\u201d Thereafter, on February 7, 2005, the trial court issued an order of recommitment for an additional year.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Defendant appeals contending, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the petition. Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 558 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 660] <em>(Garcia), </em>he argues that under the MDO Act, the district attorney had no authority to file the petition for recommitment unless the medical director of Atascadero State Hospital determined that his severe mental disorder was not in remission or could not be kept in remission without treatment. The Attorney General replies that <em>Garcia </em>addresses only an initial commitment and such a determination is not necessary for the filing of a petition for recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In <em>Garcia </em>the defendant completed a 14-year term for kidnapping and molesting a child under the age of 14. He too was committed to Atascadero State Hospital as a condition of parole under section 2962. When the time came for his initial evaluation for continued involuntary treatment under the MDO Act, the hospital medical director informed the district attorney that he had determined that the defendant\u2019s severe mental disorder was in remission and could be kept in remission. Nonetheless, the district attorney filed a petition for involuntary commitment. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and, after trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of continued involuntary treatment. <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at pp. 562-563.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, stating: \u201c[W]e hold that district attorneys are not independently empowered to initiate civil commitment proceedings under Penal Code section 2970, part of the Mentally Disordered Offender Act .... Instead, district attorneys may only initiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>such proceedings when the director of the facility or program providing the prisoner\u2019s treatment, or the Director of Corrections, states in a written evaluation in accordance with section 2970 that the prisoner\u2019s severe mental disorder is not in remission, or cannot be kept in remission without treatment.\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 562, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The court reasoned as follows: \u201cBecause defendant\u2019s treatment occurred during the period of his parole, the hospital director, on behalf of the Department, should have notified the Board of Prison Terms that defendant\u2019s treatment had terminated because he was in remission and could be kept in remission. (\u00a7 2968.)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 565.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The <em>Garcia </em>opinion then seems to suggest, in obiter dictum, that the district attorney <em>would </em>have authority to file a petition for recommitment regardless of the opinion of the treating hospital\u2019s medical director. \u201cThe district attorney only has authority under the MDO statute to file a petition to extend a prisoner\u2019s commitment. Specifically, when a prisoner was treated during parole, the period of parole terminated without the prisoner being put into remission, and the prisoner was committed under section 2970 to involuntary treatment, then under section 2972, subdivision (e) the district attorney may file a petition for recommitment.\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th at p. 565.) Actually faced with that question in this case, we conclude the answer suggested by the <em>Garcia </em>opinion is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">At the outset, we note the anomaly if <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>dictum were correct. The hospital medical director\u2019s affirmative determination on remission would be final as to an initial petition but not as to subsequent petitions. We see no persuasive policy reason for such a distinction. (See, e.g., <em>Zachary v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1032, fn. 4 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 532] <em>(Zachary).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">We begin with the text of section 2970.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIn determining [legislative] intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323] <em>(Dyna-Med).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Section 2970 has a condition for the submission of the hospital medical director\u2019s evaluation of remission to the district attorney: <em>\u201cif </em>the prisoner\u2019s severe mental disorder is not in remission or cannot be kept in remission without treatment.\u201d (Italics added.) The implication of this is that if the medical director determines the disorder is in remission and can be kept in remission without treatment, the director has no legal obligation to forward a written evaluation on remission to the district attorney. That is to say, only an evaluation unfavorable on the issues of remission is submitted to the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Under the second paragraph of section 2970, the unfavorable written evaluation, in mm, is a prerequisite for the filing of a petition. If one is submitted: \u201cThe district attorney <em>may then </em>file a petition . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The implication of this is that if there is no unfavorable written evaluation, the petition may not be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Under this reading of section 2970 the MDO Act parallels the statutory scheme that governs involuntary treatment of sexually violent predators (SVP\u2019s). (See, e.g., Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 888, 905-909 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 44 P.3d 949].) As required, it accounts for all of the language in section 2970 and harmonizes section 2970 with section 2968, as interpreted by <em>Garcia, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.4th 558. (See, e.g., <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1386-1387; <em>California Mfrs. Assn. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s brief accepts that \u201csection 2970 requires the initiation of civil commitment proceedings to be supported by a recommendation from the treating facility or Director of Corrections.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s argument is that the requirement of section 2970 does not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>here because this is a petition for recommitment and, as such, it is governed by section 2972.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Attorney General points to the last sentence in section 2972, subdivision (e): \u201cThe recommitment proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of <em>this </em>section.\u201d (Italics added.) The Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>General argues that, in view of this, filing a recommitment petition is not governed by any requirement of section 2970. We do not see this portion of section 2972, subdivision (e) as a sign that the Legislature intended procedural rules to differ for filing recommitment petitions and initial commitment petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">In ordinary statutory usage a proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition or complaint. (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 350.) To say the proceeding is to be conducted in accordance with a certain provision does not, on its face, address the prerequisites for the proceeding. Prerequisites take effect before the proceeding is conducted at all.  Indeed, an initial commitment proceeding under Penal Code section 2970 is: \u201cconducted in accordance with the provisions of [Penal Code Section 2972].\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2972, subd. (e); see <em>Zachary, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032, fn. 4.) That does not mean that the prerequisites for the filing of a petition in section 2970 are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The fact that additional commitment proceedings are addressed in a separately numbered statute does not mean that the procedures prescribed for the initial commitment are inapplicable. (Cf. <em>People v. Superior Court (Gary) </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 207, 213-218 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 874]; <em>Peters v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 845, 848-851 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 350]; <em>Butler v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178-1182 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 468].) The ordinary implication is that the procedure prescribed by statute for the initial proceeding should apply to further proceedings of the same ilk. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a73511; <em>Zachary, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument is that the phrase \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this section\u201d means not in accordance with section 2970. That is to say, it indicates a policy choice by the Legislature that the prepetition procedures prescribed in the adjacent section 2970 are not to be used in recommitment proceedings. This is belied by common sense and the history of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">This reading would leave the district attorney without the means to exercise discretion concerning whether to seek continued involuntary treatment. If section 2972 proscribes use of the procedures provided in section 2970, then the procedures for evaluation of remission, provision of a written evaluation to the district attorney and supporting affidavits, are also inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The history of sections 2970 and 2972 also belies the notion that \u201cin accordance with the provisions of this section\u201d was meant to achieve the result urged by the Attorney General. In 1985 the substance of both provisions was enacted as one statute, in former section 2960. (Stats. 1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ch. 1419, \u00a7 1, pp. 5011-5017.) Subdivision (f)(1) of former section 2960 paralleled present section 2970. Subdivision (f)(6) of former section 2960 paralleled present section 2972, subdivision (e). Subdivision (f)(6), in pertinent part read: \u201cThe recommitment proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this <em>subdivision.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Under the Attorney General\u2019s logic, that reference explicitly applied the provisions of present section 2970, as well as those of present section 2972, to recommitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In 1986 former section 2960 was broken up into the several numbered sections of the current MDO Act. (Stats. 1986, ch. 858, \u00a7 1, p. 2951.) Former sections 2970 and 2972 were enacted parallel to the present sections. The text of former section 2972, subdivision (e), in pertinent part, was changed to read as it does at present: \u201cThe recommitment proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this <em>section.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1986, ch. 858, \u00a7 7, pp. 2955, 2956, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Thus, the question is: Was this change merely a clerical tidying of \u201csubdivision\u201d to \u201csection\u201d to avoid a facial, grammatical deviation on recodification? Or was it a choice to change the law to render the procedures in section 2970 inapplicable? The former option finds explicit support in the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest. It says existing law provides for continued treatment of MDO\u2019s and: \u201cThis bill would recodify those provisions [with exceptions not pertinent herein].\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 1845 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1986, Summary Dig., p. 290.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district attorney may only initiate a recommitment proceeding when the director of the facility or program providing the prisoner\u2019s treatment states in a written evaluation in accordance with section 2970 that the prisoner\u2019s severe mental disorder is not in remission, or cannot be kept in remission without treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">That did not occur in this case. This renders the remaining contentions of trial error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Because the district attorney did not have statutory authority to initiate commitment proceedings, we not only will reverse the judgment but will direct the trial court to dismiss the petition for commitment filed on July 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The order entered February 7, 2005, committing defendant to the Department of Mental Health with placement at Atascadero State Hospital from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>January 27, 2005, through January 27, 2006, is reversed and the trial court is directed to dismiss the petition for recommitment filed on July 23, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Nicholson, Acting P.
