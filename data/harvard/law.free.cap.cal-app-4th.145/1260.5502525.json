Code, \u00a7 44955),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which in turn would necessitate the elimination of up to 89 certificated positions (teachers and counselors) in the 2003-2004 school year. The resolution directed the superintendent \u201cto send appropriate notices to all employees, including temporary employees, whose positions may be affected by virtue of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">In fact, the superintendent then sent notices to over 225 certificated employees: \u201cnonreemployment\u201d notices to some 74 persons classified by the District as probationary employees (\u00a7 44949), and about 154 \u201crelease\u201d notices to persons classified as temporary employees (\u00a7 44954). Within the latter classification, the District included all teachers and counselors holding anything less than a regular credential, which in this case meant all those working under an internship credential, a preintem certificate, an emergency teaching permit, or a credential waiver. As we will explain, there are several significant differences between probationary and temporary employees in terms of layoff procedures and reemployment rights, which in turn affect their opportunities to accrue seniority and permanent status. Probationary employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>ees, for example, but not temporary employees, have the right to an administrative hearing to determine if a PKS layoff is supported by legitimate economic reasons. (\u00a7\u00a7 44949, 44955; <em>San Jose Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 627 [192 Cal.Rptr. 710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The nonmanagement employees, both probationary and temporary, who received the layoff notices all were members of the Bakersfield Elementary Teachers Association (BETA). Most of the probationary employees, acting through BETA, exercised their right to a hearing. BETA argued at the hearing, among other things, that the rights of the probationary employees, or at least their relative seniority, could not be determined without regard to the temporary employees, many of whom BETA claimed had been misclassified and actually were entitled under the Code to be treated as probationary. The administrative law judge (ALT) found that even if this were true, it would not affect the seniority rankings of the probationary employees because, he said, service under an emergency permit (the basis upon which the District had made some of the temporary classifications) does not count toward seniority. The ALJ concluded the District\u2019s proposed layoffs were reasonable under the circumstances, and the governing board adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision without change.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">As it turned out, the District was able to rehire all of the certificated employees it had classified as probationary, and 87 of the employees it had classified as temporary, for the 2003-2004 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">BETA, on behalf of its members affected by the layoffs, brought the present action against the District on August 6, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It sought a writ of mandate directing the District to reinstate and reclassify the temporary employees (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085); a writ of administrative mandate setting aside the District\u2019s layoff of the probationary employees (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5); declaratory relief establishing the employees\u2019 rights under the Education Code as to classification and seniority; and injunctive relief prohibiting the misclassification of certificated employees. The trial court granted the requested relief, but stayed its application pending this appeal by the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">We will affirm the judgment insofar as it holds the District\u2019s policy of classifying teachers and counselors solely on the basis of their certification is invalid, and insofar as it directs the District to reinstate the misclassified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>employees, for the 2003-2004 school year, to positions and status consistent with their correct classification. We will remand the matter for further proceedings to determine the employees\u2019 correct classification, and the amount of backpay and benefits, if any, to which each is entitled. We will reverse the judgment insofar as it orders reinstatement beyond the 2003-2004 school year, and insofar as it denies the District an opportunity to present evidence in mitigation of the employees\u2019 claims for lost compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AkL\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, a trial court\u2019s findings and judgment on a petition for writ of mandate are upheld if supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.] However, the trial court\u2019s construction of a statute is purely a question of law and is subject to de novo review on appeal. [Citation.] The principles governing the proper construction of a statute are well established . . . : \u2018Courts must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate a law\u2019s purpose. [Citations.] \u201cIn the construction of a statute ... the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is . . . contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; . . .\u201d [Citation.] Legislative intent will be determined so far as possible from the language of statutes, read as a whole, and if the words are reasonably free from ambiguity and uncertainty, the courts will look no further to ascertain its meaning. [Citation.] \u201c \u2018The court should take into account matters such as context, the object in view, the evils to be remedied, the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject, public policy, and contemporaneous construction.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] \u201cMoreover, the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Golden Valley Unified School Dist. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 369, 375-376 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 642] <em>(Golden </em>Valley), italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The principal issue on appeal is whether some or all of the teachers and counselors classified by the District as temporary employees properly should have been classified instead as probationary. If so, it follows we then must determine the effect, if any, of this misclassification on their dismissals, and on the seniority and reemployment rights of the employees the District classified as probationary. We begin, however, with the District\u2019s contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>the temporary employees are barred by the doctrine of laches from objecting to their classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">I. Did the Temporary Employees Wait Too Long to Object to Their Classification?</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">When it becomes necessary, as the result of a reduction or discontinuation of services within a district, to reduce the number of permanent or probationary employees, the district must give notice to the affected employees, setting out reasons for the action and the employees\u2019 right to a hearing, no later than March 15. (\u00a7\u00a7 44955, 44949; <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Weaverville Elementary School Dist. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1846, 1854 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 310] <em>(Cousins) </em>[distinguishing procedure to lay off probationary employees for economic reasons from procedure to nonreelect them for subsequent year]; <em>Gassman v. Governing Board </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 137, 144\u2014145 [133 Cal.Rptr. 1, 554 P.2d 321] [distinguishing procedure to lay off probationary employees for economic reasons from procedure to dismiss them for unsatisfactory performance].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the district fails to give the required notice by March 15, the employee \u201cshall be deemed reemployed for the ensuing school year.\u201d (\u00a7 44955, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>No permanent employee may be laid off if a probationary employee, or any other employee of less seniority, occupies a position the permanent employee is certificated and competent to fill. (\u00a7 44955, subd. (c).) Likewise, a probationary employee may \u201cbump\u201d another probationary employee with less seniority. Seniority is determined as of the date the employee \u201cfirst rendered paid service in a <em>probationary </em>position.\u201d (\u00a7 44845, italics added.) Temporary employees therefore do not accrue seniority, and so must be released before probationary employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Moreover, temporary employees, unlike permanent and probationary employees, may be dismissed at the pleasure of the board and need be given only a more limited form of notice before the end of the school year, and no hearing. (\u00a7 44954; <em>Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High School Dist. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 917-918 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 811, 62 P.3d 54] <em>(Kavanaugh).)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(The school year runs from July 1 to June 30 (\u00a7 37200).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Thus, if the employees in this case whom the District classified as temporary were in fact entitled to be classified as probationary, the District\u2019s failure to give them a timely notice of nonreemployment caused them in effect to be rehired for the following year. It also, depending upon <em>when </em>they should have been classified as probationary employees, may have changed the relative seniority of the other employees the District had classified as probationary. (Some of the temporary employees reportedly had worked in the District with that classification for several years.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The District maintains the temporary employees, because they waited until after March 15 to challenge their classification, were guilty of laches. Had they objected sooner, the District urges, it \u201ccould have simply provided them with notices of layoff and included them in the layoff hearing.\u201d And, it adds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>\u201c[s]ince the [ALJ] ultimately concluded that there was good cause for the layoffs, the affected temporary teachers would have lost their positions, even under their own theory.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Laches is an equitable defense based on the principle that those who neglect their rights may be barred from obtaining relief in equity. (13 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Equity, \u00a7 16, p. 302.) \u201c \u2018The defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Loma Linda </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 68 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 5 P.3d 874].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Laches is a question of fact for the trial court, but may be decided as a matter of law where, as here, the relevant facts are undisputed. <em>(Heavenly Valley </em>v. <em>El Dorado County Bd. of Equalization </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1334 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The District contends that each of the temporary employees was aware of his or her classification by virtue of having signed an employment contract identifying them as such upon being hired for the 2002-2003 school year; that each such employee acquiesced in this classification by failing to object to it; and that the District relied to its detriment on the employees\u2019 silence. However, this claim overlooks the fact the District led these employees to believe they had no choice but to acquiesce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">The District utilized different contract forms depending on whether the employee possessed an emergency permit, a preintem certificate, or an internship credential, or was working in a categorically funded program. Each of the forms, however, required the employee to acknowledge that, as a temporary employee, he or she had none of the rights of, nor any claim to, probationary status. The following provision is typical: \u201cStatus of Employment: Employee specifically acknowledges that this agreement does not establish any right to probationary or permanent employment status. Employee further acknowledges that the District may terminate the [preinternship, internship, or temporary employment] on any basis . . . without any obligation to provide a statement of reasons, evidence of cause, or a right to a hearing. Employee further acknowledges that this agreement does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>establish any right to reemployment in any status beyond the term of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">However, any contractual provision purporting to waive the protections accorded certificated school employees by the Code, including the provisions governing their classification and termination, is \u201cnull and void.\u201d (\u00a7 44924; see <em>Fine v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1077, fh. 7 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 876] <em>(Fine)] Zalac v. Governing Bd. of Ferndale Unified School Dist. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 838, 849 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 615] <em>(Zalac)] United Teachers\u2014L.A. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1517-1519 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].) \u201cThe statutory provisions in the Education Code, governing the rights of teachers, are an expression of public policy; they cannot be bargained away either expressly or impliedly.\u201d <em>(Hart Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>William S. Hart Union High Sch. Dist. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 211, 214 [141 Cal.Rptr. 817] <em>(Hart Federation of Teachers).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">\u201cAlthough the contracts of employment accepted by petitioners purported to fix their status as that of temporary teachers, they are not estopped to claim probationary status if the statutory scheme of the Education Code compels the latter classification under the particular facts of each petitioner\u2019s employment situation.\u201d <em>(Santa Barbara Federation of Teachers v. Santa Barbara High Sch. Dist. </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 223, 227-228 [142 Cal.Rptr. 749] <em>(Santa Barbara Federation of Teachers).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The District argues waiver and laches are distinct doctrines, and to say a teacher cannot be required to waive the benefits of the Code is different than saying he or she cannot be precluded by laches from claiming those benefits. Be that as it may, it misses the point. The District may not now complain the temporary employees waited too long to assert a right the District misled them into believing they already had given up.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cOne who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\u201d (13 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Equity, \u00a7 9, p. 289; <em>Warsaw </em>v. <em>Chicago Metallic Ceilings, Inc. </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 564, 576 [199 Cal.Rptr. 773, 676 P.2d 584] [\u201c \u2018He who seeks equity must do equity\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>The District\u2019s reliance on <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1977) 77 Cal.App.3d 100 [143 Cal.Rptr. 264] <em>(American Federation of </em>Teachers) is unavailing. That case involved a teacher hired to replace a more experienced one who had been assigned to a categorically funded reading program. The district classified the teacher as a temporary employee on the ground she was working in a categorically funded position (former \u00a7 13329; see now \u00a7 44909) rather than on the ground she was a long-term replacement for a teacher on leave (former \u00a7 13337.3; see now \u00a7 44920). The district gave the teacher a release notice at the end of the school year, subject to the renewal of the funding for the reading program. She then sought a writ of mandate to compel the district to rehire her as a probationary teacher. She argued her temporary classification was incorrect because she was <em>not </em>employed in a categorically funded program; she therefore was entitled to the default classification of a probationary teacher (former \u00a7 13334; see now \u00a7 44915); and had been effectively rehired in this classification given the district\u2019s failure to give her a timely notice of nonreemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The trial court agreed the teacher was not a categorical employee. It also found, however, that her identification as such in the employment contract was not controlling; that she was in fact a long-term replacement teacher; and that in either event she properly was classified as a temporary employee. In other words, the classification, if not the basis for it, was correct and the teacher had suffered no prejudice. <em>(American Federation of Teachers, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.3d at pp. 105-108.) Although this conclusion ought to have ended the matter, the trial court then went on to hold the teacher had waited too long to bring it up (i.e., until after March 15), was guilty of laches, and therefore was estopped to claim probationary status. It found the district had explained to her when she signed the contract that she was a temporary employee, along with the implications of that status on her reemployment for the following year, and the district had relied in good faith on her apparent acceptance of those conditions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 109.) The appellate court affirmed the judgment as to both the teacher\u2019s classification and the finding of laches. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Apart from the fact the discussion of laches in <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>was dictum, the circumstances are distinguishable from those in the present case. There, the teacher\u2019s classification ultimately was correct; here, as we are about to explain, it was not correct (and, arguably, the District should have known it was not). Further, unlike the present case, nothing in <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>suggests the teacher\u2019s silence as to her classification was induced by any misrepresentations made to her by the district. Here, the District cannot be said to have believed in good faith that the teachers\u2019 silence indicated an acceptance of their classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>II. Were the Temporary Employees Misclassified?</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">As we have said, the District classified certificated employees having less than a regular (i.e., preliminary or clear) credential as temporary employees, and required them to sign a contract acknowledging their temporary status.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It thus made the employee\u2019s <em>classification </em>dependent upon his or her <em>certification. </em>As a general rule, however, classification and certification operate independently of one another. The statutory classification scheme applies typically to employees occupying \u201cpositions requiring certification qualifications.\u201d (See \u00a7\u00a7 44917 [substitute employee], 44915 [probationary employee], 44920 [temporary employee], 44929.21, subd. (b) [permanent employee], 44909 [categorically funded programs]; see also <em>Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 380 [teacher with emergency credential may be employed in a position requiring certification qualifications].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is, a person who has been determined to be qualified to teach is not a temporary employee simply because he or she is not yet fully accredited, but rather because he or she occupies a position the law defines as temporary. It is necessary, therefore, to differentiate a teacher\u2019s classification from his or her certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>A. <em>Teacher Classification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">The Code permits certificated employees to be classified in one of four ways: permanent, probationary, substitute, or temporary. <em>(Kavanaugh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 916.) \u201cThe code authorizes the governing boards of school districts to hire, classify, promote and dismiss certificated employees (i.e., teachers) (see \u00a7 44831), but establishes a complex and somewhat rigid scheme to govern a board\u2019s exercise of its decisionmaking power.\u201d <em>(Kavanaugh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">\u201cA certificated teacher\u2019s classification . . . governs the level of statutory job protection the teacher enjoys and controls the level of procedural protections that apply if he or she is not reelected. In general, permanent employees may not be dismissed unless one or more statutorily enumerated grounds are shown. (\u00a7 44932.) Probationary employees may not be dismissed during the school year except for cause or unsatisfactory performance (\u00a7 44948.3), but, on timely notice, \u2018may be nonreelected [for the following year] without any showing of cause, without any statement of reasons, and without any right of appeal or administrative redress.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kavanaugh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 917.) \u201c[B]ut, if nonreelection is for economic reasons (such as a decline in daily attendance or discontinuance of services), [a probationary] teacher is entitled to certain procedural protections pursuant to section 44949. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 917, fn. 4; see also <em>Cousins, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1854.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">\u201c \u2018Substitute and temporary employees, on the other hand, fill the short range needs of a school district and generally may be summarily released.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, temporary teachers may be dismissed \u2018[a]t the pleasure of the [governing] board prior to serving during one school year at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained\u2019 (\u00a7 44954, subd. (a)), and after that time so long as the temporary employee is notified before the end of the school year <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)). The overall scheme the Legislature has created in the Education Code is thus specific as to the rights and responsibilities of certificated teachers and their employers, the governing boards.\u201d <em>(Kavanaugh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 917-918; see also <em>Balen </em>v. <em>Peralta Junior College Dist. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 821, 826 [114 Cal.Rptr. 589, 523 P.2d 629] <em>(Balen); Haase </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 913, 917-918 [170 Cal.Rptr. 366] <em>(Haase).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\"><em>A </em>certificated employee is classified as permanent, i.e., acquires tenure, if, after having been employed for two complete successive school years in a position requiring certification qualifications, he or she is reelected for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>following year. (\u00a7 44929.21, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Generally, this provision applies only to <em>probationary </em>employees who are reelected after two years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Board of Education v.

Although this section makes no reference to temporary employees, other neighboring sections of the Code expressly authorize that classification in some situations. (See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 44919, 44920.) Thus, section 44915 has been understood to make probationary status the default classification for certificated employees who are not otherwise required by the Code to be classified as permanent, substitute, or temporary employees. (See, e.g., <em>Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 378-382 [teacher may be classified as probationary pursuant to \u00a7 44915 although working under emergency permit]; <em>Hart Federation of Teachers, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at p. 215 [former \u00a7 13334; now \u00a7 44909, makes probationary classification \u201ccatch-all\u201d status for teachers not properly classified as something else].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The District disputes this interpretation, however, and contends, essentially, that it retains the discretion to classify employees as temporary based on criteria\u2014in this case, the status of their certification to teach\u2014other than those specified in the Code. That is, it argues it is permitted to do whatever the Code does not expressly prohibit it from doing. \u201cAbsent direct regulation to the contrary,\u201d the District maintains, \u201cthe designation of the employees [working under emergency teaching permits] as temporary should be deemed permissible under the \u2018permissive code\u2019 provisions of . . . section 35160.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The Code\u2019s \u201ccomplex and somewhat rigid\u201d classification scheme is intended, however, to limit rather than to enlarge the power of school districts to classify teachers as temporary employees. <em>(Kavanaugh, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 917; see <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 818, 825 [129 Cal.Rptr. 443, 548 P.2d 1115] [statutory scheme represents the \u201cdelicate balancing\u201d necessary to accommodate students\u2019 need for education, teachers\u2019 need for job security, and school boards\u2019 need for flexibility in evaluating and hiring employees].) \u201cThe Legislature . . . has restricted the flexibility of a school district in the continued use of temporary employees [citations], for otherwise the benefits resulting from employment security for teachers could be subordinated to the administrative needs of a district.\u201d <em>(Haase, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at p. 918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">\u201cThe essence of the statutory classification system is that continuity of service restricts the power to terminate employment which the institution\u2019s governing body would normally possess. Thus, the Legislature has prevented the arbitrary dismissal of employees with positions of a settled and continuing nature, i.e., permanent and probationary teachers, by requiring notice and hearing before termination. [Citations.] Substitute and temporary teachers, on the other hand, fill the short range needs of a school district, and may be summarily released absent an infringement of constitutional or contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>rights. [Citations.] <em>Because the substitute and temporary classifications are not guaranteed procedural due process by statute, they are narrowly defined by the Legislature, and should be strictly interpreted\u201d (Balen, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 826, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The Code recognizes two general kinds of temporary employees: those who are employed to serve for less than three or four months, or in some types of limited, emergency, or temporary assignments or classes (see \u00a7\u00a7 44919, 44921, 44986);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and those who are employed for up to one year to replace a certificated employee who is on leave or has a lengthy illness (see \u00a7\u00a7 44920, 44918). We will refer to these as \u201cshort-term temporary teachers\u201d and \u201clong-term replacement teachers,\u201d respectively (and include counselors in those categories as well). In addition, persons employed in categorically funded programs or in programs operated by a district under contract are treated <em>like </em>temporary employees in certain respects (\u00a7 44909), as are persons employed as substitute teachers. (\u00a7 44917.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>It appears in the present case that all of the 154 persons classified by the District as temporary employees were working during the 2002-2003 school year in either long-term replacement positions or in categorically funded programs. We therefore will confine our discussion to these two groups.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">1. <em>Long-term Replacement Teachers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">By our count, the District treated 133 of the 154 temporary employees as long-term replacement teachers in ongoing classes (\u00a7 44920), and two others as regular teachers in what evidently were temporary classes (\u00a7 44852).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> All 135 of these teachers possessed something less than a regular credential: 47 had a preintem certificate (\u00a7 44305), 33 had a university internship credential (\u00a7 44450 et seq.), 31 had an emergency teaching permit (\u00a7 44300), four had a credential waiver (\u00a7 44225, subd. (m)), and the remainder had some combination of two of these.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Section 44920 provides in part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of Sections 44917 [substitute employees, see fn. 14, <em>ante] </em>and 44919 [short-term temporary employees, see fn. 13, <em>ante], </em>the governing board of a school district may employ as a teacher, for a complete school year, but not less than one semester during a school year unless the date of rendering first paid service begins during the second semester and prior to March 15th, <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number><em>person holding appropriate certification documents, </em>and may classify such person as a temporary employee. <em>The employment of such persons shall be based upon the need for additional certificated employees during a particular semester or year because a certificated employee has been granted leave for a semester or year, or is experiencing long-term illness, and shall be limited, in number of persons so employed, to that need, as determined by the governing board.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">This provision is significant in two respects. First, other than requiring that long-term replacement teachers have \u201cappropriate certification documents,\u201d i.e., are qualified to teach the material in the classroom to which they are assigned, this classification is not concerned with the particular type or form of certification the replacement teacher holds. Second, the statute directs that a district may employ no more long-term replacement teachers than it has permanent or probationary teachers absent on leave at any one time. <em>(Welch </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1421, 1431-1432 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 374] (Welch); <em>Santa Barbara Federation of Teachers, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at pp. 232-233 [temporary teacher need not be replacing a <em>particular </em>regular teacher on leave]; <em>Paulus v. Board of Trustees </em>(1976) 64 Cd.App.3d 59, 62-63 [134 Cal.Rptr. 220] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Here, the undisputed evidence shows there were at most 22 regular teachers in the District on long-term absences during the 2002-2003 school year. Therefore, the District was not permitted to classify more than this number of teachers as temporary employees under section 44920. The rest were, perforce, probationary teachers unless the District, as it claims, was entitled to classify them as temporary employees based entirely on the fact they possessed something less than a regular credential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Section 44920 also limits the power of a district to rehire teachers year after year in temporary positions. It goes on to provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">\u201cAny person employed for one complete school year as a temporary employee [e.g., a long-term replacement teacher] <em>shall, </em>if reemployed for the following school year <em>in a vacant position </em>requiring certification qualifications, be classified by the governing board as a probationary employee and the previous year\u2019s employment as a temporary employee shall be deemed one year\u2019s employment as a probationary employee for purposes of acquiring permanent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">\u201cFor purposes of this section \u2018vacant position\u2019 means a position in which the employee is qualified to serve and which is not filled by a permanent or probationary employee. It shall not include a position which would be filled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>by a permanent or probationary employee except for the fact that such employee is on leave.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">A similar provision appears in section 44918, which also requires that long-term replacement teachers must be given priority in filling vacant positions in the district in the year following their temporary service, and that their subsequent employment in a vacant position will, in most circumstances, cause their year of temporary service to be deemed a year of probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>service.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Taylor, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 500 [preferential reemployment rights granted by \u00a7 44918 apply to temporary teachers hired under \u00a7 44920].) It thus appears that the positions occupied by long-term replacement teachers in excess of the number of positions normally occupied by regular teachers on leave qualified as \u201cvacant positions\u201d within the meaning of sections 44920 and 44918.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">As we discuss below, the provision that permits a year of temporary employment to count in some circumstances as the first of two consecutive probationary years needed to acquire permanent status is central to the District\u2019s argument, on policy grounds, that it should be able, on a yearly basis, to lay off and rehire teachers having less than a regular credential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">2. <em>Employees in Categorically Funded Programs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Nineteen of the 154 persons classified by the District as temporary employees evidently were assigned to work in categorically funded programs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Although such persons are not specifically identified in the Code as temporary employees, they are treated in much the same way in that they may be dismissed without the formalities required for probationary and permanent employees in the event the program expires or is terminated, and their service does not count toward acquiring permanent status (unless they are reemployed the following year in a probationary position). (See <em>Zalac, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 842-846 [teacher properly classified as temporary employee for two years while working in categorically funded program should have been classified as probationary employee when rehired for third year in regular position after discontinuation of program]; <em>Schnee, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th 555, 560-565 [disagreeing with <em>Zalac </em>dictum regarding when permanent status accrues].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">\u201cThe intent of former section 13329 [now \u00a7 44909] was \u2018to prevent a person from acquiring probationary status solely through teaching in a categorically funded program. This permits the hiring of qualified persons for categorically funded programs of undetermined duration without incurring responsibility to grant tenured status based on such teaching services alone.\u2019 [Citation.] The section \u2018was intended to give school districts flexibility in the operation of special educational programs to supplement their regular program and to relieve them from having a surplus of probationary or permanent teachers when project funds are terminated or cut back.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Zalac, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Section 44909 provides in part: \u201cThe governing board of any school district may employ persons possessing an appropriate credential as certificated employees in programs and projects to perform services conducted under contract with public or private agencies, or categorically funded projects which are not required by federal or state statutes. The terms and conditions under which such persons are employed shall be mutually agreed upon by the employee and the governing board and such agreement shall be reduced to writing. Service pursuant to this section shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to, classification as a permanent employee unless (1) such person has served pursuant to this section for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district by which he is employed are maintained and (2) such person is <em>subsequently employed as a probationary employee </em>in a position requiring certification qualifications. Such persons may be employed for periods which are less than a full school year and <em>may be terminated at the expiration of the contract or specially funded project without regard to other requirements of this code respecting the termination of probationary or permanent employees other than Section 44918 </em>[which concerns the reemployment rights of temporary employees, see fin. 19, <em>ante].\u201d </em>(Italics added; see also <em>Schnee, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.4th at p. 564 [teacher must serve for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>year as a probationary employee before prior temporary service may be counted toward permanent status].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Thus, certificated teachers assigned to a categorically funded program may be laid off without the procedural formalities due a permanent and probationary employee <em>only </em>if the program has expired. <em>(Hart Federation of Teachers, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at pp. 215-216; <em>Zalac, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 852.) Here, so far as the record discloses, none of the programs to which the 19 laid-off employees were assigned had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">B. <em>Teacher Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">The Code directs that the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) \u201cshall\u201d issue only two types of credentials\u2014teaching credentials and services credentials\u2014and that it \u201cmay\u201d issue an internship teaching or services credential. (\u00a7 44250.) These credentials, in turn, have an \u201c \u2018[authorization\u2019 \u201d that identifies the subjects and circumstances in which the holder may teach, or the services he or she may render in the public schools. (\u00a7 44203, subd. (d).) In the case of teaching credentials, these authorizations may provide for single subject or multiple subjects instruction, specialist instruction, or instruction in designated subjects. (\u00a7 44256; see also \u00a7\u00a7 44259 [single and multiple subjects credential], 44260 [designated subjects credential], 44265 [specialist credential].) Authorizations for services credentials include pupil personnel (counseling), health, library services, and administration. (\u00a7\u00a7 44266-44270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In addition to what might be termed \u201cregular,\u201d i.e., preliminary and professional (clear), credentials (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 44251, 44259; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 5, \u00a7 80001, subd. (k)), the Code authorizes the CTC to issue other, alternative forms of certification, including emergency permits (\u00a7 44300 et seq.), preintem teaching certificates (\u00a7 44305 et seq.), district intern certificates (\u00a7 44325 et seq.), and university internship credentials (\u00a7 44450 et seq.), and to grant waivers or temporary exemptions from some credential requirements (\u00a7 44225, subd. (m)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">All 154 of the certificated employees in the present case who were classified by the District as temporary employees in the 2002-2003 school year possessed one or more of these alternative forms of certification, except a district intern certificate. The District claims this temporary classification necessarily followed from the fact they did not have regular credentials. For example, in his declaration submitted in the trial court setting out the District\u2019s position, Dennis Patrick, the assistant superintendent for personnel, stated as to each of the temporary employees that the employee had been classified as temporary because he or she \u201cdid not possess a credential that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number><em>required </em>[them] to be employed and classified as a probationary employee.\u201d (Italics added.) With the single exception of the district intern certificate however, none of these credentials, regular or not, specifies how an employee working under the credential is to be classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">Section 44300 authorizes the CTC to issue and renew emergency teaching and specialist permits to persons who have earned a baccalaureate degree and passed a basic skills proficiency test (California Basic Educational Skills Test; CBEST), provided the school district in which the person is to be employed is able to show it has conducted a diligent search for, but been unable to recruit, a sufficient number of certificated teachers, \u201cincluding teacher candidates pursuing full certification through internship, district internship, or other alternative routes established by the commission.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a)(3)(A); see <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Commission on Teacher Credentialing </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1469, 1472-1474 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 126] [providing statutory and regulatory history].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">In 1997, the Legislature created the California Preintemship Teaching Program (\u00a7 44305), and amended section 44300 to express its intent that the CTC \u201cshall issue preintem certificates in place of emergency teaching permits as sufficient resources are made available to school districts to provide services ... to preintems pursuing multiple subject or single subject teaching credentials.\u201d (\u00a7 44300, subd. (b)(1).) Section 44305 authorizes the CTC to issue preintem certificates to persons who have earned a baccalaureate degree, passed the CBEST test, and completed the number of units set by the CTC for the \u201cmultiple subject or single subject preintem teaching certificate.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (c).) It also requires that the CTC establish criteria for approving preintem teaching programs, which criteria shall include among other things \u201c[d]emonstrated need, as indicated by the percentage of teachers in the district that have not completed basic credential requirements pursuant to state law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Section 44305, as since amended, provides further: \u201cThe preintem teaching certificate issued by the commission shall be valid for one year, but may be renewed for one additional year if the holder takes the appropriate subject matter examination ... or is enrolled in a subject matter program approved by the commission .... A preintem teacher who passes the subject matter examination or completes a subject matter program in the first or second year of his or her preintem teaching <em>shall enroll in a district or university teaching internship or other approved university teaching credential program. A </em>preintem teaching certificate may be renewed for a third year if the employing school district, the cooperating college or university, and the preintem support the application for renewal.\u201d (\u00a7 44305, subd. (b), as amended by Stats. 2001, ch. 342, \u00a7 23, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>The Legislature explained its rationale for replacing emergency teaching permits with preintemship teaching certificates as follows: \u201c(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: [f] (1) Approximately 100,000 teachers are employed in the elementary schools of the state. [][] (2) Approximately 1,100 of these teachers are in paid internships and receive systematic support and training as they advance toward full certification. [J[] (3) In the 1995-96 school year, over 6,400 elementary teachers held emergency permits only. Most of these teachers have little experience and no preparation for their teaching responsibilities, (4) As a result of the implementation of the Class Size Reduction program in the 1996-97 school year, the number of teachers with emergency permits in elementary classrooms is expected to reach 8,000 or more, [f] (5) Most of the unprepared and untrained teachers with emergency permits are employed in urban schools where pupils need the best trained and most effective teachers, [f] (6) As a general rule, teachers with emergency permits get very little training or support from the schools that employ them, in part because there are no resources directed to help this group of teachers. As a consequence, between 35 percent and 40 percent of all teachers with emergency permits in both elementary and secondary schools do not teach beyond the first year.\u201d (Stats. 1997, ch. 934, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">As noted, a preintem teacher who passes or completes a prescribed examination or subject matter program in the first or second year of preintem teaching \u201cshall enroll in a district or university teaching internship or other approved university teaching credential program.\u201d (\u00a7 44305, subd. (b).) The \u201cuniversity teaching internship\u201d program to which this refers was established by the Teacher Education Internship Act of 1967, as amended. (\u00a7 44450 et seq.) \u201cDistrict\u201d internships, on the other hand, are governed by section 44325 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The Teacher Education Internship Act was enacted \u201cto encourage the development and maintenance of [professional] preparation programs that are realistic and practical in content and theory and are directly related to the individual functions and responsibilities practitioners in the public schools of California face.\u201d (\u00a7 44451.) Any school district may, with the approval of the CTC, establish an internship program in conjunction with a college or university. (\u00a7 44452.) An applicant, to be admitted to the program, must have earned a baccalaureate degree, and passed a subject matter examination or completed an approved subject matter program. (\u00a7 44453, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">\u201cAn internship credential authorizes the same service at the same levels as the regular [standard] credential authorizes.\u201d (\u00a7 44454.) The certificate is issued initially for a period of two years, and may be renewed by the CTC. (\u00a7 44455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>The Teacher Education Internship Act does not specify how a university intern is to be classified, but it provides in section 44464 that he or she shall not be accorded the procedural rights of a probationary employee dismissed or suspended during the school year for cause or unsatisfactory performance. (See \u00a7\u00a7 44948, 44948.3.) It does not, however, impose similar limitations with respect to dismissals and layoffs at the end of the school year. (See \u00a7\u00a7 44949, 44955.) And it allows service as a university intern to count toward acquiring tenure if the teacher is rehired by the district after completing the internship program. \u201cAn intern shall not acquire tenure while serving on an internship credential. A person who, after completing a teaching internship program authorized pursuant to this article, is employed for at least one complete school year in a position requiring certification qualifications by the school district that employed the person as an intern during the immediately preceding school year and is reelected for the next succeeding school year to a position requiring certification qualifications shall, at the commencement of the succeeding school year, acquire tenure.\u201d (\u00a7 44466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The part of this section following the first sentence\u2014providing that the second year of service under a university internship credential may, in some circumstances, count toward the acquisition of permanent status under section 44929.21\u2014was added in 1997. (Stats. 1997, ch. 138, \u00a7 2, eff. July 29, 1997; <em>Peoples v.

In the event the governing board does not give notice pursuant to this section on or before March 15, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">In <em>Welch, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 1421, the court interpreted subdivision (a) of section 44885.5 to create two categories of probationary employees: those employed as district interns, and those reemployed by the same district after having completed the internship program but who have not yet acquired permanent status under subdivision (b). <em>(Welch, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1430-1432.) It thereby rejected the argument that only those teachers who meet all three of these conditions must be classified as probationary employees. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">As we have said, the Legislature amended the statute (\u00a7 44466) regarding tenure for <em>university interns </em>with the intent to make it consistent with the corresponding statute (\u00a7 44885.5) regarding tenure for <em>district interns. </em>In <em>Peoples, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th 463, the court relied in part on this expression of legislative intent in a case brought by a former university intern claiming permanent status. The teacher received a notice of dismissal in May of her fifth year of employment\u2014one year under a preintem certificate, one year under a university internship credential, two years under the same credential after completing the internship program, and one year under a preliminary credential. The question was whether, pursuant to section 44666, her final year of employment under the internship credential should be counted as one of the two probationary years necessary to acquire permanent status. If so\u2014i.e., if the teacher was in her second year for tenure purposes when she received the dismissal notice\u2014the notice was late because it was not served by March 15, and she was effectively reelected as a permanent employee for the following year. (\u00a7 44929.21, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">The school district argued that a university intern, unlike a district intern, is <em>not </em>a probationary employee, and so cannot earn credit toward permanent status while working under an internship credential. The appellate court found this argument misplaced. The real issue, the court said, was not whether a teacher is a probationary employee while working as a university intern, but whether, after working the next year under a regular credential (presumably as a probationary employee), the final internship year should be counted toward acquiring tenure. The court held pursuant to section 44666 that it should be, as it is for district interns under section 44885.5. <em>(Peoples, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at pp. 468-472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">This result, while it appears to be correct, creates the anomalous situation in which university and district interns are treated the same for purposes of acquiring tenure after completing their internships, but ar\u00e9 treated differently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>while working as interns with respect to dismissal for cause during the school year. This observation brings us finally to the District\u2019s contention that, as a matter of policy, teachers should not enjoy the benefits and protections granted to probationary employees until they earn a regular credential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">III. Policy Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">As we have seen, there are, generally speaking, three significant differences between certificated employees classified as probationary and their counterparts classified as temporary. First, probationary employees are afforded more procedural protections in the event a school district proposes to dismiss them for cause or, as was the case here, to lay them off as part of a workforce reduction. (Compare \u00a7\u00a7 44949, 44955 [probationary employees] with \u00a7 44954 [temporary employees].) Second, service as a probationary employee generally counts toward the two consecutive years required to attain permanent status (tenure). (\u00a7 44929.21, subd. (b).) A year of service as a temporary employee <em>may </em>be counted toward permanent status if the employee is reemployed the following year by the same district \u201cin a position requiring certification qualifications.\u201d (\u00a7 44909; see \u00a7\u00a7 44917, 44920.) Third, the seniority of a certificated employee is determined as of the date the employee \u201cfirst rendered paid service in a probationary position.\u201d (\u00a7 44845.) Temporary employees do not accrue seniority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">The first two of these differences, insofar as they relate at least to certificated employees holding emergency teaching permits, have been the subject of other published decisions. That is to say, the issue in these cases was not whether a teacher having only an emergency permit must be classified as a temporary employee (the principal issue in this case), but whether that teacher is entitled to some, if not all, of the benefits normally associated with probationary employees. The answer is \u201cyes, and no,\u201d but it nonetheless sheds some light on the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">The first of the published cases was <em>Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 1026. It was concerned with the application of section 44911, which states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>\u201cService by a person under a provisional credential shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to, classification as a permanent employee of a school district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201cThis section shall not be applicable to teachers granted a one-year emergency credential under conditions specified in subdivision (b) of Section 44252 and subdivision (h) of Section 44830 [requiring passage of basic skills proficiency test, with certain exceptions, including one for teachers with out-of-state credentials].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">There no longer is such a thing as a \u201cprovisional credential,\u201d so the issue in <em>Summerfield. </em>was whether section 44911 applied to bar persons working under an emergency teaching permit from earning credit toward permanent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Ms. Summerfield worked her first year as a temporary teacher under an emergency teaching permit. She was rehired the following year as a temporary teacher under a renewed permit, but was then reclassified as a probationary teacher. Toward the end of her second year, the district notified Summerfield that she had successfully completed her probationary period and would be classified as a permanent (tenured) teacher for the next school year. But a month later, the district changed its position and advised Summerfield her two years working under an emergency permit could not be counted toward tenure, and she could not be classified as a probationary teacher until she had obtained a regular credential. She did so, and was hired the third year as a first-year probationary teacher. Then, at the end of the third year, the district told Summerfield she was being dismissed and would not be rehired for the following year. She successfully petitioned for a writ of mandate directing the district to employ her as a permanent teacher, with accrued benefits and backpay. The district appealed in reliance on section 44911.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The appellate court, after tracing the statutory transformation of \u201cprovisional credentials\u201d into \u201cemergency credentials\u201d into \u201cemergency teaching permits,\u201d concluded section 44911 applies to the latter. <em>(Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1030-1032; see also <em>Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 379-383.) The court also concluded Summerfield did not fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>exception in the second paragraph of section 44911, which the court construed to apply only to teachers with out-of-state credentials who are working in this state under an emergency credential while waiting to take and pass the CBEST test. <em>(Summerfield, supra, 95 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1032-1035; see also <em>Elk Grove, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at pp. 567-568.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Notably, the court observed in a footnote that the district, although it had at first \u201cmistakenly\u201d classified Summerfield as a probationary employee while she was working under an emergency permit in her second year, it was not bound by this classification because \u201cit is well settled that the two-year probationary period for teachers is mandatory and may not be shortened by the advice or actions of a school district.\u201d <em>(Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035, fin. 6.) This observation would be called into question by the next published decision we will discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\"><em>Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 369 is a decision by this court. The teacher in that case, Curran, worked her first year under an emergency teaching permit and was classified as a <em>probationary </em>employee. She was offered, and accepted, a contract for the following year, as a second-year probationary teacher, that was contingent on her taking certain steps to obtain a regular credential.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A dispute subsequently arose about whether she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>satisfied this contingency, and the district notified her in August (after the start of the school year) that it would not hire her. Curran filed a petition for writ of mandate claiming the district had failed to follow the statutory procedure required to dismiss a probationary employee during the school year. Such dismissals generally must be based on cause or unsatisfactory performance, and must provide the employee with a 30-day notice and opportunity for a hearing. (See \u00a7 44948.3.) The trial court denied Curran\u2019s petition, holding that teachers working under an emergency permit may not be classified as probationary employees (notwithstanding the fact the district had classified her that way).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Curran argued on appeal that, in the absence of any provision in the Code requiring teachers with emergency permits to be classified as temporary employees, the district was required to classify her as a probationary employee pursuant to section 44915 (teacher who has not been classified as permanent or substitute employee must be classified as probationary employee). We framed the issue this way: \u201cThe Education Code does not explicitly resolve this dispute. On one hand, the statutory provisions do not explicitly prohibit a teacher with an emergency permit from being classified as a probationary employee. On the other hand, no statutory provision explicitly delineates how teachers with emergency permits should be classified. Consequently, we must determine whether the general rule set forth in section 44915 concerning when a teacher should be classified as a probationary employee applies to a teacher with an emergency permit.\u201d <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 377, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">At the outset of our discussion, we acknowledged the footnote in <em>Summerfield </em>in which the court stated it had been a mistake for the district to classify the teacher in that case as a probationary employee while she was working under an emergency permit. The statement, we said, was dictum and so failed to resolve the issue before us.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>As we explained in <em>Golden Valley, </em>the Legislature first authorized the issuance of emergency credentials in 1943, during World War II, to compensate for the exodus of teachers to the war effort. It provided at the same time that service under the credential could not count toward acquiring permanent status. It did <em>not, </em>however, impose other comparable restrictions by, for example, excluding teachers working under emergency credentials from provisions governing the classification of probationary employees, from provisions establishing the minimum salaries of persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications, or from the protections granted probationary employees in the event they are laid off or dismissed. <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 379-380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Also in 1943, the Legislature enacted what eventually would become section 44915. It provides now, as it did then, that school districts shall \u201c \u2018classify as probationary employees, those persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications for the school year, who have not been classified as permanent employees or as substitute employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 381-382.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">In 1947, the Legislature authorized the issuance of provisional credentials to give teachers working under an emergency credential the opportunity to qualify for a regular credential. Again, the Legislature provided that service under a provisional credential did not count toward acquiring permanent status, but again it imposed no restrictions on the probationary classification, minimum salary requirements, or dismissal procedures for persons working under the credential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">\u201c. . . As with the wording and structure of the provisions concerning emergency credentials, the wording and structure of the provisions concerning provisional credentials imply the holder of a provisional credential was eligible for probationary classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">\u201cThe foregoing implications of legislative intent were strengthened in 1951 when the Legislature amended the minimum pay provisions and set a separate minimum annual salary for persons employed \u2018full time in a position requiring certification qualifications and serving under other than an emergency credential or provisional credential.\u2019 [Citation.] These amendments are further recognition by the Legislature that teachers serving under an emergency credential or provisional credential were subject to the rules generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>applicable to teachers employed in \u2018positions requiring certification qualifications,\u2019 <em>unless a specific exclusion was </em>enacted.\u201d <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 381, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Amendments made to the Code in 1970 replaced its provisions for provisional credentials with what were then called emergency credentials, and these in turn were replaced in 1988 by emergency teaching and specialist permits. <em>(Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1030-1031; <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Commission on Teacher Credentialing, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1472-1474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Notwithstanding these amendments, the provision (now \u00a7 44911) excluding service under a \u201cprovisional credential\u201d from counting toward permanent status has not been changed, other than to add the second paragraph creating a narrow exception for teachers with out-of-state credentials working in this state under a \u201cone-year emergency credentialQ\u201d while waiting to take and pass the CBEST test. <em>(Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1032-1035.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">As we observed in <em>Golden Valley, </em>it would not have been necessary to exclude emergency-permitted teachers from the Code\u2019s tenure provisions unless they otherwise would have been entitled to earn tenure, and by excluding them <em>only </em>from the tenure provisions, the Legislature presumably intended that they should remain eligible for the other benefits of probationary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">\u201c. . . [T]his exclusion in section 44911 would not be necessary unless service by teachers with emergency permits was otherwise eligible to be counted towards permanent status. Because only service as a probationary employee counts towards permanent status (\u00a7 44929.21, subd. (b)), the existence of the exclusion in section 44911 implies that teachers with emergency permits can be classified as probationary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">\u201cThe enactment of the second paragraph of section 44911 also implies the Legislature intended teachers with emergency permits to be eligible for classification as probationary employees. The second paragraph contains an exception [for certain emergency-credentialed teachers] to the exclusion set forth in the first paragraph of section 44911 .... The net effect of the exception to the exclusion is to place teachers within the scope of the exception back under the general rule of section 44929.21 .... Thus, teachers within the scope of the exception can only reap its benefits <em>if they were within the general rule in the first instance. </em>Because only employees classified as probationary employees are within the general rule, it follows that teachers holding emergency permits and satisfying the other conditions of the exception may be classified as probationary employees. In contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>Golden Valley\u2019s position that every teacher with an emergency permit is precluded from being classified as a probationary employee renders the second paragraph of section 44911 nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">\u201cAccordingly, we construe section 44915 to allow a teacher serving under an emergency permit to be classified as a probationary employee. This construction harmonizes section 44915 with sections 44911 and 44929.21 rather than rendering section 44911 superfluous. As a consequence of this construction, teachers serving under an emergency permit who satisfy the requirements of section 44915 are entitled to the statutory protections governing the dismissal of a probationary employee.\u201d <em>(Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 382-383, fn. omitted; see also <em>Motevalli v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 97, 109-110 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 562] [emergency-permitted teacher classified as \u201cprovisional\u201d nonetheless was probationary employee by operation of \u00a7 44915]; <em>Culbertson, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.4th at p. 1399 [distinguishing <em>Golden </em>Valley]; <em>Fine, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.4th at p. 1077, fn. 6 [discussing <em>Golden Valley].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The District, in the present case, notes that our decision in <em>Golden Valley </em>permits, but does not <em>require, </em>a school district to classify teachers having only emergency permits as probationary employees. It reasons from this premise that it therefore is not precluded from classifying those teachers (and, by extension, all other certificated employees having less than a regular credential) as temporary employees based entirely on their lack of such a credential. As should be evident from the foregoing discussion, however, this reasoning misconstrues the statutory classification scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">We could not have held in <em>Golden Valley </em>that emergency-permitted teachers <em>must </em>be classified as probationary employees because, as we have said, their classification, and the classification of all other certificated employees (with the single exception of district interns), is not determined by what type of credential or certification they have. If a certificated employee occupies a position the Code defines as temporary, he or she is a temporary employee; if it is not a position that requires temporary classification (or permanent or substitute), he or she is a probationary employee. (\u00a7 44915.) The Code grants school districts no discretion to deviate from this statutory classification scheme. <em>(Eureka Teacher\u2019s Assn. v. Board of Education </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 469, 474 [247 Cal.Rptr. 790] [school district\u2019s control over teacher classification ends where the rights afforded teachers by the Code begins].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">A probationary employee working under an emergency teaching or specialist permit does not accrue credit toward permanent status (\u00a744911; <em>Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 1026), but is entitled to the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>protections accorded such employees in the event of a dismissal for cause or unsatisfactory performance (\u00a7\u00a7 44948, 44948.3 &amp; 44949; <em>Golden Valley, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 369), or a layoff as the result of a reduction in the workforce (\u00a7 44955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">A certificated employee working in a temporary position (e.g., as a long-term replacement teacher [\u00a7 44920] or in a categorically funded program [\u00a7 44909]), other than an employee working under an emergency teaching or specialist permit (\u00a7 44300), may accrue credit toward permanent status if he or she is rehired the following year \u201cas a probationary employee in a position requiring certification qualifications\u201d (\u00a7 44909), \u201cin a position requiring certification qualifications\u201d (\u00a7 44917), \u201cas a probationary employee\u201d (\u00a7 44918), or \u201cin a vacant position requiring certification qualifications\u201d (\u00a7 44920). A temporary employee in a certificated position, who has served at least 75 percent of the school year, may be summarily released with no procedural formalities other than notice before the end of the school year (June 30). (\u00a7 44954.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The one remaining difference between temporary and probationary employees occupying positions requiring certification qualifications is the acquisition of seniority. The District and amicus curiae contend that any interpretation of the Code that permits certificated employees having less than a regular credential to be classified as probationary employees, and so to acquire seniority, would defeat the Code\u2019s preference for fully credentialed teachers. (See <em>Summerfield, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035.) This argument envisions the possibility an emergency-permitted teacher may have more seniority than one with a regular credential. Thus, the District asserts: \u201cUnder the trial court\u2019s construction [of the Code], a school district would be required to lay off fully qualified teachers and retain teachers [with more seniority] who are not fiilly qualified (e.g., serving under emergency credentials [szc, emergency permits], waivers, pre-internship and university internship credentials), even though by law such persons cannot be hired unless the school district can demonstrate that a fully qualified teacher is not available.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Section 44845 states: \u201cEvery probationary or permanent employee . . . shall be deemed to have been employed on the date upon which he [or she] first rendered paid service in a probationary position.\u201d (See <em>San Jose Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 640-641 [statute applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>probationary service in children\u2019s center, i.e., in any position requiring certification qualifications, as well as to service in regular program].) If the Legislature had intended that only probationary and permanent employees <em>with a preliminary or clear credential </em>shall acquire seniority, it would not have been difficult to say so. We recognize in making this observation that very little in the Code seems to be stated in the easiest or most direct way. <em>(Haase, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d at p. 917 [\u201cEntry into the Education Code is painful\u201d].) But once having determined that certificated employees with less than a regular credential must in certain circumstances be classified as probationary, we cannot then overlook the clear directive in section 44845 that, as probationary employees, they are entitled to accrue seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">In summary, we hold the District\u2019s policy for classifying teachers and counselors as temporary employees, insofar as it is based on the fact they hold something less than a preliminary or professional (clear) credential, is invalid. We hold further that the District may classify as temporary employees only those persons who, by virtue of the position they occupy or the manner of service they perform, are defined or described as temporary employees in the Code. All certificated employees who are not so classified as temporary employees, and who are not properly classified under the Code as permanent or substitute employees, must be classified as probationary employees (\u00a7 44915) and must be accorded the rights of probationary employees as provided in the Code, including the right to accrue seniority (\u00a7 44845) and the rights to notice and a hearing in the event of a workforce reduction (\u00a7\u00a7 44949, 44955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">It follows that those persons classified as temporary employees who should have been classified as probationary employees during the 2002-2003 school year, who were not given proper notice of the District\u2019s proposed workforce reduction, were effectively reemployed for the following school year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>(\u00a7 44955, subd. (c).) It also follows that the order in which those employees were laid off and reemployed, relative to the teachers and counselors classified by the District as probationary employees, must be redetermined based on the relative seniority dates of the misclassified temporary employees, and their layoff and reemployment priorities adjusted accordingly. The District\u2019s workforce layoffs for the 2003-2004 school year, of both probationary and misclassified temporary employees, therefore must be set aside. To the extent the trial court\u2019s judgment is consistent with these conclusions, we will affirm it.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">To the extent the trial court\u2019s judgment can be understood to direct the District to change to probationary (or permanent) the classification of every teacher or counselor it classified as temporary during the 2002-2003 school year, without regard to the person\u2019s individual situation, we will reverse it.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>As appears from the foregoing discussion, the possible combinations of circumstances that can affect a person\u2019s classification, and the specific rights he or she enjoys within that classification, simply are too numerous and varied to say with certainty that every temporary employee was misclassified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">We also agree with the District\u2019s contention that any claims for backpay and benefits by misclassified temporary employees\u2014those employees who, consistent with this opinion, should have been classified as probationary employees during the 2002-2003 school year, and who were for lack of proper notice effectively reelected as probationary employees for the 2003-2004 school year\u2014must be limited to the 2003-2004 school year. As probationary employees, they had no right to continued employment beyond that year. <em>(Golden </em>Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 386; <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Mendocino Unified School Dist. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 522, 526-527 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 879]; <em>Fischer v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 87, 93-94 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 452].) We will reverse the judgment insofar as it permits recovery for subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Finally, we agree with the District that it should be permitted to conduct limited discovery with respect to its burden to prove mitigation of damages. While the judgment provides that the misclassified temporary employees\u2019 claims for lost compensation should be reduced by amounts they received or reasonably could have received from comparable employment, and it correctly assigns to the District the burden of proving those offsetting amounts, it then effectively denies the District the means to do so.

(The court evidently assumed that a teacher cannot be rehired the following year as a probationary employee <em>except </em>in a vacant position.) Therefore, the court said, temporary employees are \u201cnot automatically entitled to probationary status by virtue of the fact that they have each been reemployed following a year as a temporary teacher.\u201d <em>(Santa Barbara Federation of Teachers, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">In <em>Kalamaras v.

The court acknowledged that this interpretation arguably gave temporary employees more rights than probationary employees (who can be nonreelected at the end of a school year), but left that to the Legislature to resolve. (Kalamaras, <em>supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1578.) The Legislature responded by amending section 44918 in 1992 to provide, among other things, that a temporary employee shall be reemployed the following year in a vacant position \u201cunless the employee has been released pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 44954.\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 336, \u00a7 1, p. 1303; see also Historical and Statutory Notes, 27B West\u2019s Ann.

The District attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Golden Valley </em>on this basis. It asserts: \u201cUnder these circumstances, the Court of Appeal [in <em>Golden </em>Valley] was required to harmonize the provisions of Education Code section 44916 (failure to notify teacher as temporary means employee is probationary) [see fn. 8, <em>ante] </em>with the provisions of Education Code section 44911 (service under a provisional credential does not count towards probationary status).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">As will appear, this is a mischaracterization of our opinion in <em>Golden Valley. </em>First of all, our conclusion that an emergency-permitted teacher may be classified as a probationary employee was in no way based on section 44916. Secondly, and more importantly, we did not construe section 44911 (nor has any other court construed that section so far as we are aware) to say that \u201cservice under a provisional credential does not count towards probationary status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">The District\u2019s reasoning, as we understand it, is that since certificated employees working under a \u201cprovisional credential\u201d do not earn credit toward permanent status (\u00a744911), and since probationary employees <em>do </em>earn credit toward permanent status (\u00a7 44929.21, subd. (b)), a person working under a provisional credential, i.e., less than a regular credential, must by definition be less than a regular employee, viz., a temporary one. But, as we explained in <em>Golden Valley, </em>an emergency-permitted teacher may possess some of the rights accorded probationary employees (dismissal protections) but not others (credit toward tenure). Were it otherwise, as we discuss below, section 44911 would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">The District relies in part for its position on <em>Zalac, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th 838, where, as we noted above, the court found a <em>regularly credentialed </em>teacher had been properly classified as a temporary employee during the two years she was assigned to a categorically funded program (\u00a7 44909), but should have been reclassified as a probationary employee for the following (third) year, after the program was discontinued and she was assigned to a regular program. The District seems to say that the <em>Zalac </em>court found the teacher was a temporary employee because section 44909 contains the same sort of language as section 44911 regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>accrual of credit toward permanent status. But the issue in <em>Zalac </em>was whether section 44909 applied to the teacher in her <em>third </em>year of teaching, after the categorical program was discontinued, and in particular whether the part of section 44909 applied that states a teacher in a categorical program may be terminated when the program expires without the formalities required for a permanent and probationary teacher. In other words, certificated employees in categorically funded programs are treated <em>like </em>temporary employees <em>for dismissal purposes </em>because section 44909 expressly requires that they be. <em>Zalac </em>does not support the proposition that teachers having less than a regular credential must be classified as temporary employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1026-8\"> The issue before the court in <em>Summerfield </em>was whether, in light of section 44911, a year of service as a temporary teacher, working under an emergency permit, may be deemed a year of probationary employment for purposes of acquiring tenure when the teacher is rehired by the same district for the following year \u201cin a . .. position requiring certification qualifications.\u201d (\u00a7 44920; fn. 21, <em>ante.) </em>To the extent the court\u2019s statement was meant to apply to a teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>working under some other type of certification, or to a teacher working under an emergency permit for some purpose other than tenure, it was dictum. The issue before this court in <em>Golden Valley </em>was whether a teacher working under an emergency permit was entitled to the procedural protections accorded a probationary employee who is dismissed during the school year.
