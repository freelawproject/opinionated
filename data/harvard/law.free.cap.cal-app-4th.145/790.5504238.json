Day (collectively, plaintiffs). The messages consisted of electronic mail messages (e-mails) sent to Delfino and messages that were posted on Internet bulletin boards. These e-mails and postings were ultimately traced to Cameron Moore. Plaintiffs brought suit against Moore and his former employer, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Agilent). Agilent moved for summary judgment on various grounds, and the trial court granted the motion on the basis that Agilent was immune from suit under the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). Specifically, the court held that under title 47 of the United States Code section 230(c)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Agilent was a \u201cprovider ... of an interactive computer service\u201d entitled to immunity under the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Plaintiffs contend on appeal that summary judgment should not have been granted because Agilent was not immune from suit under the CDA. They argue that they made a prima facie showing of negligence. We conclude after a de novo review that Agilent was an interactive computer service provider; as such, it was immune from liability for alleged damages arising out of the cyberthreats transmitted by its employee, Moore. We hold further that plaintiffs did not make a prima facie showing to support a claim against Agilent under theories of ratification, respondeat superior, or negligent supervision and/or retention. We therefore find that summary judgment in favor of Agilent was proper and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The complaint was filed on July 22, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It included a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and a purported claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress against Moore and Agilent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>that Moore sent a number of anonymous threats over the Internet and that he used Agilent\u2019s computer system to send these threats. Plaintiffs alleged further that Agilent was aware that Moore was using its computer system to threaten plaintiffs and that it took no action to prevent its employee from continuing to make his threats over the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Plaintiffs alleged that the anonymous threats against them occurred between April and July 2002, while an appeal was pending in unrelated litigation brought by plaintiffs\u2019 former employer, Varian Medical Systems (and others), against plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The threats alleged in the complaint\u2014most of which were directed solely at Delfino\u2014were either e-mail messages sent to Delfino or were messages posted on the Yahoo! Message Board VAR.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most of the threatening e-mails and postings were sent by an individual using the Yahoo! screen name \u201ccrack_smokingJesus\u201d; Moore later admitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that he had used this pseudonym.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The first cause of action of the complaint, captioned \u201cIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress,\u201d alleged that Moore\u2019s conduct in sending the anonymous e-mails and postings was intentional and malicious, causing plaintiffs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201csuffer humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress.\u201d Plaintiffs alleged on information and belief that Agilent \u201cwas informed and knew that Moore was using its computer system to\u201d send the threatening messages. The second cause of action, captioned, \u201cNegligent Infliction of Emotional Distress,\u201d contained (and incorporated by reference) the allegations of the first cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Agilent filed a motion for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication. Plaintiffs opposed the motion. On March 18, 2005, the court entered an order granting Agilent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that \u201cAgilent established that it is immune from liability under [section] 230(c)(1).. ., and plaintiffs failed to raise a triable issue of material fact in regard thereto.\u201d Judgment was entered on the summary judgment order on May 13, 2005.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment. The appeal is one that properly lies from a judgment entered upon an order granting summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (m); <em>Oakland Raiders </em>v. <em>National Football League </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 621, 628-629 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 266].)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">I. <em>Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the court erred in granting the summary judgment motion. They assert that Agilent is not immune from suit under section 230 of the CDA. They argue that because Agilent had no CDA immunity and it failed to take measures to protect plaintiffs from Moore\u2019s threatening communications, it is subject to negligence liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">As we have acknowledged, \u201c[construction and application of a statute involve questions of law, which require independent review.\u201d <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Padilla </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 707, 711 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 722]; see also <em>Elene H. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1445, 1451 [269 Cal.Rptr. 783] [de novo review of summary judgment motion founded on defense of immunity].) Likewise, since summary judgment motions involve purely questions of law, we review the granting of summary judgment de novo. <em>(Alexander v. Codemasters Group Limited </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 129, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>139 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 145] [de novo review of \u201cwhether a triable issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law\u201d]; <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1438 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">HI. <em>The Order Granting Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3f\">\n<em>A. Agilent\u2019s Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On July 26, 2002,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Agilent was contacted by Special Agent Sean Wells from the FBI, who \u201cwas requesting information on the user whose originating IP [(Internet protocol)] address came back to Agilent for \u2018dreamcaster.txt.\u2019 \u201d Special Agent Wells gave no other information concerning the inquiry during the initial contact. But he followed up with an e-mail to Agilent on July 26, in which he provided a listing of log-in entries for \u201cdreamcaster.txt\u201d where Agilent was the originating IP address; the listing included 25 log-in entries dated between July 12 and July 15. The internal investigation was handled primarily by Agilent\u2019s IT Security Consultant and Program Manager for CITSIRT (Corporate Information Technology Security Incident Response Team), Bill Rolfe, and its EHS (environmental health and safety) &amp; Security Manager, Douglas Buffington.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On July 29, Buffington telephoned Special Agent Wells to introduce himself and to indicate that Agilent would cooperate fully with the FBI. Special Agent Wells stated that he \u201cwas investigating some e[-]mail traffic, some of which the FBI suspected might [have been] sent by an Agilent employee.\u201d Buffington asked for details but was told that Special Agent Wells had obtained information through a grand jury proceeding and could not discuss any specifics.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On July 30, Rolfe traced \u201cdreamcaster.txt\u201d to the Agilent computer assigned to Moore. Rolfe performed further tests which confirmed that Moore was the current user of the machine. After completing this work, Rolfe e-mailed Buffington on July 30 with the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Buffington telephoned Special Agent Wells on July 30 and advised that Agilent had identified the user of the IP address. Before Buffington could identify the person, Special Agent Wells asked, \u201c \u2018Is the name that you have Cameron Moore?\u2019 \u201d Buffington confirmed that this was the case. Special Agent Wells advised Buffington further that (1) \u201che was investigating complaints by Michelangelo Delfino and Mary Day, who were involved in a lawsuit with their former employer, Var\u00edan\u201d; (2) plaintiffs had posted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>were continuing \u201cto post tens of thousands of inflammatory messages about Var\u00edan executives\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (3) after plaintiffs had lost in a jury trial involving Var\u00edan, some supporters of Var\u00edan began responding negatively to plaintiffs; (4) plaintiffs had learned that Moore had made Internet postings siding with Var\u00edan; (5) plaintiffs had made a series of Internet postings about Moore; (6) plaintiffs \u201chad received some potentially threatening e[-]mails that appeared to come from Moore\u201d; (7) \u201cthe situation had \u2018gotten out of hand\u2019 and the FBI wanted \u2018to put an end to it\u2019 \u201d; (8) \u201cthe FBI wasn\u2019t planning to arrest Moore, didn\u2019t consider him to be dangerous, and wasn\u2019t after Moore\u2019s job\u201d; and (9) the FBI simply wanted to speak to him to \u201cget the situation stopped.\u201d Special Agent Wells neither informed Buffington of the substance of any of the e-mails the FBI was investigating, nor advised him that Moore made any threatening postings on Internet bulletin boards. Buffington did not understand from his communications with Special Agent Wells that the e-mails being investigated had been sent by Moore by using Agilent systems to log on to the Internet from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On August 1, Special Agent Wells made a followup request to Buffington for Agilent to investigate the log-in history (between June 27 and July 10) to determine whether the alias \u201cdr_dweezil2000.txt\u201d also belonged to Moore. Agilent thereafter determined that this alias was also traceable to the Agilent computer assigned to Moore. Buffington informed Special Agent Wells of Agilent\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On August 12, Buffington and Agilent\u2019s Management Support Consultant, Stephanie Pierce,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> met with Moore \u201cto obtain Moore\u2019s side of the story and to administer a stem warning.\u201d Buffington declared that after Pierce explained what Agilent knew, Moore apologized for involving Agilent \u201cbut denied sending any threats through the use of Agilent systems.\u201d (Original underscoring.) He stated that he had promised in writing that he would not engage in any further similar conduct and thereafter provided Agilent with a copy of his letter to the United States Attorney.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Pierce gave Moore a stem warning; although she indicated that \u201cthere was no proof that he had sent threatening e[-]mails over the Internet through the use of Agilent systems, she reminded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Moore of Agilent\u2019s Standards of Business Conduct[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] and warned him that ... he should not be using Agilent\u2019s computer systems for anything relating to [plaintiffs] or any other personal issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In February 2003, Special Agent Wells contacted Buffington to advise him that the FBI planned to arrest Moore for conduct relating to Delfino. Buffington specifically asked if the planned arrest involved conduct by Moore in using Agilent computers, and Special Agent Wells said that it did not involve such conduct. In or about mid-February 2003, the FBI arrested Moore. In late February 2003, Buffington contacted the FBI to request a copy of the affidavit signed by Special Agent Wells pertaining to Moore\u2019s arrest (arrest affidavit). Although Buffington was told at the time that the FBI \u201cwould be faxing it,\u201d he did not receive the faxed copy of the arrest affidavit until April 7, 2003. That arrest affidavit contained a number of details about the substance of Moore\u2019s threatening e-mails and postings, none of which had been provided previously by the FBI to Agilent.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On April 22, 2003, Buffington and two other Agilent representatives met with Moore. Moore admitted to Agilent for the first time that \u201cprior to August 2002, he had sent some things that \u2018weren\u2019t nice and could be interpreted as threats\u2019 by logging onto the Internet while at work.\u201d (Original underscoring.) This statement directly contradicted what Moore had told Buffington and Pierce on August 12. Moore denied that he had used Agilent\u2019s systems to send any threats after August. He also admitted that he had \u201csent sexually explicit or offensive e[-]mails over the Agilent e[-]mail system.\u201d Moore was informed at the conclusion of the meeting that he \u201cwas being placed on immediate administrative leave while Agilent determined what discipline was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On April 30, 2003, Agilent terminated Moore\u2019s employment. The termination notice advised Moore that he was being involuntarily terminated because he had violated Agilent\u2019s Standards of Business Conduct, \u201cspecifically misuse of Agilent\u2019s assets.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>B. <em>Opposition to Summary Judgment Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The evidence presented in opposition to the summary judgment motion primarily consisted of excerpts from transcripts of the depositions of plaintiffs and several Agilent employees, the arrest affidavit, and documents concerning Moore\u2019s sentencing. While that evidence was voluminous, most of it was not germane to the issues of CDA immunity and negligence liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Further, while plaintiffs indicated that there was a genuine dispute concerning a number of issues of material fact that Agilent claimed to have been undisputed (UMF), the evidence plaintiffs cited, upon examination, did not support their assertions. For instance, plaintiffs claimed a dispute existed regarding UMF No. 7\u2014i.e., that on July 30, the FBI neither told Agilent that threats had been sent through Agilent\u2019s computer system nor provided it with the contents of any e-mail the FBI was investigating. But plaintiffs\u2019 cited evidence consisted of improperly spliced, separate excerpts of Buffington\u2019s declaration and the arrest affidavit. As a result of the improper splicing, plaintiffs created purported content that did not exist in either document. (Indeed, the two spliced excerpts of the arrest affidavit were separated by three pages of text.) In any event, the purported evidence plaintiffs cited did not demonstrate that UMF No. 7 was disputed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Other matters raised in plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the summary judgment motion relevant to this appeal are discussed, <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>C. <em>Immunity Under the CDA</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVa\">1. <em>Applicable law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Section 230(c)(1) states that \u201c[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d The statute goes on to provide that causes of action inconsistent with it under state law are precluded: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State from enforcing any State law that is consistent with this section. <em>No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this </em>section.\u201d (\u00a7 230(e)(3), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Agilent contends that CDA immunity applied to plaintiffs\u2019 claims here. It argues that plaintiffs sought to impose derivative liability upon Agilent for Moore\u2019s Internet communications, where Agilent was simply a provider of an interactive computer service. Plaintiffs naturally dispute this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The CDA\u2014of which section 230 is a part\u2014was enacted in 1996.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Its \u201cprimary goal . . . was to control the exposure of minors to indecent material\u201d over the Internet. <em>(Batzel v. Smith, supra, </em>333 F.3d at p. 1026.) Thus, an \u201cimportant purpose of [the CDA] was to encourage [Internet] service providers to self-regulate the dissemination of offensive material over their services.\u201d <em>(Zeran v. America Online, Inc. </em>(4th Cir. 1997) 129 F.3d 327, 331, cert. den. (1998) 524 U.S. 937 [141 L.Ed.2d 712, 118 S.Ct. 2341] <em>(Zeran); </em>see \u00a7 230(b)(4) [\u201cIt is the policy of the United States\u2014HQ . . . [f] (4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children\u2019s access to objectionable or inappropriate online material. . . .\u201d].) Thus, section 230(c)(2) immunizes from liability an interactive computer service provider or user who makes good faith efforts to restrict access to material deemed objectionable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A second objective of the CDA was to avoid the chilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>effect upon Internet free speech that would be occasioned by the imposition of tort liability upon companies that do not create potentially harmful messages but are simply intermediaries for their delivery. <em>(Zeran, supra, </em>at pp. 330-331; see also \u00a7 230(b) [\u201cIt is the policy of the United States\u2014[f] (1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media; [f] (2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><em>Zeran, supra, </em>129 F.3d 327, is the leading case addressing the issue of immunity granted under section 230 to interactive computer service providers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There, the plaintiff (Kenneth Zeran) alleged that America Online, Inc. (AOL), \u201cunreasonably delayed in removing defamatory messages posted by an unidentified third party [on the AOL bulletin board<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>], refused to post retractions of those messages, and failed to screen for similar postings thereafter.\u201d (Zeran, <em>supra, </em>at p. 328.) The anonymous defamatory messages involved the advertising for purported sale of shirts containing \u201coffensive and tasteless slogans related to the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 329.) The postings included instructions \u201cto call \u2018Ken,\u2019 \u201d and listed the plaintiff\u2019s home telephone number. <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was no dispute that AOL was an \u201c \u2018interactive computer service,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that the person responsible for the anonymous postings was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>an \u201c \u2018information content provider,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as those terms were defined under the CDA. <em>(Zeran, supra, </em>129 F.3d at p. 330, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The Fourth Circuit concluded that the CDA provided AOL (as an interactive computer service provider) with immunity from the plaintiff\u2019s claims. It reasoned that the CDA\u2019s immunity provisions were the result of congressional recognition of \u201cthe threat that tort-based lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning Internet medium\u201d <em>(Zeran, supra, </em>129 F.3d at p. 330), and Congress\u2019s desire \u201cto encourage service providers to self-regulate the dissemination of offensive material over their services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 331.) The court held that section 230(c)(1) conferred \u201cbroad immunity\u201d <em>(Zeran, supra, </em>at p. 331) applicable to all interactive computer service providers, irrespective of whether they were publishers or distributors of the alleged defamatory matter authored by the information content provider. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 331-334.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">At least three other federal circuit courts have followed the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Zeran, supra, </em>129 F.3d 327. (See <em>Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 339 F.3d 1119; <em>Batzel v. Smith, supra, </em>333 F.3d 1018; <em>Green </em>v. <em>America Online (AOL) </em>(3d Cir. 2003) 318 F.3d 465; <em>Ben Ezra, Weinstein, &amp; Co. v. America Online Inc. </em>(10th Cir. 2000) 206 F.3d 980.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition, two district Courts of Appeal in California have followed <em>Zeran. </em>(See <em>Gentry v. eBay, Inc. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 816 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 703] [Fourth Dist., Div. One]; <em>Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 684 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 772] [First Dist., Div. Four].) Moreover, the California Supreme Court has very recently held that <em>Zeran </em>properly construed section 230(c)(1) as affording broad immunity to any provider or user of an interactive computer service, irrespective of whether that provider or user may have been viewed under traditional defamation law as a \u201cpublisher\u201d or \u201cdistributor\u201d (i.e., \u201csecondary publisher\u201d) of the allegedly defamatory statement. <em>(Barrett </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 57-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">2. <em>Whether Agilent is immune from suit under the CDA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">There are three essential elements that a defendant must establish in order to claim section 230 immunity. They are \u201c(1) the defendant [is] a provider or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>user of an interactive computer service; (2) the cause of action treat[s] the defendant as a publisher or speaker of information; and (3) the information at issue [is] provided by another information content provider.\u201d <em>(Gentry </em>v. <em>eBay, Inc., supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th at p. 830.) We evaluate Agilent\u2019s contention that it is immune under the CDA by utilizing this three-factor test.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">First: Was Agilent \u201ca provider or user of an interactive computer service?\u201d <em>(Gentry v. eBay, Inc., supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th at p. 830.) Courts have broadly interpreted the term \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d under the CDA. (See, e.g., <em>Batzel v. Smith, supra, </em>333 F.3d at p. 1030, fn. 15 [term \u201cincludes a wide range of cyberspace services, not only [I]nternet service providers\u201d]; <em>Optinrealbig.com, LLC v. Ironport Systems, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2004) 323 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1044 [term is \u201cbroadly defined\u201d under the statute].) Thus, there are a number of examples of the expansive application of \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d in determining CDA immunity. (See, e.g., <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>eBay, Inc., supra, </em>at p. 831 [online auction Web site]; <em>Kathleen R. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 692 [library providing Internet access to public by use of computers]; <em>Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., supra, </em>339 F.3d at p. 1124 [online dating Web site]; <em>Batzel </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>at p. 1021 [nonprofit Web site operator]; <em>Chicago Lawyers\u2019 Comm, for Civil Rights Under the Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ill. 2006) 461 F.Supp.2d 681 [operator of Internet bulletin board carrying notices of jobs, housing services, and goods for sale]; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Google, Inc. </em>(E.D.Pa. 2006) 422 F.Supp.2d 492, 501 [Internet search engine operator]; <em>PatentWizard, Inc. v.

But several commentators have opined that an employer that provides its employees with Internet access through the company\u2019s internal computer system is among the class of parties potentially immune under the CDA. (See, e.g., Zion, <em>Protecting the E-Marketplace of Ideas by Protecting Employers: Immunity for Employers Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act </em>(2002) 54 Fed. Comm.

And Agilent clearly meets the definition of that term under section 230(f)(2) (see fn. 20, <em>ante), </em>in that it \u201cprovides or enables computer access by multiple users [i.e., Agilent\u2019s employees] to a computer server.\u201d As noted in Rolfe\u2019s declaration, Agilent\u2019s proxy servers are the primary means by which thousands of its employees in the United States access the Internet. In light of the term\u2019s broad definition under the CDA, we conclude that Agilent was a provider of interactive computer services. (See, e.g., <em>Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at pp. 692-693 [rejecting contention that library was not immune because of its governmental entity status]; <em>Donato </em>v. <em>Moldow </em>(2005) 374 N.J.Super. 475, 486-488 [865 A.2d 711, 718] [Web site\u2019s noncommercial status and limited use irrelevant to CDA immunity analysis].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><em>Second: </em>Does \u201cthe cause of action treat the defendant [(Agilent)] as a publisher or speaker of information?\u201d <em>(Gentry v. eBay, Inc., supra, </em>99 Cal.App.4th at p. 830.) On information and belief, plaintiffs alleged that Agilent knew (1) Moore was sending threatening messages, and (2) that he was using Agilent\u2019s computer system to send them. Agilent rebutted this allegation in its summary judgment motion, and plaintiffs presented no evidence in opposition that Agilent had such knowledge. This failing notwithstanding, it is apparent that plaintiffs, in alleging that Moore\u2019s employer was liable for his cyberthreats, sought to treat Agilent \u201cas the publisher or speaker\u201d of those messages. (\u00a7 230(c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We address whether section 230 immunity may apply to the specific tort claims alleged here. While many of the cases addressing CDA immunity have involved claims for defamation (see, e.g., <em>Batzel v. Smith, supra, </em>333 F.3d 1018; <em>Ben Ezra, Weinstein, &amp; Co. v. America Online Inc., supra, </em>206 F.3d 980; <em>PatentWizard, Inc. v. Kinko\u2019s, Inc., supra, </em>163 F.Supp.2d 1069; <em>Blumenthal v. Drudge </em>(D.D.C. 1998) 992 F.Supp. 44), it is clear that immunity under section 230 is not so limited. The Fourth Circuit noted that \u201c[t]he imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others represented, for Congress, simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.\u201d <em>(Zeran, supra, </em>129 F.3d at p. 330.) Thus, CDA immunity has been applied to defendants asserting that they were interactive computer service providers or users for a variety of tort claims other than defamation. (See, e.g., <em>Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 684 [claims included nuisance and premises liability]; <em>Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., supra, </em>339 F.3d 1119 [claims included invasion of privacy, misappropriation of right of publicity, and negligence]; <em>Doe </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>America Online, Inc. </em>(Fla. 2001) 783 So.2d 1010 [negligent failure to control third party\u2019s illegal postings].) And several cases applying section 230 immunity have involved the specific claim alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint here, namely, an intentional infliction claim. (See <em>Prickett v. InfoUSA </em>(E.D.Tex. 2006) 2006 WL 887431; <em>Donato v. Moldow, supra, </em>865 A.2d 711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In <em>Kathleen R. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 684, the First District Court of Appeal (Div. Four) held that section 230(c)(1) afforded the City of Livermore immunity from a broad array of claims arising out of a public library providing access to the Internet through use of its computers, including a taxpayer action for waste of public funds (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a), and a claim for violation of substantive due process (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983). In applying CDA immunity to the taxpayer claim, the court specifically rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the defense was limited to tort claims for damages and did not apply to taxpayer actions and suits for declaratory and injunctive relief. <em>(Kathleen R. v. City of Livermore, supra, </em>at pp. 697-698; see also <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Amazon.com, Inc., supra, </em>31 P.3d at 42 [\u201ccourts that have considered the question have held \u00a7 230 provides immunity to civil claims generally\u201d].) We conclude, therefore, that the claims against Agilent treated it \u201cas the publisher or speaker\u201d (\u00a7 230(c)(1)) of Moore\u2019s messages and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were among those to which immunity under the CDA potentially applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Third: Was \u201cthe information at issue . . . provided by another information content provider?\u201d <em>(Gentry v. eBay, Inc., supra, 99 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 830.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Clearly, Moore was the party who authored the offensive e-m\u00e1ils and postings. The allegations of the complaint do not suggest otherwise; to the contrary, the complaint consistently and repeatedly attributes authorship of the offensive messages to Moore alone. (See, e.g., pars. 1, 5, 6, 22, 23, 25-28, 30-32, 39, 40, 47, 48 of the complaint.) And there was no evidence that Agilent played any role whatsoever in \u201cthe creation or development\u201d of the messages.

Liability based upon an intentional infliction claim \u201c \u2018does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.\u2019 (Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 46, com. d.)\u201d <em>(Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1122 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46], overruled on another ground in <em>Aguilar v.

But under the circumstances here, Moore\u2019s repeated threats of physical harm directed to plaintiffs, stated in graphic terms, were sufficient acts of extreme and outrageous conduct with intent to cause emotional distress. (See, e.g., <em>KOVR-TV, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1028-1031 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 431] [news reporter\u2019s interview of preteen children, including advising them of murder of children\u2019s two playmates by playmates\u2019 mother and her subsequent suicide, sufficient for finding of outrageous conduct to defeat summary judgment]; <em>Kiseskey </em>v. <em>Carpenters\u2019 Trust for So.

Indeed, our Supreme Court has recognized, as a theoretical proposition, that an injurious e-mail communication may give rise to an intentional infliction claim. <em>(Intel Corp. v.

Therefore, while it may have been established that <em>Moore </em>committed extreme and outrageous acts directed to plaintiffs with the intent to cause emotional distress, there is a significant leap that must occur to establish a prima facie case for an intentional infliction claim <em>against Agilent.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>pleading is somewhat uncertain,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it appears that their contentions are that Agilent should be held liable for Moore\u2019s threatening messages (1) because it ratified its employee\u2019s actions, (2) under respondeat superior principles, or (3) because Agilent was negligent in its supervision and retention of Moore as its employee. (See <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 947 [160 Cal.Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58], disapproved on another ground in <em>White </em>v. <em>Ultramar, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 574, fn. 4 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 981 P.2d 944] [affirming intentional infliction liability of employer for willful acts (utterance of racial epithets and false statements about the plaintiff\u2019s job knowledge) of employer\u2019s managers]; <em>Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 618 [employer liable for employee\u2019s acts constituting intentional infliction committed within scope of employment].) None of these theories has merit based upon the undisputed evidence presented in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">2. <em>Ratification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">An employer may be liable for an employee\u2019s willful and malicious actions under principles of ratification. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2339; Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 218.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> An employee\u2019s actions may be ratified after the fact by the employer\u2019s voluntary election to adopt the employee\u2019s conduct by, in essence, treating the conduct as its own. <em>(Rakestraw </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 67, 73 [104 Cal.Rptr. 57, 500 P.2d 1401]; see also Judicial Council of Cal. Civ. Jury Instns. (2006) CACI No. 3710.) The failure to discharge an employee after knowledge of his or her wrongful acts may be evidence supporting ratification. <em>(Coats v. Construction &amp; Gen. Laborers Local No. 185 </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 908, 914 [93 Cal.Rptr. 639].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>But here there was no evidence presented in opposition to the motion for summary judgment indicative of Agilent\u2019s ratification of Moore\u2019s wrongful conduct. The facts as presented in Agilent\u2019s motion were that at the time of the initial FBI investigation in late July to mid-August, Agilent (1) had no knowledge of the substance of any e-mail or posting by Moore that was being investigated; (2) was not provided with any details by the FBI about its investigation; (3) was told by the FBI that it was not planning to arrest Moore, that it was \u201cnot after Moore\u2019s job,\u201d that Moore was not a threat to anyone, and that Agilent need not be concerned about him; (4) conducted its own investigation but did not discover evidence that Moore used Agilent\u2019s computer systems to send threatening e-mails or Internet postings; and (5) was told by Moore that he had not used Agilent\u2019s computer systems to send any threatening e-mails or other messages. It was not until April 7, 2003\u2014through receipt from the FBI of the arrest affidavit\u2014that Agilent learned the content of Moore\u2019s threatening e-mails and Internet postings that were alleged to have occurred prior to August. Agilent met with Moore shortly thereafter, at which time Moore admitted for the first time that prior to August 12, he had sent some communications through Agilent\u2019s computer systems \u201c \u2018that could be interpreted as a threat.\u2019 \u201d Agilent placed Moore on administrative leave immediately after the interview and terminated him eight days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Based upon these undisputed facts,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> there was no evidence that Agilent, after the fact, treated Moore\u2019s malicious conduct as its own. There was thus no triable issue as to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Agilent ratified Moore\u2019s tortious actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">3. <em>Respondeat superior</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We next evaluate plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Agilent should be held liable for Moore\u2019s tortious conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Pursuant to this doctrine, \u201can employer is vicariously liable for his employee\u2019s torts committed within the scope of the employment.\u201d <em>(Perez v. Van Groningen </em>&amp; <em>Sons, Inc. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 967 [227 Cal.Rptr. 106, 719 P.2d 676]; see also CACI No. 3701.) \u201c \u2018A risk arises out of the employment when \u201cin the context of the particular enterprise an employee\u2019s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business. [Citations.] In other words, where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one \u2018that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental\u2019 to the enterprise undertaken by the employer. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209 [285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341] <em>(Mary </em>M.); see generally 1 Levy et al., Cal. Torts (2006) \u00a7 8.03[3][a], pp. 8-19 to 8-20.3.) The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the employee\u2019s action for which vicarious liability is sought to be imposed was committed within the scope of the employment. <em>(Ducey </em>v. <em>Argo Sales Co. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 707, 721 [159 Cal.Rptr. 835, 602 P.2d 755].)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Scope of employment in the application of the respondeat superior doctrine has been given a broad construction. <em>(Farmers Ins. Group </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1004 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 478, 906 P.2d 440] <em>(Farmers Ins. Group).) </em>As summarized by our high court: \u201c \u2018[T]he fact that an employee is not engaged in the ultimate object of his employment at the time of his wrongful act does not preclude attribution of liability to an employer.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, acts necessary to the comfort, convenience, health, and welfare of the employee while at work, though strictly personal and not acts of service, do not take the employee outside the scope of employment. [Citation.] Moreover, \u2018 \u201cwhere the employee is combining his own business with that of his employer, or attending to both at substantially the same time, no nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury, unless it clearly appears that neither directly nor indirectly could he have been serving his employer.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] It is also settled that an employer\u2019s vicarious liability may extend to willful and malicious torts of an employee as well as negligence. [Citations.] Finally, an employee\u2019s tortious act may be within the scope of employment even if it contravenes an express company rule and confers no benefit to the employer.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">But the scope of vicarious liability is not boundless. \u201c[A]n employer will not be held vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s malicious or tortious conduct if the employee <em>substantially </em>deviates from the employment duties for personal purposes. [Citations.] Thus, if the employee \u2018inflicts an injury out of personal malice, not engendered by the employment\u2019 [citation] or acts out of \u2018personal malice unconnected with the employment\u2019 [citation], or if the misconduct is not an \u2018outgrowth\u2019 of the employment [citation], the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>is not acting within the scope of employment. Stated another way, \u2018[i]f an employee\u2019s tort is personal in nature, mere presence at the place of employment and attendance to occupational duties prior or subsequent to the offense will not give rise to a cause of action against the employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\u2019 [Citation.] In such cases, the losses do not foresee-ably result from the conduct of the employer\u2019s enterprise and so are not fairly attributable to the employer as a cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Group, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1004-1005.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Applying these principles, we find that Moore\u2019s conduct in sending threatening e-mails and postings through the Internet were plainly outside the scope of his employment with Agilent. Even assuming that Moore used Agilent\u2019s computer system in accessing the Internet to send one or more of these messages, the injury he inflicted was \u201cout of personal malice, not engendered by the employment.\u201d <em>(Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 652, 656 [171 P.2d 5].) Likewise, Moore\u2019s messages of hate were not an \u201coutgrowth\u201d of his Agilent employment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 657.) Using Agilent\u2019s computer system to log on to a private Internet account to send messages\u2014 threatening or otherwise\u2014was never part of Moore\u2019s job duties. Indeed, plaintiffs did not dispute this point. Furthermore, the fact that Moore may have been present at the workplace and may have been performing regular employment functions before or after transmitting one or more of the threatening messages does not transform his personal conduct into actions for which Agilent may be held vicariously liable. <em>(Alma W. v. Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 133, 140 [176 Cal.Rptr. 287]; see also 2 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2001) \u00a7 335, pp. 912-913 [\u201cemployees may depart from employment without leaving the situs of their work ... [][].. . [or] by engaging in purely personal acts during working hours\u201d].) As the Supreme Court said in <em>Lisa M., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at page 306, the employer \u201cmay have set the stage for [its employee\u2019s] misconduct, but the script was entirely of [the employee\u2019s] own, independent invention.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that Agilent as a matter of law could not be held vicariously liable for Moore\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>cyberthreats, because he <em>\u201csubstantially </em>deviate[d] from the employment duties for personal purposes.\u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Group, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 1005.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Moreover, the imposition of vicarious liability upon Agilent for Moore\u2019s actions would be inconsistent with the rationale for the respondeat superior doctrine. As our high court has explained, the doctrine is based on \u201ca rule of policy, a deliberate allocation of a risk. The losses caused by the torts of employees, which as a practical matter are sure to occur in the conduct of the employer\u2019s enterprise, are placed upon that enterprise itself, as a required cost of doing business.\u201d <em>(Hinman </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 959-960 [88 Cal.Rptr. 188, 471 P.2d 988]; see also <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 54, 64 [181 P.2d 645].) Likewise, \u201c[rjespondeat superior is based on 1 \u201ca deeply rooted sentiment\u201d \u2019 that it would be unjust for an enterprise to disclaim responsibility for injuries occurring in the course of its characteristic activities. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mary M., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 208.) We unhesitatingly conclude based upon the circumstances before us\u2014i.e., an employee allegedly using his employer\u2019s computer to access his personal Internet account to send anonymous cyberthreats that are unrelated to his employment\u2014that Moore\u2019s conduct was not a risk that Agilent bore as part of its enterprise. Agilent thus cannot be held liable for Moore\u2019s actions under respondeat superior. (See <em>Booker v. GTE.net LLC </em>(E.D.Ky. 2002) 214 F.Supp.2d 746 [rejecting claim against employer under respondeat superior for employees\u2019 creation of fake e-mail address and transmission of e-mail derogatory toward the plaintiff].)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>4. <em>Negligent supervision/retention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">\u201cAn employer may be liable to a third person for the employer\u2019s negligence in hiring or retaining an employee who is incompetent or unfit.

As such, \u201cCalifornia follows the rule set forth in the Restatement Second of Agency section 213, which provides in pertinent part: \u2018A person conducting an activity through servants or other agents is subject to liability for harm resulting from his conduct if he is negligent or reckless: . . . (b) in the employment of improper persons or instrumentalities in work involving risk of harm to others[.]\u2019 <em>(Ibid..)\u201d (Evan F. </em>v. <em>Hughson United Methodist Church </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 748].) Liability for negligent supervision and/or retention of an employee is one of direct liability for negligence, not vicarious liability. (2 Dobbs, The Law of Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 333, p. 906.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Here, plaintiffs alleged that Agilent knew that Moore was using its computer to accomplish his cyberthreats, that it refused to terminate his employment, and that it instead failed to take measures to prevent their recurrence. Plaintiffs\u2019 negligent supervision/retention theory fails for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">First, it is doubtful that the record supports a finding of the existence of a legal duty owing to plaintiffs by Agilent. In <em>Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561], our Supreme Court enunciated seven factors relevant to determining the existence of duty: \u201c[1] the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, [2] the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, [3] the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, [4] the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, [5] the policy of preventing future harm, [6] the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and [7] the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Applying the first factor, we find that plaintiffs had no business relationship with Agilent. And there is no evidence that Moore\u2019s cyberthreats directed toward plaintiffs arose out of, or were in any way connected with his employment. The first <em>Rowland </em>factor does not suggest the existence of a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Agilent argues that plaintiffs were not damaged, and plaintiffs admitted that they sought no treatment for their alleged emotional injuries. Plaintiffs argue that the outrageousness of Moore\u2019s conduct suggests they were damaged. At best, the second <em>Rowland </em>factor neither supports nor opposes a finding of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">There was little evidence that Agilent\u2019s conduct had any \u201ccloseness\u201d to plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries. At most, Agilent supplied Moore with an office computer by which its employee (unbeknownst to Agilent) accessed his personal Internet account and sent threatening messages. Thus, the third <em>Rowland </em>factor does not support a finding of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Moreover, the fourth through seventh <em>Rowland </em>factors strongly disfavor liability in this instance. There was no \u201cmoral blame\u201d in Agilent\u2019s conduct evidenced by the record. (See, e.g., <em>Steven F. </em>v. <em>Anaheim Union School Dist., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 917 [no \u201cmoral blame\u201d on part of school district in supervision of employee where it provided ongoing awareness programs and extensive employee training].) There is no significant policy of preventing future harm that would result from a finding of duty; indeed, a finding of duty here might have a significant chilling effect upon Internet free speech and might encourage extreme employer oversight of employee activities. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 918 [finding duty would turn the culture of the school into \u201ca virtual police state\u201d].) Additionally, the burden imposed on the employer in this instance would be enormous. (See <em>Macias v. State of California </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 844, 859-860 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 592, 897 P.2d 530] [in \u201cdeciding whether to expand a tort duty of care, courts must consider the potential social and economic consequences\u201d].) It would be a dubious proposition indeed to suggest that a party, simply by virtue of engaging in business, owes a duty to the world for all acts taken by its employee, irrespective of whether those actions were connected with the enterprise in which the business was engaged. (See, e.g., <em>Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1341 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 525] [no duty by city owed to employee\u2019s family member for employee\u2019s off-duty criminal acts].) And it is not realistic that the type of risk involved here\u2014unknown malicious acts of an employee bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>no relationship to his job achieved by accessing the Internet to make death threats\u2014is a readily insurable one. Therefore, we conclude that plaintiffs did not establish here that Agilent owed a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Second, even were we to assume the existence of a duty, there was no evidence that Agilent breached any duty of care with respect to the supervision or retention of Moore as an employee. As we have noted (see pt. III.D.2., <em>ante), </em>Agilent had no knowledge of the content of any of Moore\u2019s threatening e-mails or postings before receiving the arrest affidavit on April 7, 2003. Most important, it was not until the day Moore was placed on administrative leave (leading to his ultimate termination a few days later) that Agilent learned that Moore had used its computer systems to access his personal Internet account to send threatening messages through the Internet more than eight months earlier. Moreover, Agilent\u2019s internal investigations\u2014 one conducted in August prompted by the FBI\u2019s initial inquiry, and the second conducted after Moore\u2019s February 2003 arrest\u2014did not yield any information that Moore had used Agilent\u2019s computer system to send inappropriate messages over the Internet. Buffington was unable to discover any Internet postings that may have been attributable to Moore. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2014through Delfino\u2019s deposition testimony\u2014admitted the impossibility of tracing an anonymous posting to a particular individual. There were thus no facts presented suggesting that Agilent knew or had reason to suspect that Moore was engaged in improper on-the-job conduct. (See <em>Federico v. Superior Court (Jenry G.) </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1216 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 370] [hairstyling college not liable for employee\u2019s molestation of juvenile son of student, where it had no knowledge or notice of inappropriate behavior at work].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Third, even were we to assume that Agilent (1) knew or should have known that Moore (prior to August) had allegedly used its computers to send threatening e-mails and postings over the Internet, and (2) took no measures to prevent a recurrence of the threats, there was no evidence that Moore in fact used Agilent\u2019s system after August to threaten plaintiffs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, any negligent supervision and/or retention of Moore by Agilent\u2014which alleged negligence, as we have concluded, was devoid of factual support\u2014was not the cause of plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries. (See <em>Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1342 [assuming evidence of negligent hiring, off-duty police officer\u2019s killing of fianc\u00e9e after domestic dispute not caused by such negligence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Plaintiffs failed to present evidence supporting their claim based upon the theory that Agilent was negligent in its supervision and/or retention of Moore.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">E. <em>Negligent Infliction Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The second cause of action was captioned as a purported negligent infliction claim. It incorporated by reference all prior paragraphs of the complaint (including the entire intentional infliction claim). As it pertained to Agilent, it contained the same allegations that appeared in the intentional infliction cause of action. (See fn. 27, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">As we have noted (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>there is no independent tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. <em>(Potter </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th 965, 984.) Thus, since plaintiffs\u2019 purported negligent infliction claim was merely \u201ca species of negligence\u201d <em>(Wooden v. Raveling, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1046), the better question to ask in appraising plaintiffs\u2019 so-called negligent infliction allegations is: \u201cWhat are the circumstances under which a plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress as a matter of the <em>law of negligence!\u201d (Lawson </em>v. <em>Management Activities, Inc., supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th 652, 657.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Using this analytical framework, we have established from our discussion of negligent supervision and/or retention (see pt. III.D.4., <em>ante) </em>the nonviability of plaintiffs\u2019 purported negligent infliction claim. The claimed negligence pertained to Agilent\u2019s retention and supervision of its employee, Moore. As we have discussed, the undisputed evidence showed that plaintiffs did not establish the existence of duty, breach of duty or causation. Accordingly, summary disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 purported negligent infliction claim was proper.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The judgment entered on the order granting Agilent\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P.

(See, e.g., <em>Wooden v. Raveling </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1035 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 891]; see also <em>Lawson v.

Ultimately, the California Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the previous appeal of Delfino and Day from the trial court\u2019s order denying their special motions to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1) (i.e., their motions to strike the Varian complaint as a \u201cSLAPP\u201d [strategic lawsuit against public participation]) operated as a stay on all further trial court proceedings; accordingly, the Supreme Court determined that the judgment was void. <em>(Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v.

Thus, under Barrett\u2014although Agilent did not act as a distributor of Moore\u2019s offensive e-mails and postings, and <em>at most </em>merely provided the means of communicating the messages by Moore\u2019s use of his employer\u2019s computer to access the Internet to send the messages\u2014CDA immunity applies in this instance irrespective of whether Agilent is deemed to have been a publisher or distributor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\"> Citing <em>Hustler Magazine </em>v. <em>Falwell </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 46, 56 [99 L.Ed.2d 41, 108 S.Ct. 876], Agilent argues on appeal that plaintiffs\u2019 intentional and negligent infliction claims should be treated as defamation claims. But <em>Hustler Magazine </em>is distinguishable and does not support Agilent\u2019s assertion here. There, Jerry Falwell sought to recover damages for the publication of an advertisement parody (specifically labeled as such) under theories of invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 47-48.) The jury found against Falwell on the libel claim, but awarded compensatory and punitive damages on Falwell\u2019s intentional infliction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49.) The Supreme Court concluded that the intentional infliction award could not stand under the First Amendment, holding that a public figure or public official \u201cmay not recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of [a satirical] publication!] . . . without showing in addition that the publication contains a false statement of fact which was made with \u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u201d (485 U.S. at p. 56.) Here, plaintiffs were not public officials or public figures, did not sue for defamation, and, in pleading the intentional and negligent infliction claims, were not attempting to plead an otherwise defective defamation claim. We therefore reject Agilent\u2019s suggestion that we treat plaintiffs\u2019 intentional and negligent infliction claims as claims for defamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> The allegation in the complaint directed toward Agilent reads: \u201cUpon information and belief, at all relevant times, Agilent was informed and knew that Moore was using its computer system to carry out these acts against [plaintiffs. Agilent failed to terminate Moore\u2019s employment, and instead assented to his continued use of its computer system for this unlawful purpose and failed and refused to take measures to stop [Moore\u2019s] activities notwithstanding that they were contrary to Agilent\u2019s own corporate policies, thereby ratifying his tortious misconduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> Employer derivative liability for employee actions need not be founded on respondeat superior, but may be based upon the doctrine of ratification. <em>(Murillo v. Rite Stuff Foods, Inc. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 833, 852 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> While (as we have mentioned in pt. HUB, <em>ante) </em>plaintiffs claimed in their separate statement in opposition to the motion that a number of these key facts were disputed, a careful review of the supporting and opposing evidence reveals that there was no actual dispute. (See <em>Uhrich v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 598, 616-617 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 131] [party opposing summary judgment must do more than aver that it has evidence to support cause of action, but must actually present that evidence].) For example, while plaintiffs claimed in their responsive separate statement that a dispute existed regarding UMF No. 11 (i.e., that Agilent\u2019s August investigation did not disclose that Moore had used Agilent\u2019s computer systems to send any threatening e-mails or Internet postings), the evidence plaintiffs cited raised no such dispute. Rather, it consisted primarily of a reference to Pierce\u2019s August investigation in which she determined that Moore had sent two e-mails (using his own name) to Superior Court Judge Jack Komar and Captain Dennis Bacon in the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office, in which he complained about Delfino\u2019s harassment of Moore. Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition simply did not present admissible evidence of a dispute as to any matter that demonstrated Agilent\u2019s ratification of Moore\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> Thus, in a number of instances, courts have concluded that the employer was not liable for its employee\u2019s intentional tort where the employee\u2019s act was outside the scope of his or her employment. (See, e.g., <em>Lisa M. </em>v. <em>Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 297-299 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 510, 907 R2d 358] <em>(Lisa M.) </em>[sexual assault by medical technician during patient examination]; <em>Farmers Ins. Group, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at pp. 1012-1013 [deputy sheriff\u2019s sexual harassment of subordinates]; <em>Hoblitzell v. City of lone </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 675, 682-686 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 8] [city building inspector\u2019s harassment of builder, done as favor to inspector\u2019s friend]; <em>Maria D. v.

But where, as here, the undisputed facts demonstrate clearly that an employee\u2019s conduct was outside of the scope of his or her employment, the issue is one of law that the court may determine. <em>(Lisa M., supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 299; <em>Perez v. Van Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 968.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> The district court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker </em>that the employees\u2019 tortious acts were outside the scope of their employment was based upon the conclusion that transmission of the offensive e-mails by means of false third party e-mail accounts \u201cwas most certainly <em>not </em>sent in furtherance of [the employer\u2019s] business,\u201d and was not a matter that was expected in light of the employees\u2019 duties. <em>(Booker v. GTE.net LLC, supra, </em>214 F.Supp.2d at p. 750.) Certainly, a number of legal scholars have written on the subjects of employer monitoring of employees\u2019 Internet use and potential employer liability for employees\u2019 wrongful computer-related activity. (See, e.g., Echols, <em>Striking a Balance Between Employer Business Interests and Employee Privacy: Using </em>Respondeat Superior <em>to Justify the Monitoring of Web-Based, Personal Electronic Mail Accounts of Employees in the Workplace </em>(2003) 7 Comp. L.Rev. &amp; Tech.J. 273, 278; Comment, <em>I Spy Something Read! Employer Monitoring of Personal Employee Webmail Accounts </em>(2003) 5 N.C. J.L. &amp; Tech. 121 (2003); Comment, <em>The Doctrine of Respondeat Superior: An Application to Employers\u2019 Liability for the Computer or Internet Crimes Committed by Their Employees </em>(2002) 12 Alb. L.J. Sci &amp; Tech. 683.) But we note from our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>research that, somewhat surprisingly, <em>Booker, supra, </em>214 F.Supp. 746, is the only case addressing the issue of the imposition of vicarious liability on an employer based upon employee abuse of the Internet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\"> Thus, for instance, the <em>Rowland </em>seven-factor test was applied by the court in <em>Steven F. v. Anaheim Union School Dist. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 904, 915-919 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 105], to reach the conclusion that a school district could not be held liable to a student\u2019s parents under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>a negligent supervision theory as a result of the acts of its teacher-employee (i.e., a sexual relationship engaged in by a teacher with a student).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> The November cyberthreat for which Moore ultimately pleaded guilty indisputably was made without use of Agilent\u2019s computer system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\"> As is the case with respondeat superior, while we acknowledge that negligent retention is generally a question of fact, it is one of law if no reasonable jury may conclude based upon the undisputed facts that liability exists. <em>(Federico </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Jenry G.), supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1214.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\"> For the first time on appeal, plaintiffs argue that Agilent is subject to negligence liability under the theory that\u2014as an extension of the <em>Tarasoff (Tarasoff </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 425 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334]) doctrine involving a psychotherapist\u2019s duty to warn a potential victim of foreseeable injury caused by a patient\u2014 Agilent had a duty to warn plaintiffs under the USA Patriot Act (Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272). We need not address this dubious theory; it is inappropriate for plaintiffs to adopt a new theory for the first time on appeal, and appellate courts will customarily decline to decide such newly minted theories. <em>(Beroiz v.
