However, relator is not languishing in jail, and the necessity for forced speed is not evident. While the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees a speedy trial, no such requirement attaches to proceedings subsequent to trial, primarily because the presumption of innocence at the trial level does not exist at the appellate or post-appellate levels. Speedy trial was originally guaranteed (1) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; <em>(2) </em>to minimize anxiety of the accused (not the convicted); and (3) to limit the possibility that the defense will be unpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">These concerns are not compelling here. Relator has not demonstrated that his remedies at law are not adequate and hence mandamus will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Therefore, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-12\">O\u2019Neux, C.
