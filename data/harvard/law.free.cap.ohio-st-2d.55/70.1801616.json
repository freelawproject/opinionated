C. 149.43 states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-19\">\u201cAs used in this section, \u2018public record\u2019 means any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>record required to be kept by any governmental unit # * #</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u201cAll public records shall be open at all reasonable times for inspection. Upon request, a person responsible for public records shall make copies available at cost, within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>State, ex rel. Beauty Supply Co., </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Cosmetology </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St. 2d 245, 246, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u201cThis court has thus enunciated a twofold' test to determine the existence of \u2018public records\u2019: (1) the records must be kept by a governmental unit, and (2) the records must be specifically required to be kept <em>\u00edy law-. </em>Affimative application of these two elements in a given circumstance mandates that the records be available for inspection and copying.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">R. C. 102.02 requires Judge Gagliardo to file a financial disclosure statement with the secretary of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. Thus, that statement so filed is a \u201cpublic record\u201d pursuant to R. C. 149.43. As such, it is subject to public inspection at locations designated by the appropriate ethics commission. R. C. 102.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court is not one of those designated locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Although Canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that an additional report be filed with the clerk of the court where the judge presides, that filing is not required by statute. Therefore, the financial disclosure statement filed in the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court is not a \u201cpublic record.\u201d Eespondent Judge Toner is under no legal duty to,produce the document, and thus a writ of mandamus will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-13\">O \u2019Neill, ,C.
