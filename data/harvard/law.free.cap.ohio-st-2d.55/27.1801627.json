Glass, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Eelators\u2019 position is that a party bringing suit for personal injuries may not be compelled to disclose privileged medical information by giving opposing counsel authority to investigate medical information <em>prior </em>to a waiver of the physician-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">It is clear that such privilege has not been waived. A party does not waive the physician-patient privilege accorded to him by R. C. 2317.02(B) merely by filing suit and claiming personal injuries arising from an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Eelators are seemingly confusing <em>waiver </em>with <em>disclosure </em>of privileged information. Until a waiver occurs, defense counsel may not use the information at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Eespondent judge issued his order pursuant to Civ. E. 16, which states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cA court may adopt rules concerning pretrial procedure to accomplish the following objectives:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201c(6) The exchange of medical reports and hospital records;</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">u# ft *</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\"><em>\u201cThe producing by any party of medical reports or hospital records does not constitute a waiver of the privilege granted under Section 2317.02, Bevisde Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Local Eule 2.21(C) reflects this grant of authority by providing that in a pre-trial order the court may order the \u201cexchange [of] medical reports and hospital records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The above-emphasized portion of Civ. E. 16 creates a distinction between a court-ordered disclosure and the use at trial or discovery<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> of that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Eelators have not demonstrated that respondent\u2019s order was unauthorized by law. Therefore, a writ of prohibition will not lie, and it is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-14\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P. Brown, Saveeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-15\">Civ.
