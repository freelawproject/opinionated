C. Chapter 3745 did not oust common pleas courts of their jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment proceeding in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">These assertions ignore the administrative scheme of R. C. Chapter 3745 which gives the applicant adequate access to judicial review. Due process and equal protection are afforded the applicant under this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">R. C. 3745.04 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u201cAny person who was a party to a proceeding before the director may participate in an appeal to the environmental board of review for an order vacating or modifying the action of the director of environmental protection or local board of health, or ordering the director or board of health to perform an act. <em>The environmental board of review has exclusive original jurisdiction over any matter which may, under this section, be brought before it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">R. C. 3745.06, then provides, that if one has not received satisfaction before the Environmental Board of Review he \u201c* * * may appeal to the court of appeals of Franklin county, or, if the appeal arises from an alleged violation of a law or regulation, to the court of appeals of the district in which the violation was alleged to have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The exclusivity of this statutory process has been recognized and upheld by his court. In <em>Cincinnati, ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Crotty, </em>v. <em>Cincinnati </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 27, at page 30, it was stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201c* * * under B. C. 3745.04, an appeal \u2018for an order vacating or modifying the action of the Director of Environmental Protection\u2019 may be brought before the Environmental Board of Beview and \u2018the Environmental Board of Beview has exclusive original jurisdiction over any matter which may, under * * * [B. C. 3745.04], be brought before it.\u2019 Appeal thereafter may be taken only \u2018to the Court of Appeals of Franklin County, or, if the appeal arises from the alleged violation of a law or regulation, to the Court of Appeals of the district in which the violation was alleged to have occurred.\u2019 B. C. 3745.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u201cIt is apparent that this statutory scheme for review of actions by the Director of Environmental Protection is exclusive, and that the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County accordingly lacked jurisdiction over the complaint at bar, which seeks to have an order issued by the director set aside.\u201d See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Brown, v. Rockside </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Bespondent stresses <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 128, as standing for the proposition that declaratory judgment is an alternative to a special statutory scheme. However, the statutory scheme (of state income taxation) in <em>Herrick </em>does not impress the Board of Tax Appeals with \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In view of the clear legislative intent and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Grotty, siipra, </em>the requested writ will be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-10\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
