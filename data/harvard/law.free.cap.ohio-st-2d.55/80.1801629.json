It is this period of employment for which relator seeks to acquire retroactive membership in PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">In order to acquire this membership relator must ful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>fill the requirements of R. C. 145.44. In essence, R. C. 145.-44 provides that a current member of PEES can acquire retroactive membership in the system, but this acquisition is limited to those employed by \u201cthe several local authorities mentioned in section 145.01\u201d who have \u201ca local retirement system established under the laws of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The stipulation of facts establishes that relator was a member of the city of Cincinnati\u2019s retirement system which is classified as \u201ca local retirement system established under the laws of the state.\u201d In addition, relator has accumulated enough service credit to be vested in the Cincinnati system and to be eligible for retirement benefits in 1981. He, nevertheless, 'desires to transfer this credit to PEES in the form of retroactive membership. In order to transfer this vested service credit to PEES, it must be established that this service was employment with \u201cthe several local authorities mentioned in section 145.01.\u201d The University of Cincinnati is not mentioned as an employer in R. C. 145.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">It is the laws governing municipal universities, R. C. 3349.01 <em>et seq., </em>which are applicable herein. R. C. 3349.03 and its predecessor, G. C. 4003-1, authorized the employment of faculty members during relator\u2019s tenure at the university and established the university, through its board of directors, as his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">If past employment of the relator is to be classified in a state retirement system, this service would come under the State Teachers Eetirement System (R. C. 3307.01 <em>et seq.), </em>and PEES, although making numerous provisions for prior service credit, retroactive membership, military service credit, and credit for service in othe state systems (R. C. 145.20 <em>et seq.), </em>does not provide for a transfer of the nature sought herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Accordingly, the writ prayed for is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-10\">O\u2019Neill, C.
