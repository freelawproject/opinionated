Since no such facts are alleged, we fail to perceive that the emergency action of the commission in the past dictates the emergency actions sought under the facts which were alleged and taken as true by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">This is especially true when it is observed that the or. der appealed from in the instant cause was not an absolute denial of relief. By its express language, the oommission\u2019s order indicated that other facts which may yet be uncovered in the course of its investigation may trigger emergency rate relief for these consumers, while other consumer allegations may broaden the scope of that inquiry. While the facts alleged and assumed argue for improvements in the quality of services, the appeal seems, at this point and on this record, to be grounded on an understandable excess of zeal by the Consumers \u2019 Counsel, rather than upon a demonstrated denial of a substantial right. Therefore, we hold that the order of the commission is not unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Public Utilities Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-8\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P. Brown, Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\">In the absence of a motion to dismiss by the commission we do not decide the question of whether the order before us is a final or appealable one under this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
