Petitioners are electors who, in a timely manner, submitted written comments about the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. ORS 250.067(1). Therefore, petitioners are entitled to seek modification of the proposed ballot title in this court. ORS 250.085(2). We review the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (establishing this court\u2019s standard of review of ballot titles). We modify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title and certify it to the Secretary of State as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Pursuant to ORS 250.067(2), the Attorney General certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS, DISSOLVES REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING PORTLAND AREA \u2018METRO,\u2019 WITH EXCEPTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u201cYES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote prohibits, dissolves regional governments, including Portland area metropolitan service district \u2018Metro,\u2019 with exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains all forms of regional governments, including Portland area metropolitan service district (\u2018Metro\u2019).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends constitution. Constitution currently authorizes metropolitan service districts, allows regional governments. Measure prohibits, dissolves regional government, defined as any governmental entity crossing city, county boundaries. Specifically dissolves Portland area metropolitan service district called \u2018Metro.\u2019 Effectively dissolves Metro\u2019s regional urban growth boundary. Exempts governmental entities providing single, defined service; lists specific entities not covered. Creates process for transferring parks, zoos to cities, counties, districts; other facilities to new regional commission. Allocates remaining funds, debts to affected counties. Provides no system for paying dissolved regional governments\u2019 debts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Petitioner Sizemore challenges the caption and the summary of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. Petitioner Houck challenges the caption, the result statements, and the summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires a \u201ccaption of not more than 10 words that reasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d Petitioner Sizemore argues that the caption \u201cdoes not reasonably identify the subject matter of the measure,\u201d because the \u201cwording of the certified caption is awkward and confusing\u201d and, therefore, lacks clarity. Petitioner Sizemore contends that the Portland area Metropolitan Service District (Metro) is, \u201cby definition,\u201d the only regional government dissolved by the proposed initiative measure and that the ballot title caption should be rewritten to make it clear that only Metro is dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">That argument is not well taken. The proposed initiative measure does not provide explicitly that only Metro will be dissolved. On its face, the proposed initiative measure dissolves all regional governments. Section 1 provides, in part, that \u201c[a]ll regional governments existing on the effective date of this act shall be dissolved.\u201d Factual and legal inquiry beyond the scope of this proceeding would be required to determine whether other regional entities exist that fall within the proposed initiative measure\u2019s definition of regional government, but that are not specifically listed in the initiative measure\u2019s exceptions. For example, the regional governmental councils authorized by ORS chapter 190 are multi-jurisdictional, multi-purpose organizations that may meet the proposed initiative measure\u2019s definition of \u201cregional government.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Those councils are not included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the specific exceptions fisted in section 4 of the proposed initiative measure. To the extent that any one of those regional councils provides a political forum for resolution of regional issues, the member units of local government may be giving up their authority and autonomy regarding certain issues. We do not decide those issues here, but conclude only that the Attorney General properly declined to characterize the proposed initiative measure as dissolving <em>only </em>Metro.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Petitioner Sizemore next argues that voters will be confused by (1) the \u201cjuxtaposition of \u2018prohibits\u2019 with \u2018dissolves,\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201cthe phrase \u2018with exceptions\u2019 following \u2018dissolves * * * Metro.\u2019 \u201d Because petitioner Sizemore failed to raise either of those arguments in his original written comments on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title, this court may not consider them. ORS 250.085(6); <em>McCoid v. Kulongoski, </em>321 Or 452, 454, 900 P2d 1028 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Petitioner Houck contends that the proposed initiative measure contains three subjects, or three \u201cdistinct aspects\u201d of one subject: (1) eliminating regional governments, including Metro; (2) eliminating Metro\u2019s urban growth boundary (UGB); and (3) requiring the sale of Metro\u2019s assets. Petitioner Houck argues that the caption does not comply with ORS 250.035(2)(a), because it does not reasonably identify the whole subject matter of the proposed initiative measure. He argues that it identifies only one of those subjects or \u201cdistinct aspects,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the elimination of regional governments, and that it does not expressly mention the last two of those three subjects, or aspects, of the proposed initiative measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">This court has explained that the function of a ballot title caption is to identify generally the thread that connects a ballot measure\u2019s various provisions, rather than \u201cfocusing on one or more of the most significant constituent parts.\u201d <em>Rooney v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 77, 85, 902 P2d 1177 (1995). A caption that does not fist multiple parts of an initiative measure nonetheless may substantially comply with the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>standard, in the absence of a showing that unnecessary words have been inserted into the caption and that additional ideas could be communicated to the voters by replacing those unnecessary words. <em>Crumpton v. Kiesling, </em>317 Or 322, 325-26, 855 P2d 1107 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In this case, within the ten-word statutory limit, the Attorney General\u2019s caption identifies the following important provisions of the proposed initiative measure: (1) prohibition on regional governments; (2) dissolution of existing regional governments, (3) specifically including Metro; with (4) enumerated exceptions. Petitioner Houck fails to identify any of those provisions as \u201cunnecessary,\u201d yet asks this court to replace one or all of them to discuss additional parts of the proposed initiative measure that he wishes to see in the ballot title caption. Because that argument fails to persuade us that the Attorney General\u2019s caption is legally insufficient, we decline to modify the caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Attorney General\u2019s caption substantially complies with ORS 250.035-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">RESULT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c) require a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved\u201d and a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is rejected.\u201d The statements \u201cshall be written so that, to the extent practical, the language of the two statements is parallel.\u201d ORS 250.035(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Petitioner Houck argues that the Attorney General\u2019s result statements fail to substantially comply with the statutory requirements for the same reason that he argues that the caption is defective: the result statements fail to disclose two important \u201cimpacts\u201d of the proposed initiative measure\u2014 the ehmination of the Metro UGB and the sale or transfer of all Metro assets. We disagree. Even assuming that petitioner Houck\u2019s suggested additions would be desirable (an issue that we do not decide), he has failed to show how, given the limitations inherent in the statutory word limit, the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>General\u2019s \u201cyes vote\u201d result statement is legally insufficient. We hold that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes vote\u201d result statement substantially complies with ORS 250.035(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Petitioner Houck also challenges the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d result statement. However, his argument is premised on the theory that his challenge to the \u201cyes vote\u201d result statement is well taken. As we have held, it is not. We hold that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno vote\u201d result statement substantially complies with ORS 250.035(2)(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">ORS 250.035(2)(d) requires that a ballot title contain a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Petitioner Sizemore objects to two statements in the Attorney General\u2019s summary: (1) the statement that the initiative measure \u201c[ejffectively dissolves Metro\u2019s regional urban growth boundary,\u201d and (2) the statement that the initiative measure \u201c[pjrovides no system for paying dissolved regional governments\u2019 debts.\u201d Petitioner Sizemore argues that the first statement, regarding Metro\u2019s UGB, \u201cstems merely from the Attorney General\u2019s <em>opinion </em>[emphasis in original] that an effect of adopting the measure would be to dissolve the Portland area UGB,\u201d that this effect arguably might not occur, and that, even if it were certain to occur, it is only a \u201ctertiary\u201d effect of the initiative measure that may not be mentioned in the ballot title summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The Portland area UGB is established by Metro pursuant to ORS 268.390(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to ORS 268.390(4), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Metro may require cities and counties to amend their comprehensive land use plans to conform to the Portland area UGB established by Metro. Metro also may require cities and counties within the Metro district to amend their comprehensive plans as those plans affect land use, water quality, air quality, transportation, or other issues, as determined by the Metro Council pursuant to ORS 268.390(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The parties agree that, if the proposed initiative measure is passed by the voters, Metro will cease to exist. However, the Attorney General\u2019s summary, which states that the proposed initiative measure \u201c[e]ffectively dissolves Metro\u2019s regional urban growth boundary,\u201d is incorrect. If the initiative measure is passed by the voters, the UGB would not cease to exist at that time. What would cease to exist, along with Metro itself, is Metro\u2019s authority to require cities and counties in the Metro district to amend their comprehensive plans to conform to the Metro UGB and other requirements on land use, water quality, air quality, and transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For example, ORS 197.625(1) provides, in part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>This creates the possibility of a scenario in which, the day after the proposed measure is enacted, one or more cities immediately adopt new UGBs, one or more of which could be deemed acknowledged 21 days after adoption, barring the filing of notices of appeal with the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) for each new UGB. Even if the hypothetical new UGBs were appealed to LUBA, there currently is no existing mechanism or process, separate from Metro itself, for coordinating the UGBs of all 24 cities within the Portland area UGB, and current administrative rules do not expressly address consideration of regional needs with respect to review of the UGBs of individual cities. The end result, if the measure is passed, is the elimination of Metro\u2019s authority to coordinate the regional UGB and related land use air quality, water quality, and transportation issues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cIf no notice of intent to appeal is filed within the 21-day period set out in ORS 197.830(8), the amendment to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation or the new land use regulation shall be considered acknowledged upon the expiration of the 21-day period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>In our view, the elimination of Metro\u2019s enforcement authority is a predictable legal effect of the proposed measure, if enacted, and should be mentioned in the ballot title summary. <em>See Bartsch v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 335, 338-39, 906 P2d 815 (1995) (court sustained Attorney General\u2019s use of phrase \u201cany person\u201d in a ballot title, because those words accurately described initiative measure\u2019s effect; initiative measure\u2019s use of different terms did not render Attorney General\u2019s choice inaccurate, because initiative measure\u2019s terms had \u201cno established meaning in the law\u201d); <em>Huss v. Kulongoski, </em>324 Or 369, 371, 926 P2d 318 (1996) (in proposed initiative measure amending Oregon Constitution to give human embryos and fetuses \u201cfull legal rights,\u201d court certified Attorney General\u2019s ballot title summary that stated the predictable legal effects of the initiative measure). Accordingly, we so modify the Attorney General\u2019s summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Petitioner Sizemore next argues that the statement in the summary that the proposed initiative measure \u201c[provides no system for paying dissolved regional governments\u2019 debts\u201d is inaccurate. We agree. The proposed initiative measure contemplates two species of regional government debt: (1) bonded indebtedness, which is discussed in the proposed initiative measure in subsections (2)(c)(i) and (ii); and (2) other debt remaining after the dissolution of the regional government, which is discussed in subsection (2)(c)(iii). Governmental entities receiving the assets of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>dissolved regional government <em>(e.g., </em>parks, zoos, convention facilities, etc.) specifically would be granted the authority of the dissolved regional government with respect to bonds and property taxes used to finance the purchase or construction of the transferred assets. After dissolution, debt unrelated to bonds issued by the regional government, if any, would be apportioned equally among the counties in which the dissolved regional government was located. Thus, the \u201csystem\u201d for the payment of the dissolved regional governments\u2019 debts is clear: bonded indebtedness would be paid using tax revenues contemplated by the regional government at the time the bonds were issued, and any other debt would be split equally among the relevant counties and paid in whatever manner selected by each of those counties. Accordingly, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s summary by eliminating the challenged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Petitioner Houck argues that the summary\u2019s discussion of the debt issue is statutorily deficient. He contends that Metro\u2019s assets currently are insufficient to cover Metro\u2019s indebtedness and that, if the proposed initiative measure passes, the counties in which Metro is located will acquire new debt. He argues that the summary would mislead voters by implying that the cities and counties in Metro could acquire new debt <em>or </em>new funds, and that this implication is \u201cerroneous and wholly improper.\u201d Even the most casual evaluation of petitioner Houck\u2019s argument in this regard would require a factual investigation by this court into Metro\u2019s current financial health. That would be well beyond the scope of this proceeding. Petitioner Houck\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Petitioner Houck argues that the Attorney General\u2019s summary is deficient in two additional respects: (1) it does not discuss adequately the extent to which Metro would be required to transfer its properties, should the initiative measure pass; and (2) it does not address the effect of the initiative measure on Oregon\u2019s constitutional home rule provisions. We reject Petitioner Houck\u2019s first argument. The Attorney General\u2019s summary, taken as a whole, makes clear that Metro would be dissolved, its affairs wound up, and its assets transferred if the proposed initiative measure is passed by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Regarding the effect of the proposed initiative measure on Oregon\u2019s constitutional home rule provisions, Petitioner Houck argues that Article IV, section 1(5), Article VI, section 10, and Article XI, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution reserve to local governments the right to choose and control the form and structure of their local governments, and that this power includes the authority to share resources, or to create \u201cdistricts\u201d to share resources, so as to accomplish multiple tasks, as long as that action does not interfere with \u201ca general law addressed primarily to substantive social, economic, or other regulatory objectives.\u201d <em>Seto v. Tri-County Metro. Transportation Dist., </em>311 Or 456, 463, 814 P2d 1060 (1991). Petitioner Houck argues further that the proposed initiative measure removes the power to cooperate from the hands of local governments, which constitutes a \u201cserious modification of the \u2018home rule\u2019 provisions of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d Discussion of that issue is misplaced here, because it would require extensive legal interpretation, not only of the proposed initiative measure, but also of the interaction of the initiative measure with other constitutional provisions. Because this is beyond our authority in this proceeding, we decline to consider Petitioner Houck\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In accordance with the foregoing discussion, we certify the following modified ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS, DISSOLVES REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING PORTLAND AREA \u201cMETRO,\u201d WITH EXCEPTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote prohibits, dissolves regional governments, including Portland area metropolitan service district \u201cMetro,\u201d with exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains all forms of regional governments, including Portland area metropolitan service district (\u201cMetro\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution.
