That measure, designated by the Secretary of State as \u201cMeasure 51,\u201d would, if enacted, repeal ORS 127.800 to 127.897, the \u201cOregon Death with Dignity Act.\u201d That Act (hereafter sometimes referred to as \u201cMeasure 16\u201d) was itself adopted by the people at the November 1994 general election but, due to various court proceedings, never has gone into effect. Petitioners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are electors who filed timely written comments with respect to various aspects of the ballot title as it originally was proposed by the Attorney General and who now are entitled to maintain these proceedings. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (establishing the foregoing criteria for standing to challenge ballot titles certified by the Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Pursuant to ORS 250.067(2), the Attorney General has certified to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for the referred measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cREPEALS LAW ALLOWING TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS TO OBTAIN LETHAL PRESCRIPTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cRESULTS OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote repeals law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cRESULTS OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Repeals Measure 16, adopted by voters in 1994.

Before turning to those requirements, however, we first must address a procedural point raised by petitioners Hamilton <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>argue to this court, as a preliminary matter, that the Attorney General was precluded from preparing a ballot title for the proposed measure, because the Legislative Assembly had itself prepared a ballot title for the measure. <em>See </em>ORS 250.075(1) (providing that, \u201c[w]hen the Legislative Assembly refers a measure to the people, a ballot title for the measure <em>may </em>be prepared by the assembly\u201d) (emphasis added). It follows, they argue, that the Attorney General had no authority to prepare a separate, substitute ballot title. <em>See </em>ORS 250.075(2) (providing that, \u201c[i]f the [ballot] title is <em>not </em>prepared under subsection (1) of [ORS 250.075],\u201d the Attorney General shall prepare a ballot title for the referred measure) (emphasis added). From the foregoing, petitioners reason that this court is precluded from reviewing the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title, because that ballot title is not eligible to be placed on the ballot at all in any form, <em>i.e., </em>is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Petitioners acknowledge that A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session), the bill that purported to create the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>legislature\u2019s suggested ballot title, was vetoed by the Governor. They assert, however, that the gubernatorial veto also was a nullity, because the Governor is without power to veto legislative bills that are referred to the people. Because this latter theory is pivotal to petitioners\u2019 argument, we turn to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">It is true, as petitioners state, that the Governor does not have the power to veto bills referred to the people by the Legislative Assembly. Oregon Constitution, Article IV, section l(3)(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session) itself was not, by its own terms, a referred bill. Instead, it was a direction to the Secretary of State to use the election machinery of state government to place before the voters a particular ballot title for a referred bill that had been created in a separate bill, A-Engrossed House Bill 2954 (1997 session). As such, A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session) was not, as the constitution specifies, a \u201cbill[ ] ordering a referendum\u201d or a \u201cbill[ ] on which a referendum is ordered\u201d but was, instead, a bill like any other bill for an Act: It could become law only if a majority of each house of the Legislative Assembly concurred in it, Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 25, <em>and </em>if it was not vetoed by the Governor, Or Const, Art V, \u00a7 15b. In the case of A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session), however, the Governor chose to exercise his veto power under Oregon Constitution, Article V, section 15b. A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session) thus never became law. As of this date, the Legislative Assembly has not overridden his veto pursuant to Oregon Constitution, Article V, section 156(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">No ballot title having been created by the Legislative Assembly for Measure 51 (i.e., A-Engrossed House Bill 3502 (1997 session) never having become an Act), it fell to the Attorney General to create a ballot title. ORS 250.075(2). The Attorney General did so. The present proceedings are validly before this court. We turn to the merits of the arguments presented by the various petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As noted, this court reviews ballot titles for \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the statutory requirements in ORS 250.035. ORS 250.085(5). ORS 250.035(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cThe ballot title of any state measure to be initiated or referred shall consist of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201c(a) A caption of not more than 10 words that reasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201c(b) A simple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved. * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201c(c) A simple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is rejected. * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">\u201c(d) A concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Petitioners Goodwin <em>et al </em>and Hamilton <em>et al </em>mount separate challenges to the Caption, Result Statements, and Summary of the certified ballot title. We address each of the three sections of the ballot title in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Petitioners Goodwin <em>et al </em>argue that the Caption of the certified ballot title fails to \u201creasonably identify the subject matter\u201d of Measure 51, as required by ORS 250.035(2)(a), because, instead of focusing on the present measure, it relies too heavily on the ballot title wording certified in 1994 for the then-proposed Measure 16. Specifically, they argue that the subject matter of Measure 51 would be more readily identifiable if the Caption were to refer, by name and year of passage, to the law that Measure 51 proposes to repeal. They propose a Caption stating: \u201cREPEALS DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT PASSED BY VOTERS IN 1994.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">That argument is not well taken. Assuming that the foregoing would be a permissible Caption, nothing in petitioners\u2019 argument demonstrates how the Attorney General\u2019s alternative choice for the Caption, <em>viz., </em>\u201cREPEALS LAW ALLOWING TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS TO OBTAIN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>LETHAL PRESCRIPTION,\u201d fails to meet the standard imposed by ORS 250.035(2)(a). The certified Caption reasonably identifies the subject matter of Measure 51 by referring to the content of the corresponding law that it seeks to repeal, using wording previously approved by this court to describe the subject matter. <em>See Kane v. Kulongoski, </em>318 Or 593, 871 P2d 993 (1994) (issuing certified ballot title for the 1994 initiative; certified Caption read: \u201cALLOWS TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS TO OBTAIN PRESCRIPTION FOR LETHAL DRUGS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">For similar reasons, the arguments of petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>with respect to the Caption fail. They argue that the certified Caption is inadequate, because it leaves out any reference to \u201cdrugs\u201d as the medium through which lethal prescriptions may be made under the law, in favor of adding the term \u201cadult.\u201d They propose that this court substitute the Caption that the legislature proposed in HB 3502 (1997). That Caption states: \u201cREPEALS LAW ALLOWING PRESCRIPTION OF LETHAL DRUGS TO TERMINALLY ILL.\u201d By including the term \u201cdrugs,\u201d petitioners assert, this Caption includes what they deem to be the \u201cmost significant\u201d aspect of the law that Measure 51 seeks to repeal, <em>i.e., </em>the right of a physician to write a prescription for lethal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Petitioners\u2019 argument is only an assertion that their preferred wording would be \u201cbetter\u201d than that used by the Attorney General. That is no basis for this court to hold that the Attorney General\u2019s choice is legally insufficient. Moreover, inserting the word \u201cdrug\u201d necessarily would require removing the word \u201cadult,\u201d in order to meet the 10-word limit on captions. ORS 250.035(2)(a). The gain would not offset the loss: The concept of \u201cdrugs\u201d is implied in the word \u201cprescription.\u201d On the other hand, removing the word \u201cadult\u201d would deprive the voters of crucial information about <em>who </em>may seek a lethal prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Petitioners have not established that the certified Caption fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">THE RESULT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title contains the following Result Statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cRESULTS OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Tes\u2019 vote repeals law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">\u201cRESULTS OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Petitioners Goodwin <em>et al </em>argue, as they did with respect to the Caption, that the Result Statements would be more \u201csimple and understandable,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c), if they clearly identified the existing law that Measure 51 seeks to repeal. We reject petitioners\u2019 arguments for the same reason expressed earlier concerning petitioners\u2019 similar argument with respect to the Caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>argue for the following Result Statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u201cRESULT OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Tes\u2019 vote repeals law allowing prescription of lethal drugs for adults diagnosed as terminally ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains law allowing prescription of lethal drugs for adults diagnosed as terminally ill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Petitioners\u2019 proposed Result Statements are those that the legislature proposed in HB 3502 (1997 session).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">These petitioners assert that the most significant feature of the existing law is that it removes criminal penalties for physicians who prescribe lethal drugs to the terminally ill. Therefore, they reason, their proposed Result Statements properly shift the focus from the choice that the law provides to terminally ill adults to what the law allows physicians to do. Petitioners offer one way to look at the existing law, but their argument fails to show why the certified ballot title, which roughly parallels the 1994 ballot title for Measure 16, does not comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c). Moreover, by maintaining the same focus as the Caption, the certified Result Statements are in accord with this court\u2019s case law endorsing internal consistency in ballot titles. <em>See Mabon v. Keisling, </em>317 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>406, 414, 856 P2d 1023, (1993) (Question \u2014 statutory predecessor to the Result Statements \u2014 should build on and be consistent with the Caption); <em>Kane, </em>318 Or at 600 (rewording Caption to make it consistent with the Question and Summary).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">THE SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The Summary must contain \u201c[a] concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(d). In addition to urging that the use of the phrase, \u201cOregon Death with Dignity Law,\u201d in the Summary is essential \u2014 an argument that we reject for the reason already stated \u2014 petitioners Goodwin <em>et al </em>challenge certain wording of the certified Summary. They argue that the phrase, \u201cRepeals Measure 16, adopted by voters in 1994,\u201d is misleading and biased, because the \u201cDeath With Dignity Act\u201d no longer is merely a \u201cmeasure\u201d but, instead, has been transformed into a \u201claw\u201d by the vote of the people. The voters, petitioners assert, are entitled to know that Measure 51 seeks to repeal an existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary, althoughit begins with a reference to \u201cMeasure 16,\u201d almost immediately thereafter refers to that measure as \u201c[t]hat <em>law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That reference is sufficient, we conclude, to convey to the voters the fact that they are dealing with an existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>reject the entire Summary certified by the Attorney General. They first argue that the certified Summary is unfair, because it informs the voters that Measure 51 would repeal a measure that passed in 1994, thereby making a \u201cpolitical statement\u201d that \u201cencourag[es] voters to vote against Measure 51.\u201d We are not persuaded. We agree with the Attorney General that telling the voters what year the existing law passed is one permissibly useful, neutral method of helping to identify the existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As a fallback position, petitioners argue that the voters at least also deserve to be told that the 1994 initiative passed by a \u201cslim\u201d margin and that the legislature referred the law back to the voters because of its \u201cflaws.\u201d Neither of those suggestions is well taken. The margin of passage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Measure 16 is a matter for argument, not for inclusion in an impartial Summary. Still less is it appropriate for a Summary to take sides with respect to a measure by announcing that, in the opinion of some members of the Legislative Assembly, the measure has \u201cflaws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>next argue that the certified Summary is inadequate, because it improperly focuses on what the 1994 law does, rather than on the \u201cmajor effect\u201d of Measure 51. The major effect of Measure 51, petitioners assert, is simply to repeal a law; no more needs to be said. They offer the following Summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201cSUMMARY: This measure repeals the law that allows terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription to commit physician-assisted suicide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">That proposed Summary is the one proposed by the legislature in HB 3502 (1997 session).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Petitioners\u2019 proposed Summary makes no effort to inform the voters of the features of the existing law \u2014 opting to explain only one part (the repeal) of a two-part story (existing law). Even if that would be a permissible way to draw a ballot title in these circumstances \u2014 an issue that we need not and do not address \u2014 petitioners have offered no persuasive explanation as to why the Attorney General\u2019s decision to tell both parts of the story fails to comply with the statutory directive to include a Summary containing an impartial statement summarizing the measure\u2019s major effect. ORS 250.035(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>argue next that the use of the term \u201cresidents\u201d in the Summary is improper, because that term is not defined. This court certified a similar use of the term in <em>Kane, </em>the ballot title review case for the 1994 initiative (Measure 16). Petitioners fail even to address, much less explain, why the <em>Kane </em>court erred in using that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>rely on federal cases in an attempt to illustrate what they consider to be deficiencies in the certified Summary. They argue first that the reference in the Summary to the standard for criminal and civil immunity is improper, because it has been held unconstitutional. <em>See Lee v. State of OR, </em>891 F Supp 1421 (D Or 1995); <em>Lee v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>of OR, </em>891 F Supp 1429 (D Or 1995) (both so holding). However, the <em>Lee </em>cases were vacated by the Ninth Circuit. <em>Lee v. OR, </em>107 F3d 1382 (9th Cir 1997) . Moreover, and whether or not vacated, such cases have no <em>precedential </em>authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Petitioners Hamilton <em>et al </em>also challenge the use in the Summary of the phrase, \u201cvoluntary informed choice,\u201d citing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s expressed skepticism of such \u201csafeguards\u201d in <em>Washington v. </em>Glucksberg, _US _, 117 S Ct 2258, 138 L Ed 2d 772 (1997). <em>Glucksberg </em>is not helpful to the present proceeding. That case addressed the issue of a terminally ill adult\u2019s right, under the United States Constitution, to commit physician-assisted suicide, in jurisdictions in which such an act had been declared criminal. <em>Glucksberg </em>does not change the content or meaning of Oregon\u2019s existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s Summary substantially complies with the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In conclusion, we hold that the ballot title certified by the Attorney General to the Secretary of State is not legally deficient in any respect urged by any of the petitioners before us. Accordingly, we. certify the following ballot title for Measure 51:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">REPEALS LAW ALLOWING TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS TO OBTAIN LETHAL PRESCRIPTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">RESULTS OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: Wes\u201d vote repeals law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">RESULTS OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains law allowing terminally ill adults to obtain physician\u2019s prescription for lethal drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">SUMMARY: Repeals Measure 16, adopted by voters in 1994.
