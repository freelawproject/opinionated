The petitioners in each proceeding have challenged the legal sufficiency of one or more parts of a ballot title certified by the Attorney General for Ballot Measure 40 (the proposed measure).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title in certain respects and, as modified, certify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Measure 40, self-styled as the \u201cInitiative Reform Act,\u201d is a wide-ranging revision of the initiative and referendum process as it presently is practiced in Oregon. Its scope cannot be captured easily in a brief summary. We therefore limit our discussion of its contents to those portions that must be mentioned in order to respond to the particular arguments that we are addressing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Attorney General certified the following ballot title for Measure 40:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REVISES INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROCESS, PROVIDES FOR YEARLY INITIATIVE ELECTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Vote Yes\u2019 for yearly initiative elections, revised signature requirements, limit restrictions on paid signature gatherers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: Vote \u2018No\u2019 to retain present constitutional and statutory controls on initiative and referendum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends Constitution, changes number of required signatures; permits two year minimum to gather signatures. Restricts legislature\u2019s referral or enactment of changes in initiative process, restricts enactment of laws controlling petition circulation, who may circulate, payment of circulators. Chief petitioner selects 40% of committee to draft statewide ballot titles; if challenged,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Supreme Court must choose between petitioner\u2019s, committee\u2019s or challenger\u2019s ballot title. Elections held each year in November. For some elections, removes voter turnout requirement on local measures. Prohibits publicly funded challenges to initiative approved laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This court\u2019s review of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title is limited to a determination whether, in the face of the challenges raised by the parties, the ballot title is in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035. ORS 250.085(5). Because they have taken markedly different approaches to the ballot title, we address the arguments advanced by each petitioner separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Petitioner Carson challenges only the legal adequacy of the Summary in the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. The Summary must set out a concise and impartial statement of the proposed measure and its major effects. ORS 250.035(2)(d). Petitioner Carson asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s Summary fails to meet that standard, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201cit excludes any mention that Article IV, Section l(2)(d) [of the Oregon Constitution] would be amended to dilute the requirement that a proposed initiative law or constitutional amendment be limited to a single-subject in certain amendments to the Constitution or proposed laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Petitioner\u2019s argument refers to a paragraph of Measure 40 that would add to Article IV, section l(2)(d), of the Oregon Constitution, wording that declares that, for the purposes of \u201csingle subject\u201d analysis, a measure that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201cembrac\u00e9is] one subject only and matters properly connected therewith * * * shall not be deemed to violate this paragraph, and shall not be deemed to be a revision of the Constitution[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] because it amends or affects more than one section or article of the Constitution. For purposes of this section, a proposed initiative or amendment which primarily revises all or part of the system whereby government taxes or assesses fees or charges shall be deemed to embrace only one subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>It is not clear to us whether or not the addition of the foregoing wording would, in fact, \u201cdilute\u201d the \u201csingle subject\u201d provision. Because it is not clear, it is not appropriate for us to speculate among arguable meanings of a measure. <em>See, e.g., Mannix v. Kulongoski, </em>323 Or 485, 495-96, 918 P2d 839 (1996) (Attorney General did not err in declining to speculate about scope of existing law).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Petitioner Carson is correct, however, in suggesting that <em>something </em>must be said in the Summary to alert the reader that wording is being added to the constitution, even if the ultimate effect of that addition cannot be foretold precisely. The Attorney General\u2019s Summary is legally deficient in not doing so. As we explain elsewhere in this opinion, other changes to the Summary at least make it possible to add the words \u201cother provisions\u201d to that portion of the ballot title. We direct that that be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We turn next to the challenges made by petitioners Gray, Sager, and Dale. They challenge all three parts of the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. With respect to the Caption, they state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThis is a complex and multi-faceted proposal. * * * [I]t is impossible to draft a Caption which identifies all of the major subjects touched on by the proposal. However, the goal should be a Caption which is as comprehensive as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u201cThe [Attorney General\u2019s] certified Caption identifies two points: revisions to the initiative and referendum processes, and the establishment of annual initiative elections. The petitioners suggest an alternative which keeps these two points and adds a third: the change in signature requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(Emphasis added.) We agree with petitioners that the Caption in its present form is inadequate, when examined in light of the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a), because it catalogues an effect of the proposed measure, rather than stating its \u201csubject.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 assertion that the proposed measure is \u201ccomplex and multi-faceted\u201d is well taken. However, petitioners\u2019 solution is to describe more effects in the Caption. That is the wrong approach. The Caption is not meant to serve as a comprehensive statement of the measure\u2019s effects.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c[a] caption of not more than 10 words that reasonably identifies <em>the subject matter </em>of the state measure. The caption of an initiative or referendum amendment to the constitution shall begin with the phrase, \u2018Amends Constitution,\u2019 which shall not be counted for purposes of the 10-word caption limit[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The fact is that, beyond stating that the measure revises the initiative and referendum processes, any further elaboration in the Caption simply reflects a choice to emphasize certain effects of the measure at the expense of other effects. We conclude that the most accurate thing that may be said about the <em>subject matter </em>of Measure 40 is conveyed by the use of less than all the 10-word allotment for the Caption. We hold that the Caption should be revised to read: \u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REVISES INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROCESSES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Petitioners next challenge the Attorney General\u2019s Result Statements. We deal first with the \u201cYes\u201d Result Statement. ORS 250.035(2)(b) requires that each ballot title for a state measure contain</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201c[a] simple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved. The statement required by this paragraph shall include either the phrase, T vote\u2019 or Vote yes,\u2019 or a substantially similar phrase, which may be placed at any point within the statement^]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The \u201cyes\u201d statement \u201cshall be written so that an affirmative response to the statement corresponds to an affirmative vote on the state measure.\u201d ORS 250.035(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">As noted, the Attorney General\u2019s Wes\u201d Result Statement states: \u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Vote Wes\u2019 for yearly initiative elections, revised signature requirements, limit restrictions on paid signature gatherers.\u201d Petitioners assert that the foregoing Statement is not \u201cunderstandable,\u201d under the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(b), and because it uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>confusing syntax, gives an erroneous impression that annual initiative and referendum elections would be <em>required, </em>rather than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The Attorney General concedes that his \u2018Yes\u201d Result Statement is inadequate. He proposes an alteration in the Statement that corrects the problem by rephrasing the result \u201cfor yearly initiative elections\u201d to \u201cprovides annual initiative elections.\u201d No party challenges the Attorney General\u2019s suggested change. We find that change acceptable under the statutory standard and will incorporate it into the Result Statement that we certify after considering petitioner Size-more\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Petitioners Gray, Sager, and Dale also challenge the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d Result Statement, but do so only on the ground that its wording should be \u201cparallel,\u201d at least \u201cto the extent practical,\u201d with the wording of the \u2018Yes\u201d Result Statement. ORS 250.035(3). They suggest a minor revision of the wording to accomplish that end. The Attorney General essentially agrees with their proposal. We, too, agree that the minor suggested change to which the Attorney General agrees is \u201cpractical,\u201d without sacrificing the substance of the information required by ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c). Accordingly, we certify the following \u201cNo\u201d Result Statement: \u201c \u2018No\u2019 vote retains the present constitutional and statutory controls on initiative and referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Finally, petitioners Gray, Sager, and Dale challenge the Attorney General\u2019s certified Summary in four respects, two of which we find to be well taken. Petitioners first point out that the Attorney General\u2019s Summary contains 86 words, when the limit is 85. The Attorney General concedes the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Petitioners\u2019 argument points up one other defect. The Attorney General\u2019s Summary fails to alert the reader that, in addition to the effects that it discusses, there are several others. The numerical word limitation prevents a discussion in the Summary of all of the measure\u2019s effects, but the voter should at least be advised that the measure has other important but unstated effects, so that the voter can do further reading, should he or she choose to do so. The omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>may be corrected by deleting the words \u201cin November\u201d from the Summary and adding, at the end, the words \u201cother provisions.\u201d We make that modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The Summary is modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Changes number of required signatures on petition, permits two year minimum to gather signatures. Restricts legislature\u2019s referral or enactment of changes in initiative process, restricts laws controlling petition circulation, who may circulate, payment of circulators. Committee, 40 percent chosen by chief petitioner, drafts statewide ballot titles; if challenged, Supreme Court must choose between petitioner\u2019s, committee\u2019s, or challenger\u2019s ballot title. Elections held each year. For some elections, removes voter turnout requirement on local measures. Prohibits publicly funded challenges to initiative approved laws. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We turn now to the challenges made by petitioner Sizemore, who is the chief petitioner for the measure. He challenges both the Attorney General\u2019s Result Statements and the Summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Petitioner Sizemore contends that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d Result Statement violates ORS 250.035(2)(b) because it suggests that the measure would limit or restrict only \u201cpaid\u201d signature gatherers when, in fact, that misstates the result. At oral argument, the Attorney General conceded petitioner Sizemore\u2019s point and proposed to correct the error by deleting the word \u201cpaid\u201d from the Result Statement. We find that change acceptable under the statutory standard, as we did the change proposed by the Attorney General in response to the concerns raised by petitioners Gray, Sager, and Dale. Accordingly, we incorporate both changes into the Wes\u201d Result Statement that we now certify: \u201c Tes\u2019 vote provides annual initiative elections, changes signature requirements, limits regulation of signature gatherers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Petitioner Sizemore raised other objections to the Attorney General\u2019s Results Statement, but none of those objections demonstrates a violation of the standard that the Attorney General is to observe when drafting a ballot title. We do discuss one point, however, because we believe that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>will be repeated in cases of this kind until dealt with. Petitioner Sizemore criticizes the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d Result Statement on the ground that it fails to \u201cparallel\u201d the wording of the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d Result Statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner asserts that such a parallel construction is \u201crequired\u201d by the wording in ORS 250.035(3) that provides that the \u2018Yes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d Result Statements \u201cshall be written so that, to the extent practical, the language of the two statements is parallel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Petitioner\u2019s premise is wrong. The provision must be read as a whole, including the qualifying phrase, \u201cto the extent practical.\u201d The provision thus is not an absolute. In light of its context \u2014 ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c)-we hold that the statutory preference for parallelism is secondary to the statutory direction that the Result Statements actually describe for the voters what the \u201cresult\u201d of their vote will be. To the extent that petitioner wishes to have this court in the future treat the parallel language clause in ORS 250.035(3) as a categorical imperative, we reject his approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">With respect to the Summary, petitioner\u2019s objections are similar to his objections to the Result Statements. We do not find them to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Having considered the arguments advanced by each of the petitioners in these three consolidated ballot title review proceedings, we certify the following ballot title for Ballot Measure 40 to the Secretary of State pursuant to ORS 250.085(5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: REVISES INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROCESSES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote provides annual initiative elections, changes signature requirements, limits regulation of signature gatherers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains the present constitutional and statutory controls on initiative and referendum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>SUMMARY: Amends Constitution.
