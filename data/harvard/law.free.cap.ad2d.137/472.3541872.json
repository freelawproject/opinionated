In those decisions, it was determined that restrictive definitions of the term \"family\u201d, contained in certain local zoning ordinances could not serve as the basis for enjoining the use of single-family houses as \"group homes\u201d either for foster children <em>(City of White Plains v Ferraioli, supra, </em>at 306) or for disturbed children <em>(Group House v Board of Zoning &amp; Appeals, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We are constrained by this aspect of the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>McMinn v Town of Oyster Bay (supra) </em>to declare that the definition of the term \"family\u201d contained in the zoning ordinance of the Town of Brookhaven is unconstitutional, since the definition in question likewise fails to include within its scope the type of \"surrogate\u201d families as were described by the Court of Appeals in the <em>Group House v Board of Zoning &amp; Appeals (supra) </em>and <em>City of White Plains v Ferraioli (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We note that the <em>McMinn </em>court, by relying on those cases did not decide whether a local government may place a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>reasonable limitation on the number of unrelated persons who may reside together in single-family houses but who do <em>not </em>constitute a surrogate family. The concurring opinion of Judge Kaye indicates that local governments <em>may </em>legally prohibit unrelated persons, who do not constitute surrogate families, from residing together in such houses in whatever numbers they choose. Although the definition of \"family\u201d contained in the Town of Brookhaven\u2019s ordinance is unconstitutional because that definition does not include surrogate families, it would appear that a town has the right pursuant to a properly adopted ordinance to restrict the manner of the use of the property by the plaintiffs, which is in essence that of a boarding house. Mangano, J. P., Bracken, Kunzeman and Eiber, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
