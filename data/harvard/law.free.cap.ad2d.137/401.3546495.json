The appeal from the order entered July 30, 1986 is dismissed as superseded, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Appellant, the issuer of an excess insurance policy, seeks to recover damages from respondent, issuer of the primary insurance policy, for respondent\u2019s alleged bad-faith refusal to settle a claim against appellant\u2019s insured prior to trial. Following a jury verdict against the insured, the claim was settled for $132,500 of which appellant paid $112,500. Appellant now challenges Supreme Court\u2019s decision to grant respondent\u2019s untimely motion for a protective order. Respondent maintains that the order was properly granted because appellant\u2019s notice and demand was overly broad and because the material sought is privileged under CPLR 3101.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We note at the outset that respondent\u2019s failure to timely seek a protective order forecloses all inquiry into the propriety of appellant\u2019s discovery demands unless they are \"palpably improper\u201d <em>(Wood v Sardi\u2019s Rest. Corp., </em>47 AD2d 870, 871 [1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Dept 1975]). Although appellant\u2019s discovery requests are framed in the broadest of terms, the documents sought relate to a specific subject matter and are therefore sufficiently identifiable to satisfy the requirements of CPLR 3120 (a). <em>(Matter of Bird, </em>100 AD2d 784 [1st Dept 1984]; <em>Scheinfeld v Burlant, </em>98 AD2d 603 [1st Dept 1983].) The requests in the notice of demand were not, therefore, palpably improper and respondent should have been ordered to comply therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Respondent\u2019s assertion of the litigation and work product privilege for the materials sought by appellant is unavailing in this bad-faith action between issuers of primary and excess insurance policies. In <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indent. Co. v Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(93 AD2d 337 [1st Dept 1983], <em>affd </em>61 NY2d 569 [1984]), this court reaffirmed that the primary carrier owes the same fiduciary obligation to the excess insurer which the primary insurer owes to its insured. Where it is alleged that the insurer has breached that duty to its insured, the insurer may not use the attorney-client or work product privilege as a shield to prevent disclosure which is relevant to the insured\u2019s bad-faith action <em>(Colbert v Home Indem. Co., </em>24 AD2d 1080 [4th Dept 1965], <em>affg </em>45 Misc 2d 1093). Thus, the same principle obtains in a bad-faith action between the excess insurer and the primary insurer. Respondent\u2019s insured, the owner of the vehicle, and the driver of the vehicle who is also covered under the owner\u2019s policy, and appellant\u2019s insured, the driver\u2019s employer, were all represented by the law firm retained by respondent. The litigation materials prepared for the liability trial and counsel\u2019s work product relevant to that action were prepared on behalf of all three of those defendants, including appellant\u2019s insured. Respondent does not claim that there was any conflict of interest among the three defendants which required separate strategies or materials for their defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We agree that the first five interrogatories were improper as they relate to the enforcement of a judgment which may be rendered against respondent. Other arguments raised by the parties on appeal have been considered and rejected. Concur\u2014 Murphy, P. J., Sullivan, Ross, Rosenberger and Smith, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
