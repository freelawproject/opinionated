While one of these roadways was mapped but unopened at the time the town acquired the subject property, the record demonstrates that the County of Suffolk partially cleared and paved that road prior to the acquisition. Moreover, it is undisputed that the town undertook the task of clearing the balance of the unopened roadway after acquiring the parcel in order to take advantage of the additional benefits which it offers.</p><p id=\"b721-4\">Similarly unavailing is the town\u2019s contention that one of the comparable sales employed by the claimant\u2019s appraiser in valuing the subject parcel pursuant to the market data approach should have been excluded from evidence due to a dispute between the parties concerning its selling price. The weight of the credible evidence supports the accuracy of the sales figure advanced by the claimant\u2019s appraiser; hence, we perceive no basis for disturbing the Judicial Hearing Officer's resolution of this issue in favor of the claimant.</p><p id=\"b721-5\">Furthermore, we find unpersuasive the town\u2019s criticism of the adjustment methodology utilized by the claimant\u2019s appraiser, as the record reveals that he properly combined all of the various adjustments for time, size and other factors to obtain a single net adjustment, which he then applied to the various comparables in order to achieve a final indicated value for each of them. Additionally, we note that even if the adjustment methodology employed by the town\u2019s appraiser had been adopted by the Judicial Hearing Officer, the range of indicated values for the claimant\u2019s comparables under such a methodology would nevertheless support the final value assigned to the subject property by the claimant\u2019s appraiser.</p><p id=\"b721-6\">We have considered the town\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Mangano, J. P., Bracken, Spatt and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
