Evidence \u2014 when husband\u2019s declaration of trust is admissible as against creditors. In a creditors\u2019 bill proceeding to set aside a conveyance of real estate from husband to wife, a written declaration made by the husband before complainants\u2019 indebtedness was incurred, to the effect that he had used his wife\u2019s money in purchasing the property and that he held the title in trust for her, is admissible in favor of the wife, where the husband is dead and no motive for falsifying the facts appears.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b165-8\" pgmap=\"165\">2.

Executions were issued upon said judgments and delivered to the sheriff of said county, who afterwards returned the same nulla bona. On August 3, 1896, the said insurance company and bank filed a creditor\u2019s bill in the circuit court of said county, against Frederic Bartlett, Isabella J. Bartlett and others, to subject to the payment of said judgments certain real and personal property situated in said county, the title of which was held by Isabella J. Bartlett, wife of Frederic Bartlett. On October 15, 1897, Frederic Bartlett died intestate, leaving him surviving Isabella J., his widow, and Frederic R. and Isabella H. Bartlett, his children and only heirs-at-law. On March 6,1898, Isabella J. Bartlett died testate, willing all her property to her daughter, Isabella H. Bartlett, who was also made her executrix, and who afterwards qualified as such. Subsequently Frederic R. Bartlett, Isabella H. Bartlett, and Isabella H. Bartlett as executrix of the will of Isabella J. Bartlett, deceased, were substituted as parties defendant to said bill. The case was tried upon bill, answers, replications and the master\u2019s report, and a decree was entered holding said real estate to be the property of Isabella H. Bartlett and not subject to the payment of said judgments, and dismissing the bill of complaint as to Frederic R. Bartlett, and directing that the complainants pay one-half of the costs and Isabella H. Bartlett the other half. The complainants perfected an appeal to the Appellate Court for the Second District, where said decree was affirmed, and they have prosecuted an appeal to this court from such judgment of affirmance.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166(87) 167(213)\">Isabella J. Bartlett (formerly Isabella J. Robinson) was the only child of Thomas and Margaret J. Robinson. On the second day of August, 1858, she married Frederic Bartlett, and they for a time lived with her parents in Freeport. On April 3, 1866, Margaret J. Robinson and Thomas Robinson conveyed to Isabella J. Bartlett lot 4 in block 1, in Guiteau\u2019s addition to Freeport, and on January 13, 1862, Denard Shockley conveyed to Isabella J. Bartlett the west half of lot 5 in block 1, in Guiteau\u2019s addition to Freeport, and on April 30, 1860, Denard Shockley conveyed to Frederic Bartlett the east half of lot 5 in block 1, in Guiteau\u2019s addition to Freeport. On lot 4 there was located a brick dwelling house, which Frederic and Isabella J. Bartlett occupied as their homestead for a number of years prior to November 8, 1880, on which date Isabella J. Bartlett and Frederic Bartlett sold and conveyed said lots 4 and 5 to Lehman A. Warner for the expressed consideration of \u00a75500, which was paid in merchandise, and from the sale of which was after-wards realized \u00a77500 in cash. On the 15th day of October, 1869, the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company issued a twenty-year endowment policy on the life of Frederic Bartlett for \u00a75000, for the use and benefit of Isabella J. Bartlett, which policy provided that if the insured should survive the term of twenty years said sum should be paid to him; that said policy should not be assigned, but that the same might be surrendered to the company and discharged at any time by Isabella J. Bartlett. On October 9, 1888, the sum of \u00a74740.25 was paid to Isabella J. Bartlett and Frederic Bartlett in full for the surrender of said policy.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">On February 1, 1882, L. L.

In 1885-86 a commodious dwelling was erected by Frederic Bartlett upon said lots 1, 2, 13 and 14, and from the time of the completion thereof to the commencement of this suit the same was occupied by Frederic Bartlett and family as a homestead. On January 16,1896, Frederic Bartlett and Isabella J. Bartlett,' his wife, conveyed said homestead property to Frederic R. Bartlett, their son, and on the same day Frederic R. Bartlett conveyed the same to Isabella J. Bartlett, his mother, by warranty deeds, which were filed for record February 10, 1896, and are the deeds sought to be set aside by complainants as fraudulent.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-2\" pgmap=\"168\">On the 5th day of August, 1893, Frederic and Isabella J. Bartlett and George C. Fry had a conversation, in the presence of Frederic R. Bartlett, concerning the financial relations of Frederic and Isabella J. Bartlett, in which Frederic Bartlett stated that the money which bought and paid for the homestead above referred to belonged to Isabella J. Bartlett, and was derived from her parents and from a certain endowment policy of insurance on Frederic\u2019s life in which Isabella J. was the beneficiary. These statements showed that by agreement between Frederic and Isabella J. he invested said funds in said homestead and was to take title thereto in the name of his wife. At the same time Isabella J. stated to Fry that she had sent for him because she was worried, having learned for the first time that day that the title to the property where they lived was not in her name but in the name of her husband. The amount of her property so used was determined by her and her husband to be &lt;\u00a312,500, and Frederic on that day executed to his wife a judgment note for that amount, also a written declaration of trust setting forth that he held said homestead in trust for her, which is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-3\" pgmap=\"168\">\u201cState of Illinois, ) Stephenson County. ) ss.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\" pgmap=\"168(179) 169(124)\">\u201cTo whom it may concern. \u2014 I, the undersigned, Frederic Bartlett, of the city of Freeport, county of Stephenson, State of Illinois, do hereby declare and state that Isabella J.

Bartlett was the bona fide owner of said homestead at the time of her death? We are of the opinion they are, and that they established, in connection with the other facts proven in this case, an existing indebtedness from Frederic Bartlett to Isabella J. Bartlett, and an intention that the same should be paid. They were made some months before the indebtedness to either the insurance company or the bank was contracted and without reference thereto, and could not, therefore, have been made for the purpose of defrauding the complainants or either of them. The payment of such indebtedness was a g'ood and valuable consideration for the transfer of said homestead from Frederic Bartlett to Isabella J. Bartlett, from whom Isabella H. takes title.</p> <p id=\"b173-3\" pgmap=\"173\">The ground upon which such evidence is received is thus stated by Mr. Greenleaf: \u201cDeclarations of the other class, of which we are now to speak, are secondary evidence, and are received only in consequence of the death of the person making them. This class embraces not only entries in books, but all other declarations or statements of facts, whether verbal or in writing, and whether they were made at the time of the fact declared or at a subsequent day. But to render them admissible it must appear that the declarant is deceased, that he possessed competent knowledge of the facts or that it was his duty to know them, and that the declarations were at variance with his interest. When these circumstances concur, the evidence is received, leaving its weight and value to be determined by other considerations. \u201d 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 147.</p> <p id=\"b173-4\" pgmap=\"173\">In the case of County of Mahaska v. Ingalls, 16 Iowa, 81, Judge Dillon, after an exhaustive review of the English and American authorities, reaches the conclusion that verbal declarations may be received in an action between third parties when accompanied by the following prerequisites: (1) The declarant must be dead; (2) the declaration must have been against the pecuniary interest of the declarant at the time it was made; (3) the declaration must be of a fact in relation to a matter concerning which the declarant was immediately and personally cognizable; and (4) the court should be satisfied that the declarant had no probable motive to falsify the fact declared.</p> <p id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173(31) 174(73)\">In VanBuskirk v. VanBuskirk, 148 Ill. 9, on page 20, it is said: \u201cWe think, however, that there is a clear distinction between proof of the declarations of the grantee to the effect that he holds the title for another or has agreed to convey to another, and his declarations or admissions to the effect that another person\u2019s money was paid for the land. Declarations of the latter class are entitled to more weight than those of the former class, especially when they are corroborated by circumstances and attended by proof of some previous arrangement under which the money was advanced.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b174-3\" pgmap=\"174\">In Crane v. Wright, 46 Ill. 107, which was an action by the wife to recover back money paid on a contract for the purchase of land which had been rescinded, we held that the declaration of the deceased husband that the money paid on the purchase belonged to his wife and that he wished the contract to inure to her benefit, was admissible in evidence on her behalf.</p> <p id=\"b174-4\" pgmap=\"174\">We see no reason, in principle, why the admission of the husband acknowledging an indebtedness to the wife, when all the other prerequisites concur, should not be received against the creditors of the husband. Like all such declarations, they are not conclusive, but may be proved to be untrue either by positive or circumstantial evidence.</p> <p id=\"b174-5\" pgmap=\"174\">Second \u2014 It appears from the evidence that Frederic Bartlett received the proceeds of the sale of the first homestead to Warner and the funds derived from the insurance policy; that in August, 1893, he agreed to re-pay to Isabella J. Bartlett the amount thereof, for which he gave her his promissory note; that on January 16, 1896, he conveyed to her the homestead then occupied by them, which on the 5th day of August, 1893, he had acknowledged in equity belonged to her; that it did not exceed in value the amount of said indebtedness, and that the title thereto was conveyed to her before the complainants recovered their judgments. Frederic Bartlett had the right to prefer his wife to his other creditors, provided the preference was based upon a-valuable consideration and was made in good faith.</p> <p id=\"b175-2\" pgmap=\"175\">Third \u2014 Appellants contend that Isabella J. Bartlett was estopped from asserting title to said homestead as against their executions because she did not at once put the declaration of trust on record when she obtained it, in 1893, and because the deeds conveying the title to her were not recorded for a period of about thirty days after their execution. The proof fails to show that Isabella J. Bartlett in any way misled the complainants, or that said declaration of trust and deeds were withheld from record by reason of an agreement made by her with her husband. The complainants\u2019 equities are not superior to those of the wife. She succeeded in securing the title to the property, of which she was justly and equitably the owner, before they reduced their claims to judgments against her husband. She first reduced her equity to a legal basis, and, as was said in Earl v. Earl, 186 Ill. 370, we cannot assent to the view her right and title to the homestead property should be subordinated to said judgments.</p> <p id=\"b175-3\" pgmap=\"175\">The substantial truth of the statements made by Frederic Bartlett are not affected by some apparent discrepancies which appear in the evidence. From an examination of this record we fully concur in the opinion of the Appellate Court \u201cthat the court below was fully warranted by the proofs in finding that the conveyance of real estate from Frederic to Isabella J. Bartlett was made in good faith and for a valuable consideration, and that the title to the same was vested in the latter in her lifetime.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b175-4\" pgmap=\"175\">As the complainants succeeded only in part, we do not think the court erred in requiring them to pay one-half of the costs.</p> <p id=\"A3GM\" pgmap=\"175\">Appellee, Isabella H. Bartlett, having failed to assign cross-errors in this court, we are not called upon to review that part of the decree and judgment which affects only the personal property.</p> <p id=\"b175-6\" pgmap=\"175\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will therefore be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AC1\" pgmap=\"175\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
