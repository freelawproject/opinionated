Hawkins against the property of Daniel A. Jacques and Flora <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>E. Jacques, of Coventry, Rhode Island. The amount claimed upon the lien was $192.50. The respondents claim that a lien for that amount'should not be established because the petitioner has not properly performed the work that he agreed to do, for which the sum of $192.50 was the balance due, and ask that they be allowed to recoup for defective work.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao7\">For complainant: William H. Mc-Soley, Thomas H. Clarke.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABV\">For respondents: Quinn, Kernan &amp; Quinn.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">This Court has examined the evidence carefully and feels that $75 is a fair allowance for defective work and that a lien should be established for $117.50. Therefore, a decree may be entered establishing a mechanic\u2019s lien on the property of the respondents for $117.50, said lien to take precedence over all mortgages and liens that may be upon said property.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
