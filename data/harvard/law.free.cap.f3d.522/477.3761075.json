GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Abel Garcia-Arellano (\u201cGarcia\u201d) appeals the sentence imposed for his unlawful reentry following removal from the United States. Garcia asserts that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based on the determination that his prior Texas conviction for unlawful delivery of cocaine qualifies as a drug-trafficking offense under the sentencing guidelines. Garcia also asserts that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Garcia pleaded guilty, without a written agreement, to being an alien found in the Untied States after having been removed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). Pursuant to United States Sentenoing Guidelines Maitoal (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2005), the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 8 for Garcia. Based on Garcia\u2019s prior Texas conviction for \u201cdelivery of a controlled substance\u201d under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a), the PSR recommended a 12-level enhancement to Garcia\u2019s offense level under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), because Garcia\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The PSR also provided for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. An offense level of seventeen coupled with Garcia\u2019s criminal history category of II resulted in a guidelines range of 27-33 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Garcia objected to the PSR\u2019s assessment of the statutory maximum incarceration and supervised release periods, noting that recent rulings have evidenced the Supreme Court\u2019s intent to overrule its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The district court overruled this objection. At the sentencing hearing, Garcia\u2019s counsel stated that there were no objections to the 12-level enhancement, but asked the court to consider imposing a sentence at or below the low end of the guidelines range. In seeking lenience, counsel argued that Garcia\u2019s prior conviction involved a small amount of drugs, specifically stating that \u201calthough it\u2019s a drug trafficking crime, it\u2019s a $20 hand-to-hand transaction with an undercover officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The district court sentenced Garcia to 30-months in prison and two-years\u2019 supervised release. At sentencing, the record did not include any proof of Garcia\u2019s prior conviction other than the PSR and counsel\u2019s statements during the sentencing hearing. Garcia filed a timely notice of appeal and argues now that: (1) the district court erred in applying the 12-level enhancement because his Texas conviction does not fall within the guidelines\u2019 definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d; and (2) Section 1326(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in that the statute treats prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">While the district court relied only upon the PSR and counsel\u2019s statements, the record on appeal has been supplemented to include a number of documents related to Garcia\u2019s prior conviction. Garcia supplemented the record with a copy of his Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>indictment. The government supplemented the record with copies of Garcia\u2019s state court judgment and Garcia\u2019s judicial confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Garcia correctly concedes that because he did not object to the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2; review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002). Plain error exists when the district court: (1) commits error, (2) that is plain or obvious, and (3) that error affects the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>See United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001). If these three prongs are met, this court will only exercise its sound discretion to correct the error if it finds that the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We analyze the district court\u2019s error and the plainness of any error at the time of appellate consideration. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d 559, 561 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Therefore, we must determine whether the district court plainly erred in imposing the sentence enhancement based on the record before us as supplemented with the state court documents concerning Garcia\u2019s conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 561-62 (analyzing district court\u2019s imposition of enhancement for plain error based on appellate record as supplemented to include state court documents of conviction).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The Texas Health and Safety Code defines the term \u201cdeliver\u201d broadly to include, <em>inter alia, </em>an offer to sell a controlled substance. Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.002(8). Based on this broad definition, we have held that \u00a7 481.112 encompasses \u201cboth conduct that does constitute a drug trafficking offense (trafficking cocaine) and conduct that does not (offering to sell cocaine).\u201d <em>United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 358 (5th Cir.2007); see <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-15 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Garcia contends that the enhancement was improper because the court could not definitively determine whether his conviction was for trafficking, or simply for an offer to sell. Because the statute provides multiple ways to violate its terms, we must determine whether Garcia\u2019s offense of conviction under \u00a7 481.112 for unlawful delivery falls within the guidelines definition. In making this determination, a court may look beyond the statute itself to \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to <em>some other comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (emphasis added); <em>see United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Garcia\u2019s indictment and state court judgment fall within the scope of documents a court may consider under <em>Shepard. See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>S.Ct. 1254 (listing charging document); <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 715 (5th Cir.2007) (noting that district court had before it the Texas state indictment and judgment). We hold today that a written judicial confession also constitutes a \u201ccomparable judicial record\u201d under <em>Shepard, </em>and that it may be considered in determining whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense under the guidelines. A Texas judicial confession is an admission made in the course of judicial proceedings by a party, \u201csuch as a confession made to an examining court before the trial.\u201d <em>Dinnery v. State, </em>592 S.W.2d 343, 352 (Tex.Crim.App.1979). Under Texas law, a judicial confession which stipulates to the factual content in an indictment provides a strong enough evidentiary basis to support a judgment of conviction on the charge without the need for any corroborating evidence. <em>See id. </em>Also, Texas courts have recognized written judicial confessions as providing necessary proof of prior convictions for state sentence enhancement purposes. <em>See, e.g., Walls v. Texas, </em>No. 06-04-00009-CR, 2004 WL 1440619 at *4 (Tex.App.-Texarkana June 29, 2004) (unpublished). Accordingly, we regard a written judicial confession as the type of reliable and accurate judicial record the <em>Shepard </em>court indicated that a federal court may rely upon in an effort to determine the nature of the Texas offense to which Garcia previously pleaded guilty. <em>Cf. United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 591-92 (finding that New York Certificates of Disposition have sufficient indicia of reliability to act as judicial records of a defendant\u2019s offense of conviction). Therefore, we consider the indictment, judgment, and judicial confession to determine whether Garcia\u2019s offense of conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Garcia\u2019s indictment charges him with knowing and intentional delivery, to-wit: \u201cactua[l] transfer, constructive] transfer and offer to sell a controlled substance, to-wit: COCAINE, in an amount by aggregate weight, including any adulterants or dilutants, of less than 1 gram to S. HARRIS.\u201d The judgment states simply that the offense of conviction was unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. While the indictment charges facts in the conjunctive that would meet the definition of a drug trafficking offense, the indictment\u2019s conjunctive charge alone does not require that Garcia pleaded guilty to the facts in the conjunctive, since each charge individually could sustain a conviction for delivery under \u00a7 481.112. <em>See Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d at 358-360 (noting that a Texas conviction for unlawful delivery may be sustained solely upon proof of an offer to sell, even when the indictment charges further unlawful conduct in the conjunctive).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Were we confined to the indictment and judgment alone, Garcia\u2019s sentence enhancement would be improper. However, in Garcia\u2019s case, the judicial confession clears up any ambiguity presented by the indictment and judgment. In his written judicial confession, Garcia confesses that he did \u201cknowingly and intentionally deliver, to-wit, actually transfer, constructively transfer <em>and </em>offer to sell a controlled substance.\u201d (emphasis added). He also confessed that he \u201ccommitted the offense with which [he] stand[s] charged exactly as alleged in the indictment in this case.\u201d Because Garcia\u2019s confession establishes that he possessed, transferred and offered to sell a controlled substance, his prior conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under the guidelines. As a result, Garcia has not shown that the district court\u2019s enhancement constitutes error, plain or otherwise. Because we find no error, we need not reach the remaining elements in our plain error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Garcia challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1995). <em>See United States v.
