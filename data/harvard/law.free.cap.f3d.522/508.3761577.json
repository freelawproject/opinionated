Concluding that the district court correctly determined that, if Charles could prove that Grief fired him for his \u201cspeech,\u201d Charles has alleged an objectively unreasonable violation of his First Amendment rights because the speech for which he was putatively fired was entitled to constitutional protection, we affirm in part. But further concluding that we lack jurisdiction to assess whether Griefs actions were \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d because the district court determined that there is a genuine fact question as to the real reason for Charles\u2019s termination, i.e., his speech or his insubordination, we dismiss in part Griefs interlocutory appeal of the denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Charles is an African-American who, in October 2005, sent an e-mail to high-ranking Commission officials, including Grief, raising concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation against him and other minority employees of the Commission. In November 2005, after failing to receive a response, Charles re-sent that e-mail, this time directing it to members of the Texas Legislature with oversight authority over the Commission. Additionally, Charles sent a new e-mail to these same members of the legislature alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of the Texas Open Records Act, misuse of state funds, and other misconduct by Commission management. Two days later, Grief directed Charles to meet with his immediate supervisor and a human resources manager to answer questions regarding the e-mails. When those two began to question Charles about the emails, he requested that the Commission\u2019s questions be put in writing so that he could respond in writing. According to allegations by Charles, one of the representatives of the Commission agreed to do so; but later that same day, Grief appeared unannounced in Charles\u2019s office and fired him on the spot. Grief handed Charles a written statement to the effect that he was being fired for insubordination, specifically for his \u201crefusal to respond to the direct requests from [his] immediate supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">After Charles sued Grief and the Commission for employment retaliation in violation of Charles\u2019s constitutional right of free speech, Grief sought dismissal as a defendant on grounds of qualified immunity, which the district court denied, largely on the basis of a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Like the magistrate judge, the district court concluded that Charles had introduced summary judgment evidence that, when viewed in the light most favorable to him as the nonmovant, was sufficient to establish that (1) Charles\u2019s acts were protected by clearly established First Amendment law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) Griefs acts were objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AW8e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Grief timely filed a notice of appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s order that denied him qualified immunity, specifically the court\u2019s conclusion that Charles had alleged a violation of a constitutional right. In his appeal from the denial of qualified immunity, Grief insists that his firing of Charles was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d because he was responding to reports of Charles\u2019s insubordination, not to his speech. Alternatively, Grief advances that Charles\u2019s speech is not protected because (1)his e-mails are too \u201cvague, conclusory, and non-factual\u201d to involve matters of public concern, and (2) his speech was made in the context of his employment as a Commission employee, and therefore, pursuant to <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>is not protected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJHM\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqro\">\n<em>1. Appellate Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A44\">\u201cAlthough a denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is ordinarily not immediately appealable, the Supreme Court has held that the denial of a motion for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review. Our jurisdiction is significantly limited, however, for it extends to such appeals only to the extent that [the denial of summary judgment] turns on an issue of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2CO\">\u201c[0]fficials enjoy qualified immunity to the extent that their conduct is objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law. Whenever the district court denies an official\u2019s motion for summary judgment predicated upon qualified immunity, the district court can be thought of as making two distinct determinations, even if only implicitly. First, the district court decides that a certain course of conduct would, as a matter of law, be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. Second, the court decides that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendants) did, in fact, engage in such conduct. According to the Supreme Court, as well as our own precedents, we lack jurisdiction to review conclusions of the <em>second </em>type on interlocutory appeal. Stated differently, in an interlocutory appeal we cannot challenge the district court\u2019s assessments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence\u2014 that is, the question whether there is enough evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true. We do, however, have jurisdiction to review the <em>first </em>type of determination, the purely legal question whether a given course of conduct would be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZHL\">\n<em>2. Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADO\">\u201cTo determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity, the court asks (1) whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuOi\">Terminating an employee for engaging in protected speech, of which Charles accuses Grief, is an objectively unreasonable violation of such an employee\u2019s First Amendment rights. Grief, though, insists that (1) Charles did not engage in protected speech, but (2) even if he did, Griefs actions were \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d because he fired Charles, not for his speech, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>but for his \u201cinsubordination\u201d when he refused to respond to the Commission\u2019s questions unless they were put in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Whether Charles engaged in protected speech is a purely legal question over which we have appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not, however, have jurisdiction to review Griefs contention that his actions in firing Charles were \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether Griefs actions were reasonable depends on his real reason for firing Charles; and the district court determined that Charles had introduced sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to causation, <em>viz., </em>whether he was fired for (1) being insubordinate (as Grief maintains), or (2) his speech (as Charles insists).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cTo the extent that [Grief] attacks the district court\u2019s determination of the genuineness, rather than the materiality, of any dispute concerning [Charles\u2019s] factual assertions, the [appellate] court may not consider his argument at this juncture.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\n<em>S. Protected Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u201cPublic employees do not surrender all their free speech rights by reason of their employment. Rather, the First Amendment protects a public employee\u2019s right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen on matters of public concern.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cA public employee\u2019s speech is protected by the First Amendment when the interests of the worker \u2018as a citizen commenting upon matters of public concern\u2019 outweigh the interests of the state \u2018as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the services it performs through its employees.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\"><em>a. </em>Garcetti v. Ceballos</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">Before proceeding to examine the substance of Charles\u2019s speech, we must first focus on his role when he uttered it. \u201cEmphasizing the distinction between a speaker acting in her role as \u2018citizen\u2019 and her role as \u2018employee,\u2019 <em>Garcetti </em>held that the First Amendment does not protect \u2018expressions made pursuant to [the employee\u2019s] official duties.\u2019 Even if the speech is of great social importance, it is not protected by the First Amendment so long as it was made pursuant to the worker\u2019s official duties.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Stated differently, \u201cwhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">Albeit in the alternative to his primary proffered reason for firing Charles (insubordination), Grief insists that Charles\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>First Amendment claims are foreclosed by <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Williams v. Dallas Independent School </em>District<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because his speech was made in the context of his employment as a systems analyst for the Commission. Grief substantially overstates the reach of <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Williams </em>in his briefs: Charles\u2019s speech does not come within their ambits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In <em>Garcetti </em>a deputy district attorney reported to his supervisor that there were inaccuracies in an affidavit supporting a search warrant and recommended that the office refrain from prosecuting the case. The deputy alleged that he was subjected to a series of retaliatory actions in response to this intra-office speech. The Supreme Court concluded that the deputy\u2019s speech was not entitled to First Amendment protection because it was made pursuant to his official duties, specifically in fulfillment of his responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>Williams </em>requires us to determine the extent to which a public employee\u2019s speech was protected if his speech was not necessarily required by his job duties but was nevertheless related to them.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that case, an athletic director was removed from his position after he wrote memoranda to high-ranking school officials, including the principal, calling into question the school\u2019s handling of its athletic fund. We concluded that the athletic director\u2019s speech concerned the fulfillment of his daily operations, namely budgeting for various athletic department expenses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, we held that, under <em>Garcetti, </em>his speech was not entitled to First Amendment protection because it was made in the course of performing his employment responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Grief insists that <em>Garcetti </em>and its progeny control, emphasizing that (1) Charles\u2019s speech concerned \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d that he had obtained through his employment at the Commission, and (2) Charles identified himself in his e-mails as a Commission employee. Even when accepted as true, neither of these assertions is dispositive. To hold that any employee\u2019s speech is not protected merely because it concerns facts that he happened to learn while at work would severely undercut First Amendment rights. Also, it is apparent that Charles identified himself as a Commission employee solely to demonstrate the veracity of the factual allegations he was making in his e-mails to the legislators. After introducing himself as a Commission employee, Charles further emphasized the foundation for his allegations by stating that he was available to speak to the legislative officials about activities that he had \u201cwitnessed\u201d while employed. Moreover, Charles submitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>e-mails from his private e-mail address and listed his home address and phone number for his contact information, all of which further undermines the emphasis Grief tries to place on Charles\u2019s identification of himself as a Commission employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Most significantly, though, Charles\u2019s speech \u2014 unlike that of the plaintiffs in <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Williams </em>\u2014 was not made in the course of performing or fulfilling his job responsibilities, was not even indirectly related to his job, and was not made to higher-ups in his organization (as were Ceballos\u2019s and Williams\u2019s) but was communicated directly to elected representatives of the people. As a systems analyst, Charles worked in the area of Information Resources as a senior technical lead coordinating and supporting the Commission\u2019s computer network operations. He was not in a professional position of trust and confidence like those of an assistant district attorney or a sheriffs deputy. Even though his job description is not contained in the record on appeal<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and is therefore unavailable to us, we are convinced that his e-mails concerned topics far removed from the realm of \u2014 and unrelated to \u2014 any conceivable job duties. As the district court indicated, there can be no <em>Garcetti</em>like nexus between Charles\u2019s systems analyst\u2019s work and the malfeasance that he sought to expose to the cognizant public authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Moreover, the persons to whom Charles directed his e-mails further distinguishes his speech from that of the plaintiffs in <em>Garcetti </em>and <em>Williams: </em>Charles voiced his complaints <em>externally, </em>to Texas legislators who had oversight authority over the Commission, not <em>internally, </em>to supervisors. His decision to ignore the normal chain of command in identifying problems with Commission operations is a significant distinction. We conclude that Charles\u2019s speech is not left unprotected by <em>Garcet-ti </em>\u2019s genre of \u201cnon-protected\u201d speech and turn next to examine whether his speech involved matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">\n<em>b. Public Concern</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\u201cWhether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is well-established, though, that speech relating to official misconduct or racial discrimination almost always involves matters of public concern.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, Charles\u2019s e-mails plainly and clearly addressed these issues of public importance. We reject Griefs contention that Charles\u2019s post-hoc refusal to answer the Commission questions orally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>somehow rendered his allegations \u201ctoo vague\u201d to involve matters of public concern. That is simply a <em>non-sequitur </em>under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Charles\u2019s first e-mail advanced allegations of racial discrimination. Specifically, Charles alleged that he was individually being \u201ctreated in a discriminatory manner both in salary and working environment\u201d; and, on a broader scale affecting all employees, that \u201csalary, treatment, and advancement [at the Commission] are based on racial bias.\u201d His second e-mail \u2014 the only one at issue in this interlocutory appeal \u2014 focused on misconduct by Commission officials. In it, he alleged that (1) Commission management had violated the Texas Open Records Act by inflating the cost to obtain information; (2) Commission meetings were held in which the main topic of discussion concerned how to block public access to Commission information; (3) the Commission had misused state funds allocated to the Lottery Disaster Recovery site, the agency\u2019s computer records recovery system which remained nonoperational; and (4) the Commission had taken steps to conceal this misuse of public funds. Moreover, Charles directed his speech to legislative officials with oversight authority over the Commission, i.e., elected officials external to the Commission who were in a position of authority to address the concerns raised.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject Griefs contention that Charles\u2019s speech fails to meet the second requirement of a First Amendment retaliation claim: His speech obviously involved matters of public concern and did so with an abundance of specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">c. Pickering <em>Balancing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Grief, by his express declaration, limits his challenge for purposes of this qualified immunity appeal to the second prong of Charles\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim, insisting only that Charles\u2019s speech was of a private quality, rather than of a public one. Therefore, to the extent that he might have analyzed the <em>Pickering v. Board of Education </em>balancing test<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and urged that the Commission\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency in the workplace outweighs Charles\u2019s interest in commenting on matters of public concern, this argument is waived and foreclosed on appeal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>III. AD HOMINEM</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">Although we agree on rehearing that we are not without jurisdiction over all aspects of Griefs appeal, we note that the key issue before'us \u2014 the one emphasized by both the district court in its denial of qualified immunity and by Grief on appeal \u2014 is causation, i.e., Griefs true reason for firing Charles. Grief insists that his actions were objectively reasonable because he fired Charles, not for his speech, but for his insubordination. The district court, however, clearly ruled that Charles produced sufficient evidence to show that there existed a genuine issue, of material fact on the issue of causation, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>the close proximity of time between Charles\u2019s protected speech and his termination. Our precedent is clear that we lack jurisdiction over such appeals of fact-based denials of qualified immunity,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and we trust that counsel will in future interlocutory appeals make sure to challenge only those rulings involving questions of law and not waste valuable resources appealing those determinations over which we clearly lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">With respect to Griefs contention that his actions in terminating Charles were objectively reasonable, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction: Whether Griefs actions were reasonable turns on causation, i.e., the real reason why Charles was fired\u2014 blowing the whistle or insubordination\u2014 about which the district court concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact. With respect to the district court\u2019s holding that Charles did allege an objectively unreasonable violation of his constitutional rights by Grief, we affirm. Because (1) <em>Garcetti </em>does not apply, (2) Charles\u2019s speech involved matters of public concern, and (3) on appeal Grief has waived or abandoned the issue of the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test, Charles\u2019s speech is entitled to First Amendment protection <em>if </em>on remand Grief is found to have fired Charles for that speech, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">In conclusion, we reiterate that we are without jurisdiction to review causation. On remand, though, because we have concluded that Charles\u2019s speech was protected, the trier of fact\u2019s determination whether his firing was motivated by his emails or by his insubordination will dictate whether he is entitled to recover on his First Amendment retaliation claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part for lack of appellate jurisdiction; REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> This panel granted rehearing and withdrew the opinion filed November 6, 2007, for which this opinion is now substituted. <em>Charles v.

His amended complaint, though, was filed after the district court denied Grief's motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Charles's 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 employment retaliation suit; therefore, this appeal is necessarily limited to Charles's First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">.

The <em>Pickering </em>balance concerns the \"balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">. We note, though, that Grief\u2019s abandonment of this argument does not work to his disadvantage, as the <em>Pickering </em>prong of Charles's First Amendment retaliation claim is one on which Charles surely would prevail. Charles presents a substantial First Amendment interest, as his speech was indisputably made in an effort to prompt an investigation into important matters of public concern: namely, misuse of public funds, official misconduct, racial discrimination, and breach of the public trust. Furthermore, we are hard-pressed to imagine how concern over the efficient operation of the Commission might override such a weighty interest. Charles\u2019s speech concerned matters wholly unrelated to his responsibilities as a systems analyst, and was directed externally to legislative officials instead of to other Commission employees or supervisors. There is no evidence in the record, nor even any suggestion, that his speech negatively affected his or others\u2019 working relationships or otherwise disrupted the workplace. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. County of Comal, </em>400 F.3d 284, 290 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cUnder the Supreme Court's <em>Pickering </em>test, the court is required to look at whether the speech (1) was likely to generate controversy and disruption, (2) impeded the department\u2019s general performance and operation, and (3) affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>working relationships necessary to the department\u2019s proper functioning.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Connelly v.

In assessing causation on remand, the district court should remain mindful that this court has made clear that \"First Amendment retaliation claims are governed by the <em>Mt.

Accordingly, we do not address this potential defense at this time. <em>See Connelly, </em>484 F.3d at 346 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
