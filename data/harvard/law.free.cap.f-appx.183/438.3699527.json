They argue that the IJ erroneously determined that Leonard Vaso\u2019s asylum application was untimely, and they contend that he was entitled to withholding of removal and relief under the CAT because he has been persecuted in Albania on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-24\">Because the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s determination that the asylum application was untimely, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum. <em>Cf. Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 528 (5th Cir.2004)(in which the BIA did not indicate whether it was affirming the timeliness decision, the merits decision, or both). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The record reveals that Leonard Vaso was subject to harassment that does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s determination affirming the denial of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
