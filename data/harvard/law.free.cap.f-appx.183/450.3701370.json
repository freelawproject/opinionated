Reviewing the record for substantial evidence, we deny the petition because substantial evidence supports the finding that Gomez was engaged in construction-related rooftop activities without fall protection. Williams relies on the exception to the fall protection requirement provided in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.500(a)(1) for employees engaged in inspection, investigation or assessment of workplace conditions prior to the actual start of construction work. When a standard contains an exception to its general requirement, the burden of proving that the exception applies lies with the party claiming the benefit of the exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams introduced no witnesses and adduced no testimony to support its contention that Gomez was engaged in pre-work inspection and fall anchor installation at the time the inspection occurred. Other than the assertions of Williams\u2019s counsel and remarks of one compliance officer as to what Gomez claimed to be doing, there is nothing in the record to establish that Gomez was engaged in exempted activities while on the roof without fall protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
