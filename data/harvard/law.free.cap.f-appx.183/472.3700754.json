The district court concluded that it lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>jurisdiction to entertain the motion. Hall was granted a Certif\u00edcate of Appealability solely on the issue whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We held in <em>United States v. Johnston, 258 </em>F.3d 361, 366-72 (5th Cir.2001), that the consensual delegation of a \u00a7 2255 motion to a magistrate judge violates Article III. Thus, Hall\u2019s motion seeking to vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s orders pursuant to <em>Johnston </em>effectively sought relief via Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). <em>See Jackson v. FIE Corp., </em>302 F.3d 515, 522-23 (5th Cir.2002). A district court has no discretion to deny a Rule 60(b)(4) motion if the challenged judgment was void, and there is no time limit on such a motion. <em>See Jackson, </em>302 F.3d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">However, we conclude that relief is not available to Hall. A district court\u2019s erroneous exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is res judicata and is not subject to collateral attack by way of a Rule 60(b)(4) motion if the party seeking to void the judgment had the opportunity to do so on direct review of the court\u2019s determination. <em>See Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 376, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940); <em>Picco v. Global Marine Drilling Co., </em>900 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.1990). Hall failed to challenge the exercise of jurisdiction by appealing that issue at the time. He may not do so now collaterally. <em>See Callon Petroleum Co. v. Frontier Ins. Co., </em>351 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Given that the jurisdictional question was not evident or settled prior to <em>Johnston, </em>this case does not involve a clear usurpation of power or total want of jurisdiction that would warrant Rule 60(b)(4) relief. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Tittjung, </em>235 F.3d 330, 335 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Considering the foregoing, the district court\u2019s order denying Hall\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
