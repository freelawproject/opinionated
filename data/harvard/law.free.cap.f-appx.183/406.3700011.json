Robinson contends: the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his action; and its exhaustion determination was erroneous because it was based on a faulty administrative record and because he exhausted his remedies when he filed grievances that were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-25\">\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>istrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). A dismissal for want of exhaustion under \u00a7 1997e is based on the pleadings alone, and no evidence concerning exhaustion need be adduced. <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1133, 119 S.Ct. 1809, 143 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1999). Section 1997e\u2019s exhaustion requirement should be enforced unless a valid defense exists. <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 890-91 (5th Cir.1998). A dismissal under \u00a7 1997e is reviewed <em>de novo. Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Robinson\u2019s contentions lack merit. The district court did not err in <em>sua sponte </em>raising the exhaustion issue. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e; <em>see also Wendell, </em>162 F.3d at 889. Robinson\u2019s administrative-record contention lacks merit because the district court proceeded on the belief that Robinson had filed the documents claimed to have been filed. Finally, Robinson has not established that the district court\u2019s determination that his action should be dismissed for want of exhaustion was flawed. As the district court determined, Robinson\u2019s allegations that he properly exhausted his administrative remedies fail because his own pleadings demonstrate he failed to exhaust all available remedies. <em>See Underwood, </em>151 F.3d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
