In response, managers persistently interviewed all of the aides to identify who spearheaded these efforts, then fired one of the lead aides and demoted another one. The National Labor Relations Board determined that Sunrise committed unfair labor practices in violation of section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), by coercively interrogating the aides and by improperly taking action against the lead aides for engaging in activity protected under section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. The Board\u2019s remedial order required Sunrise, among other things, to reinstate the fired aide with full back pay. Sunrise petitions this court for review, seeking to overturn the Board\u2019s decision and order, and the Board cross-petitions for enforcement. Concluding that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision and order and that its remedy was not arbitrary and capricious, we deny Sunrise\u2019s petition and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">Sunrise is a Delaware corporation with principal offices in McLean, Virginia. The company operates nearly 370 senior living facilities in the United States, including the 68-resident assisted living facility in Parma, Ohio, where this case arose. The Parma facility\u2019s residents depend in varying degrees on the care aides for help with the basic routines of life (for example, dressing, bathing, and use of the toilet). The aides, including the designated lead care aides, are not professional nurses. They are not represented by a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Susan Johnson became executive director of the Parma facility on March 1, 2004. At a meeting that week she informed the care aides that a former resident who was scheduled to return to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>facility would need assistance with handling her colostomy bag. Rosie Howard, a supervisor of the care aides, expressed concern that the aides would object to being assigned to the colostomy bag emptying routine. On March 9 three lead care aides \u2014 Samantha Reyes, Coty Smith, and another employee \u2014 met with Johnson to present her with a petition. Signed by 24 aides, the petition declared, \u201c[W]e have talked among each other and have all agreed that we are unwilling to accept responsibility for any colostomy care. We do more than our share of work here.\u201d J.A. 936. The petition asserted that the care aides faced a long list of regular responsibilities and that the aides \u201care subjected to verbal abuse by angered family members, and were disrespected by the management team.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petition concluded: \u201cWe as a group have all reached our limit in additional job assignments and hope this situation is addressed without further action needed.\u201d J.A. 936-37. After receiving the petition, Johnson asked the lead aides to identify the author of the document, but received no response. She later discussed the petition with higher Sunrise executives. They decided that Johnson would meet with the care aides in small groups to further investigate the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">That same day (March 9), in Howard\u2019s office and within her earshot, Reyes suggested that the care aides plan a work stoppage on March 11. Smith discussed the work stoppage with care aide Cynthia Boldan, who said she would not participate. Also that day, Johnson asked Howard what she knew about the petition and its authorship; Johnson raised her voice in disbelief when Howard professed no knowledge. On March 10 Reyes told care aides Tania Kaufman, Lisa Dousa, and Olexandra Chepak that there would be a work stoppage the next day and that if they did not participate, they would be on duty by themselves. They said they would not take part. (Later, at the unfair labor practice hearing before the administrative law judge, Reyes repeatedly denied under oath that she discussed a work stoppage, but after Sunrise presented numerous contradicting witnesses, the ALJ found that Reyes\u2019s denials were not credible.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Also on March 10 Johnson, accompanied by Sunrise executives Linda Olsavsky and Natalie Antosh, conducted interviews with the care aides in groups of three to five aimed at determining the petition\u2019s authors. One of the aides, Lisa Dousa, named Reyes and Smith as the authors. After the interviews Johnson learned of the work stoppage being discussed for the next day, so she called her supervisors and arranged for employees from other Cleveland-area Sunrise facilities to cover for the absent workers. Every care aide showed up for work on March 11. There was no strike. That morning, after Johnson called Smith to tell her to come in early, Smith called Dousa and asked her why Dousa had identified the petition authors. Dousa later told management about Smith\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">On March 11 Johnson (joined at times by Antosh and Olsavsky) interviewed many of the care aides individually in her office, asking about the petition and the work stoppage. Several of the aides told Johnson that Reyes had discussed the strike with them. In her interview with Boldan, Johnson expressed disapproval of the petition, saying that the aides could have brought their grievances to her informally rather than committing them to writing. During the interviews at least two of the aides felt afraid of losing their jobs, while another came to regret signing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Johnson later placed Reyes, Smith, and Howard on paid administrative leave pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ing an investigation. On March 16 Sunrise demoted Smith to care aide, although it continued to pay her as a lead care aide. Sunrise fired Reyes. (On March 19 the company also fired Howard, but the ALJ determined that Howard\u2019s discharge was not an unfair labor practice, and her claim is not presented in this appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Howard and the United Food <em>&amp; </em>Commercial Workers Union Local 880 filed charges with the Board over Sunrise\u2019s conduct. The Board\u2019s General Counsel issued an administrative complaint alleging that Sunrise engaged in unfair labor practices violating the Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). The ALJ heard testimony during the unfair labor practice hearing in September and October 2004. The ALJ ruled for the General Counsel in March 2005, and Sunrise filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In July 2005 the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s findings that Sunrise engaged in three unfair labor practices under section 8(a)(1) of the Act (1) when it fired Reyes and (2) demoted Smith (both of whom the Board concluded were engaged in protected activity under the Act in organizing the petition and the threatened strike), and (3) when Sunrise coercively interrogated the care aides in the interviews on March 10 and 11, 2004. To remedy these unfair labor practices, the Board entered a cease- and-desist order. It declined to require Sunrise to restore Smith to her earlier position because she voluntarily resigned two months after her demotion. The Board concluded that the proper remedy for Sunrise\u2019s violation as to Reyes was to reinstate her and award her full back pay, even though the ALJ discredited Reyes\u2019s testimony that she never advocated a strike. 344 N.L.R.B. No. 151, 2005 WL 1827778 (July 29, 2005), slip op. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Sunrise, which \u201ctransacts business\u201d within this circuit pursuant to the Act\u2019s venue rule, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f), petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision and order. Sunrise contends that the Board erred in concluding that Sunrise committed an unfair labor practice (1) by firing Reyes and ordering her reinstated with full back pay, even though the ALJ discredited her in part; (2) by demoting Smith, despite Sunrise\u2019s articulation of valid reasons unrelated to protected activity; and (3) by interviewing the aides in groups and individually, which Sunrise contends did not amount to coercive interrogation. The Board\u2019s cross-petition seeks enforcement of its decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Section 7 of the Act provides that employees \u201chave the right to self-organization ... and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of ... mutual aid or protection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. These rights are secured by section 8(a)(1), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in\u201d section 7. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). \u201cThe scope of our inquiry in reviewing the Board is limited.\u201d <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, Inc., v. NLRB, </em>142 F.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir.1998). We uphold the Board\u2019s factual findings if, considering the whole record, they are supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>TNT Logistics of N. Am., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>413 F.3d 402, 405 (4th Cir.2005). In reviewing questions of law, we defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act \u201cso long as its reading is a reasonable one.\u201d <em>RGC (USA) Mineral Sands Inc., v. NLRB, </em>281 F.3d 442, 448 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Holly Farms Corp. v. NLRB, </em>517 U.S. 392, 409, 116 S.Ct. 1396, 134 L.Ed.2d 593 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Sunrise first claims (a) that the Board erroneously determined that Sunrise\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>duct toward Reyes was an unfair labor practice, and (b) that even if this conduct was an unfair labor practice, the Board\u2019s remedy was improper in that it failed to sanction Reyes in any way for her discredited testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">An employer violates section 8(a)(1) when \u201c(1) [its] ... action can be reasonably viewed as tending to interfere with, coerce, or deter (2) the exercise of protected activity, and (3) the employer fails to justify the action with a substantial and legitimate business reason that outweighs the employee\u2019s [section] 7 rights.\u201d <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 745. Sunrise advances two arguments in contending that it did not violate section 8(a)(1) in firing Reyes: (1) she improperly pressured the aides in organizing the work stoppage and thereby lost the section 7 shield, and (2) Sunrise had a valid business justification for its action because if it had not responded decisively to the threatened strike, it would have risked violating a state statute safeguarding the health of the facility\u2019s residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Reyes and Smith drafted a petition concerning their conditions of employment and advocated (but did not bring about) a day-long strike at the Parma facility. These activities are ordinarily concerted activities under section 7 because they constitute exercises of statutory rights such as \u201cself-organization\u201d and \u201cmutual protection.\u201d In contrast, an employee\u2019s circulation of a petition to remove a supervisor for personal reasons is not concerted activity protected by the statute. <em>Joanna Cotton Mills Co. v. NLRB, </em>176 F.2d 749, 753 (4th Cir.1949). Sunrise contends that Reyes\u2019s motivation was to prevent her mother (one of the facility\u2019s aides) from having to take responsibility for the returning resident\u2019s colostomy care. The bare existence of such a motive, however, does not affect the analysis because the petition and the threatened stoppage were predominantly directed at challenging collective work conditions. What matters is the activity\u2019s purpose, not a participating employee\u2019s motive. <em>TNT Logistics, </em>413 F.3d at 407 (quoting <em>id.); see also Five-CAP, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>294 F.3d 768, 783 (6th Cir.2002) (circulation of a petition \u201cseeking] the amelioration of work-related conditions\u201d is protected activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">How the activity is earned out also matters. In <em>NLRB v. Washington Aluminum, Co., </em>370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1962), the Supreme Court identified \u201cnormal categories of unprotected concerted activities such as those that are unlawful, violent, or in breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 82 S.Ct. 1099. The Court also characterized as unprotected those concerted activities that are \u201cindefensible because they ... show a disloyalty to the workers\u2019 employer\u201d to a degree beyond that needed to pursue valid section 7 objectives. <em>Id. </em>We have understood this language to mean that section 7 does not shield employees whose \u201cconduct is so egregious as to take it outside the protection of the Act, or of such a character as to render [employees] ... unfit for further service.\u201d <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>338 F.3d 267, 280 (4th Cir.2003) (punctuation omitted). Such \u201cegregious\u201d conduct would include, for example, \u201cthreatening to kill a supervisor\u201d or \u201cstealing from an employer.\u201d <em>Cf. Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>535 U.S. 137, 146, 122 S.Ct. 1275, 152 L.Ed.2d 271 (2002) (giving these as examples of \u201cserious [employee] misconduct\u201d that courts have held to preclude those employees from being reinstated under the Board\u2019s remedial orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Sunrise argues that when Reyes told the care aides about the planned March 11 work stoppage, she abused her authority and impermissibly pressured them to participate, thereby surrendering section 7 protection under <em>Washington Aluminum. </em>Substantial evidence, however, supports the Board\u2019s contrary determination. Chepak recalled that Reyes said to her on March 10, 2004, \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t come in tomorrow morning\u201d and that Chepak should telephone other aides to tell them not to come in either. J.A. 509H. Yet neither Chepak\u2019s account nor anyone else\u2019s shows that Reyes threatened to punish any aide who did not participate in the work stoppage. Kaufman, another aide, described Reyes as \u201clike, basically, kind of pressuring us into calling ... off along with others,\u201d J.A. 480, but Kaufman hedged her characterization with qualifiers (\u201clike ... kind of\u2019). Her description of Reyes\u2019s \u201cpressuring\u201d was not tantamount to evidence that Reyes engaged in an act that was so egregious as to remove the section 7 shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion that section 7 protected the actions of Reyes and Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">When an employer disciplines an employee by changing employment conditions and terms in response to the employee\u2019s protected activities, the employer \u201cnecessarily coerces the employee from engaging in protected activities.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Air Contact Transport Inc., </em>403 F.3d 206, 213 (4th Cir.2005). Such coercion violates section 8(a)(1) if the employer does not demonstrate it had a \u201csubstantial and legitimate business reason\u201d for its conduct that outweighs the employee\u2019s rights. <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Sunrise\u2019s challenge draws on language from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hoffman Plastic, </em>where the Court refused to allow the Board to award back pay to illegal alien employees to remedy the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices because federal immigration law expressly prohibited employing aliens not lawfully in (or authorized to work in) the United States. <em>Hoffman Plastic, </em>535 U.S. at 147-49, 122 S.Ct. 1275. The Court concluded that the Board\u2019s \u201cremedy may be required to yield\u201d when that remedy \u201ctrenches upon a federal statute or policy outside the Board\u2019s competence to administer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 122 S.Ct. 1275. From this starting point Sunrise argues that the Board erred in failing to acquiesce to Sunrise\u2019s need to comply with state health care law. In essence, Sunrise characterizes the state legal requirements as a \u201csubstantial and legitimate business reason\u201d for its conduct toward Reyes and the other aides. The Board\u2019s failure to validate the state law requirements, in Sunrise\u2019s view, \u201ctrenches upon\u201d the state regulatory scheme, as <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>used that phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In particular, Sunrise points to its obligations to the Parma facility\u2019s residents under Ohio\u2019s \u201cresidents\u2019 rights\u201d statute, section 3721.13 of the Ohio Revised Code. That statute secures a nursing home resident\u2019s rights, among others, \u201cto a safe and clean living environment,\u201d Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 3721.13(A)(1), and \u201cto have all reasonable requests and inquiries responded to promptly,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3721.13(A)(4). Supporting this argument was Sunrise\u2019s expert witness, Kurt Haas, who testified that state regulators hold facilities such as the one at Parma to the statutory standard for nursing homes. Haas further testified that regulators would expect a facility whose workers threatened a strike to take \u201ccorrective action, preventative measures that were commensurate with the infraction\u201d against the strike, to prevent \u201cabuse and neglect\u201d of the facility\u2019s residents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>J.A. 532. Haas also surmised that a facility that tolerated an employee strike would be \u201cin harm[\u2019]s way\u201d regarding its state certification, without which it could not continue to operate. J.A. 550. On cross-examination, however, Haas could not point to any state law or regulation that would compel a facility to fire employees who planned a one-day work stoppage. He also knew of no case in which a facility actually lost its state license because workers \u201ctalked about\u201d such a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We do not dispute Sunrise\u2019s claim that as an operator of a state-licensed assisted living facility the company has significant duties to its residents under Ohio\u2019s health care statute. Sunrise simply failed, however, to prove that its duties under the Ohio statute directly collided with its section 8(a)(1) obligation to refrain from unfair labor practices. The Act protected Reyes in preparing the petition and planning the work stoppage, and as Haas\u2019s answers on cross-examination revealed, no Ohio law compelled Sunrise to fire Reyes for these actions. Haas\u2019s mere speculation that the Parma facility could have lost its state license if it did not fire Reyes and take other measures to respond to the threatened strike is inadequate to support Sunrise\u2019s claim. The Board\u2019s determination to this effect was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>Hoffman Plastic </em>moreover does not extend as far as Sunrise would take it. The Supreme Court held in that case that the Board\u2019s remedial order could not be permitted to undermine the express terms of a federal immigration statute. Here, there is simply no federal statute upon which the Board\u2019s decision \u201ctrenched,\u201d and nothing in <em>Hoffman Plastic </em>subordinated the Board\u2019s determinations under the Act to the sort of vague generalizations about the principles of state law that Sunrise presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Sunrise\u2019s arguments thus fall short of establishing that the Board erred. Striking \u201cthe proper balance between the asserted business justifications and the inyasion of employee rights in light of the Act and its policy\u201d is a task that is \u201cthe primary responsibility of the Board and not the courts.\u201d <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 745 (punctuation omitted). Accordingly, we cannot set aside the Board\u2019s conclusion that Sunrise lacked a \u201csubstantial and legitimate business reason\u201d for firing Reyes that trumped her rights under the Act and that her discharge contravened section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The ALJ stated that he \u201cfound Reyes a less than fully credible witness based on her demeanor and testimony,\u201d which was \u201ccontradicted by multiple witnesses, including Smith who, like Reyes, testified on behalf of the General Counsel.\u201d J.A. 937 n. 6. If Reyes had testified honestly about the discussions, the proceeding would have been somewhat shorter because Sunrise would not have called as many care aides to rebut Reyes\u2019s testimony. The Board recognized that the ALJ \u201cdiscredited portions of [Reyes\u2019s] testimony,\u201d but stated that \u201cthere is no evidence that [Reyes] engaged in deliberate and malicious misconduct that abused and undermined the integrity of the Board\u2019s processes.\u201d J.A. 933. The Board ordered Reyes reinstated with full back pay. Reyes benefitted from this remedy even though \u2014 having taken an oath to testify truthfully before the ALJ \u2014 she violated that oath when she denied discussing a strike with care aides.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Sunrise acknowledges that under <em>ABF Freight System, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>510 U.S. 317, 114 S.Ct. 835, 127 L.Ed.2d 152 (1994), the Board has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in selecting remedies, even those that benefit em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ployees whose inexcusable false testimony risks compromising the integrity of administrative proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 114 S.Ct. 835. Sunrise nevertheless attacks the Board\u2019s remedy here based on a recent case, <em>Toll Manufacturing Co., </em>341 N.L.R.B. No. 115, 2004 WL 1038162 (May 4, 2004). There, the Board cut off an employee\u2019s backpay as of the date he first lied under oath before an ALJ. The Board ruled that the employee had \u201cabused the Board\u2019s processes for his own benefit, that his transgressions were repeated, and that his testimony was generally untrustworthy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip. op. at 5. Sunrise contends, however, that <em>Toll Manufacturing </em>and the Board\u2019s remedial order are so inconsistent that the Board has exceeded its \u201cbroad [remedial] discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Sunrise expresses legitimate concern about Reyes\u2019s discredited testimony. Untruthful testimony in any form, whether at an unfair labor practice hearing or a trial in any court, is of grave concern. We neither \u201creward nor condone ... a flagrant affront to the truth-seeking function of adversary proceedings.\u201d <em>ABF Freight, </em>510 U.S. at 323, 114 S.Ct. 835 (punctuation omitted). Yet when the Board has concluded that the objectives of the National Labor Relations Act are best served by awarding relief to an employee who did not testify truthfully in all respects, the Supreme Court has cautioned generalist judges not to casually second guess that expert determination. \u201c[C]ourts must give the agency\u2019s decision controlling weight unless it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 114 S.Ct. 835 (quoting <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). The source of this rule is Congress\u2019s express delegation to the Board, not the courts, of the power to ascertain remedies for unfair labor practices. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c); <em>ABF, </em>510 U.S. at 324, 114 S.Ct. 835. Put another way, to set aside the Board\u2019s remedial order we would have to conclude that \u201cthe order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 540, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943); <em>ABF, </em>510 U.S. at 324 n. 10, 114 S.Ct. 835 (quoting <em>id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Sunrise fails to show that the Board\u2019s remedy was arbitrary and capricious. The Board\u2019s remedial order was not an unexplained deviation from the Board\u2019s determination in <em>Toll Manufacturing. </em>Rather, the Board reasonably distinguished that case. <em>Toll Manufacturing </em>involved an employee who after his discharge claimed he should not have been fired for failing to notify his employer on two days that he would not be at work. The employee testified at an initial unfair labor practice hearing that he gave proper notice by calling his employer from home on those days, and the ALJ specifically credited that testimony. In fact, the employee went to work for another employer on those days, but he repeated his lies in an affidavit, in a subsequent deposition, and finally at a second hearing that the Board ordered to examine the discrepancies in the record created by the employee\u2019s previous lies. <em>Toll Mfg. Co., </em>slip. op. at 1, 5. Here, by contrast, the ALJ determined at the hearing that Reyes\u2019s testimony about discussing the work stoppage was not credible; the discredited testimony (unlike the credited testimony in <em>Toll </em>Manufacturing) did not go on to contaminate the ALJ\u2019s decision or subsequent Board proceedings. Thus the Board\u2019s conclusion that Reyes\u2019s discredited testimony did not amount to a malicious abuse of the Board\u2019s processes was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Reyes\u2019s discredited testimony is troubling and must be condemned. <em>ABF </em>coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>seis us, however, to conclude that the Board\u2019s chosen remedy fell within its \u201cbroad discretion.\u201d The remedy must therefore be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Sunrise next claims that its demotion of Smith was not an unfair labor practice. The company contends that it would have disciplined Smith even if she had not engaged in activity protected under section 7 and that the Board\u2019s contrary determination was erroneous. The Board applied the burden-shifting framework of <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. 1083, 1980 WL 12312 (1980), <em>enforced, </em>662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981), to determine whether Sunrise\u2019s action constituted discrimination against Smith based on her protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Under this familiar framework, the General Counsel must first present a prima facie case that the employer\u2019s disciplinary decision was motivated by the protected activity. \u201cTo make out a prima facie case, the General Counsel must show (1) that the employee was engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer was aware of the activity, and (3) that the activity was a substantial or motivating reason for the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>FPC Holdings, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>64 F.3d 935, 942 (4th Cir.1995). If the General Counsel makes such a showing, \u201cthe employer may still escape liability by presenting the affirmative defense that the discriminatory motivation, though illicit, was harmless.\u201d <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, </em>142 F.3d at 742. To demonstrate harmlessness, the employer must establish that it would have taken the same action against the employee for legitimate reasons. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the Board believes the employer\u2019s stated lawful reasons are non-existent or pretextual, the employer\u2019s defense fails.\u201d <em>Air Contact, </em>403 F.3d at 215 (punctuation omitted). The Board\u2019s determination regarding an employer\u2019s motive is a factual one, <em>NLRB v. Hale Container Line, Inc., </em>943 F.2d 394, 398 (4th Cir.1991), so we must uphold such a determination if it is supported by substantial evidence, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), which is tantamount to asking \u201cwhether on this record it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to reach the Board\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>522 U.S. 359, 366-67, 118 S.Ct. 818, 139 L.Ed. 2d 797 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Sunrise concedes that the General Counsel proved by a preponderance that a discriminatory motive was a substantial or motivating factor for Smith\u2019s demotion and thus established a prima facie case. Sunrise proceeds to challenge the Board\u2019s rejection of its defense. The company asserts two lawful reasons for demoting Smith. First, it alleges that Smith improperly harassed Dousa when, after learning from other aides that Dousa had revealed to management that Smith and Reyes had drafted the petition, Smith called her to complain. Second, the company alleges that Smith had a prior history of breaking work rules that warranted discipline. Several times she left the facility while \u201con the clock,\u201d and she was once accused of not helping all the residents shower. J.A. 781-83, 839-43. The ALJ concluded that the company\u2019s asserted reasons were pretextual, and the Board adopted all of the ALJ\u2019s findings with one narrow exception: the Board did not endorse the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Smith\u2019s telephone call to Dousa could be considered as part and parcel of Smith\u2019s protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The Board\u2019s conclusion was the same that a reasonable jury could have reached from the evidence presented. First, although Dousa testified that Smith used harsh language in the telephone call and that Dousa was intimidated as a result, there was no evidence that Dousa suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>anything more than hurt feelings. For example, Smith never used profanities or made any threats during the telephone call. Also, if the harassment had been a valid reason for the company\u2019s action, Sunrise would have reasonably been expected to follow its own standard procedures before disciplining Smith. Instead the company disciplined Smith without obtaining her \u201cversion of events,\u201d Rep. Br. at 10, which was inconsistent with Sunrise\u2019s established internal investigations policy. According to that policy, the final step in an investigation is to record the target\u2019s account of the events at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Second, Sunrise, which bore the burden of proof on its defense, did not present substantial evidence that it demoted Smith for her prior violations of Sunrise rules. The company never told her that previous misconduct drove the demotion. In addition, more than a year elapsed between the last prior transgression and Smith\u2019s demotion, reducing the likelihood that the previous misconduct had any causal relationship to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Thus, we affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion that Sunrise\u2019s demotion of Smith was an unfair labor practice contravening section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Sunrise\u2019s final claim is that its group and individual interviews of the aides did not amount to an unfair labor practice because the company did not coercively interrogate the employees. Ordinary questioning of employees about protected concerted activity is not an unfair labor practice, but coercive questioning is, and like the Board we consider the totality of the circumstances to tell the difference. <em>NLRB v. Nueva Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>761 F.2d 961, 965-66, 966 n. 5 (4th Cir.1985). The relevant circumstances may include \u201cthe nature of information sought, the identity of the questioner, and the place and method of the questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 966. The Board assesses the circumstances in the first instance, and we affirm the Board\u2019s finding on coerciveness if it is supported by substantial evidence. When the finding rests on credibility determinations, we accept those determinations where there is no showing of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d (namely that the determinations contradict other findings, or are unreasonable, or are supported by little to no reasoning). <em>NLRB v. CWI of Maryland, Inc., </em>127 F.3d 319, 326 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Sunrise strives to distinguish the March 10 group interviews from the March 11 individual interviews. The company contends that the ALJ should have credited the testimony of managers Johnson and Olsavsky that they began the group interviews with introductory remarks assuring the aides there would be no reprisals against them for participating in the petition. The ALJ\u2019s decision contains no specific credibility determination regarding Olsavsky, and Sunrise emphasizes that Amber Hines, the one care aide who testified to the specifics of the group meeting she attended, could not remember how the meeting began. The company acknowledges Hines\u2019s testimony that the interviewers at no time promised there would be \u201cno retaliation ... taken against anyone for sitting in the room\u201d and answering questions. J.A. 330. Nevertheless, Sunrise maintains that the ALJ erred in concluding that Johnson and the others never assured the aides against reprisal. Specifically, Sunrise argues that Hines was biased by other conflicts with Sunrise personnel, her recollection was not complete, and Olsavsky provided evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Sunrise\u2019s claim faces several insurmountable obstacles. First, Hines\u2019s partial recollection was enough to permit the</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>ALJ to infer that the interviewers did not assure the aides that there would be no reprisal. Sunrise has not shown any of the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that would warrant our overturning the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit Hines instead of Johnson, and while a ruling on Olsavsky\u2019s credibility might have made the ALJ\u2019s reasoning complete, the absence of such a ruling is not grounds for reversal. Second, Sunrise places more weight on assurances against reprisal than they can bear. Such assurances, even if given, do not by themselves remove the sting of unfairness from otherwise coercive interrogation. <em>Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Carpet Yarn Div., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>691 F.2d 1138, 1141 n. 8 (4th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co., </em>146 N.L.R.B. 770, 775, 1964 WL 15910 (1964)). Third, even if Johnson and her colleagues <em>believed </em>they were not coercing the aides during the group interviews, the Board would not be precluded from finding that the interviews contravened section 8(a)(1). \u201c[N]o proof of coercive intent or effect is necessary!,] the test being whether the employer engaged in conduct, which, it may reasonably be said, tends to interfere with the free exercise of employee rights under the Act.\u201d <em>Brandeis Mach. &amp; Supply Co. v. NLRB, </em>412 F.3d 822, 830 (7th Cir.2005) (punctuation omitted). Also, we note that the General Counsel\u2019s complaint focused on the March 11 individual interviews, and nothing in the Board\u2019s remedial order differentiated between the group interviews and the individual ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">From the totality of the circumstances surrounding Sunrise\u2019s interviews of the aides on March 10 and 11, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding of an unfair labor practice. In the interviews Johnson and the other executives sought information concerning the petition and the planned work stoppage, two protected activities under the Act. Johnson made her disapproval of the activities clear in the interviews. The identity of the questioners also weighed in favor of the coercion finding. Johnson was the Parma facility\u2019s new executive director, Olsavsky was Sunrise\u2019s regional registered nurse, and Antosh was the executive director of the company\u2019s facility in Rocky River, Ohio. All three had oversight responsibility, while the interview subjects were all low-level care aides. Finally, the method of questioning was insistent. Johnson asked about the identity of the petition\u2019s authors not just once, but several times. The questioning also exacerbated rather than alleviated the aides\u2019 fear of being fired for signing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">There was, in sum, substantial evidence before the ALJ and the Board that <em>both </em>the group and individual interviews were coercive. We therefore leave undisturbed the Board\u2019s conclusion that Sunrise violated section 8(a)(1) by coercively interrogating its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The Board\u2019s determinations that Sunrise committed unfair labor practices by coercively interrogating the aides, firing Reyes, and demoting Smith are supported by substantial evidence. In addition, the Board\u2019s choice of remedy was not arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, we deny Sunrise\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; CROSS-PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
