We dismiss their petition as it relates to the removal order, and deny their petition as it relates to the motion to reconsider or motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">A. <em>Removal order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-20\">Subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed de novo. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-21\">The BIA\u2019s final order of removal in this case was issued when the BIA dismissed the Petitioners\u2019 appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s order of removal. Although Petitioners filed a timely motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review. Because the Petitioners filed their petition for review more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s removal order, we lack jurisdiction to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>view that order and dismiss their petition as to the removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">B. <em>Motion to reopen or reconsider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The petition for review was timely with respect to the BIA\u2019s order denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen or reconsider, and we have jurisdiction to review that order. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (motion to reopen); <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (motion to reconsider).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion to reopen shall state \u201cnew facts\u201d that would be proven at a new hearing, but \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because they failed to specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s decision. Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. First, the proffered new evidence, an affidavit from a law school professor, was not previously unavailable. Additionally, the affidavit was not material and would not have changed the results in the case because it did not address the IJ\u2019s findings that Velasquez\u2019s testimony and asylum application were inconsistent and vague. The affidavit merely summarized conditions in Colombia and provided no details regarding the Petitioners\u2019 specific claims. In fact, the professor acknowledged that he could not verify the truth of the Petitioners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Accordingly, the Petitioners\u2019 petition for review of the BIA\u2019s removal order is dismissed, and their petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying their motion to reopen or reconsider is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
