After review, we affirm Velasquez\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In February 2005, a United States Coast Guard helicopter spotted and eventually disabled the engine of a forty-foot \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat in international waters near Colombia. Upon boarding, the Coast Guard discovered 55 bales of cocaine in the boat\u2019s hold, with each bale containing 30 kilograms of cocaine for a total of 1,650 kilograms. The boat had four crew members. Velasquez, as the \u201cload guard\u201d on the boat, was responsible for protecting the boat\u2019s cargo. For his role, Velasquez was promised $10,000, while two of his co-defendants were promised $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Velasquez and his three co-defendants pled guilty to both counts. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a recommended Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. Velasquez\u2019s written objections to the PSI argued that he should receive a mitigating role reduction. In overruling Velasquez\u2019s mitigating role objection, the district court noted that Velasquez was being held accountable for only the drugs on board the go-fast boat, had the additional responsibility of ensuring that the same amount of cocaine loaded onto the boat was ultimately unloaded, was paid more than other crew members and was involved in a significant amount of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">The district court adopted the Guidelines calculations in the PSI and noted the advisory Guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. With respect to Velasquez\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines-range sentence, the district court pointed out that Velasquez\u2019s background as a former Columbian military police officer and his advanced education made his involvement in the offense atypical of other defendants who were generally poor and had few options. The district court ultimately stated that it did not think a non-Guidelines sentence was appropriate \u201ceven considering those factors in your case,\u201d and imposed concurrent 135-month sentences, at the low end of the recommended Guidelines range. Velasquez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">A. Mitigating Role</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s qualification for a role reduction. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The defendant has the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 939. Two principles guide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>a district court\u2019s consideration: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. When the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941. In addition, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in denying Velasquez\u2019s request for a mitigating role reduction. Under the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, the court held Velasquez accountable for only the drugs aboard the go-fast boat. Velasquez\u2019s actual and relevant conduct were the same, and he did not play a minor role in that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Under the second prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the record indicates that Velasquez was the load guard, was paid $10,000, and guarded a large amount of cocaine. Given these facts, Velasquez was at least as culpable as his co-defendants, the other members of the boat\u2019s crew. <em>See id. </em>at 945 (listing as relevant factors, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount of drugs involved, the amount of money the defendant was to be paid and defendant\u2019s role in the distribution). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Velasquez a mitigating role reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">B. <em>Booker </em>Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the advisory Guidelines range and the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for unreasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and the reasons given by the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">After review, we cannot say that Velasquez\u2019s concurrent 135-month sentences are unreasonable. The 135-month sentences are at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum term of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1). The district court noted Velasquez\u2019s more fortunate background and stated that there was no reason to impose anything other than a Guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (including as a factor to consider the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics). The district court also acknowledged Velasquez\u2019s arguments based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and stated that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>nonetheless imposing a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>does not require the district court to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor). Nothing in the record convinces us that Velasquez\u2019s 135-month sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-8\">. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant is entitled to a four-point decrease in his offense level if he was a minimal participant, and a two-point decrease if he was a minor participant. Whether a defendant qualifies for a decrease is \"heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C). A \u201cminimal participant\u201d is someone who is \"plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 4. A \u201cminor participant\u201d is a person who is \"less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. Velasquez's argument that the district court erred when it failed to explicitly consider the relevant factors in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a) is without merit. \"So long as the district court\u2019s conclusion as to defendant's role in the offense is supported by the record, and the court has resolved any disputed factual issues in conformity with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1), a simple statement of the district court's conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 947.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">. The government argues that we should review only for plain error because Velasquez failed to object to his sentence as unreasonable after it was imposed. We need not address this issue because, even under a reasonableness standard, Velasquez\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
