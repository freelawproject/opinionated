In <em>United States v. Rolle, </em>144 Fed.Appx. 777 (11th Cir.2005) (not published), we vacated appellant\u2019s concurrent prison sentences of 168 months<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and remanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the district court treated the Guidelines as discretionary and considered the sentencing objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as <em>Booker </em>instructs, and sentenced appellant once again to concurrent prison terms of 168 months. He now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">This case began when the Drug Enforcement Agency intercepted two boats, carrying 816.58 kilograms of cocaine, ten miles off of the coast of South Florida. Appellant was driving one of the boats. In this appeal, he claims that the district court committed clear error when it treated him as the captain of his vessel and enhanced his sentence accordingly. According to him, Congress intended the enhancement to apply only to those who are licensed or otherwise officially recognized as possessing a special skill, e.g., the captain of a large vessel who has either operational or navigational skill, not someone like him who merely steered a small boat and exhibited neither operational command of the crew nor navigational skill. He claims, moreover, that the Government failed to establish that he was employed to captain the boat (within the meaning of the Guidelines) or that any of the crew members identified him as the captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">The Guidelines instruct the sentencing court in a drug case such as this to increase the defendant\u2019s base offense level by two levels \u201c[i]f the defendant unlawfully imported or exported a controlled substance under circumstances in which ... the defendant acted as a pilot, copilot, captain, navigator, flight officer, or any other operation officer aboard any craft or vessel carrying a controlled substance....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B). Note eight of the commentary to that guideline differentiates between \u00a7 2D1.1 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating that \u201ca de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>fendant who used special skill in the commission of the offense may be subject to an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.3.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.8).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In reviewing an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B), we have adopted a \u201cfunctional definition\u201d of the terms \u201ccaptain\u201d and \u201cpilot,\u201d based upon the facts of the case, rather than a narrow definition. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1116, 163 L.Ed.2d 924 (2006). In <em>Cartwright, </em>we concluded that the defendant \u201ceasily qualified for the enhancement\u201d when he (1) was a lifelong fisherman, (2) drove the boat as it left Jamaica, (3) followed directions concerning where to steer the boat, and (4) navigated the ship. <em>Id. </em>at 1299. Additionally, we held that the fact that Cartwright\u2019s co-conspirators also steered the boat did not effect the analysis \u201cbecause the enhancement explicitly includes \u2018copilots.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Because appellant admitted to driving one of the vessels used to import the drugs, the district court committed no clear error in enhancing his offense level based upon his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Appellant claims that even though the court may not have erred in enhancing his offense level in this fashion, his sentences are nonetheless unreasonable. He contends that, at the time he committed the offense, he was only twenty years old, had no prior criminal record, and worked menial jobs to support his child. Furthermore, his codefendants received prison sentences shorter than his, ranging from 57 months to 120 months, and this disparity rendered his sentences unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">After <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for \u201cunreasonableness,\u201d in the context of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765; <em>see also United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) states, in part, \u201c[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Other factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment, (4) the need to protect the public, and (5) the guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">In this case, the court sentenced appellant at the low end of the Guidelines sentence range after fully considering the \u00a7 3553 factors, of which sentencing disparity is only one. As the captain of his vessel, appellant occupied a role different from that of his crewmen. Given the difference in his status compared to that of his codefendants, we cannot say that the difference between his sentences and theirs amounts to unwarranted disparity, such that it renders his sentences unreasonable. In short, we have no basis for vacating his sentences and remanding the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-11\">.
