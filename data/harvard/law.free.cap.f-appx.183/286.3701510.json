Because MetLife did not abuse its discretion in determining that Wilson had a preexisting condition and therefore was not entitled to disability benefits, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">On August 12, 1996, Wilson, an Information Systems Specialist, began working for BDM Federal, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina. Among its benefits, BDM Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>automatically provided Wilson disability coverage under a Short Term Disability (STD) Plan, and Wilson also enrolled in the optional Long Term Disability (LTD) Plan. Both plans were provided through MetLife, which served as the fiduciary and insurer for the plans. Wilson received a booklet entitled \u201cBDM: Your Employee Benefits Plan\u201d (the BooHet), which described both of these plans in separate sections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">An employee became eligible for benefits under each Plan on different dates. Under the STD Plan, Wilson became eligible for benefits on the date that she began working for BDM Federal \u2014 August 12, 1996. The LTD Plan delayed an employee\u2019s eligibility for benefits until she had completed six months of continuous employment with BDM Federal, so Wilson did not become eligible for LTD benefits until February 12,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The LTD Plan also included a Pre-existing Condition Limitation, which stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">This Plan does not provide benefits for any Disability that is caused by, contributed to by, or resulting from a PreExisting Condition, unless the Disability begins after you have been covered under This Plan for 12 months in a row.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az-\">(J.A. at 600.) In Wilson\u2019s Booklet, a definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d was not included in the LTD Plan. The STD Plan, however, did include a definition of \u201cPreExisting Condition\u201d even though the STD Plan did not have a Pre-Existing Condition Limitation. On page 9 of Wilson\u2019s STD Plan, \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d was defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">[A] Sickness or Injury for which [an employee] received Medical Advice or Treatment during the 3 month period immediately prior to [the employee\u2019s] effective date of Personal Benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">(J.A. at 586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">As became evident later, the reason the STD Plan had a definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d was because Wilson\u2019s Booklet was flawed; pages 9 and 10 of the STD Plan and pages 9 and 10 of the LTD Plan were apparently swapped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The LTD Plan reserved to MetLife the discretionary authority \u201cto interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>bility for and entitlement to Plan benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan.\u201d (J.A. at 605.) MetLife therefore possessed the authority to manage the administration of benefits under the LTD Plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On January 22, 1997, approximately five months after she began working at BDM Federal, Wilson was evaluated at the Duke University Medical Center\u2019s Orthopaedic Clinic for heel spurs and pain in her left shoulder. According to the Clinic\u2019s notes, Wilson began experiencing shoulder pain after she fell down approximately ten stairs a year-and-a-half before visiting the Clinic. At the Clinic\u2019s recommendation, Wilson was further evaluated for polyarthralgias, or joint pain, on January 29, 1997, by Dr. N.M. Kredich, in Duke\u2019s Rheumatology Clinic. Dr. Kredich could not diagnose the medical cause for Wilson\u2019s joint pain, although he did rule out rheumatoid arthritis. Dr. Kredich also noted that Wilson\u2019s problems began after her fall. Two days later, on January 31, Wilson sought medical care at the Womac Army Medical Center for her persistent pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Because her joint pain did not abate after these medical evaluations, on June 10, 1997, Wilson stopped working at BDM Federal. A month later, she began receiving short term disability benefits. On July 15, 1997, MetLife received a Disability Claims Report that Wilson had stopped working because of \u201cpain in [her] joints.\u201d (J.A. at 559.) On May 20, 1998, MetLife approved Wilson\u2019s claim for long term disability benefits and made those benefits retroactive to the expiration of her short term disability benefits. In April 1999, MetLife requested updated medical information from Wilson, which she provided. Although Wilson submitted no new relevant information relating to her eligibility for benefits, MetLife reviewed Wilson\u2019s file and realized from available information that her disability was caused by a condition \u2014 joint pain \u2014 for which she had received medical advice or treatment within the three months preceding her eligibility date for LTD Plan benefits. As a result of this review, MetLife wrote Wilson on July 19, 1999, and referred her to the \u201cPreExisting Condition Limitation\u201d and to the definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d contained within the LTD Plan. (J.A. at 142-43.) Noting that Wilson was treated on January 29 and 31, 1997, for joint pain, MetLife informed Wilson that it had determined that her disability claim fell within the LTD Plan\u2019s \u201cPre-Existing Condition Limitation\u201d and that it was terminating her benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Wilson then brought this action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132 (West 1999), to have her LTD Benefits reinstated. MetLife moved for summary judgment, submitting the entire administrative record for Wilson\u2019s LTD claim, including an original Booklet.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In her response in opposition to Met-Life\u2019s motion, Wilson submitted a copy of her Booklet and noted that it did not include the definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d within the LTD Plan section, unlike MetLife\u2019s Booklet. Because Wilson\u2019s Booklet contained all the information available to her about MetLife\u2019s disability plan, the district court analyzed MetLife\u2019s decision to terminate benefits under the terms of her Booklet. Analyzing the Booklet as setting forth one plan with two sections, the district court noted that although the LTD Plan section did not include a definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition,\u201d \u201cthe fact that the definition was contained in a previous section of [Wilson\u2019s] Plan does not mean that it is inapplicable to other see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tions of the Plan[ ] as well.\u201d (J.A. at 614.) Accordingly, the district court concluded that \u201cthe definition of \u2018Pre-Existing Condition\u2019 contained in the Short-Term Benefits Section of the Plan is equally applicable to give meaning to the term[ ] \u2018Pre-Existing Condition,\u2019 as used in the Pre-Existing Condition Clause\u201d in the LTD Plan. (J.A. at 614.) As such, the district court concluded that MetLife correctly applied the LTD Plan\u2019s pre-existing condition limitation to Wilson\u2019s claim for benefits. Wilson timely noted an appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to MetLife, \u201capplying the same standards that the district court employed.\u201d <em>Evans v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>358 F.3d 307, 310 (4th Cir.2004). The LTD Plan gives MetLife \u201cdiscretionary authority ... to determine eligibility for and entitlement to [LTD] Plan benefits\u201d (J.A. at 605); however, MetLife\u2019s capacity as the insurer of the LTD Plan creates a conflict of interest. <em>Evans, </em>358 F.3d at 311. We therefore review MetLife\u2019s denial of benefits under a modified abuse of discretion standard, in which we consider MetLife\u2019s conflict in determining whether MetLife abused its discretion in denying benefits to Wilson. <em>Id. </em>The touchstone for properly-exercised discretion is whether a plan administrator reached a reasonable decision after a deliberate and principled reasoning process and whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Wilson contends that the district court erred in treating the Booklet as a unitary document and concluding that the definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d found in the STD section applied to the LTD section. She argues that the Booklet comprises two distinct plans \u2014 the STD Plan and the LTD Plan \u2014 and that therefore it is improper to import the STD Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d into the LTD Plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Assuming that Wilson is correct that the Booklet comprises two separate and distinct Plans, we nevertheless conclude that MetLife did not abuse its discretion in terminating her benefits because MetLife properly based its decision on the terms of the LTD Plan as found in the accurate Booklet.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">As described above, Wilson received a flawed Booklet, and MetLife based its decision to terminate Wilson\u2019s disability benefits on <em>its </em>LTD Plan, which contained the definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition.\u201d We first examine whether MetLife abused its discretion in applying the definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>contained in its LTD Plan when Wilson\u2019s LTD Plan did not contain that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Wilson\u2019s flawed version of the LTD Plan would control over MetLife\u2019s accurate version if there was a conflict between the two and Wilson relied on, or was prejudiced by, her version. <em>Hendricks v. Cent. Reserve Life Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 507, 511 (4th Cir.1994). If there is no conflict between the documents, we need not analyze reliance or prejudice. <em>Martin v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Virginia, </em>115 F.3d 1201, 1204 (4th Cir.1997). To determine whether Wilson\u2019s LTD Plan conflicts with MetLife\u2019s Plan, we examine whether \u201cthe generally accepted definition[ ]\u201d of \u201cPreExisting Condition\u201d \u201cdiffer[s] substantially from the definition[ ] of th[at] term[ ] given in\u201d MetLife\u2019s LTD Plan. <em>Hendricks, </em>39 F.3d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">According to generally accepted definitions, \u201cpre-exist\u201d means \u201cto exist previously or before (another person or thing),\u201d and \u201ccondition\u201d means \u201c[a] state of health\u201d or \u201can Alness [or] aAment.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World CoUegiate Dictionary 290,1062 (3d ed. 1997). Therefore, \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d is commonly understood simply as an iUness or aAment that existed before a certain time. Although MetLife\u2019s LTD Plan has a more precise definition of \u201cPreExisting Condition,\u201d it is \u201cnot <em>so </em>different from [the] common understanding[ ] of the term[ ] that [it] can be thought to conflict with t[hat] understanding.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>39 F.3d at 512 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Moreover, WAson cannot show reliance on her version of the Booklet or prejudice from MetLife\u2019s application of its definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition.\u201d First, the definition applied by MetLife is actually more favorable to WAson because it limits \u201ccondition\u201d to a sickness or injury for which medical advice or treatment was obtained and \u201cpre-existing\u201d to a three month period of time before she became eligible for LTD Plan benefits. The generaUy accepted definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d is not that limited and would include any Alness \u2014 treated or untreated\u2014 that existed at any time prior to a particular temporal reference point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, applying the generally accepted definition, we stAl would have to identify a temporal reference point for determining whether a medical condition is pre-existing. In WA-son\u2019s case, there are two logical temporal reference points: pre-existing could refer \u2014 as WAson contends \u2014 to the time before she enrolled in the LTD Plan in August 1996, or it could refer to the time before she became eligible for LTD benefits. But from either reference point, WA-son\u2019s condition was pre-existing because her medical records indicate that her aAment \u2014 the joint pain for which she sought treatment at Duke in January 1997 \u2014 began a year earlier following her faU down stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Because Wilson\u2019s version of the Booklet is not in conflict with MetLife\u2019s, and, in any event, because WAson cannot show that she relied on, or was prejudiced by, her version of the Booklet, MetLife did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>abuse its discretion by applying the correct version of the LTD Plan and accompanying definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Wilson also contends that MetLife abused its discretion by terminating her benefits based on the same medical information that was available at the time of its initial decision to grant her benefits. Relying on one of the criteria for reasonableness that we articulated in <em>Booth v. WalMart Stores, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000), Wilson contends that MetLife did not consistently interpret the provisions of the LTD Plan because it first concluded that she did not have a preexisting condition but then later determined that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We do not believe that MetLife inconsistently interpreted the LTD Plan. Nothing in the record before us suggests that Met-Life has previously interpreted \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d to mean something other than \u201ca Sickness or Injury for which [the employee] received Medical ... Treatment\u201d during the three-month period preceding an employees\u2019s eligibility date for benefits. (J.A. at 115.) Instead, MetLife initially failed to apply the \u201cPre-Existing Condition Limitation\u201d to Wilson\u2019s claim for LTD benefits, but it is not estopped from enforcing that provision of the LTD Plan simply because of its initial failure to do so. <em>See Coleman v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., </em>969 F.2d 54, 60 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that estoppel principles do not bind a plan administrator to prior representations of coverage). Although it is certainly preferable that a plan administrator reach in the first instance a correct decision to grant or deny benefits, we do not believe that a plan administrator abuses its discretion by terminating benefits after a review of available information shows that the initial grant of benefits was contrary to the terms of the plan. <em>See Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., </em>394 F.3d 262, 274 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that a plan fiduciary does not need to meet a higher standard of proof to terminate benefits once granted than is needed to sustain a denial of benefits in the first instance), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2941, 162 L.Ed.2d 867 (2005). Otherwise, plan administrators would be severely constrained from terminating benefits that were erroneously granted, resulting in plan administrators becoming more hesitant about initially granting benefits lest they be stuck with a wrong decision. <em>Id. </em>(noting the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of requiring a heightened standard of proof to terminate erroneously-granted benefits). We therefore conclude that MetLife did not abuse its discretion in correcting its application of the LTD Plan to Wilson\u2019s claim and terminating her LTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">We conclude that MetLife did not abuse its discretion in determining that Wilson\u2019s disability fell within the pre-existing condition limitation of the LTD Plan and that MetLife did not abuse its discretion in terminating her benefits after it initially granted them. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to MetLife.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. The Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) states that employee benefit plans \"shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1102(a)(1) (West 1999), and that every participant in an ERISA plan shall receive a Summary Plan Description (SPD) that is \"written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant\u201d and that \"apprise[s] [plan] participants ... of their rights and obligations under the plan,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1022 (West 1999). Wilson contends that the Benefits Booklet is not simply a SPD of the STD and LTD Plans, but that it is the <em>entire text </em>of those plans and that there is not another, more complete document serving as the official plan upon which MetLife's decision was based. MetLife does not dispute Wilson\u2019s contention, and we therefore assume Wilson is correct. <em>See, e.g., Alday v. Container Corpwestmate://www.westlaw.com/Find/default.asp?rs= WestMate7</em>.30&amp;vr=1.0&amp;cit<em>e=394F.3d262&amp;FindType=F. of Am., </em>906 F.2d 660, 662 n. 2 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that the formal ERISA plan and the SPD at issue in that case were identical).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-14\">. The STD Plan and LTD Plan sections had separate Tables of Contents, but the contents on pages 9 and 10 of each Plan did not correspond with the respective Table of Contents. For example, according to the Table of Contents for the STD Plan in Wilson's Booklet, page 9 should include \"Provisions Applicable to Pregnancy\u201d and \"When Benefits End,\u201d but those provisions are found on page 9 of Wilson\u2019s LTD Plan. Similarly, the Table of Contents for the LTD Plan indicates that pages 7-15 should explain the details of \"Long Term Disability Benefits,\u201d but those pages are interrupted by the pregnancy provisions on page 9 and a statement on page 10 of when short term disability benefits end\u2014 terms clearly not germane to the LTD Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. BDM Federal, the LTD Plan\u2019s official Plan Administrator, shared this authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Although MetLife filed a counterclaim to recover the $35,459.50 that had been paid to Wilson as LTD benefits, the district court entered judgment in favor of Wilson on Met-Life\u2019s counterclaim, and MetLife does not appeal that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. Wilson supports her argument that the Booklet comprises two distinct and self-contained plans by pointing to the fact that the STD Plan and LTD Plan sections of the Booklet each possessed the accouterments of a distinct SPD. Her argument before us, however, contradicts what she argued to the district court. <em>See </em>Resp. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Mot. Summ. L, <em>Wilson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 5:01-CV-384 (E.D.N.C.2002) (\"[Wilson] ... was issued <em>an </em>SPD covering <em>both </em>the STD Plan and the LTD Plan ....\" (emphases added)). Nevertheless, we need not address whether the Booklet included one unitary Plan or two distinct Plans, because the proper mode of analysis is to compare Wilson\u2019s flawed Booklet with MetLife's accurate Booklet to determine if there is a conflict between the two Booklets and if Wilson relied on, or was prejudiced by, her Booklet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. Wilson proposes that \"Pre-Existing Condition\u201d should mean a condition \"for which [she] sought medical advice, care or treatment during the period prior to her employment with BDM [Federal].\u201d (Appellant's Br. at 25.) As discussed, however, the generally accepted definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition\u201d includes all illnesses or ailments, regardless of whether medical treatment was sought. The effect of Wilson\u2019s proposed definition is that she gets to keep the portion of the LTD Plan's definition that benefits her\u2014 the more limited definition of \"condition\"\u2014 while jettisoning the portion that does not\u2014 the point of measurement for \u201cpre-existing.\u201d We therefore reject her proposed definition because it is not the same as the generally accepted definition of \u201cPre-Existing Condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
