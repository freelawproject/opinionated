In <em>United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100 (5th Cir.2005), this court held that a similar claim brought for the first time on appeal by a federal prisoner was not ripe for review, as \u201cit remains conjecture whether [the prisoner\u2019s] DNA sample will be taken while he is on supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1102. Lara\u2019s appeal is factually distinguishable from <em>Riascos-Cuenu, </em>in that Lara is now on supervised release, but his appeal is nevertheless deficient. First, if Lara provided a DNA sample to the Bureau of Prisons while incarcerated, his claim is moot, as he will not be asked to provide an additional DNA sample during his period of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 761 (5th Cir.2003). Second, as an alien having been convicted of a felony, Lara would have been deported upon his release from prison in January 2006. Even assuming arguendo that Lara did not provide a DNA sample during his incarceration, it is pure conjecture to assert that an individual no longer within the jurisdiction of the United States will be made to provide a DNA sample during his period of supervised release. Thus, regardless of whether Lara has provided a DNA sample to the Bureau of Prisons, this court lacks jurisdiction over his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Lara also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1226, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lara contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would now overrule the case, we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Lara properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
