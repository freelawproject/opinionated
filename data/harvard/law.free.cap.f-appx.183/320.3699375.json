Freeze appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying his motion to recuse and denying relief on his civil complaint. He also seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order imposing a prefiling injunction. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">With regard to the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on Freeze\u2019s complaint and denying his motion to recuse, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Freeze v. Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., </em>No. 1:05-cv-00220-FWB (M.D.N.C. Dec. 29, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">Turning to the order imposing a prefiling injunction, we note that Freeze challenges that order in his informal brief. Although Freeze\u2019s informal brief could be construed as a notice of appeal, <em>see Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), the brief was filed beyond the applicable sixty-day appeal pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>riod set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Because Freeze failed to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), (6), we do not have jurisdiction to review the order. <em>See Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (stating that appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We deny Freeze\u2019s motions to recuse the district court judge, to charge the district court judge with obstruction of justice, and for an en banc hearing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
