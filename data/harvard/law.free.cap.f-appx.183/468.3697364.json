Camargo claims the court erred, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This claim is not moot because he is serving a term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 928 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Supervised release, while a form of post-imprisonment supervision, is still considered to be a component of the defendant\u2019s total sentence\u201d.).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Camargo claims his constitutional rights were violated when the district court assessed a two-level firearm increase, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), based on judicially-determined facts. His Presentence Investigation Report and sentencing objections sufficiently apprised the court he was making a Sixth Amendment objection to being sentenced based on facts not found by a jury. <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir.2005). The increase violated Camargo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, and the Government has not met its burden of demonstrating the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
