Lopez contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to provide accurate advice regarding the practical meaning of Lopez\u2019s appeal-waiver provision; that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for the exclusion of his videotaped confession; that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the firearm adjustment to Lopez\u2019s offense level; and that counsel\u2019s ineffective actions, taken cumulatively, demonstrated performance so deficient that prejudice should be presumed pursuant to <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">To prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, an applicant must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prove deficient performance, the applicant must show that counsel\u2019s actions \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To prove prejudice, the applicant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and that \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient performance render[ed] the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 372, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Lopez\u2019s plea agreement contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">The Defendant expressly waives the right to appeal his sentence on any ground, other than for ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct of constitutional dimension. Similarly, the Defendant agrees not to contest his sentence or the manner in which it was determined in any post-conviction proceeding, including, but not limited to, a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Lopez misreads the waiver provision. The waiver has no effect on his ability to appeal, or seek 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief from, his <em>conviction; </em>the provision affects only his ability to appeal, or seek \u00a7 2255 relief from, his <em>sentence. </em>Moreover, a waiver provision does not preclude an appeal or a \u00a7 2255 motion based on claims that the plea agreement or the waiver provision were tainted by ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 2255 motion); <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>72 F.3d 463, 465 (5th Cir.1995) (direct appeal). However, the record in this case is not sufficiently developed for us to address on direct appeal whether counsel provided Lopez with inadequate advice regarding the waiver provision. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). The record is also undeveloped regarding Lopez\u2019s remaining ineffective-assistance contentions; we will not address those contentions on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
