Godinez-Santos contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider (1) the correctly calculated sentencing range under the advisory guidelines and (2) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include among others: \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential .... and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Godinez-Santos contends that at resentencing the district court failed to take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including his \u201chistory and characteristics, as well as the circumstances of his offense.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 8. Specifically, he contends that the district court failed \u201cto take adequate account of the unique circumstances of Godinez-Santos\u2019 distant criminal background, and the manner in which he turned his life around.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The district court did, however, consider all of these arguments at resentencing and stated: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed the history and characteristics of this defendant and the nature of the circumstances of the offense.\u201d The court then recounted Godinez-Santos\u2019 criminal and personal history and noted: \u201cI understand that since that time ... the defendant has changed and has not committed any additional crimes and has led a productive life but that sort of misses the point.\u201d He continued, \u201c[t]he point is that the policies behind the guidelines put[ ] a heavy penalty for reentering this country at all after committing a crime of violence like manslaughter. It\u2019s the policy of this country not to allow a person who\u2019s a convicted felon of a crime of violence back in the country without permission.\u201d He concluded: \u201cThat\u2019s what I find to be compelling and most important in this case in order to reflect the seriousness of this offense and to provide just punishment.\u201d The court indicated that it was sympathetic to Godinez-Santos\u2019 history \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t in any way ... reasonably mitigate the fact that this defendant has a very high criminal history category.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The court could not be more clear: \u201cSo, again, I have considered the statements of the parties, the presentence report which contains the advisory guidelines, as well as the factors set forth in Title 18 United States Code \u00a7 3553(a) 1 through 7. For the reasons I\u2019ve stated, I\u2019ll impose a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines, finding it fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Godinez-Santos\u2019 claim that the district court failed to take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is just wrong. There is no basis in the district court\u2019s statements for a conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Likewise, the claim that the 57-month sentence is unreasonable also fails. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 786. It imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and less than one-fourth of the statutory maximum of 20 years imprisonment, both of which are indications of a reasonable sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 788; <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing the sentence imposed to the statutory maximum in determining its reasonableness); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Under our deferential review, and in light of the record in this case as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find that Godinez-Santos\u2019 57-month sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
