The district court revoked his probation after finding that he failed to comply with the condition of probation that he refrain from associating with individuals engaged in criminal activity or individuals convicted of a felony unless granted permission to do so by his probation officer. The record reflects that Jarvis was aware of this condition yet he intentionally recruited Ivory Rhodes, a convicted felon on federal supervision, to work with him on a job without contacting his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In his brief, Jarvis relies upon <em>Arciniega v. Freeman, </em>404 U.S. 4, 92 S.Ct. 22, 30 L.Ed.2d 126 (1971) (per curiam) which held that the standard condition restricting a probationer\u2019s association with other convicted felons does not apply to incidental contacts which arise out of work for a common employer. But unlike the parolee in <em>Arciniega, </em>Jarvis\u2019s association with Rhodes was not incidental. Jarvis personally recruited Rhodes, a known felon, to work with him. In the words of the district court, Jarvis \u201cactively, proactively and on his own initiated the employment of Mr. Rhodes in the same place that he was working\u201d without permission from his probation officer. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s revocation of Jarvis\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
