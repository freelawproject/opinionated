He also appeals an order revoking a term of supervised release that was imposed in connection with a prior conviction and imposing a term of imprisonment. Quevado argues that his sentence of 120 months of imprisonment for his illegal reentry offense, which included an upward departure, was unreasonable as measured by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-25\">The district court considered Quevado\u2019s history, which is a valid consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Quevado\u2019s use of multiple names and birth dates, coupled with his criminal history, indicated a general disrespect for the law. His criminal history indicated that a lesser sentence would not have a deterrent effect. These are also valid considerations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (B). Quevado\u2019s sentence is appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ate under the Guidelines and is not unreasonable as measured by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Quevado\u2019s arguments thus do not provide a basis for reversal. Quevado\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Quevado contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprend\u00c1, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Quevado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED. As Quevado offers no specific argument challenging the sentence imposed upon revocation, the order revoking Quevado\u2019s supervised release and imposing a term of imprisonment is also AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
