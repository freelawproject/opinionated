In February 2002, the district court sentenced him to a prison term of 95 months. He appealed his conviction (but not his sentence), and we affirmed. <em>United States v. McKeithen, </em>No. 02-11212, 49 Fed.Appx. 289 (11th Cir. September 13, 2002) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-23\">On August 22, 2003, petitioner moved the district court to vacate his conviction on four grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. One of the grounds was that counsel failed to challenge the constitutionality of convictions the court purportedly used to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. The court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who recommended that the motion be denied. The court followed the recommendation and denied relief. The court also denied petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). We thereafter issued a COA for this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-24\">Whether the district court erred by failing to address [petitioner\u2019s] claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s alleged use of several invalid prior convictions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>enhance his sentence in the instant case. <em>See Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (holding that the district court must resolve all claims for relief raised in a habeas petition, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The district court did err. In disposing of petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, the court explicitly rejected three of the four grounds the claim raised but omitted any mention of the fourth ground, the one cited in the COA. This was error; as noted in the COA, <em>Clisby v. Jones </em>requires the district court to dispose of <em>all </em>of a petitioner\u2019s claims. The error, however, is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which the district court relied upon in sentencing petitioner, indicated that petitioner was subject to a mandatory prison term of five years, with a maximum term of 40 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). According to the PSI, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) was not implicated in petitioner\u2019s case because petition had not previously been convicted of a felony drug offense. The PSI recited that petitioner had been convicted of murder, a conviction that clearly was not constitutionally infirm,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that conviction generated a criminal history category of II \u2014 the category the court used in fashioning petitioner\u2019s sentence. That category coupled with a total offense level of 28 yielded a Guidelines sentence range of 87 to 108 months of imprisonment. In sum, petitioner\u2019s attorney could not have rendered ineffective assistance by not objecting to his prior convictions on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his right to counsel because none of those convictions \u2014 save the valid murder conviction \u2014 were used to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-7\">. In February 1990, petitioner was charged in the Dade County, Florida circuit court with murder in the second degree. Represented by an attorney, he pled guilty to murder in the third degree, and on July 6, 1990, the court sentenced him to prison for a term of 17 years. He was released from prison on June 1, 1998. The record conclusively refutes petitioner\u2019s (albeit implicit) claim that this conviction was invalid because he was denied the representation of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
