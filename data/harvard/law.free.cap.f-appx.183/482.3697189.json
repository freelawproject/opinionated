In October 2004, Walter pleaded guilty to illegal reentry. The court sentenced Walter to 57 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. The court also found that Walter had violated the terms of his supervised release in his drug case and sentenced him on revocation thereof to the maximum sentence available, 24 months in prison, to run consecutively to the 57-month sentence that was imposed for his illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-27\">Walter argues, relying on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New </em>Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his sentence upon revocation of supervised release exceeds the statutory maximum sentence permitted by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583. He challenges the court\u2019s classification of his original offense, which in turn defines the maximum sentence that can be imposed upon revocation of supervised release. Walter argues that the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) refers to the maximum sentence authorized under the Sentencing Guidelines, not the maximum sentence authorized by the underlying statute of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The maximum term of imprisonment under the statute of conviction determines the classification of a defendant\u2019s offense. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Hernandez, </em>453 F.3d 280, 282 (5th Cir.2006). Walter\u2019s sentence on supervised release does not exceed the statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 3583.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Walter also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. His challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Walter contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b508-28\"> In case No. 05-40263, the defendant appealed under the name Richard Dol\u00edan Watler. In case No. 05 \u2014 40261, he appealed under the name Richard Walter. The defendant avers that his correct name is Walter, not Watler.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
