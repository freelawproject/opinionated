Mason appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to his employer, Wyeth, Inc., on his claims of discrimination and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>(West 2005) (\u201cADA\u201d), and for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Virginia law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Mason has been hearing impaired since early childhood, with a total hearing loss of approximately 80 percent. With hearing aids, his ability to hear is improved between 80 and 90 percent, and he can participate in normal conversations. However, in areas where there is substantial background noise, Mason does not wear his hearing aids because the noise causes him to experience dizziness and headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">In November 1989, Mason was hired by Wyeth\u2019s predecessor in Richmond, Virginia, as an Offset Operator B in the Print Services Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). Wayne Samford was manager of the Department for the entire duration of Mason\u2019s nearly fifteen years of employment with Wyeth. In 1991, Mason received a promotion to Offset Operator A and, by all accounts, was a successful employee and highly skilled press operator who consistently received good performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Throughout Mason\u2019s employment, the employees in the Department got along very well on a personal level, and there was little turnover. When Mason was hired, there were seven employees in the Department \u2014 Mason, Samford, Nick Paravatti (supervisor), Otis Martin, Bill Branch, Allen Blankenship, and Rogers Jones. In the early to mid-1990s, Paravatti resigned, Martin was promoted to supervisor, and Ray Slaughter was transferred into the Department to operate the photocopiers. In January 2003, the employees in the Department consisted of six of the seven original employees (Mason, Samford, Martin, Branch, Blankenship, and Jones), plus Slaughter, who had been there for several years by that time. According to Mason, he considered these men to be his primary support network, he felt well-liked by his coworkers, and he felt that they always treated him as a person with normal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">In approximately 1998 or 1999, the employees, and particularly Samford, began playing pranks on one another. One such prank involved Samford sneaking up behind the other employees to startle them, either by pinching or poking them, making hissing or loud noises, or blowing air on their hands with an air hose. Another involved Samford placing a toy rat in places where the employees would encounter it. It is undisputed that the pranks and tricks were not limited to those played by Samford on Mason. On the contrary, Samford played the same or similar pranks on nearly every employee in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Department. Mason also admits participating in the prank-playing environment. For example, Mason admitted that he made everybody laugh by \u201cmooning\u201d traffic on Interstate 95 from the Wyeth parking lot on one occasion. He admitted placing a dead bug on top of a candy bar on Jones\u2019s desk to startle him, and he admitted startling Jones on another occasion by putting a rubber snake in his breakfast bag. According to Mason, Samford witnessed the latter incident, got the snake from Mason, and put it in Jones\u2019s sandwich box to startle him again. On yet another occasion, Mason attempted to pry open the door of a bathroom stall occupied by Jones. Mason testified that he was unsuccessful, but Jones realized that it was \u201cme ... trying to tease him,\u201d \u201ccaught me laughing and got me [the] next day.\u201d J.A. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Mason also has a history of mental health problems that preceded his employment with Wyeth. In the 1980s, Mason was diagnosed with severe depression and was hospitalized for depression and suicidal thoughts. He has been treated by a psychiatrist for a Schizoaffective Disorder since 1997. In December 2002, Mason told one of his coworkers that he was considering suicide. When Samford learned about this statement, he discussed the matter with Mason, and relayed his concern to Betty Allen, Samford\u2019s immediate supervisor. Mason was placed in contact with Wyeth\u2019s employee health department, and referred to the Employee Assistance Plan (\u201cEAP\u201d). Pursuant to the EAP, Mason was referred to a clinical psychologist, Nancy MacConnachie. At no time during this process did Mason attribute his depression and suicidal thoughts to his employment with Wyeth, or to the prank-playing environment in the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Dr. MacConnachie first saw Mason on January 13, 2003. By letter dated January 22, 2003, Dr. MacConnachie advised Shirley Hess (Wyeth\u2019s senior manager in Human Resources) that Mason was suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder which Dr. MacConnachie attributed to the pranks that had been played by Samford on Mason. Dr. MacConnachie advised that \u201c[b]ecause of his hearing impairment, Mr. Mason\u2019s startle response has a low threshold and causes him great distress, breaking his concentration on his work\u201d and suggested that \u201cMason\u2019s coworkers would benefit from education regarding the impact of a hearing impairment on the startle response.\u201d J.A. 9-10. This was the first time that Mason or anyone on his behalf requested that the prank-playing be stopped because of the alleged effect it was having on his emotional condition. It was also the first notice anyone at Wyeth received of Mason\u2019s current claim that he considered Samford\u2019s prank-playing (when directed at him) to be discriminatory conduct based upon his hearing disability and that Samford\u2019s prank-playing was the cause of his escalating mental health problems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Upon receiving Dr. MacConnachie\u2019s letter, Hess, Allen, and Ned Netherwood (Senior Director of Administrative Opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>tions in Wyeth\u2019s Consumer Healthcare Division in Richmond), met with Mason and assured him that the prank-playing would stop. They then met with Samford and Martin, separately, regarding the matter. Both men readily admitted that the Department employees, including Mason, joked and played pranks on one another frequently. However, they stated that they were not aware of any negative or unusual impact the prank-playing was having on Mason, and they denied that the pranks were in any way directed at Mason because of his hearing disability. Both men stated that they had no idea that Mason was upset about the pranks, that Mason was, in fact, a participant in the play, and that they never intended to upset him or otherwise cause him harm. According to Allen, Samford appeared \u201cvery surprised\u201d that Mason was claiming that the activity had this effect on him \u201csince it was a situation where they all had participated in that type of activity,\u201d Mason \u201chad not said anything to them that it was bothering him,\u201d and \u201che too, participated in some of the activity.\u201d J.A. 176. Allen testified that she did not view the prank-playing \u201cas singling Mr. Mason out particularly at that point,\u201d J.A. 178, but instructed Samford to stop the activity in the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It is undisputed that Samford played no further pranks on Mason after that meeting. In September 2003, however, nearly seven months later, Mason told Hess that he was having a nervous breakdown. Although Samford had admittedly played no further pranks on Mason, Mason claimed that Samford had continued to tease other employees which upset him. He also claimed that Martin had startled him on one occasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, Mason left employment on short-term disability and checked into a hospital for treatment. He never returned to active employment with Wyeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Prior to these events, Wyeth had begun the task of analyzing cost-saving strategies, including ways to reduce expenses in its Print Services Departments located throughout the company. Wyeth hired an outside consultant firm, the McKinsey Group, to analyze how costs could be reduced through outsourcing of various print service functions. By early January 2003, Jim Pohlman, the Executive Vice President located in Wyeth\u2019s corporate headquarters in Madison, New Jersey, informed Netherwood that offset printing would likely be discontinued because it could be done cheaper outside of the company. Netherwood immediately informed Samford and Martin of the likelihood that a reduction-in-force (\u201cRIF\u201d) would take place in the Department and they, in turn, informed all employees in the Department, including Mason, of the likely RIF. Mason testified that, although he was informed at this time of the proposed closure, he was not worried about it. On February 14, 2003, Netherwood presented to Pohlman the options available in Richmond under the McKinsey study and his recommendation that the company eliminate all offset press work, equipment and associated personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">A final decision to discontinue operation of the offset print presses in Richmond, Virginia and Madison, New Jersey, was made later that year, with the formal announcement occurring on September 23, 2003. The offset presses were removed from the Richmond location shortly thereafter. Because their primary job function was to operate the now-defunct offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>presses, Mason and Blankenship were included in the RIF. The three remaining employees in the Department (Jones, Slaughter, and Branch) were transferred to a newly-created Copy and Mail Center, where they continued to perform the same job functions. Because this left only three non-management employees, the need for a manager and supervisor of the Department was also eliminated, resulting in the termination of Samford and Martin, effective November 30, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 24, 2003, Mason was informed that his position was being eliminated. However, because Mason would turn 55 years old in March 2004, Netherwood and Wyeth\u2019s Assistant Vice President of Human Resources recommended that Wyeth postpone the effective date of Mason\u2019s termination for six months, until April 1, 2004, so that he would be eligible to retire and receive enhanced retirement benefits if he returned to active employment before that date. Mason and the others were also offered a separation program, which included severance, outplacement, educational assistance and benefit continuation. Mason never returned to work and continues to receive disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Mason filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging discrimination and retaliation under the ADA. He then filed this action, asserting claims for hostile work environment and retaliation under the ADA, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress under Virginia state law. Wyeth moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the district court, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We begin with Mason\u2019s claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his hostile work environment claim and in determining that Mason had failed to plead a separate \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d claim under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">\u201cThe ADA prohibits discrimination only against a \u2018qualified individual with a disability,\u2019 and defines such a person as \u2018an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions\u2019 of his job.\u201d <em>Fox v. General Motors Corp., </em>247 F.3d 169, 177 (4th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12112(a) and \u00a7 12111(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">In his amended complaint, Mason set forth three specifically enumerated counts: Count One, labeled \u201cAmericans with Disabilities Act (Hostile Work Environment)\u201d; Count Two, labeled \u201cAmericans with Disabilities Act (Retaliation)\u201d; and Count Three, labeled \u201cIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.\u201d J.A. 134-136. Wyeth moved for summary judgment as to all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">During the summary judgment proceedings before the district court, a controversy arose regarding whether Mason had stated a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d claim under \u00a7 12112(a), separate and apart from his claim of a \u201chostile work environment.\u201d Specifically, Mason argued that he had and, in particular, claimed that Wyeth had violated the ADA by failing to provide him with a TTY-adapted telephone and by failing to provide either sign language interpreters or written summaries of semiannual meetings to ensure that he was aware of new information. The district court ruled that Mason had failed to plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a separate \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d claim in his amended complaint, and granted summary judgment as to Mason\u2019s \u201chostile work environment\u201d claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">As an initial premise, we note that Mason clearly failed to set forth a separately stated count for an alleged failure to provide reasonable accommodations for his hearing disability. He does not claim otherwise on appeal. Rather, he asserts that he should be allowed to pursue such a claim because it was sufficiently stated in the paragraphs leading up to the enumerated counts, which, in turn, were incorporated by reference into his first count for hostile work environment. In these paragraphs, Mason set forth factual allegations regarding the prank-playing environment, followed by allegations that \u201c[ojther acts ... contributed to the hostile environment/harassment,\u201d J.A. 130, including Wyeth\u2019s failure to provide \u201creasonable accommodation in the form of an interpreter\u201d or \u201cwritten summaries of the department meetings, so he could learn what topics had been discussed,\u201d J.A. 131. Mason also alleged that Wyeth had \u201cfurther discriminated against Mason when it gave him a lower performance evaluation because of his difficulties in answering the telephone at work. The telephone at the printing department was not a TTY-adapted telephone, and Defendant continuously ignored Mason\u2019s requests for accommodation in this and other regards.\u201d J.A. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We disagree with Mason\u2019s view that these background allegations were sufficient to state a separate count for reasonable accommodation. Mason structured his amended complaint to allege, via clearly delineated headings, three specific, enumerated counts. At best, a fair reading of the amended complaint should have placed Wyeth on notice that Mason considered these supposed failures to be a part of his claim that the work environment was hostile to him because of his hearing disability, and therefore something to be considered in conjunction with Samford\u2019s prank-playing. But it did not fairly place Wyeth on notice that Mason was claiming that such accommodations would have allowed him to \u201cperform the essential functions\u201d of his job, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12111(8), and that he intended to pursue a separate count for failure to accommodate.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Even if the amended complaint had sufficiently placed Wyeth on notice of a reasonable accommodation claim, however, it would not affect Wyeth\u2019s entitlement to summary judgment on the ADA count. Prior to the filing of the motion for summary judgment, the parties conducted discovery and Mason was given ample opportunity to produce evidence in support of any such claim. Yet, Mason has failed to support his allegations that he requested and was denied the specified accommodations with sufficient evidence, and has failed to demonstrate that he was unable to perform the essential functions of his job without them.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">With regard to Mason\u2019s alleged request for a sign-language interpreter, Mason testified that, within a year or two of coming to work, he realized that he was having trouble hearing in the semi-annual meetings and he \u201chint[edj ... to Otis and Wayne\u201d that he needed an interpreter. J.A. 92. According to Mason, he was encouraged to sit in the front of the meetings and turn his hearing aids up. Mason testified that he heeded this advice, but still encountered too much background noise to hear well. Mason admits that he only \u201chinted\u201d of the need for an interpreter on this one occasion, and he apparently told no one that the suggested resolution was unsatisfactory. Rather, Mason testified that he did not believe he needed to say anything else, that Wyeth should have \u201cimmediately\u201d provided an interpreter in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>sponse to his hint, and that he \u201cjust gave up.\u201d J.A. 94.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such evidence is plainly insufficient to support a finding that Wyeth failed to make a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Mason\u2019s testimony regarding his difficulties with the telephone and its alleged impact on his job is a similarly insufficient basis upon which to ground a reasonable accommodation claim. Mason testified that Samford informed him on one occasion that Mason was not taking telephone messages accurately, prompting him to request \u201csomething like a sound booster\u201d for the telephone. J.A. 96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mason testified that the only accommodation he requested was this \u201cvolume enhancer or amplifier on the telephone\u201d and admitted that this \u201cwas done and that [it] helped\u201d him. J.A. 97. He later testified, without elaboration, that he also \u201casked [Betty Allen] about TTY, and they never provided it.\u201d J.A. 98. However, because Mason has also failed to come forward with any evidence that a TTY-adapted telephone was required for him to perform his essential job functions, we need not resolve any conflict in Mason\u2019s testimony in this regard. To the extent any evidence on the matter was produced, it indicates that Mason was performing his job duties, including answering the telephone, satisfactorily with the accommodation provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In sum, we agree that Mason\u2019s amended complaint failed to allege a separate claim for \u201cfailure to accommodate\u201d under the ADA and, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. We also hold that, even if Mason had sufficiently stated such a claim, Wyeth remained entitled to summary judgment because Mason\u2019s evidence is plainly insufficient to support his claim that the accommodations were requested and denied, or that they were necessary for him to perform his essential job functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">We next turn to Mason\u2019s claim that Samford\u2019s prank-playing amounted to a hostile work environment in violation of the ADA. The ADA prohibits employers from \u201cdiscriminating] against a qualified individual with a disability <em>because of </em>the disability of such individual in regard to [the] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). In order to establish such a claim for discrimination based upon a work environment that is hostile to one\u2019s disability, the plaintiff must prove that \u201c(1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ment; (3) the harassment was based on his disability; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) some factual basis exists to impute liability for the harassment to the employer.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>247 F.3d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Mason failed to create a genuine issue of material fact which could satisfy the third element, <em>i.e., </em>that Samford discriminated against Mason \u201cbecause of\u2019 Mason\u2019s hearing disability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The critical issue for consideration in the \u201cbecause of\u2019 inquiry is whether a disabled plaintiff has been \u201cexposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which [non-disabled employees] are not exposed.\u201d <em>Ocheltree v. Scollon Productions, Inc., </em>335 F.3d 325, 331 (4th Cir.2003) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted) (addressing the \u201cbecause of\u2019 inquiry in the context of a Title VII sex discrimination case). Here, it is undisputed that the employees in the Department had worked together for a long period of time and were close friends as well as coworkers. While Samford may have led the pack in the prank-playing shenanigans that developed among the men, it is undisputed that Samford was not the only participant, nor was Mason his sole target. Samford played these exact pranks on most, if not all, of Mason\u2019s coworkers, and all of the employees participated in the prank-playing in some fashion and degree. Mason admits this and, while he attempts to downplay the extent and degree of his involvement, he admits that he engaged in similar horseplay. And, like Samford, Mason viewed his antics as innocent and, for the most part, welcomed by his targets. In short, the work environment in the Department was permeated with the perhaps sophomoric and juvenile behavior of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Unable to show that Samford singled him out from his coworkers for the pranks, Mason instead claims that it was sufficient to produce evidence that he was the <em>primary </em>target of Samford\u2019s prank-playing antics. According to Mason, he felt like he was Samford\u2019s primary target, and he believes this is because he was easy to sneak up on and has a low-threshold startle response. Because these characteristics resulted from his hearing impairment, Mason asserts that one may infer that Samford\u2019s prank-playing, when directed at him, amounted to discrimination against him because of the hearing disability in violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">We are unpersuaded. First, Mason has produced insufficient admissible evidence from which one could conclude that he was even the \u201cprimary\u201d target of Samford\u2019s prank-playing, as opposed to only one of several \u201cfavorites\u201d in the Department.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Second, while Mason presented lay testimony regarding his supposed \u201cexaggerated\u201d or \u201clow threshold\u201d startle response, he has not designated and produced expert testimony to support a causal connection between the degree of his startle response and his hearing disability, or evidence that his startle response was really all that different from that of Samford\u2019s other primary targets.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In the end, however, we hold that Mason cannot prevail on his hostile work environment claim under the ADA based upon such a multi-layer approach of imputing a discriminatory motive to Samford. In order to establish a claim under the ADA, Mason was required to present evidence upon which a jury could rest a determination that Samford <em>discriminated </em>against Mason <em>because of </em>his hearing disability. That is what the ADA and other such anti-discrimination laws are intended to prevent \u2014 discrimination against an employee because of the protected trait at issue. They do not intended to guarantee \u201crefinement and sophistication in the workplace.\u201d <em>Cf. Hartsell v. Duplex Prods., Inc., </em>123 F.3d 766, 773 (4th Cir.1997). Nor are they intended to subject an employer to liability because the mutual prank-playing of friends and coworkers in the workplace gets out of hand and inadvertently offends or harms one who happens to a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In this case, there is no evidence that Samford was ever motivated to discriminate against Mason because Mason was hearing impaired. Mason does not claim that he alone was singled out. He readily acknowledged that Samford \u201cd[id] it all the time. I\u2019m not the only person.... He does it to all the others.\u201d J.A. 49. He also admitted that Samford never said anything that caused him to believe that he was being teased \u201cbecause [he was] hearing impaired,\u201d J.A. 69, and testified that Samford \u201cnever made fun of [his] hearing,\u201d J.A. 70. He, and the others in the Department, viewed Samford\u2019s pranks as \u201cjust ... a joke.\u201d J.A. 47, 50. When specifically asked to identify the people at work who he believed were motivated to tease him or play tricks on him because of his hearing impairment, Mason denied that he was teased because of his hearing impairment. Rather, he believed that he was teased because he was a \u201cgood all around role model and offset pressman.\u201d J.A. 66. According to Mason, \u201c[t]hey just like[d] to pick on me\u201d because \u201cI was [a] swell of a guy.\u201d J.A. 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Indeed, Mason testified that he did not consider the prank-playing to be harassment based upon his hearing disability until his medical providers told him otherwise. Mason testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t look at it that way because of [his] hearing disability, but [his] doctor look[ed] at it that way and told [him].\u201d J.A. 55. He was also told in \u201cthe group meetings when [he] was in the hospital ... that [it] is harassment, that [he] didn\u2019t know. And [he] just held it as a joke, and no one told me it was harassment....\u201d J.A. 47. As a result, Mason came to believe that Sam-ford\u2019s pranks were \u201charassment,\u201d not because he believed Samford held any discriminatory animus towards him or his disability, but because his medical provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ers told him that Samford was so motivated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In sum, Mason makes no claim that Samford was directly motivated by a discriminatory animus towards him. Sam-ford denies any such animus or motivation, and there is no other testimony or evidence that would allow such an inference. Mason cannot prevail because he failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that Samford subjected him to a discriminatory, hostile work environment because of his hearing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">C. Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Mason\u2019s next claim is that he was terminated by Wyeth in retaliation for his complaints about Samford\u2019s prank-playing, also in violation of the ADA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12208 (providing that \u201c[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Mason was required to present evidence that (1) he \u201cengaged in conduct protected by the ADA;\u201d (2) he \u201csuffered an adverse action subsequent to engaging in the protected conduct;\u201d and (3) \u201cthere was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health, Inc., </em>313 F.3d 205, 216 (4th Cir.2002). Athough Mason was not required to establish that the opposed conduct was actually an ADA violation, he must at a minimum establish a reasonable, good faith belief that the opposed conduct violated the ADA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Mason cannot prevail on his retaliation claim because he failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that he was terminated as a result of his complaints, rather than as part of the scheduled RIF. As noted earlier, Wyeth began studying ways to reduce expenses in its Print Services Departments in early 2002 and, by early January 2003, its consultant had completed its study in this regard. The Richmond and Madison print departments were targeted for closure, and a RIF and reorganization were formally announced in September. The offset presses were removed and, Mason and Blankenship, whose primary job functions were to operate those offset presses, were terminated, along with a number of additional employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">In light of this undisputed evidence, the district court held that Mason had failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that Wyeth\u2019s stated reason for terminating Mason was pretextual, or that the termination was otherwise imposed as retaliation for Mason\u2019s complaints of Samford\u2019s prank-playing antics. We agree, and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Lastly, we turn to Mason\u2019s claim that he presented sufficient evidence that Sam-ford\u2019s pranks amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress under Virginia law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress requires that the plaintiff prove (1) that \u201cthe wrongdoer\u2019s conduct was intentional or reckless;\u201d (2) that \u201cthe conduct was outrageous and intolerable;\u201d (3) that \u201cthere was a causal connection between the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct and the emotional distress;\u201d and (4) that \u201cthe emotional distress was severe.\u201d <em>See Harris v. Kreutzer, </em>271 Va. 188, 624 S.E.2d 24, 33 (2006). \u201cBecause of the risks inherent in torts where injury to the mind or emotions is claimed, ... such torts [are] not favored in the law.\u201d <em>Ruth v. Fletcher, </em>237 Va. 366, 377 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, in establishing the requisite \u201coutrageousness\u201d of the conduct, it is not enough to show that the defendant \u201cacted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>624 S.E.2d at 33 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, liability may be \u201cfound only where the conduct has been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Mason claims that Samford\u2019s pranks rose to this level, in large part because he was an especially susceptible and vulnerable target. Like the district court, we are unpersuaded. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mason, the conduct at issue, while perhaps inappropriate for the work environment, amounted to little more than sophomoric pranks between good friends and coworkers. As such, it falls far short of the requisite outrageous and atrocious behavior necessary to pursue a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to this count as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-5\">. Mason testified that several years earlier, when the prank-playing behavior was getting started, he told Samford to stop because it was \"getting on [his] nerves,\u201d and told Martin that Samford should stop the pranks. J.A. 50. However, he testified that Samford \"thought I was kidding\u201d and \"didn't think what I was saying to him was serious.\u201d J.A. 50. Mason apparently took no further steps to stop the behavior or extricate himself from the prank-playing environment, and makes no claim that he ever informed management or his coworkers or supervisors that he believed the pranks were directed at him because of his hearing disability or that they were causing a deterioration of his mental health condition until after he was referred to Dr. MacConnachie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b383-6\">. Although Mason testified that he felt like Martin made a noise on purpose, he admitted that he did not see Martin do anything to cause the noise and did not know if it was done intentionally or not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. A simultaneous RIF in the Richmond RxPO department resulted in the termination of ten additional employees. The parties have not indicated the number of employees terminated as a result of the reorganization at the Madison, New Jersey location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-5\">. There is no admissible evidence that Mason ever requested written summaries of the meetings, as alleged in his complaint. He did not claim that he did in his testimony, and the only mention of the alleged request in the record is a hearsay statement recorded by Dr. MacConnachie in her letter to Wyeth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. In his amended complaint, and in arguments before us, Mason characterizes this comment on Samford\u2019s part as a lower performance appraisal which resulted from Wyeth\u2019s failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. Mason alleged that he \"disagreed with the lower performance evaluation and initially refused to sign it,\u201d that he \"was told by Samford that if he did not sign the evaluation he would not get a pay raise,\u201d and that he \"asked for a copy of the evaluation, [but] his request was denied.\" J.A. 131. Mason has produced no evidence in support of these additional allegations and his own testimony does not support them. Indeed, there is no evidence of a written evaluation regarding Mason's telephone abilities at all, and the only written evidence regarding Mason\u2019s performance evaluations is overwhelmingly positive. To the extent we could view Samford's comment as a lower performance appraisal, however, it obviously did not result from Wyeth's failure to provide a TTY telephone, as it <em>preceded </em>Mason\u2019s request for the voice amplifier that was provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. We express no opinion as to whether the prank-playing could be viewed as sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Because Mason failed to demonstrate that any alleged discrimination occurred \"because of\" his hearing disability, it is unnecessary for us to reach the alternative holding of the district court on the fourth element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. Mason testified that he believed he was the primary target, that Slaughter was second, and that Blankenship was third. Slaughter testified that he felt like <em>he </em>was Samford's primary target, and that Samford played more pranks on him than on Mason. The testimony of the employees in the Department supports both viewpoints, as well as the possibility that Blankenship was at least Samford\u2019s third favorite target. Of course, all such rankings are too subjective and generalized to be of much assistance to Mason. They are necessarily based upon the subjective impressions of the employees and the frequency with which they were in position to observe the behavior. The employees, including Mason, do agree on one thing; Samford played the most pranks on Slaughter, Blankenship, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Mason because they were accessible and had \"funnier\u201d reactions, in contrast to Branch, Jones and Martin, who, either because they were not as accessible in their work stations or had little or no reaction to the pranks, had fewer pranks played upon them. We find Mason's subjective and self-serving declaration that he was \"first\u201d simply too thin a reed upon which to rest the claim that he was \"singled out\u201d from the others and subjected to \"disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which\u201d his nondisabled coworkers were not exposed. <em>Ocheltree, </em>335 F.3d at 331 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">. Even if the opinions of the medical providers had been offered as expert testimony, an opinion that Samford\u2019s pranks were discriminatory in nature would not be the proper subject of a medical opinion. We note, however, that the medical providers appear to have been under the incorrect impression that the <em>only </em>harassing conduct taking place was that of Samford playing \"sneaky\u201d tricks on Mason. Mason does not make that claim, and it is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b390-8\">MICHAEL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7F\">dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision in part II.B to affirm summary judgment for Wyeth, Inc. on Ronald Mason\u2019s hostile work environment claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The majority erroneously concludes that Mason\u2019s claim fails because Wyeth\u2019s manager Wayne Samford did not harass Mason because of his deafness. When the facts are taken, as they must be, in the light most favorable to Mason, they reveal that Samford relentlessly took advantage of Mason\u2019s deafness in playing pranks on him to provoke his extreme \u201cstartle reaction.\u201d Far from being mere horseplay, these incessant pranks ultimately led to a deterioration in Mason\u2019s mental health and made his work environment a hostile one.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">In 1989 Ronald Mason began working as an offset printer operator in the print services department of A.H. Robins Company, Inc., a Richmond, Virginia, concern that later became part of Wyeth. Samford and Otis Martin were Mason\u2019s supervisors during most of Mason\u2019s employment, including the period relevant to this case. Mason, who is deaf, was a highly skilled employee. He did not usually wear hearing aids at work because using them in the noisy work environment caused dizziness and headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Although Mason\u2019s coworkers liked him and treated him like a \u201cnormal hearing person\u201d in many ways, they were generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>clueless about and indifferent to his disability. J.A. 42. As Mason put it, \u201cThey don\u2019t understand about my hearing disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mason\u2019s managers likewise were indifferent to his deafness. For example, Mason requested a sign language interpreter early in his employment so that he could follow the discussion and participate in group meetings, but Samford and Martin never provided one. Mason explained to Samford and Martin that he \u201c[could not] understand a word\u201d at the meetings. J.A. 92. Mason specifically said to them, \u201cI need [an] interpreter,\u201d and asked, \u201cCan someone see ... about getting an interpreter?\u201d J.A. 92, 94. Samford and Martin just responded, \u201cTurn your hearing aid up. Get up in front.\u201d J.A. 92. As a result of this indifference, Mason did not have access to the same workplace information that his hearing coworkers did. Whenever Mason wore his hearing aids at work, Samford would expect Mason to function at all times as \u201ca hearing person,\u201d but Mason obviously could not. J.A. 44. For instance, even when wearing his hearing aids, Mason could not understand voices on the telephone because his hearing aids distorted the sound. Disregarding this problem, Samford criticized Mason for not taking phone messages correctly. At times Mason\u2019s coworkers would speak to Mason in a belittling way about his disability, saying, \u2018You hear what you want to hear.\u201d J.A. 42. This accusation, Mason insisted, was not true. In addition, one coworker, Ray Slaughter, mocked Mason\u2019s impaired speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In 1998 or 1999 Samford began playing pranks on Mason that were both cruelhearted and discriminatory because they exploited Mason\u2019s deafness. As often as two or three times a week, Samford would sneak up behind and pinch Mason while making a hissing noise or blowing air from an air hose onto Mason\u2019s hand. As Mason described the incidents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">I hear the sound, psst, and he touch me like a snakebite, yes, but I didn\u2019t hear him approach me, behind me. I can\u2019t hear him____ My job is focus on work. If I hear, I will turn around. I would prevent it. The advantage is I can\u2019t hear him, and it\u2019s so easy for him \u2014 I was so target, easy to be attacked, because I jump. I jump my legs. And he laughed, think it\u2019s funny, because I overreacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">J.A. 49-50. In addition, Samford would often hide a rubber rat in the work area to shock Mason. Mason estimates that Sam-ford scared him with the rat at least twenty-five times in one year. Samford used the rat on occasion to scare other print shop employees, but Mason was his most frequent prey.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Although Samford played pranks on other employees, Mason was Samford\u2019s \u201cnumber one target\u201d because Mason\u2019s disability made it easy for Samford to sneak up behind him and provoke a severe startle reaction. J.A. 55. Mason explained, \u201c[M]y nerve is very jumpy. And anybody touch me, I jump ... because the deaf people, if you tap behind deaf people, what happen? It causes deaf people to startle. Deaf people prefer people come around in front where they can see, see you. I\u2019m the same way.\u201d J.A. 68-69. Samford tormented Mason because he (Samford) was amused by Mason\u2019s reactions; Samford admits they made him laugh. Mason\u2019s reactions also made Mason\u2019s coworkers laugh. According to Mason, Samford was motivated to scare Mason primarily because of Mason\u2019s startle reactions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">[A]s being a hearing-impaired person, other than normal hearing person, you can hear him coming, and you don\u2019t usually scare as much as they are. When you\u2019re impaired person, it\u2019s like I\u2019m almost deaf and I\u2019m working on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>machine and it\u2019s just \u2014 all my mind is staying on machine. When unexpected startle or \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m telling you, it scared the shit out of me, because there\u2019s a lot to do with hearing disability. It just made me \u2014 heart pounding, scaring. My face turned white, and I jump. Nobody jumps like I do. It scares me to shit. And Wayne [Sam-ford] likes that, my action of being scared. He thinks it\u2019s funny.... [H]e kept on and on and on and on and on, never stopped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">J.A. 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Mason\u2019s coworkers confirmed that Sam-ford targeted Mason with harassing conduct because of his disability. Mason\u2019s coworker Judith Kounnas reported that Mason was an easier target for pranks than other employees because he could not hear. Mason\u2019s coworkers also confirmed that print shop employees did not reciprocate with pranks on Samford. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. at 251 (coworker Roger Jones stating, \u201cYou don\u2019t usually play tricks on the boss.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u201c[M]ore than once, maybe several times,\u201d Mason pleaded with Samford to stop his \u201cshit,\u201d explaining to Samford that his pranks were \u201cgetting on [Mason\u2019s] nerves.\u201d J.A. 50. Read in context, Mason\u2019s statement about his frayed nerves conveys more than mere annoyance: Sam-ford\u2019s pranks were affecting Mason\u2019s nervous condition. (Samford was aware of Mason\u2019s condition and knew that Mason took medication to \u201ccalm [his] nerves.\u201d J.A. 69.) Samford ignored Mason\u2019s requests, however, forcing Mason to seek help from another person in management, Otis Martin. Mason reported Samford\u2019s harassment to Martin two times. He specifically asked Martin if he \u201cwould ... tell [Sam-ford] to stop.\u201d J.A. 47. Martin seemed to feel sorry for Mason; he told Mason that he knew Samford\u2019s conduct was wrong and that he would \u201csee what he [could] do.\u201d J.A. 79-80. But nothing was done, and Samford\u2019s harassment persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Samford\u2019s pranks caused Mason to suffer great anxiety and physical distress. Although Mason took additional medication to alleviate his anxiety, his job performance began to suffer. Mason would often lose his concentration and have trouble focusing and handling his tools. His work slowed. The harassment even caused Mason to incur minor physical injury at work. On occasion Samford\u2019s conduct would cause Mason to lose his balance and skin his knuckles. Once Mason fell over and hurt his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In late 2002 Mason\u2019s anxiety became so severe that he began to contemplate suicide. He was referred to a psychologist, Dr. Nancy MacConnachie, who diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2003 Dr. MacConnachie wrote a letter to Shirley Hess in Wyeth\u2019s Human Resources Department. Dr. MacConnachie cited Samford\u2019s conduct as a source of Mason\u2019s emotional deterioration and emphasized that it was necessary to put an immediate stop to the \u201capparently discriminatory behavior in [Mason\u2019s] work place.\u201d J.A. 10. Hess responded about three weeks later by holding separate meetings with Mason, Martin, and Samford about the harassing conduct. At the meeting with Mason, held on February 13, 2003, Mason cried and explained why he was scared and depressed as a result of the pranks. Sam-ford and Martin confirmed that the incidents had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">To establish a hostile work environment claim under the ADA, Mason must establish that (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) he was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on (or because of) his disability; (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) some factual basis exists to impute liability to the employer. <em>Fox v. General Motors Corp., </em>247 F.3d 169, 177 (4th Cir.2001). The majority errs in concluding that Mason does not proffer sufficient facts to establish the third element, that he was harassed because of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The majority contends that Mason was not harassed on account of his disability because Samford was not the only person in the print department who played pranks and because Samford played many of the same pranks on Mason\u2019s non-disabled coworkers. This contention suffers from two fatal flaws. First, Mason has produced sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he was the primary target of Samford\u2019s harassment. Mason testified that he was subjected to pranks more frequently than others in the department. Mason also testified that we was the \u201cnumber one target\u201d for Samford\u2019s pranks because he was easy to sneak up on and because his startle reaction was extreme. Mason\u2019s coworker, Judith Kounnas, corroborated this account. Even Samford\u2019s testimony, taken as a whole, would allow a jury to infer that he targeted Mason: Samford surprised Mason with his pranks more often than any other employee because he found Mason\u2019s extreme startle reaction amusing. Moreover, the type of pranks Samford played specifically exploited Mason\u2019s inability to hear and his exaggerated startle reaction. It is true, as the majority notes, that some of Mason\u2019s coworkers testified that Samford did not target Mason more frequently than other employees. This testimony simply reveals the presence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mason was the primary target of Samford\u2019s harassment; it does not defeat in summary judgment proceedings Mason\u2019s evidence that he was the number one target.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">I recognize that some of Mason\u2019s deposition testimony, when read out of context, may appear to undermine his claim. For instance, he testified that he knew Sam-ford targeted other employees with pranks, that he understood Samford\u2019s actions to be a \u201cjoke,\u201d and that his coworkers treated him as a \u201cnormal hearing person.\u201d J.A. 42, 50. Again, these statements are not fatal on summary judgement, where all reasonable inferences must be drawn in Mason\u2019s favor. <em>See Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). To illustrate, Mason\u2019s statement that Sam-ford\u2019s pranks were a \u201cjoke,\u201d when read in context, can be understood to mean that he did not realize at the time that Samford\u2019s pranks were unlawful. <em>See </em>J.A. 50 (Mason testifying that \u201cno one told [him] it was wrong,\u201d and explaining that he went to Martin for \u201chelp\u201d in trying to get Samford to stop his pranks). Likewise, Mason\u2019s statement that his coworkers treated him as a \u201cnormal hearing person,\u201d when read in the context of Samford\u2019s failure to provide a sign language interpreter and other employees\u2019 accusations that Mason \u201chear[s] what [he] want[s] to hear,\u201d show insensitivity to his disability. These statements therefore do not negate Mason\u2019s argument that Samford\u2019s conduct was subjectively and objectively offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The majority, in concluding that Mason was not harassed because of his disability, relies on evidence that Samford also played pranks on Mason\u2019s non-disabled coworkers. A disabled employee, however, can be abused in ways that cannot be explained without reference to his disability, notwithstanding that non-disabled employees are exposed to the same treatment. <em>Cf. Ocheltree v. Scollon Prods., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Inc., </em>335 F.3d 325, 332 (4th Cir.2003) (en banc). Thus, even though other employees took offense at Samford\u2019s pranks, a jury could reasonably find that Samford engaged in this conduct largely because he \u201cenjoyed watching and laughing at the reactions of the only [deaf person] in the [workplace].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tellingly, most if not all of Samford\u2019s pranks specifically exploited Mason\u2019s inability to hear. Evidence that Mason\u2019s coworkers mocked his impaired speech and that his supervisors ignored his requests for disability accommodations demonstrates general workplace hostility to the presence of a person with a disability. This general hostility supports Mason\u2019s claim that he was harassed because of his deafness.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The majority attempts to paint Sam-ford\u2019s conduct toward Mason as mere \u201cprank-playing shenanigans\u201d that permeated the work environment and that Mason himself even instigated at times. Ante-. To this end, the majority emphasizes the few, isolated jokes Mason played with his coworkers over his fourteen-year tenure with Wyeth. On one occasion, Mason placed a fake snake on Roger Jones\u2019s lunch bag. On another occasion, Mason placed a dead bug on top of a candy bar on Jones\u2019s desk. (Jones liked the bug because it kept people from stealing his candy, and so he left it on his desk for years.) Mason also once tried to unlock the bathroom door when Jones was using the bathroom, a joke that Jones reciprocated the next day. Finally, Mason testified that once, outside of work, he \u201cmooned\u201d traffic on 1-95, although he did not drop his undershorts. Mason\u2019s isolated pranks differ from Samford\u2019s persistent, abusive conduct in many ways. Most important, when Jones asked Mason not to scare him with the fake snake anymore, Mason stopped. Mason was thus willing to modify his conduct in response to his coworker\u2019s request. In contrast, Samford persisted with his harassment even though Mason repeatedly complained to Samford and Martin about Samford\u2019s conduct. Mason\u2019s pranks also differed from Samford\u2019s because Mason did not specifically exploit his coworkers\u2019 physical disabilities. Additionally, Mason\u2019s pranks were reciprocal. Mason played a few jokes on Jones (whom he did not supervise), and in return Jones played a few jokes on him. In contrast, most print shop employees testified that no one played jokes on the boss, Samford. As Jones explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t usually play tricks on the boss.... I don\u2019t know how [Samford] would take it.\u201d J.A. 251. The majority simply fails to make the case that Mason\u2019s conduct can be equated with Samford\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In sum, the summary judgment record, viewed in the light most favorable to Mason, reveals that he was harassed because of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The next issue is whether the district court erred in concluding that Samford\u2019s conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute an objectively hostile or abusive work environment. The court did err. Factors relevant to whether the environment is objectively hostile include \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>247 F.3d at 178. Each of these factors weighs in favor of a determination that Samford\u2019s conduct helped create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment. Mason\u2019s account of his experience at work, supported by Dr. MacConnachie and his treating physician, shows that Samford\u2019s harassing conduct was constant, physically invasive, humiliating, and emotionally harmful and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that it interfered with Mason\u2019s job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Mason described in clear detail the feelings of anxiety and panic that Samford\u2019s pranks made him experience and how these reactions were specifically connected to his disability. He explained why it was especially frightening for him, as a deaf person, to be startled by a pinch or blast of air from a hose from someone he could not possibly hear approaching from behind. He also described how the anxiety caused him to make mistakes at work, incur minor injuries, and generally \u201cslow[ ] ... down.\u201d J.A. 90. Samford\u2019s conduct could perhaps be characterized as horseplay if directed only at hearing employees, but it is plainly abusive and offensive when directed at someone who cannot hear. Samford\u2019s insistence upon continuing the pranks despite Mason\u2019s repeated requests that he stop (which included an explanation of how the pranks affected his nervous condition) makes Samford\u2019s conduct even more abusive and offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">There are genuine issues of material fact as to (1) whether Mason was harassed because of his disability and (2) whether Samford\u2019s conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute an objectively hostile work environment. Accordingly, I believe that Mason is entitled to a trial on his hostile work environment claim. Because I would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Wyeth on this claim, I dissent in part from the majority opinion. However, I concur in the majority\u2019s determination that Wyeth is entitled to summary judgment on Mason\u2019s reasonable accommodation, retaliation, and state tort claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
