Harvey argues that the district court enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his career offender status in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have held, however, that a judge\u2019s determination of career offender status does not implicate <em>Booker, </em>because, except for the defendant\u2019s age, \u201c[cjareer offender status is not \u2018a sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact other than a prior conviction.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1080, 163 L.Ed.2d 898 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Harvey also raises on appeal the issue of the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines or so-called \u201cFanfan\u201d error. Although the Government argues that Harvey has not preserved this issue for appeal, Harvey preserved the issue by raising an objection under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in the district court, and, therefore we review the district court\u2019s \u201cFanfan\u201d error under the harmless error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006) (a <em>Blakely </em>objection before the district court preserves a Fanfan error for appeal). The Government has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-66 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Harvey\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
