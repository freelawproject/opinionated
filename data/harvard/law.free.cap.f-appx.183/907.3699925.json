No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">The district court sentenced Clark under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Section 924(e) prescribes the penalty for a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) of being a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm and who has three earlier convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. Section 924(e)(1) prescribes a minimum sentence of not less than fifteen years; the authorized statutory maximum is life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Brame, </em>997 F.2d 1426, 1428 (11th Cir.1993) (concluding that the \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d under the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is life imprisonment). According to the PSI, Clark had four separate Florida convictions for either sale of cocaine or possession with intent to distribute. Because Clark had three or more convictions for serious drug offenses, he was subject to an ACCA section 924(e) enhancement; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 applied to the calculation of his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Clark objected at sentencing to the ACCA enhancement: he made a constitutional challenge to application of the enhancement without a jury finding on the prior convictions used to support the enhancement. Clark argued that the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), had been undermined by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny. In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument that recidivism must be treated as an element of an offense; a sentencing court could use prior convictions for sentencing enhancement purposes. <em>Id. </em>The district court implicitly rejected Clark\u2019s <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>argument, applied the enhancement and stated that absent the ACCA enhancement the court would have departed upward given Clark\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">On appeal, Clark once again maintains that considerable doubt exists about the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Clark maintains that the maximum statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tory sentence for a section 922(g) violation without the enhancement is 10 years; his 300-month sentence far exceeds this maximum. Clark concedes, however, that his sentence is without reversible error if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. And Clark acknowledges that we have held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding law, but he advances his claim so that the issue may be preserved for subsequent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We have rejected on many occasions arguments that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been, in effect, overruled by later Supreme Court decisions. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-75 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing decisions <em>post-Apprendi </em>and its <em>progeny </em>that affirmed the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres). </em>And though we have noted that recent Supreme Court decisions \u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>AlmendarezTorres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions,\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005), we have stated repeatedly that \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court specifically overrules <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we will continue to follow it.\u201d <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The Supreme Court has issued no decision overruling specifically <em>AlmendarezTorres; </em>it remains binding precedent. The district court did not err in using Clark\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
