Edwards reserved in his plea agreement the right to appeal the district court\u2019s suppression ruling. The record indicates that facts relevant to Edwards\u2019s standing were not at issue when the district court considered, and denied, Edwards\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>673 F.2d 554, 556-57 (1st Cir.1982). Therefore, we may consider the Government\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that Edwards lacked standing to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Edwards argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when officers conducted a search and that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). A person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only though the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person\u2019s premises or property has not had his Fourth Amendment rights infringed. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 133, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). The stipulated facts set forth in Edwards\u2019s plea agreement indicate that Edwards did not own the vehicle, and the record does not otherwise indicate that Edwards personally had an expectation of privacy in the vehicle. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>221 F.3d 789, 795 and n. 4 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, Edwards lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Regarding Edwards\u2019s challenge to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement, Edwards was an admitted purchaser and user of illegal drugs, and he admitted that he had been using illegal drugs for the last four to five days at the hotel where he was apprehended. Additionally, pseudoephedrine (a precursor to methamphetamine), a used syringe and spoon, and methamphetamine, were found in the vehicle with the hand grenades. Also, although Edwards later stated that he paid for the hand grenades, he originally told officers that he received methamphetamine in exchange for agreeing to dispose of the hand grenades. Possession of one gram or less of methamphetamine is a felony under Texas law. <em>See </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 481.102, 481.115; Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that Edwards possessed the hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>grenades in connection with his methamphetamine possession is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1199-1200 (5th Cir.1994). The district court therefore did not clearly err when it applied the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement to Edwards\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
