For the first time on appeal, Oliveros argues that the district court erred by giving him notice that his continued objection to the amount of drugs attributable to him, an amount to which he had already agreed in his written plea agreement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> would result in the court\u2019s denial of an offense-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Oliveros suggests that the district court\u2019s notice impaired his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We review objections to sentencing issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>See United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999). To prevail under this standard, Oliveros must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). <em>\u201cIf </em>all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Prior to sentencing, Oliveros signed a plea agreement in which he admitted that an element of the offense was \u201c[t]hat the object of the unlawful plan was to possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine as charged.\u201d Moreover, at the plea colloquy, Oliveros described his participation in the underlying conspiracy, as follows: \u201cI\u2019m guilty. I talked to the CS [confidential source]____ And I was the one who talked to the CS to get them together and carry out the transaction. That\u2019s why I am guilty.\u201d He further explained, \u201cThe quantity was ... what they actually had were three kilos. <em>But I am guilty because it goes back to the fact that I talked first about ten, and then, later, five. </em>But what we had was those three kilos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Oliveros offered to sell five kilograms of cocaine to a CS. During a recorded telephone conversation, when the CS indicated that he was interested in purchasing <em>ten </em>kilograms, Oliveros told the CS to \u201cget ready\u201d for the ten, in anticipation that it would be acquired. In another recorded telephone conversation, Oliveros told the CS that he was ready to deliver the first five kilograms, and that the other five kilograms would be ready for delivery in the upcoming week. After meeting with the CS, Oliveros canceled the transaction, refusing to finalize delivery and attempting to leave the area. Oliveros subsequently was arrested and three kilograms of cocaine were found in a hidden storage area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>in the \u201cengine block\u201d area (under the hood) of the vehicle he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The PSI recommended a base offense level of 32 based on Oliveros\u2019s responsibility for ten kilograms of cocaine, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a), 3El.l(b). With an adjusted offense level of 29 and a criminal history category II, and taking into consideration the 120-month mandatory minimum of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), Oliveros faced a Guidelines sentencing range of 120 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Oliveros objected to the assignment of responsibility for ten kilograms of cocaine, rather than three. Prior to the sentencing hearing, the district court issued a Notice to Counsel Regarding Sentencing (\u201cNotice\u201d), which informed Oliveros that he \u201cshould be prepared to discuss at the sentencing hearing why [he] should not lose the acceptance of responsibility deductions for his false or frivolous objection[ ] to the quantity of cocaine being at least the quantity to which he pled guilty.\u201d The Notice cited U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment 1(a), which provides the following: \u201ca defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, Oliveros withdrew the objection. The district court imposed a 120-month term of imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Oliveros now argues that the district court\u2019s issuance of the Notice infringed on his right to argue at the sentencing hearing that he was responsible for an amount (three kilograms) that was below the amount to which he agreed in his plea agreement and at the plea colloquy. This argument has no merit since it is well-settled that a district court may \u201cdeny a defendant a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 based on conduct inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, <em>even when that conduct includes the assertion of a constitutional right. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>127 F.3d 987, 989 (11th Cir.1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis added) (upholding the denial of an acceptance of responsibility reduction based on the defendant\u2019s objections to the PSI). This is so because a defendant\u2019s false denial of relevant conduct is \u201cinconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 667-68 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, based on Oliveros\u2019s objection as to drug quantity, even if the objection was based on a constitutional right, the district court was free to deny an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. If the district court would not have erred by denying the acceptance of responsibility reduction altogether, we fail to see how the court committed <em>plain </em>error by warning Oliveros that he could lose the reduction, thereby giving Oliveros the opportunity to withdraw the objection and retain the benefit of the reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">. Oliveros\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver in which he waived his right to appeal the sentence, including on the ground that the district court had erred in calculating the Guidelines range, except on certain specified grounds. The government states that it has not filed a motion to dismiss this appeal because it is arguable that Oliveros\u2019s claim is not a challenge to his sentence, but rather a challenge to the district court's procedures at the sentencing hearing, and because it is unclear whether Oliveros seeks a new sentencing hearing, a revocation of his plea agreement, or some other form of relief. We give appellant the benefit of the doubt and address the merits of his claim, rather than dismissing the appeal based on the waiver, because: (1) there is an argument to be made that the appeal does not fall within the express terms of the waiver, as conceded by the government; (2) the government does not seek application of the waiver and has already expended the resources to brief the case on the merits; and (3) application of the waiver would not be outcome-determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
