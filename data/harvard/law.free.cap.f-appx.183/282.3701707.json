Byrd was classified as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Byrd to 180 months of imprisonment, below the applicable advisory Guideline range of 262-327 months, based on the short period of time Byrd was involved in the conspiracy. On appeal, counsel filed an Anders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggests that the district court failed to comply with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in the guilty plea hearing. Byrd filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he asserts that the district court erred in not granting an offense level reduction for his minor role in the offense, and that the district court erred in not applying the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">Because Byrd did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the plea hearing transcript reveals that the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy that assured Byrd\u2019s plea was made both knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117, 120 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we find Byrd\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and properly accepted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">We have also considered the assertions of error in Byrd\u2019s supplemental brief and find them to be without merit. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Byrd\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>inform Byrd, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Byrd requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-21\">. <em>Anders v.
