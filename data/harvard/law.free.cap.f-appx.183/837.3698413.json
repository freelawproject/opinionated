After the district court sentenced him to prison for a total of 292 months, he lodged this appeal. He asks that we vacate his convictions, and direct the reinstatement of his plea of not guilty, on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel prior to and at the time he accepted the plea agreement and pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">Except in rare instances where counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is manifest on the cold record, we do not consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the direct appeal of a judgment of conviction. If appellant wishes to pursue this claim, he should move the district court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 proceeding will provide a forum for taking evidence concerning counsel\u2019s performance, including the advice he gave appellant in connection with his plea agreement with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">Since the only issue appellant raises in this appeal is whether counsel\u2019s performance passed Sixth Amendment muster\u2014 that is, he does not otherwise attack his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>convictions or sentences \u2014 the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
