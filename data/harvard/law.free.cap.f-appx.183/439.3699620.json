Hamm argues that the district court erred in determining that he should be held responsible for eight firearms and, concomitantly, that his base offense level should be increased by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B). The district court\u2019s findings on this issue are plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Consequently,- Hamm has not shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of the disputed adjustment was erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-24\">Hamm also contends that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility if this court concludes that he should not have received the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) adjustment. Because we reject Hamm\u2019s argument concerning the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) adjustment, we concomitantly reject his argument concerning acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-25\">Hamm\u2019s final contention is that he should have received an adjustment to his base offense level under the sporting purposes exception of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2). Hamm has not carried his burden of establishing that his possession of a firearm was for lawful purposes only. <em>See United States v. Shell, </em>972 F.2d 548, 552 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Cir.1992). Consequently, he likewise has not shown error, much less plain error, in connection with his argument that he was entitled to the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Hamm has shown no error in the judgment of the district court. That judgment is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
