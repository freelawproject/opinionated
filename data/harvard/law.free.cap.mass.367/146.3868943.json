The essential question for review, expressed in the terminology of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure effective July 1, 1974,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, that defense having been presented by the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. Rule 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Through the excessively adjectival allegations of the complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiffs\u2019 story emerges as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The plaintiffs (appellants here), eleven in number, are residents of the Charlestown area of Boston and members of an unincorporated association called \u201cConcerned Citizens of Charlestown.\u201d They complain of three named defendants (appellees here), Paul F. Amico, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>trustee of the \u201cPiemonte Family Trust,\u201d the Boston Redevelopment Authority (B. R. A.), and the city of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">For a considerable period of time prior to the events in suit, a corporation, Downtown Auto Parks, Inc., doing business under the name, \u201cOne Two Three Car Wash,\u201d owned and operated a car wash located at 294 Causeway Street in Boston. As of 1970, Evelyn P. Piemonte was the president, Gabriel F. Piemonte the treasurer, and Paul F. Amico the clerk, of the corporation. In December, 1970, the city of Boston acquired the car wash premises by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Much earlier, in 1965, B. R. A. had designed an urban renewal plan for Charlestown which was approved by the mayor and city council of Boston and in that connection a \u201ccooperation agreement\u201d was entered into between B. R. A. and the city. The renewal plan is in process of being carried to completion. In August, 1971, B. R. A. advertised the availability of a certain parcel \u201cC-2A1\u201d (the complaint places it in Charlestown, but without more exact location) for redevelopment as a commercial site. That month the Downtown corporation informed B. R. A. of its interest in relocating and in becoming the redeveloper of the parcel. Subsequently Evelyn P. Piemonte and Gabriel F. Peimonte submitted a proposal, which was later amended to name as the proposed redeveloper only Amico, as trustee of the Piemonte Family Trust, which is alleged to be a trust for the benefit of the grandchildren of Gabriel F. Piemonte. The proposal was for a car wash. The projected transaction aroused the opposition of the plaintiffs, among other local residents, because in their opinion the site was inappropriate for the proposed use. This view was communicated to B. R. A. Nevertheless B. R. A. voted on September 7, 1972, to designate Amico, as trustee, as redeveloper. The decision was advertised on November 8, 1972. Boston Redevelopment Authority withheld further action because of the continued protests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cConcerned Citizens,\u201d but, evidently after hearing them, it voted on April 5, 1973, to reaffirm the designation of Amico.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Searching for the sting of illegality in the allegations of the complaint, we find it suggested in two ways.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is an allegation that \u201c[t]he Urban Renewal Planners of Project R55 [for Charlestown] at no time filed an environmental impact study and a negative statement was never filed prior to commencing redevelopment activities in this area.\u201d The complaint also refers to the conflict of interest statute, G. L. c. 268A, and alleges that Gabriel F. Piemonte was at relevant times a member of the Boston city council, prohibited by \u00a7 20 (a), a criminal provision, from knowingly having a \u201cfinancial interest, directly or indirectly\u201d in a \u201ccontract\u201d made by a municipal agency of the same city.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Filed in April, 1973, shortly after B. R. A. finally designated Amico as redeveloper, the complaint prayed injunctive relief against this projected use of the parcel, and for good measure demanded damages against the defendants \u201cindividually and severally . . . for the time and expenses . . . [the plaintiffs] have incurred to prevent this harmful and unlawful relocation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The complaint is notably thin in its substance, as the judge may well have found in sustaining the demurrers. With respect to the abrupt allegation about \u201cenvironmental impact,\u201d the plaintiffs in their argument mentioned the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, effective January 1, 1970 (P. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852, codified as 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321, 4331-4335, 4341-4347 [1970]). It appears on the face of the complaint that the basic renewal plan long antedated the statute, and there are no averments that the particular proposal here in question, or any segment of the plan embracing the proposal, is so distinct from the plan as a whole and its performance so timed as to require separate treatment under the statute. Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>477 F. 2d 885 (1st Cir. 1973). Nor does the complaint indicate what the Federal involvement in the relevant part of the plan is supposed to be that would bring the statute into play. We may pretermit the question of a need to join the interested Federal agencies when the statute applies and is invoked.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also referred in argument to the State Environmental Policy Act (St. 1972, c. 781, \u00a7 2, codified as G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62), of which the section requiring the filing of environmental impact statements, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62, became effective July 1, 1973. The matter of the timing of performance is here also to the fore; not only the basic renewal plan but even the particular proposal and, indeed, the present suit, antedated \u00a7 62, and there are no saving averments in the complaint. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy. </em>364 Mass. 639, 659-661 (1974). Cf. <em>Secretary of Environmental Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authu. </em>366 Mass. 755 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>With regard to conflict of interest, under the provisions of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 (a), which allow a private action to rescind a transaction by a municipal agency infected by a violation of \u00a7 20 (a), that violation must have \u201csubstantially influenced\u201d the action taken by the municipal agency in the particular matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is a significant part of the gravamen, see <em>Crall </em>v. <em>Leominster, </em>362 Mass. 95, 106 (1972), but the present complaint does not include such an allegation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To return to \u00a7 20 (a) (quoted at n. 6 above), there is also a difficulty in the present case in making out the requisite \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the municipal employee. A trust described as one for the employee\u2019s grandchildren is not on its face a financial interest of the employee, direct or indirect (compare the situation in <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Clinton, </em>356 Mass. 426, 429-430 [1969]),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>pleader meant to charge that the trust was a fraudulent pretense on the employee\u2019s part, as an oblique remark in the complaint suggests, then the pleading was not ample enough, for according to the salutary special principle of Rule 9 (b), 365 Mass. 751 \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud . . . the circumstances . . . shall be stated with particularity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In considering whether this complaint can survive the motions to dismiss, we are mindful that the new Rules represent a sweeping overturn of attitudes toward pleading. For example, whereas under the previous dispensation in this Commonwealth \u201c [n]o intendment in favor of the pleader . . . [could] be made upon a demurrer,\u201d see <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy., supra, </em>349 Mass. at 563 (1965), quoting from <em>Walter </em>v. <em>McCarvel, </em>309 Mass. 260, 263 (1941), and pleadings were generally to be construed strictly against the pleader, see <em>H\u00e1wes </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>100 Mass. 216, 218 (1868), the contrary attitude is to be taken under the new Rules, as the Reporters\u2019 Notes under Rule 8 (a) (1) and (b) and elsewhere take pains to say. So also a complaint need not, as under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 7, Second (now repealed by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 157, except as to the District Courts), \"state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>concisely and with substantial certainty the substantive facts necessary to constitute the cause of action\u201d; it is now enough for the complaint to \u201ccontain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u201d (Rule 8 [a] [1], 365 Mass. 749). The reasons for the abandonment of the inherited stiff pleading requirements in favor of the simplified style of the new Rules are well known and need not be rehearsed here; they are explained by the Reporters, and have been often repeated in the decisions interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure upon which our Rules are based. We would be loath to renew the futile paper chase for the supposedly exact pleading, and shall resist any tendency so to interpret the new Rules contrary to their purpose and spirit. Nevertheless the Rules are not designed to encourage a plaintiff to put in a grievously murky complaint, without sufficient attention to its basis in the substantive law, in hopes of somehow finding something helpful to his case in the course of the discovery procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Although we have found much fault with the complaint, we cannot say that when the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel reexamine the facts and law they will be unable to state a claim. Cf. <em>Vogelaar </em>v. <em>H. L. Robbins &amp; Co. Inc. </em>348 Mass. 787 (1965). We recognize the public importance of the subject matter, cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hayes Intl. Corp. </em>456 F. 2d 112, 121 (5th Cir. 1972), and we give weight to the fact that the demurrers, which recited the then conventional battery of grounds, from failure to state a cause of action to multifariousness, were sustained without indication of reasons, see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>286 F. 2d 514, 515 (9th Cir. 1961).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ingly, we think it best to afford the plaintiffs an opportunity to reframe their complaint. For this reason, the decree appealed from will be reversed and the plaintiffs will have leave to file an amended complaint in the Superior Court within forty days of the date of the rescript.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendants may then move or answer according to the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\"> The defendants also answered, but as the bill was vague at essential points (see below) the answers were not substantially informative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> Appeal was not noted from the denial of this motion.

App. P. 1A, 365 Mass. 845 (1974), both entitled, \u201cTransitional Rule for Litigation in Progress on July 1, 1974.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> The pleader might have taken to heart Chief Justice Wilkins\u2019s remarks in <em>Moskow </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Authy. </em>349 Mass. 553, 562 (1965), cert. den. 382 U. S. 983 (1966), that nothing is added to a pleading by \u201cwords of belligerence,\u201d and that \u201crhetoric is not an adequate substitution for allegations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> See the preferred form of setting forth multiple claims (Rule 10 [b], 365 Mass. 752) or multiple statements of a single claim (Rule 8 [a] [2], 365 Mass. 749).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> Section 20 (a), as appearing in St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1, states in part: \u201cA municipal employee who has a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in a contract made by a municipal agency of the same city or town, in which the city or town is an interested party of which financial interest he has knowledge or has reason to know, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">As to the broad scope given \u201ccontract,\u201d see <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>352 Mass. 201, 202-204 (1967). That an elected official of a city is a \u201cmunicipal employee\u201d within the statute, see the <em>Conley </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 205; <em>Selectmen of Avon </em>v. <em>Linder, </em>352 Mass. 581, 583 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> There is a prayer that R. R.

It is not asserted or argued, for example, that the proposal for this parcel departs so far from any agreed plan for Charlestown\u2019s renewal that fresh approval by the mayor and council is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\"> <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Romney, </em>473 F. 2d 287 (1st Cir. 1973), cited by the plaintiffs, is not dispositive of this question in their favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> The text of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21 (a), is: \u201cIn addition to any other remedies provided by law, any violation of section two, three, eight, or sections fifteen to twenty, inclusive, which has substantially influenced the action taken by any municipal agency in any particular matter shall be grounds for avoiding, rescinding or cancelling the action on such terms as the interest of the municipality and innocent third persons require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The \u201cother remedies provided by law\u201d include that provided by \u00a7 21 (b) which gives the city or town a civil remedy. And as noted, violation of \u00a7 20 (a) is a penal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> The only allegation bearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d to assert the conflict of interest under \u00a7 21 (a) is their residence in Charles-town. In our recent decision regarding \u00a7 21 (a) in <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 534 (1974), the private plaintiffs could be said to suffer in a competitive sense as a result of the transaction tainted by the supposed conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A sidelight.is thrown on this point by \u00a7 19 (a) which (overlooking certain details) punishes a municipal employee who in his role as such employee participates in a matter in which to his knowledge he or \u201chis immediate family\u201d has a financial interest. \u201cImmediate family\u201d is defined by \u00a7 1 (e) as meaning \u201cthe employee and his spouse, and their parents, children, brothers and sisters.\u201d Grandchildren are not named. (Section 19 [a] is mentioned in the present complaint but there is no indication as to \u201cparticipation\u201d by Gabriel F. Piemonte.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Difficulties like those encountered in satisfying \u00a7 20 (a) reappear in any attempt by the'plaintiffs to support their claim by reference to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>clause in the \u201ccooperation agreement.\u201d Here the city of Boston undertook to \u201ctake steps\u201d to assure that no city official who \u201cexercises any functions or responsibilities in the review or approval of the Project\u201d shall acquire any \u201cpersonal interest, direct or indirect, in any property included in the Project Area, or in any contract or proposed contract in connection with the carrying out of the Project.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> Chapter 268A, \u00a7 23, sets out \u201cstandards of conduct\u201d for municipal (and other government) employees including in \u00a7 23 (d) a prohibition on their using or attempting to use their official positions to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others \u201cor [to] give the appearance of such action.\u201d The complaint refers to \u00a7 23 (d). Violation of the standards of <em>\u00a7 </em>23, however, calls for such \u201cappropriate administrative action\" as is \u201cwarranted.\u201d It appears, in addition, that the governmental unit or the employee may seek a declaration as to whether a \u201cstandard\u201d has been met. See <em>Selectmen of Avon </em>v. <em>Linder, </em>352 Mass. 581, 582-583 (1967); <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Clinton, </em>356 Mass. 426, 427 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> Our Rule 12 (b), last sentence, provides (although the parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure does not) that \u201c [a] motion, answer, or reply presenting the defense numbered (6) shall include a short, concise statement of the grounds on which such defense is based.\u201d This should not be allowed to degenerate into a formulary recital but should address itself to the real legal issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\"> As this is the result, it is immaterial as a practical matter whether we regard the complaint as failing to state a claim or as being \u201cso vague or ambiguous\u201d as to be vulnerable to a motion to make more definite and certain under Rule 12 (e). For the sparing use and rare success of attacks under Rules 12 (b) and (e) if the working philosophy of the new Rules is to be carried out, see the cogent discussions in Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1357 at 598-605, \u00a7 1377 (1969); Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 12.08, 12.21 (2d ed. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
