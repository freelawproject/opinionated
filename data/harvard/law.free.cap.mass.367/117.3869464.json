Bonito and owned by his employer, John J. Botti Co., Inc., skidded while descending a hill on Route 138 in Canton, crossed the center of the two-lane road, and collided with an oncoming Econoline van being driven by Mark R. Walter. Walter sustained personal injuries with connected medical expenses and loss of earnings, and, alleging negligence on the part of Bonito, brought the present action against Bonito and the Botti company. The plaintiff won a jury verdict in the Superior Court for Suffolk County on February 1, 1973, and the defendants by their bill of exceptions raise two points for review here; Should their motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence have been granted, and was it prejudicial error to allow the plaintiff, who had called the defendant Bonito as a witness, to impeach him by introducing in evidence the records of five prior convictions for motor vehicle violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">There were material differences between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 versions of the events leading to the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>lision. In his testimony the plaintiff said that at the time of the accident he was beginning to ascend a hill at about five miles an hour, that the weather was bad, a mixture of snow, sleet, and rain, and the road was wet with patches of ice and snow. He testified that the defendants\u2019 vehicle was descending the hill at not less than twenty and maybe up to thirty miles per hour, not slowing down, and when ten to twenty feet from the plaintiff\u2019s van slid sideways, crossed the center of the two-lane road and struck the left front of the plaintiff\u2019s van, pushing it back twenty to twenty-five feet. He said the defendants\u2019 truck was not equipped with chains but did have deep rib snow tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The defendant Bonito confirmed that the accident consisted of his truck skidding across the center of the road into the plaintiff\u2019s van, but he presented an explanation different from the plaintiff\u2019s in his accident report filed with the Registry of Motor Vehicles and in answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories, all introduced in evidence by the plaintiff, and also in his testimony under questioning by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Bonito said that when he reached the crest of the hill and began to descend some 100 to 150 feet from the accident scene, he both downshifted and applied his brakes; at that point he was going fifteen to twenty miles an hour but he slowed down as he approached the plaintiff\u2019s van (\u201cI applied my brakes to make the hill, because with trucks on the hill you\u2019ve got to go slow with them.\u201d). He testified that the road was wet, but that it was not raining or snowing at the time of the accident, which was about 11 a.m., and that he saw no icy patches and did not think there was any ice or snow on the road until he hit the icy patch that caused his truck to skid, turn sideways, and strike the plaintiff\u2019s van. After the skid began he blew his horn and tried to steer away in an attempt to avoid the collision. The van, he said, was not moved backward by the impact of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In the face of the conflict in the evidence \u2014 a conflict not resolved by photographs of the damaged vehicles introduced in evidence by the plaintiff \u2014 it was not error for the judge to decline to direct a verdict for the defendants. If the jury, evaluating the defendant Bonito\u2019s credibility, had chosen to believe him, they could have found that he was not negligent and that the collision arose from accident not reasonably avoidable. But believing the plaintiff, as evidently they did, the jury could conclude that the defendant Bonito was negligent in descending the hill at too high a rate of speed, with no attempt to slow down under conditions he observed as hazardous, making a skid likely, and with it a loss of control of the vehicle. The choice between believing the plaintiff and the defendant Bonito was one characteristically for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendants\u2019 second point is more compelling. As part of his affirmative case, the plaintiff called the defendant Bonito as his witness and, after eliciting testimony on the lines described, offered records of six convictions of Bonito in the District Courts for motor vehicle violations. These were: a 1970 conviction for driving in a break-down lane, resulting in a $5 fine; a 1969 conviction for speeding with a $15 fine; and 1964 convictions, stemming from a single incident, for drunkenness, which was filed, for operating under the influence of liquor, which resulted in a $100 fine, for operating to endanger, fined $20, and for leaving the scene of an accident, fined $20. These records were offered for the purpose of impeaching Bonito\u2019s credibility. The judge admitted the records with the exception of the conviction for drunkenness which had been placed on file. We are obliged to agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that the admission of these records was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The governing statute, G. L. c. 233, <em>\u00a7 </em>23, provides that \u201c[t]he party who produces a witness shall not impeach his credit by evidence of bad character, but may contradict him by other evidence, and may also prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony.\u201d In <em>Labrie </em>v. <em>Midwood, </em>273 Mass. 578 (1931), we held that the statute applied to a party who called his opponent as a witness: a plaintiff who had called a defendant as a witness was there held barred from impeaching his credibility by introducing a record of his prior conviction of crime. The court reasoned that \u201cthe whole purpose of introducing the record of the conviction of a witness of crime\u201d was to \u201cimpeach the credit of the witness by evidence of bad character,\u201d and so the statute covered. <em>Id. </em>at 582. To the proposition that prior criminal convictions go to prove bad character, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>361 Mass. 287, 301 (1972); McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43 (1972); Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 980 (Chadbourn rev. 1970); Leach and Liacos, Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence, 121-126 (1967). We are aware that there is much sentiment and strong argument for allowing a party to impeach his own witness just as he can attack the opposition\u2019s, see Uniform. Rules of Evidence, Rule 20, as found in 9A U. L. A. 607 (1965); Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 607, 28 U. S. C. App. (Supp. V, 1975) (as enacted by P. L. 93-595, January 2, 1975, effective July 1, 1975); Wigmore, op. cit., at \u00a7 899, and particularly does the argument appear cogent when one\u2019s witness is the adverse party, for here the fiction that by offering a witness one \u201cvouches\u201d for him is most vacuous. See Rule 43 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U. S. C. Appendix (1970); Wigmore, op. cit., at \u00a7 916. But regardless of what the degree of our own enthusiasm might be for such a rule, we do not consider ourselves free to adopt it by decision in defiance of the statute as previously interpreted. Rule 43 (b) of our new Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 806 (1974), departing from its Federal model which allows broad impeachment of the adverse party when called as a witness, expressly forbids impeachment in such a case \u201cby evidence of bad character\u201d; our rule thus accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23, as a datum and the Reporters\u2019 Notes to the rule cite \u00a7 23 and the <em>Labrie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Two, further points may, be mentioned. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 22, permits a party who calls an adverse party to \u201ccross-examine\u201d him. The <em>Labrie </em>case considered and rejected the possible argument that \u00a7 22 overcame \u00a7 23, and history supports the conclusion, for \u00a7 22 derived from St. 1870, c. 393, \u00a7 4, and in 1870 it was already settled law in the Commonwealth that for impeachment purposes previous convictions could only be shown by introduction of the records and not by cross-examination in the usual sense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quin, </em>5 Gray 478, 480 (1855); <em>Root </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>105 Mass. 22 (1870), a position which has indeed been repeatedly affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>196 Mass. 369 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arsenault, supra, </em>at 301; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Kremer, </em>360 Mass. 870 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 627 (1970). The second point, which the <em>Labrie </em>case also disposed of, is the possible argument that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, the general statute permitting use of convictions for impeachment, might override the more specific restrictions of \u00a7 23. The ancestor of \u00a7 21, St. 1851, c. 233, \u00a7 97, was enacted at a time when one still could not, impeach the credibility of one\u2019s own witness in any respect, see <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>15 Pick. 534, 544-545 (1835); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>97 Mass. 67, 67-68 (1867), consequently it would not make sense to read \u00a7 21 as detracting from a later statute permitting such impeachment in only limited ways.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> So it was error to allow the defendant Bonito to be impeached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>by the introduction of the records of his prior convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">It remains to decide whether the error was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial. We hold that it was. A limiting instruction was indeed given to the effect that the convictions were to be used only to impeach credibility, and, as Hennessey, J., noted, concurring in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 682 (1974), in logic, \u201cPrior convictions, even as applied only to the credibility issue, have little or no probative value in most instances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But we cannot fail to recognize that where, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>as here, the prior convictions relate to offenses similar to the tort at bar, there is an especially serious danger that a jury will disregard limiting instructions and allow the convictions to influence their deliberations as substantive evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, supra, </em>at 679-682 (concurring opinion of Hennessey, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>34 N. Y. 2d 371, 377 (1974). In this light, and considering the condition of the rest of the proof in the case, we cannot say that the defendants might not have prevailed if the records of conviction had been excluded. Hence a new trial is called for.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Labrie </em>v. <em>Midwood, </em>273 Mass. at 582 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> See, now, St. 1974, c. 502, approved July 9, 1974, adding to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, a provision that the record of conviction of a witness for a \u201ctraffic violation upon which a fine only was imposed\u201d shall not be shown to affect his credibility \u201cunless he has been convicted of another crime or crimes within five years of the time of his testifying.\u201d Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> Deciding this issue as we do, we do not reach the defendants\u2019 alternative argument that the conviction records should not have been admitted without a showing by the plaintiff that Bonito was represented by counsel in those proceedings. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Zayre of Beverly Inc. post, </em>125 (1975), decided this day. We point out, however, that in none of the cases involved was any penalty beyond a fine imposed, so that <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U. S. 25 (1972), which held unconstitutional the imposition of jail sentences where defendants in misdemeanor cases were not represented by counsel, does not apply. It follows that any argument for exclusion because of lack of counsel would be based, first, upon a claim that due process requires the provision of counsel in at least some misdemeanor cases even where no jail sentence is imposed, or, second, upon a claim of violation of Rule 10 of the General Rules, 347 Mass. 809 (1964) (now S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as amended, 355 Mass. 803 [1969], and Rule 79 of the Rules of the District Courts [1965]), requiring the provision of counsel for an indigent defendant, or a showing that counsel has been waived, whenever the defendant is \u201ccharged with a crime, for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed.\u201d See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Zayre of Beverly Inc., supra, </em>at 127, n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\"> The new Federal Rules of Evidence exhibit the modern trend toward rationalizing, and thereby limiting, the use of prior convictions to attack the credibility of a witness. Under Rule 609 (a) thp convictions admissible to attack credibility are confined to those involving dishonesty or false statement; also those punishable by death or imprisonment for. more than one year if the court decides that their probative value exceeds their prejudicial effect. The Uniform Rules of Evidence are even more restrictive; by Rule 21 only crimes involving dishonesty or false statement may be used. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>34 N. Y. 2d 371, 376-377 (1974), which discusses the use of prior convictions for impeachment purposes under a system in which the trial judge has discretion to admit or exclude such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>evidence after a balancing of its probative value as to the defendant\u2019s credibility against its prejudicial effect. The opinion notes that \u201c [t]he commission of an act of impulsive violence, particularly if remote in time, will seldom have any logical bearing on the defendant\u2019s credibility ... at the time of trial. Further, proof of such a crime may be highly prejudicial .... To the extent, however, that the prior commission of a particular crime of calculated violence or of specified vicious or immoral acts significantly revealed a willingness ... to place ... his individual self-interest ahead of principle or of the interests of society, proof thereof may be relevant to suggest his readiness to do so again on the witness stand .... [Qjuestions as to traffic violations should rarely, if ever, be permitted.\u201d [See note * above.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"><em> Subilosky </em>v. Commonwealth, 358 Mass. 390 (1970), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boudreau, </em>362 Mass. 378 (1972), which found the erroneous admission of prior convictions harmless error, involved situations in which other convictions for serious crimes had been properly admitted, so the improperly admitted records had little additional impact. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Zayre of Beverly Inc., post, </em>125 (1975). Hence they are inapplicable here. Nor was the defendant Bonito so impeached by variations between his testimony at trial and interrogatories and an accident report he had filled out that the added impeachment was harmless. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>475 F. 2d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 1973), cert. den. 414 U. S. 870 (1973), in which the admission of prior convictions for impeachment, even if improper, was held to be harmless error in view of the \u201cenormous damage already done to his credibility\u201d by other impeaching evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
