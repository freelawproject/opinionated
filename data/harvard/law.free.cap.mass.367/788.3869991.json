S. 109 (1972), the Boston Licensing Board (board) promulgated rules and regulations similar to those upheld in the <em>LaRue </em>case, governing sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>explicit conduct in establishments licensed by the board to sell liquor. The Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) decided that the board was not authorized to make such rules and regulations. We hold that the challenged authority exists under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as amended through St. 1971, c. 477, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The board brought this bill for declaratory relief in the Superior Court, and the judge reported it without decision to the Appeals Court on the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts. The case was transferred to this court under G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 10 (A). We summarize the agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">On December 20, 1972, the board issued the regulations set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 12, 1973, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>board held a public hearing to receive comments on the regulations, and it subsequently promulgated the regulations. On February 7, 1973, the board held a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>to determine whether a licensee, the United Food Corporation of Boston, had violated the regulations, found a violation, and imposed a three-day suspension of the licensee\u2019s alcoholic beverage license. The licensee appealed to the commission, which issued a decision directing the board to vacate the suspension, declaring that the regulations were without force and effect, and requiring that they be \u201cproperly voided\u201d by the board and that \u201cproper notice\u201d be sent to all licensees. No petition for judicial review of that decision has been filed. The commission has not issued regulations of this type and does not intend to.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">1. <em>Declaratory relief. </em>The decision of the commission was subject to judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 229 (1962). The commission argues that it is not appropriate to grant declaratory relief to a party which has ignored its statutory right of direct review, citing G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 3, and <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 326 (1964). We agree that the present case would not be an appropriate vehicle for review of the license suspension or of the commission\u2019s order that the suspension be vacated. But we think that judicial review of the board\u2019s regulations by a bill for declaratory relief is not precluded. G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 2. Cf. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>338 Mass. 368, 377 (1959); <em>Westland Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>352 Mass. 374, 380-383 (1967); <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>363 Mass. 474, 502 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">2. <em>Intervention by the licensee. </em>The licensee whose suspension had been ordered vacated sought to intervene in the action in the Superior Court. Leave to intervene was denied, and the licensee filed a bill of exceptions, included by the judge in his report. Since the decision in this case will not affect the vacated suspension, and since we do not pass on the constitutional rights of licensees subject to the regulations in question, we hold that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>was no abuse of discretion in denying the petition for intervention. See <em>Dillaway </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>256 Mass. 568, 576-577 (1926); <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170, 178 (1932). Cf. Mass. R. Civ. P. 24, 365 Mass. 769 (1974). A decision on the allocation of powers between the board and the commission can properly be made without the participation of all the licensees and others who may be indirectly affected. See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of the County of Norfolk, ante, </em>345, 349 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">3. <em>Constitutional issues. </em>The constitutional climate in which the statutes and regulations must operate is of course an important part of the context in which they must be interpreted. We therefore take note of the fact that the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, leaves some room for the regulation of sexually explicit conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. <em>California </em>v. <em>LaRue, </em>409 U. S. 109, 118-119 (1972). Cf. <em>Paladino </em>v. <em>Omaha, </em>471 F. 2d 812, 814 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>Oberhelman </em>v. <em>Schultze, </em>371 F. Supp. 1089, 1091 (D. Minn. 1974), affd. without opinion, 505 F. 2d 736 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>Manos </em>v. <em>Green Bay, </em>372 F. Supp. 40, 46-47 (E. D. Wis. 1974); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Fremont, </em>377 F. Supp. 327, 342 (D. Neb. 1974); <em>Cheetah Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Lake, </em>22 Ill. App. 3d 306, 312-313 (1974); <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commn. </em>34 Ohio St. 2d 244, 248-249 (1973); <em>Seattle </em>v. <em>Hinkley, </em>83 Wash. 2d 205, 206-208 (1973). Constitutional limitations seem to have been applied more restrictively, at least in some courts, to regulation of similar conduct not associated with alcoholic beverages. Compare <em>Starshock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shusted, </em>370 F. Supp. 506 (D. N. J. 1974), reversed without opinion 493 F. 2d 1401 (3d Cir. 1974) (nude dancing after liquor license revoked); <em>Salem Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>501 F. 2d 18, 20-21 (2d Cir. 1974), probable jurisdiction noted sub nom. <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Salem Inn, Inc. </em>419 U. S. 1119 (1975) (\u201ctopless\u201d dancing prohibited in any \u201cpublic place\u201d), with <em>Crownover </em>v. <em>Musick, </em>9 Cal. 3d 405, 427-428 (1973) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>(valid regulation of nuda conduct in public places), cert, den. sub nom. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sacramento, </em>415 U. S. 931 (1974); <em>Wayside Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia Beach, </em>215 Va. 231, 236 (1974) (regulation of nudity in public places valid as applied to licensees selling beer and wine).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">We do not think, however, that we should pass on the commission\u2019s claim that the board\u2019s regulations violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Ordinarily constitutional questions may only be litigated by persons whose interests are affected. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brunelle, </em>361 Mass. 6, 10-11 (1972), and cases cited; cf. <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>362 Mass. 417, 445 (1972). The commission\u2019s constitutional rights are not in issue. Like the Supreme Court in the <em>LaRue </em>case, we think we should reserve for another day the question whether some specific application of the regulations may engender problems of constitutional dimension. See 409 U. S. at 119 n. 5 (1972). Similarly, we think we should not now pass on such questions as whether their possible application in one hypothetical case would render them overbroad and hence invalid in another hypothetical case, how far they are severable, or whether they are underinclusive so as to discriminate unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">4. <em>The boards authority. </em>The regulations are made applicable to licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages to be served and drunk on the premises granted pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 12, as amended. Such licenses are granted by the board, \u201csubject to the prior approval of the commission.\u201d See <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>295 Mass. 572, 575, (1936); <em>Coyne </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>312 Mass. 224, 228-229 (1942). License fees and hours of operation are fixed by the board within statutory limits. The \u2018licensing authorities,\u201d defined in G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 1, as either the board or the commission or both, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u201cmodify, suspend, revoke or cancel\u201d a license. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 64, as amended through St. 1964, c. 64. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the board may appeal to the commission, but if the commission disapproves the board\u2019s action it can only recommend the action to be taken by the board. Except in certain cases of reappeal to the commission, the board is not bound to follow the recommendation of the commission. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, as amended through St. 1971, c. 477, \u00a7 4. <em>Largess </em>v. <em>Nore\u2019s Inc. </em>341 Mass. 438, 442 (1960). <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd. </em>357 Mass. 699, 702 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The commission has comprehensive powers of supervision over licensees. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>334 Mass. 613, 617 (1956). It may make regulations for \u201cclarifying, carrying out, enforcing and. preventing violation of\u201d statutory provisions for the \u201cmethod of carrying on the business of any licensee,\u201d and \u201cfor the proper and orderly conduct of the licensed business.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1971, c. 478. Licenses are also revocable for violation of \u201cany regulation adopted by the commission or <em>local licensing authority\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), and local licensing authorities are to make \u201creasonable requirements\u201d with respect to \u201cthe conduct of business by any licensee.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, quoted in part in fn. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The only relevant regulation of the commission which has been brought to our attention is its Regulation 21: \u201cNo licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall permit any disorder, disturbance or illegality of any kind to take place in or on the licensed premises. The licensee shall be responsible therefor, whether present or not.\u201d It is not contended that the board\u2019s regulations are inconsistent with that rule or repugnant to it. Cf. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 152-157 (1973). The fact that the commission could issue regulations on the same subject does not of itself invalidate the board\u2019s regulations. Cf. <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 136 (1949). We do not find in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>statutes the limitation of purpose, asserted by the commission, to the preservation of public safety and good order. \u201cThe liquor traffic has long been recognized as a source of danger to the public welfare, health and safety, and regulations governing the conduct of the business and frequently going to the extent of prohibiting it altogether have been sustained.\u201d <em>Supreme Malt Prod. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>334 Mass. 59, 61 (1956). Cf. <em>Liggett Drug Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>License Commrs. of No. Adams, </em>296 Mass. 41, 50 (1936). We think the board\u2019s regulations are within the scope of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">5. <em>Opportunity for hearing. </em>Regulations of the commission are to be made in accordance with G. L. c. 30A, and are to be approved by the Governor. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 71. Before a regulation is adopted or amended, the commission must ordinarily give notice and hold a public hearing, or give notice and afford interested parties an opportunity to present data, views or arguments. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. <em>Kneeland Liquor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn. </em>345 Mass. 228, 233-235 (1962). The board is not a State \u201cagency\u201d subject to G. L. c. 30A. <em>Dixie\u2019s Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd. </em>357 Mass. 699, 702 (1970). The statute authorizing board regulations, however, refers to regulations adopted \u201cafter opportunity for a hearing.\u201d See fn. 1 <em>supra. </em>The commission contends that it has the implied duty to insist that the board meet minimum procedural standards similar to those the commission itself must meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We do not pass on this claim of the commission, since we think there is no showing that the board failed to provide the required \u201copportunity for a hearing.\u201d Although the board\u2019s regulations were first issued on December 20, 1972, to be effective January 1, 1973, a public hearing was held on January 12, 1973, and the commission concedes that the board subsequently promulgated the regulations. The transcript of the hearing is before us and shows an undisputed statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>by counsel that notice was sent about December 27 to every licensee under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, to every city of Boston elected State representative and senator, and city councillor, to other city and State officials including the commission, and to various neighborhood groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The transcript discloses police testimony, much like that described in the <em>LaRue </em>opinion, 409 U. S. 109 (1972), as to the connection between explicit sexual entertainment in bars and the commission of various crimes. It also discloses statements of views by or on behalf of several public officials, including the chairman of the commission, by representatives of neighborhood groups, and by an attorney for the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. No one spoke on behalf of a licensee, but it seems clear that there was an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">6. A judgment is to be entered in the Superior Court declaring that (1) the board\u2019s regulations are within the scope of its authority, (2) the procedure of the board in adopting them was proper, and (3) these declarations are made without prejudice to any claim of violation of constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\"> General Laws c. 138, \u00a7 23, reads in part: \u201cThe terms licenses and permits, wherever employed as substantives in this chapter, are used in their technical sense of a license or permit . . . revocable . . . for any violation of this chapter or <em>any regulation adopted by the </em>commission or <em>local licensing authority </em>consistent with the terms of this chapter after opportunity for a hearing. . . .
