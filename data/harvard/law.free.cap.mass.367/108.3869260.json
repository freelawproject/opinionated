O\u2019Leary, an employee, from a final decree of the Superior Court denying his claim for a doubling of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>member of the Industrial Accident Board, after hearing, ordered that compensation be paid for periods of the employee\u2019s partial and total incapacity, increased by an amount based on the number of the employee\u2019s dependents, and for disfigurement and loss of function of his lower left extremity. The single member also found that the employee\u2019s injury was suffered <em>\u201cas a </em>result of the serious and willful misconduct of ... a person intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence for this employer, within the meaning and intent\u201d of c. 152, \u00a7 28. Because of the latter finding, the single member ordered the insurer to double the amount of compensation to be paid. The findings and decision of the single member were affirmed and adopted by the reviewing board (board). The insurer appealed this decision to the Superior Court, where a judge of the Superior Court ordered the matter recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board for completion of findings and rulings by the board on certain motions and objections made by the insurer. The board ruled adversely to the insurer on all issues raised. Thereupon another judge of the Superior Court entered a final decree in essence (a) in accordance with the decision of the board in all respects save for the question of doubling compensation under \u00a7 28, and (b) denying the \u00a7 28 claim. The employee appealed therefrom to the Appeals Court and then applied to this court, for direct appellate review which we granted. See Mass. R. A. P. 11, 365 Mass. 854 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The sole question before us is whether the judge of the Superior Court erred in denying the \u00a7 28 claim for double compensation. He was obligated, and this court on appeal is obligated, to sustain the decision of the board, which supersedes that of the single member, <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 679 (1970), if there was any evidence to warrant the conclusion that the employee was \u201cinjured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51, 52 (1913). <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 10 (1914). <em>Randolph\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 245, 248 (1924). The courts should sustain the determinations of the Industrial Accident Board where-ever possible. <em>Bajdek\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 325, 326 (1947). <em>Vaz\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 495, 497 (1961). <em>Wax\u2019s Case, </em>357 Mass. 599, 601-602 (1970). Applying the foregoing standards of review, we turn to a consideration of the evidence before the single member which bears on the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">At the time of his injury, the employee was employed as a journeyman iron worker for Steel Products Erectors, Inc., the employer. On March 15, 1965, the employee and two fellow workers, James Gallagher and Louis Latino, went to work in Ipswich on the construction of the St. Joseph\u2019s Church. All three men were members of Local 57 of the International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers (union local). The contract between this union local and this employer provided, \u201cWhen two (2) or more employees are employed, one shall be selected by the employer to act as foreman and receive a foreman\u2019s wages, and the foreman is the only representative of the employer who shall issue instructions to the workmen.\u201d On the Ipswich job, Latino was the foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The employee, the foreman and Gallagher, arrived at the construction site about 8 a.m. on the day in question, their first day of work on this particular job. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>steel beams with which the men were to work were delivered to the job site, they had attached to them so called shear connectors or steel clips.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The shear connectors had been attached to the beams when they were fabricated in the shop of a steel fabricating company, certain officers of which were also officers of the employer in this case. Shear connectors are steel angle irons of approximately three inches in height, two inches in width, and three-eighths of an inch in thickness. They are affixed to the beams every six inches lengthwise and every two inches width wise. These devices are attached to the beams to serve as bonds for the concrete which is poured around the beams after they are erected. The contract between the employer and the union local provided, under the heading \u201cSafety Provisions\u201d: \u201cit shall be mandatory for all employers to have all shear connectors such as studs and/or spirals field erected and secured. In the event shear connectors are shop erected and secured the shear connectors will be removed prior to field erection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">When the beams were delivered to the Ipswich job site, both the employee and Gallagher pointed out to the foreman that the beams had the shear connectors attached and that they were not supposed to work with beams in such condition. Although there was equipment at the site to detach the shear connectors, the foreman responded by telling the employee and Gallagher, in effect, that they had to choose between erecting the steel or going home. The single member found that \u201c[t]hey obeyed the foreman\u2019s order to do the work rather than risk dismissal.\u201d No attempt was made to remove the shear connectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The employee sustained his injury sometime around 2 p.m. , when he and Gallagher were working on a three-section set of beams. This set of beams had one end on the ground and the other on a wall, and was attached to a crane. The employee was tightening the bolts on one part of the beam when the foreman directed the crane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>operator to disconnect the crane. In testifying as to what happened then, the employee said, \u201cWhen this beam flopped over, these shear connectors caught my pants. They went through the outside pants and inside pants, my long drawers and cut my leg right along my knee.\u201d Two bones in his leg were broken, and he sustained other injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The board found that it was the shear connectors which caught the employee\u2019s pants and which cut his leg. The board further found that the foreman, Latino, was entrusted with and exercising powers of superintendence for the employer on the day of the injury, and that his \u201corder to get on with the work without removing the shear connectors . . . involved conduct of a quasi-criminal nature . . . [because the order was made] with the knowledge that it was likely to result in serious injury and [because the order] displayed a wanton and reckless disregard of the probable consequences.\u201d In support of this last finding, the board took notice that the Commissioner of Labor and Industries had, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4) (c), determined that structural steel and iron workers were engaged in a hazardous occupation. The board similarly noted that the contractual safety provisions such as the one involved in this case \u201care arrived at only after lengthy discussions and hard bargaining and serious study . . . [and] take into consideration the lessons learned from the practical experience gained in the building trades.\u201d This conclusion, in connection with a finding that all parties to the contract were aware of the shear connector provisions, served as a basis for the ultimate finding that \u201cthe injury suffered by O\u2019Leary was as a result of the serious and willful misconduct of Latino, a person intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence for this employer, within the meaning and intent\u201d of c. 152, \u00a7 28. We are of opinion that the board was fully warranted in making the quoted finding. It necessarily follows that the judge in the Superior Court erred in denying the \u00a7 28 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The insurer contends that the evidence did not warrant the findings as to Latino, the foreman, (1) that he was a person regularly entrusted with and exercising powers of superintendence, (2) that he ordered the employee and Gallagher to work on the beams without removing the shear connectors, or (3) that his conduct amounted to \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. We do not agree with these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In asserting that the foreman could not have been found to be a person regularly entrusted with and exercising powers of superintendence, the insurer emphasizes the word \u201cregularly,\u201d stating, \u201cLatino was an acting foreman pursuant to the provisions in the agreement with the union, and not a regular or full-time foreman in the service of the employer.\u201d This argument is without merit. At the time the employee sustained his injury, Latino had been chosen by the employer to act as foreman under a contractual provision requiring the employer to select a foreman to be \u201cthe only representative of the employer who shall issue instructions to the workmen.\u201d The word \u201cregularly\u201d has meanings which vary considerably from context to context. <em>Lustenberger </em>v. <em>Boston Cas. Co. </em>300 Mass. 130, 135 (1938). See Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1913 (1961). In the particular statute here at issue, the word is simply designed to distinguish between a mere fellow worker who occasionally acts in a limited supervisory capacity and a person who is officially designated by the employer as the person in charge of a particular facet of the employer\u2019s business and who is actually engaged in a supervisory capacity at the time of the employee\u2019s injury. See <em>Thayers Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 40-41 (1962). Comparable language in the Employer\u2019s Liability Act, G. L. c. 153, \u00a7 1, has been interpreted by this court as primarily intended to differentiate between a mere volunteer and one actually designated by the employer as a super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>intendent. Continuity of service in the capacity of superintendent is not required. Cf. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>127 Mass. 98, 99-100 (1879).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The insurer\u2019s second major argument is that the evidence did not support the board\u2019s finding that the foreman ordered the employee and Gallagher to work on the beams with the shear connectors attached. The employee\u2019s actual testimony on this point was that after he told the foreman they were not supposed to work on such beams, the foreman said that they had a job to do and \u201cif you didn\u2019t want to do it, you know what you can do \u2014 leave.\u201d Gallagher testified that the foreman gave him much the same answer when he told the foreman the beams had shear connectors on them and were not supposed to be handled in such condition. And even the foreman testified that he told both men, \u201cEither we have to start erecting this steel or we will go home. That\u2019s all.\u201d We hold that on this evidence the board was warranted in finding that the foreman\u2019s words amounted to an order to work on the beams with the shear connectors attached at the risk of dismissal, at least for that day or that job, if they did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The insurer\u2019s third major contention is apparently that, even assuming that the employee prevails on points one and two just discussed, the foreman\u2019s actions could not have been found to be serious and wilful misconduct. In <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 432, 433-434 (1946), we said: \u201cThe \u2018serious and wilful misconduct\u2019 which lays the foundation for double compensation under \u00a7 28 of the act \u2018is much more than mere negligence, or even than gross or culpable negligence. It involves conduct of a quasi criminal nature, the intentional doing of something either with the knowledge that it is likely to result in serious injury or with a wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.\u2019 <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 10 [1914]. <em>Riley\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 55, 56-57 [1917]. <em>Beckles\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 272, 273 [1918]. <em>Randolph\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>247 Mass. 245, 247 [1924]. <em>Durgin\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 427, 430 [1925]. <em>Silver\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 222, 224 [1927]. <em>McCarthy\u2019s Case, </em>314 Mass. 610, 612 [1943].\u201d See also <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 39-40 (1962). In <em>Scaia\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 434, we also referred to Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 500 (1934), which we construed as requiring that \u201cnot only must the actor intentionally do the act upon which he is sought to be charged, but also he must know or have reason to know . . . facts \u2018which would lead a reasonable man to realize that the actor\u2019s conduct not only creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to the other but also involves a high degree of probability that substantial harm will result to him.\u2019\u201d This principle of the original Restatement has been reaffirmed and clarified in Restatement 2d: Torts, \u00a7 500 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It is our opinion that under the foregoing principles the board was warranted in concluding that the foreman\u2019s actions amounted to serious and wilful misconduct. As determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Industries under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4) (c), structural steel and iron work is hazardous. The contract between the employer and the union local to which the foreman, the employee, and Gallagher belonged prohibited the field or job site erection of beams with shop-attached shear connectors. The board found, as it was warranted in doing, that this contractual prohibition was, as labeled in the contract, a safety provision. It is not difficult to understand why it would be dangerous to work with large steel beams covered by sharp steel protrusions. Indeed, the concern of those who drafted the contract for these protrusions proved to be justified by the injury to the employee. The board found that the foreman was exercising the powers of superintendence when he ordered the men to work with these dangerous beams at the risk of dismissal even after they complained to him about the shear connectors; that \u201cthe employer, the union, its members, supervisors and foremen were aware of the provisions for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>removal of the shear connectors prior to field erection and that not to remove them was a potential danger\u201d; and that the equipment for removing the shear connectors was at the job site. For a person exercising powers of superintendence deliberately to order workmen to disregard an important contractual safety provision, after the danger is called to his attention and when the means for complying with that safety provision are at hand, is an act which warrants a finding of serious and wilful misconduct within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The decree is affirmed except in so far as it denies the employee\u2019s claim for a doubling of his benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The portion of the decree denying the claim under \u00a7 28 is reversed. As to that claim, a new decree is to be entered awarding the employee double benefits. See <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185 (1974). Costs and expenses of this appeal shall be determined and allowed by a single justice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-13\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 529, \u00a7 9, provides: \u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence, the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled. In case the employer is insured, he shall repay to the insurer the extra compensation paid to the employee. If a claim is made under this section, and the employer is insured, the employer may appear and defend against such claim only. The employment of any minor, known to be such, in violation of any provision of sections'Sixty to seventy-four, inclusive, or of section one hundred and four of chapter one hundred and forty-nine shall constitute serious and wilful misconduct under this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
