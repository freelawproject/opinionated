Bradley. Bradley was the owner and operator of a motor vehicle in which the minor plaintiffs, Gary R. Forrest and Martin McNamara, riding as guests, sustained injuries as a result of a one car accident. In a suit against Bradley alleging gross negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>gence, the plaintiffs recovered judgments. The insurance company refused to pay the judgments on the ground that Bradley\u2019s policy did not include coverage for guest occupants, which is optional under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C. This suit was then brought on the theory that the uninsured motor vehicle coverage in the policy (now mandatory under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L) applies to passengers injured in an automobile for which there is no guest coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Under \u201cCoverage U\u201d of the policy, an uninsured automobile is defined as \u201can automobile with respect to the ownership, maintenance and use of which there is no bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy applicable at the time of the accident with respect to any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such automobile . . ..\u201d The policy further states that \u201c\u2018uninsured automobile\u2019 shall not include: (i) an automobile defined herein as an \u2018insured automobile,\u201d\u2019 and \u201cinsured automobile\u201d is defined to include an automobile \u201cwith respect to which a specific coverage U premium has been charged under this policy.\u201d There is no question that a \u201cCoverage U\u201d premium was charged under the policy issued by the defendant with respect to Bradley\u2019s automobile. Accordingly, that automobile falls under the definition of \u201cinsured automobile\u201d and perforce is excluded from the definition of \u201cuninsured automobile.\u201d There is no ambiguity in these definitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>American Fid. Co. </em>350 Mass. 542 (1966), in which this court interpreted a policy containing essentially the same general definition of \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d and concluded that an automobile carrying some liability insurance but no guest coverage was an uninsured automobile with respect to the injured plaintiff, who was a guest at the time of the accident. However, in the <em>Whitney </em>case the plaintiff sued under a policy issued to her father (which covered her), not under the policy issued to the owner of the automobile in which she was injured. The general language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>defining \u201cuninsured automobile\u201d in her father\u2019s policy was qualified by a specific exclusion for an \u201cinsured automobile\u201d as in the policy in this case but the court had no occasion to consider that exclusion since it had no application to the facts presented. Thus, the <em>Whitney </em>case is not authority for recovery under the policy issued with respect to the automobile involved in this single car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We do not agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that permitting the insurer to deny recovery under \u201cCoverage U\u201d in these circumstances is contrary to the legislative intent as interpreted in the decision to make uninsured motor vehicle coverage mandatory. Were we to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 theory an insurer would be liable for injuries to guests in an automobile with respect to which there was no guest coverage even though the statute makes guest coverage optional according to whether the insured chooses to purchase it. It follows that the plaintiffs\u2019 bill should have been dismissed, and that the decree of the Superior Court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
