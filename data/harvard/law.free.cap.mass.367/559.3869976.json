He appealed to the Superior Court where he moved to dismiss the matter against him on the ground that \u201cChapter 272, Section 53 fails to define with specific particularity the proscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>conduct and is therefore unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions.\u201d The motion was denied. Thereafter the defendant, following trial in the Superior Court, was found guilty and was given a six-month suspended sentence in the house of correction with probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Elaborate argument is made here that the defendant, as stated in the bill of exceptions, was charged under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, which proscribes \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior,\u201d and that \u00a7 53 is unconstitutionally vague. The principal briefs of both parties argue the issue of constitutionality of that section on First Amendment to the United States Constitution and other grounds. However, the record of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston discloses that the defendant was convicted of \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behaviour,\u201d the exact language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. The same language was used in the complaint. As the Commonwealth points out, it is the substance of the complaint that governs, and that is determined by the language in the body of the complaint itself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>116 Mass. 339, 340 (1874). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 495-496 (1971). A complaint phrased in the statutory form, as was this complaint, is sufficiently detailed to apprise the defendant of the particular offense charged. G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 355 (1939). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>358 Mass. 672, 676 (1971). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hare, </em>361 Mass. 263, 266-268 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Any further information thought necessary could have been obtained through a motion for a bill of particulars under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 40. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 34; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bessette, </em>345 Mass. 358, 360 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valleca, </em>358 Mass. 242, 244 (1970). No question is raised concerning the constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. Therefore the defendants conviction under \u00a7 16 is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
