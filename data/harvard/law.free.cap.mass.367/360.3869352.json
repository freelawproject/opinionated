L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>c. 58A, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1969, c. 692,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from decisions of the Appellate Tax Board (the Board) denying abatements of corporate excise taxes paid under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32, for the taxable years 1963 through 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The taxpayer is in the business of lending money. Its loans, represented by promissory notes, range in amount from $2,000 to over $1,000,000 and are made for personal and business purposes. Some of the notes are unsecured. The collateral for secured notes consists, inter alla, of real estate mortgages, chattel mortgages, assignments of accounts and pledges of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In each of the taxable years in question, the taxpayer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed timely applications with the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation (Commissioner) for classification as a domestic securities corporation entitled to favorable tax treatment under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each, of the applications was denied by the Commissioner. For each of the years, the taxpayer filed corporation excise returns in which it computed the excise under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, as a domestic securities corporation. For each of the years, the State Tax Commission (Commission) gave notice to the taxpayer of its intention to assess a tax on the increased taxable net income and, thereafter, assessed an excise computed under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32. The assessed excises were paid,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>abatement were filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Each of the applications was deemed to be denied by operation of law by reason of the failure of the Commission to act thereon prior to the expiration of six months from the date of filing. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 6. The taxpayer<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> then initiated timely appeals to the Board from such denials. The appeals were consolidated for hearing before the Board under the formal procedure. The taxpayer filed requests for rulings of law. On November 1, 1972, the board issued its decisions sustaining the position of the Commission. On November 9, 1972, the taxpayer entered a request for \u201cFindings of Fact and Report.\u201d The Board promulgated its \u201cFindings of Fact and Report\u201d on January 4, 1974. These appeals followed. The amount in controversy exceeds $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">1. General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38B, as amended by St. 1962, c. 756, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 60,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides favorable excise tax treatment for every domestic business corporation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cwhich is engaged exclusively in buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker.\u201d In these appeals, the taxpayer asks us to focus narrowly on the question whether promissory notes are securities within the meaning of G. L. c. 63, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u00a7 38B. This, it urges, was the sole question addressed by the Board, and is the sole question properly before this court. If promissory notes are, indeed, such securities, the taxpayer claims that, because it exclusively dealt in and held promissory notes, it must be held entitled to an abatement of the corporate excise. The Commission responds that the true issue is a broader question whether a corporation engaged in the taxpayer\u2019s various business activities can be classified as a security corporation under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. The Commission argues that the Board was correct in finding that the business of the taxpayer was lending money and not holding and dealing in securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Commission\u2019s formulation of the issues of the case is the correct one. It is true that, under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, this court cannot \u201cconsider any issue of law which does not appear to have been raised in the proceedings before the board.\u201d <em>Assessors of Dover </em>v. <em>Dominican Fathers Province of St. Joseph, </em>334 Mass. 530, 535 (1956). However, the broad question whether the taxpayer\u2019s activities qualified it for classification as a security corporation entitled to beneficial tax treatment under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, was raised in the Board proceedings. The reasoning of the Board in its opinion was not confined to the narrow definitional issue whether a promissory note is a security. In reaching its decisions, the Board examined the taxpayer\u2019s business to determine if the business met the statutory requirement. It found the taxpayer\u2019s business to be \u201clending money\u201d and not \u201cinvesting, reinvesting, or trading in securities.\u201d Moreover, the taxpayer\u2019s own \u201cRequest for Rulings of Law,\u201d granted in this respect, identified the issues in the case in the same expansive vein as the Commission does: \u201c1. The only issues raised by the evidence in this matter are: . . . (2) whether Industrial Finance Corporation was engaged exclusively in buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities during the period 1963-1967; and (3) whether Industrial Finance Corporation is entitled to be taxed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>security corporation in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L. Ch. 63, Sec. 38B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">2. \u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Accord, <em>Lincoln-Sudbury Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Brandt-Jordan Corp. of New Bedford, </em>356 Mass. 114, 117-118 (1969). \u201cWhere the [legislative] intent is clear, the statute, if reasonably possible, must be construed to carry out that intent.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 32, 36 (1949). From the legislative history of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, and commentary on that history, it is plain that a corporation such as the taxpayer which actively engaged in secondary financing<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and making loans is not within the class of corporations intended to be benefited by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. This class of corporations includes <em>only </em>those corporations which acquire securities for investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Two annual reports of the Commissioner provide insight into the legislative intent in enacting G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. In the annual report wherein the initial enactment of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B (St. 1929, c. 359, \u00a7 1), is proposed, the Commissioner explained the need for the provision. Under the heading, \u201cSecurity Investment Corporation,\u201d he urged that domestic \u201ccorporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>having primarily investments in securities\u201d receive tax advantages to offset tax benefits which could be achieved by incorporation in other States and to encourage them to incorporate under Massachusetts law. 1929 House Doc. No. 14, p. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In his report two years later, the Commissioner, while proposing an amendment to the law, specified those corporations within the coverage of the statute: \u201c <em>Security Corporations. </em>\u2014 By the passage of chapter 359 of the Acts of 1929 the Legislature of Massachusetts undertook to deal with the problem of the so-called investment trust which had incorporated, and which in taxation did not lend itself to the tax laid generally against domestic business corporations under which corporation laws the security companies were obliged to incorporate, by providing that the tax on security corporations should be the same as that paid by an individual under the Massachusetts income tax law. These corporations dealing exclusively in securities for their certificate holders seemed clearly to be entitled to treatment which was accorded the individual.\u201d 1931 House Doc. No. 115, p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The commentators agree with the quoted position of the Commissioner that investment trusts which had incorporated were the intended beneficiaries of St. 1929, c. 359, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. Philip Nichols wrote that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, benefits a \u201cnewly created class of corporations engaged in the business of buying, selling and holding securities, sometimes called \u2018incorporated investment trusts.\u2019\u201d Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts 611 (3d ed. 1938). Accord, Barrett and Bailey, Taxation, \u00a7 842 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The incorporated investment trust supplies an investment vehicle for its stockholders. The stockholders contribute to the corporate pool of capital for investment and receive the advantages of investment diversification and expert management. See <em>Aldred Inv. Trust </em>v. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>151 F. 2d 254, 260 (1st Cir. 1945), cert. den. 326 U. S. 795 (1945); Note, 41 Col. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Rev. 270 (1941). One authority has characterized the investment trust as \u201can agency (i.e., it may be a corporation, a common law trust . . .) by which the combined funds ... of different participants . . . are placed in securities . . . showing a distribution of risk . . . such as to introduce the Taw of average\u2019 in protection of the principal; and which aims solely at the safe and reasonably profitable employment of the subscribed investment funds while definitely avoiding any and all of those responsibilities of control, management, finance, direction or special interest which are sometimes tied in with investment.\u201d Robinson, Investment Trust Organization and Management, 13-14 (Rev. ed. 1929). The essential function of these trusts is, thus, <em>investment </em>in portfolio securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Recent amendment has broadened the applicability of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. In 1966, St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 60, imposed a specific less onerous excise on a \u201cregulated investment or bank holding company under the Federal Internal Revenue Code.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The bank holding company, which may exercise control and management responsibility, does not fit the above mentioned definition of the investment trust, but now is entitled to benefit from G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B. Nevertheless, the bank holding company is a company which <em>invests </em>in securities. We believe that amendments to the statute contain no indication that the Legislature intended to extend G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, to corporations which do not invest in securities. We hold that to qualify under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, the corporation engaged exclusively in buying, selling, dealing in, or holding securities on its own behalf must do so for investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The taxpayer is not an incorporated investment trust or other corporation whose business is making investments in securities. The taxpayer lends money in the daily course of business and obtains promissory notes to evidence its loan transactions. The taxpayer may best be characterized as a \u2018\u201cbusiness that has for its object the acquisition of gain\u2019\u201d through daily transactions and face-to-face business dealings rather than as a \u201ctrust [or corporation] for investment\u201d which conserves and augments capital and provides income through judicious acquisition and retention of securities. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>215 Mass. 1, 12 (1913). Cf. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>335 Mass. 431, 434-435 (1957). Though, in some circumstances, promissory notes may constitute \u201csecurities\u201d under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B, when held for investment by a company whose business is investment, we do not now reach that issue. The taxpayer manifestly does not hold its promissory notes for investment in the necessary sense (cf. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>363 Mass. 589, 594 [1973]) and cannot qualify for advantageous excise treatment under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38B.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The decisions of the Appellate Tax Board are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-14\"> Merritt, Chapman and Scott Corporation is Industrial Finance Corporation\u2019s successor in interest through successive mergers.
