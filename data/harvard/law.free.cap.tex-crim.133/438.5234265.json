No witness testified that there was not affixed to the containers a stamp showing the payment of the tax due the State of Texas. Moreover, there was no proof that there was not affixed to said containers an affidavit showing that the whisky had been withdrawn from a container of whisky on which the taxes had been paid. Manifestly, the evidence is not sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The affidavit for the search warrant was made on information and belief. We are of opinion that the facts and circumstances set forth therein are not sufficient to constitute probable cause. It follows that appellant\u2019s objection to the testimony of the officers touching the result of the search should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u2022 The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
