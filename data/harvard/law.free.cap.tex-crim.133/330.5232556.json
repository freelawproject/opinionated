Appellant and a woman named Willie Mae Hanks testified that this was their home, and they lived there, and had no other home. In our judgment this place was clearly either a home or a barroom, and the fact of the bed room having a curtain hanging over an open doorway leading into the barroom, could not throw over it the sanctity of a home thus closely connected with appellant\u2019s barroom, it being so immediately and closely connected thereto as that one could reach in the door from behind the bar and pick up the bottle of whisky found therein, as testified to by some of the witnesses. These premises and two rooms were so intimately and closely connected as to impress them both with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>character of a barroom, and not with the charactertistics of a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">Appellant next complains relative to the indefiniteness and Vagu\u00e9iiess of the statute under which he was prosecuted, because the same prohibits the possession of whisky <em>at or near </em>the premises wherein wine and beer are legally sold, and contends that the phrase \u201cor near\u201d renders the statute so uncertain as to offend against Article 6 of the Penal Code of 1925, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u201cWhenever it appears that a provision of the penal law is so indefinitely framed or of such doubtful construction that it can not be understood, either from the language in which it is expressed, or from some other written law of the State, such penal law shall be regarded as wholly inoperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The word \u201cnear\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201cwithin a little distance from; close or upon.\u201d In our opinion the word \u201cnear,\u201d if too indefinite, could be eliminated, and we would still have left the possession of whisky \u201cat\u201d the premises, and we are constrained to believe that the word \u201cat\u201d as herein used is practically synonymous with the word \u201con,\u201d which is the identical word found in the information herein. We do not think the addition of the words \u201cor near\u201d would render the article herein proceeded under as in contravention of the Constitution if we were to hold them to be thus vague and indefinite, especially in view of Art. 667-22, P. C., of Vernon\u2019s Texas Statutes, 1936, which provides that if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word contained in the general liquor law, of which this section is a part, should be held to be unconstitutional, then such holding should not affect the remaining portions of said act, but the legislature declares that it would have passed such remaining portions, despite such invalidity, which saving clause would leave us an active statute, in the words used in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The appellant further complains of a search of his living apartment without a warrant therefor; and in the light of what we have heretofore said there would seem to be no distinction between the place where appellant had his bar and sold wine and beer, and the place where he and this woman slept. If there was any question about the legality of such search, such has been cured, so we think, by the testimony of the appellant himself who testified: \u201cThis is my whiskey and the inspector found it out there at 1111 Gladys Street; he went in my bedroom and got it, found it at that address and I was selling beer and wine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>there.\u201d See Ross v. State, 11 S. W. (2d) 516, and authorities there cited. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In a supplemental brief the appellant lays down the proposition that because of the change in the law, relative to the possession of whisky at a place where wine and beer were legally sold, as shown by Vernon\u2019s Penal Code, Art. 666-3, (c), that all prosecutions under such law would necessarily fall unless a saving clause was found in a later law, same being House Bill No. 5, Regular Session, Forty-fifth Legislature, which became effective September 1, 1937. A close reading of the two enactments is convincing that practically the only change, outside of the use of more concise terms and definitions in the last enactment, is the change of the words \u201cat or near the premises\u201d to the phrase \u201con the licensed premises,\u201d the only practical difference being a substitution of \u201con\u201d for \u201cat or near\u201d; and in our opinion the words at and on are practically synonymous, and as used herein mean the same thing. We also note that the punishment is identical in each enactment, and under the authority of Art. 16, Penal Code, 1925, which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201cIf an offense be defined by one law and by a subsequent law the definition of the offense is changed, no such change shall take effect as to the offenses already committed; but one accused of violating the first law shall be tried under that law,\u201d and also Fox v. State, 127 Texas Crim. Rep., 22, \u2014 we are of the belief that this appellant, although tried on April 19, 1937, under the previous liquor law, is punishable thereunder at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In accordance with the views herein expressed this cause is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
