There is but one bill of exception in the record relating to the court\u2019s action in overruling his plea of former jeopardy. The bill within and of itself fails to contain sufficient facts to support his plea and in the absence of a statement of facts the bill cannot be properly appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has heen examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b161-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b161-14\">MORROW, Presiding Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A12\">The opinion affirming the .judgment of conviction was rendered June 25, 1937. The appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing was received by the clerk of this court on July 22, 1937, which was 27 days after the rendition of the original opinion. It is a well-settled rule of this court that motions for rehearing v must be filed within fifteen days after the date of the original opinion or some good reason given for the failure to do so. See Smith v. State, 75 S. W. (2d) 449; Rice v. State, 93 S. W. (2d) 1149; Smith v. State, 100 S. W. (2d) 359; 4 Tex. Jur., p. 510, sec. 357. In our examination of the motion for rehearing filed by counsel for appellant, we have failed to find any reason for the failure to file the motion within the prescribed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The motion for rehearing having been filed too late for consideration, it is therefore overruled. \u2022\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
