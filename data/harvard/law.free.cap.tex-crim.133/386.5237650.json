In support of the conclusion announced in the original opinion herein, we cited the case of Stevens v. State (page 333 of this volume), delivered on October 13, 1937, where a similar question as here presented was thoroughly and extensively discussed by this court, and upon authority of that case, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
