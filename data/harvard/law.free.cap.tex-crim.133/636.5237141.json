I knew he had killed Frank when he brought the gun back and said everything was all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We quote from Ex parte Goode, 59 S. W. (2d) 841, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\u201cWe do not agree that appellant is held without bail upon his uncorroborated confession. While a confession should be corroborated, it is not required that the corroborating evidence be of such cogency as to establish the commission of the crime by the accused. The rule prevailing in this State is that, there being evidence of death by criminal agency, the confession of the accused is available to aid the proof of the corpus delicti including the criminal agency of the accused. See Johnson v. State, 94 Tex. Cr. R. 184, 249 S. W. 1056.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In our judgment the above quotation is applicable to this case. Under the facts it seems to us that the proof is evident that the deceased was killed unlawfully; that the accused is the guilty agent; and that he would probably be punished capitally if the law is administered. See Ex parte Peddy, 118 Texas Crim. Rep., 175, 42 S. W. (2d) 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
