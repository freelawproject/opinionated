E. Lawrence, </em>of Eastland, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-17\"><em>Lloyd W.

There is nothing in the record which indicates that this was the appellant\u2019s second offense. Hence, the instruction hereinabove quoted was not authorized by any testimony and discloses fundamental error, which requires a reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">In support of what we have said, we refer to the case of O. E. Alexander v. State, decided by this court on the 24th day of November, and not yet reported (page 276 of this volume).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the trial court be reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
