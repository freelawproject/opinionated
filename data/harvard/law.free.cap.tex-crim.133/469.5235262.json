He gave notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals and his bond pending appeal was fixed in the sum of $7,500. He is unable to make bond in the amount mentioned. After a hearing upon a writ of habeas corpus the district judge declined to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the amount of said bond and remanded relator to the custody of the sheriff. Hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Under the circumstances reflected by the record, we are of opinion that bail pending appeal in the sum of $5,000 is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The judgment is reversed and bail granted in the sum of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and bail granted in the sum of $5,000.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
