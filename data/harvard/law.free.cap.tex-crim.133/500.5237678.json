It appears from the affidavit that, prior to appellant\u2019s trial in the present case, he had been convicted in a federal court and sentenced to a term in the Leavenworth penitentiary. The affidavit of the deputy sheriff recites that his information as to appellant\u2019s death was received from federal authorities. In short, the affidavit is based entirely upon information and belief.
