We are constrained to overrule appellant\u2019s contention that there is a fatal variance. We quote from 4th Words and Phrases, Third Edition, page 697, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u201cAn indictment alleging assault with intent to kill by cutting the person injured with a \u2018knife\u2019 was sustained by proof that prosecuting witness was either cut with a knife or a razor; \u2018knife\u2019 being a generic term which would include \u2018razor,\u2019 meaning any instrument consisting of a thin blade of steel, and having a sharp edge for cutting fastened to a handle. May v. State, 162 S. W., 43, 44, 110 Ark. 432.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">It is shown in bill of exception No. 2 that in his argument to the jury the county attorney stated that the witnesses for the State all agreed on the main details of what had happened on the occasion of the assault; and that there was no conflict in the record as to the facts. Further, counsel used language as follows: \u201cThe defendant has not denied \u2014 .\u201d Before the last sentence was concluded appellant\u2019s counsel objected and the court sustained the objection, instructing the jury not to consider said statement nor to consider as a circumstance against the appellant his failure to testify in the case. We think the bill of exception in its entirety shows a direct reference to the failure of the appellant to testify, and under the mandatory provisions of Art. 710, C. C. P., a reversal of the judgment of conviction must follow. See Jackson v. State, 87 S. W. (2d) 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Graves, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
