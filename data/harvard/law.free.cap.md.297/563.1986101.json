In the process we once again are involved with the matter of hypnotically enhanced testimony, this being the fifth of a series of cases presenting that issue. <em>See State v. Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, 464 A.2d 1028 (1983); <em>State v. Metscher, </em>297 Md. 368, 464 A.2d 1052 (1983); <em>Simkus v. State, </em>296 Md. 718, 464 A.2d 1055 (1983), and <em>Grimes v. State, </em>297 Md. 1, 464 A.2d 1065 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">James Arthur Calhoun was convicted by a Montgomery County jury of first degree, premeditated murder in the death of Philip Metz (principal in the first degree), murder in the first degree (felony murder) in the death of David Myers (principal in the second degree), attempted murder of Douglas Cummins, two violations of the handgun law, robbery with a deadly weapon, and storehouse breaking. A jury sentenced him to death for the murder of Metz. Life imprisonment was imposed for the murder of Myers. He was sentenced to thirty years for the attempted murder of Cummins. The sentence for each of the handgun violations was imprisonment for fifteen years. He was sentenced to twenty years on the robbery charge and to ten years on the count for storehouse breaking. All sentences imposed are to run consecutive to each other except for the sentence for storehouse breaking which is concurrent. The case reaches us by virtue of the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 414 which states that whenever the death penalty is imposed we shall review the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">i The facts</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The facts are not in dispute. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 828 g the parties have entered into an agreed statement of facts. We shall repeat only so much of the grisly details of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>this incident as are necessary for a clear understanding of the case and our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The W. Bell store is located at 1130 New Hampshire Avenue in White Oak, Montgomery County. Banging noises coming from the area of the Bell store were heard by a neighbor across the street at approximately 11:00 p.m. on March 26, 1981. She saw shadows in the area of the roof at the back of the store. The neighbor notified her father, who went outside their home with a flashlight to investigate. He saw people leaving. She saw a car, which looked like a hatchback, parked across the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">An employee of Electro Protective Corporation testified that at 6:16 a.m. on March 27,1981, both the safe alarm and the perimeter alarm at the Bell store were activated. He notified the police; Douglas T. Cummins, Jr., Bell\u2019s assistant manager; and David W. Myers, an employee of Electro. Officer Philip Carl Metz, the police officer covering that beat on that particular day, was dispatched to the Bell store.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Cummins testified that at approximately 6:20 or 6:25 a.m. on March 27 he received a telephone call from Electro. He arrived at the store at about 7:00 a.m. at which time he saw a white station wagon with Electro\u2019s name on the door in front of the store. He observed a late model two-door black Cadillac on the other side of the parking lot. A black male in the front seat was the sole occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The technician in the Electro vehicle identified himself to Cummins. Cummins drove around the store and noticed that the outside of the building appeared to be secure. Officer Metz arrived on the scene at about 7:15 a.m. Cummins unlocked Bell\u2019s door with a set of master keys. He, Officer Metz, and Myers entered the building. They first checked the merchandise area. Then they proceeded to the cashroom. It had two doors, both of which supposedly could be opened only from the inside. Cummins put a key into the door. Upon his opening the door Officer Metz stepped in front of him to enter. At that moment Cummins noticed \"a shoulder and about half of a back of an individual standing to the right of the doorway.\u201d Metz was pulled into the doorway as another, shorter individual armed with a pistol jumped into the hallway area. Cummins did not see the place from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>shorter man came. Myers drew his gun and stumbled back into a hallway door when he was shot. Cummins said he realized he had been shot in the upper shoulder area of his chest. After thirty to forty-five seconds the taller man opened the door and dragged Cummins into the office. Cummins at that point observed Metz lying on the floor and bleeding from the head. Cummins said that although he saw or heard no evidence of a third person he had no idea whether there might have been other individuals there who had left through another door by the time he was dragged into the room. He asserted that the shorter man shot him and he could only assume that it was the taller person who shot Metz.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Cummins complied with the taller man\u2019s order to open a combination safe. He was then asked by that same person to open a second safe. He was hit on the left side of his head with a pistol when he reached for his wallet which contained the combination to the second safe. Cummins said that after he failed twice in his efforts to open the second safe this taller person cocked a pistol, put it to the side of Cummins\u2019 head and informed him that if he did not open the safe that time he was a dead man. He succeeded in opening the safe. He was then told to sit on the floor. His wrist was handcuffed to a file cabinet drawer. He heard his assailants scramble up through the ceiling of the office \"and then back down on the other side.\u201d He pulled himself onto a chair, pulled the file drawer from the cabinet, carried the drawer by its handle to a telephone in the loading dock area, and called the police. After failing to detect a pulse from Myers\u2019 neck, he went to the door and waited for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Cummins testified that both of the men that he saw were wearing stocking masks which covered their entire heads. Both men wore gloves on their hands. Cummins observed gaps between the sleeve cuffs and the top of the gloves of these persons from which he determined they were black.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">James Adcock testified that while working as a plumber on the fourth floor of a building next door to the Bell store, at approximately 7:00 a.m. on March 27,1981, he looked out the window and saw two black males running across the parking lot. He said they \"skipped\u201d over a fence, jumped over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>a wall and went into a parked \"brown or maroon-looking car\u201d that then drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Evidence to connect Calhoun with the crime included that of an accomplice who testified pursuant to a plea agreement. His testimony included a description of an attempt by him and another to break into the Bell store through the roof shortly after midnight on the morning of this incident. They were frightened away when they noticed someone watching them with a flashlight from across the parking lot. He related how later, in the early hours of that morning, he and his associates encountered Calhoun, discussed the hole they had put in the Bell roof, and worked out a plan for entering the store. They then waited for the manager to arrive so that the robbery could be effected. He described the operation in detail including mention of weapons, a description of the stocking masks used and their source, and testimony as to the amount of money taken and its division. There was substantial other evidence adduced in addition to that of the accomplice including testimony concerning casts made of footprints found in the area. Two of these casts matched one of the shoes of the accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Other relevant facts will be set forth as we review the points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">ii Hypnotically enhanced testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Lt. James Roby of the Montgomery County Police Department was asked to conduct hypnotic interviews with Adcock and Cummins to ascertain if they could recall any details of the crime which they had not previously related to the police. Adcock was hypnotized on the day of the crime. Cummins was hypnotized on April 13. An audiotape recording was made of the hypnotic session with Adcock. The session with Cummins was placed on video tape. Dr. David Stern, a licensed clinical psychologist whose qualifications we mentioned in <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. 670, and <em>Metscher, </em>297 Md. 368, compared Adcock\u2019s and Cummins\u2019 prehypnosis statements with the tapes of their hypnotic sessions and concluded that hypnotically enhanced memory was not present as to either Adcock or Cummins.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Prior to hypnosis Adcock made statements to three different police officers. He set forth what he observed while working as a plumber in a building next to the Bell store. He described two black males, apparently teenagers, whom he saw running across the parking lot toward a car. On one occasion he pointed to a burgundy colored Datsun 310 and said the vehicle looked very similar to the one he had seen. On another occasion he indicated that the car in question was a dark, chocolate brown, Honda-type, \"sawed-off\u201d foreign car. He described where it was parked. His posthypnotic testimony at the motion to suppress hearing was consistent with the prehypnotic testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Cummins was first interviewed on the morning of the incident while being prepared for surgery. He was interviewed twice the day after surgery and again on April 2. He described in substantial detail the incidents in question. On April 6, a photographic array of seven pictures was exhibited to Cummins. At first he said he could not identify anyone. Later he touched the photograph of Calhoun and said that the shape of the head was very similar to that of the taller of his assailants but that he would be better able to tell if he had a full view of the person. Subsequently, he tapped Calhoun\u2019s photograph and said that of the seven, \"that\u2019s who I\u2019d put my money on.\u201d His posthypnotic testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress was consistent with the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The trial judge stated in pertinent part relative to the motion to suppress Adcock\u2019s and Cummins\u2019 testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\"I further find that [the hypnotist] was objective in the application of the technique; that he did not suggest by leading questions or interrogation what the answer should or should not be. I further find that if it is not the test, that it certainly should be. You do not go merely on the episode itself. You should have somewhat of what I will refer to as a self-verification or self-corroboration, and that is statements that were made prior to the hypnosis and what statements were made during hypnosis. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>there is a discrepancy between the two, then there must be a determination by the trier of fact as to whether or not those discrepancies were introduced in some manner by hypnosis, and may in fact be confabulation to the extent therefore the witness should not be allowed to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\"If that were true that should not preclude the witness from being allowed to testify or some testimony as to their factual recitation prior to hypnosis. How that is accomplished in a case by case basis may present some substantial difficulty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\"The next question was post hypnotic suggestion employed. There has been no suggestion \u2014 post hypnotic suggestion other than relaxation of the witness, indeed in both of the witnesses. I don\u2019t know why in the world Mr. Adcock needed to be relaxed. Apparently he was never relaxed from the hypnosis. He didn\u2019t vary one degree. I find no evidence of post hypnotic suggestion. I find the absence of post hypnotic suggestion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\"I find from observing the tape that when compared with the statements given prior to the hypnotic episode, that there has been no suggestive or confabulation during the hypnotic episode, and therefore, that Mr. Cummins should not be precluded from testifying; that the fact that he was hypnotized goes to the weight to be given by the jury as to that question. It therefore is going to require the availability of all of the expert\u2019s testimony before the trier now, the trier of fact, the jury, and although the Court suggests that it is a trial court\u2019s obligation to produce those witnesses for the defendant or before the jury, it would not appear that I could call them as Court witnesses over the objection of the defendant, because it could well have a reverse effect, that if the jury were to hear the fact that the witness was hypnotized, and believe that hypnosis in fact made it more likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that he was telling the truth, it would be detrimental to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\"In any event I think the fact that hypnosis was used should be fully exposed as was done in Martin. So it leads up to the motion to declare Mr. Adcock and Mr. Cummins incompetent per se to testify, the Court denies that motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In his brief and at oral argument Calhoun makes much of the fact that at one point prior to hypnosis, when asked if he could identify either individual, Cummins said, \"To be honest, I doubt it[,]\u201d but \"[a]t trial, however, he identified [Calhoun] without hesitation as the only person inside the cash office when the door opened.\u201d This overlooks the fact that prior to hypnosis he selected the picture of Calhoun and indicated he would put his money on it as that of his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Maryland Rule 886 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\"When an action has been tried by the lower court without a jury, this Court will review the case upon both the law and the evidence, but the judgment of the lower court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">That rule is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s determination that there was no significant variance between the prehypnotic and posthypnotic statements of Adcock and Cummins. We do not find the determination of the lower court in that instance to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">We considered the whole matter of hypnotically enhanced testimony in <em>Collins, </em>296 Md. 670. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">\"We see no reason why a person should not be permitted to testify in court in accord with statements which it clearly can be demonstrated he made prior to hypnosis. Such is not then hypnotically enhanced testimony. This seems to be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>accord with the majority view. We do not go so far as to spell out the exact procedures which must be followed to clearly demonstrate that such statements were made prior to hypnosis. One method certainly might be to follow the guidelines laid down by the Arizona court in <em>[State ex rel.] Collins [v. Superior Court, etc.], </em>132 Ariz. 180, 210, [644 P.2d 1266 (1982),] which we have heretofore quoted. Since one cannot possibly envision all possible situations in which statements prior to hypnosis might be demonstrated to accord with posthypnotic testimony, we deem it wise not to attempt to spell out each and every condition or possibility for demonstrating reliability. To do otherwise is to risk omission of acceptable solutions which do not occur to us.\u201d 296 Md. at 702-03.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It was clearly demonstrated that the Cummins and Adcock testimony did not depend upon hypnosis. Cummins identified Calhoun\u2019s photograph prior to hypnosis. Even if he had made no courtroom identification of Calhoun his extra-judicial identification would have been admissible in evidence. <em>Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 177, 443 A.2d 78 (1982); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 291, 206 A.2d 138 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">When this case was tried the trial court and counsel did not have available what we have said in <em>Collins. </em>It is noteworthy, however, that an audiotape was made of the hypnotic interview of Adcock and a video tape made of the hypnotic interview of Cummins. Moreover, tape recordings were made of some but not all of the prehypnotic interviews with Cummins.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The trial judge\u2019s ruling here was in accord with <em>Collins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">iii Refusal to strike a juror for cause</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Calhoun contends that the trial court erred and abused its discretion in refusing to strike for cause juror 58. When the jurors were interrogated on their voir dire as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>they, their families or friends had been the victims of crime, juror 58, Ralph DeMarco, responded that his wife\u2019s wallet was stolen the year before on L Street in Washington, D. C., that his wife\u2019s parents and the DeMarcos\u2019 next door neighbors both were burglarized within the previous two years, and that a close friend was robbed at gunpoint on Connecticut Avenue about two years before. He was asked, \"As a result of any of those instances, would that in any way affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in this case?\u201d He responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Later DeMarco was questioned individually as to his prior knowledge of the case. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\"I read the accounts of people being apprehended a few months ago. I remember a few things about him. I can\u2019t remember anything specifically about this particular defendant. ... I think one of them had been in prison. One had a girlfriend who he claimed was an alibi. She refused to give him an alibi. It may have referred to some other trial. I think it was this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">He earlier had been asked whether he had \"any feelings on today\u2019s criminal justice system, the courts, crime, sentencing and defendants\u2019 rights.\u201d He stated, \"I think that a lot of people are being let off. Most crimes, I think, are committed by repeater offenders and that sort of thing.\u201d DeMarco affirmed that he could be \"a fair and impartial juror in deciding this particular case only on the facts and evidence presented.\u201d The trial judge overruled a challenge for cause. One of Calhoun\u2019s peremptory challenges was then exercised. Calhoun contends that the refusal of the trial judge to grant his challenge for cause effectively reduced the number of his peremptory strikes from twenty to nineteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">There is both a short and a long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contentions. The short answer is that counsel said, \"[W]e are satisfied[,]\u201d after the last juror was sworn subsequent to the exhaustion of Calhoun\u2019s peremptory challenges. The State then announced its satisfaction. Thus, the point is waived. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Glover, Robinson &amp; Gilmore v. State, </em>273 Md. 448, 452-53, 330 A.2d 201 (1975). However, because of the nature of the case we shall give the \"long answer\u201d to Calhoun\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">What the Supreme Court said in <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961), has significance here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\"It is not required, however, that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity, and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. <em>Spies v. Illinois, </em>123 U.S. 131; <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U.S. 245; <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>[98 U.S. 145].\u201d 366 U.S. at 722-23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Chief Judge Alvey spoke in a similar vein for this Court in <em>Garlitz v. State, </em>71 Md. 293, 18 A. 39 (1889). The accused in that case was convicted of the first degree murder of his wife on one of the public streets of Cumberland. Three jurors indicated that they had formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused based upon newspaper accounts and rumor. Each of them, however, indicated that he could give the accused a fair and impartial trial according to the evidence that might be adduced at the trial. Chief Judge Alvey said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\"All persons accused of crime are entitled, as matter of right, to be tried by a fair and impartial jury, selected according to law. About this there can be no question. But the question is constantly presented in practice, by what standard or test is the condition of the mind to be tried, in order to obtain with reasonable certainty, the requisite degree of fairness and impartiality in those called upon to serve as jurors? In this age of intelligence and universal reading, with newspapers in the hands of every man with sufficient intelligence to qualify him to sit upon a jury, to require that jurors shall come to the investigation of crime committed in their community, no matter how notorious or atrocious it may be, with minds wholly unaffected or unimpressed by what they may have read or heard in regard to it, is simply to maintain a rule or standard by which every man who is fit to sit upon a jury may be excluded. Many crimes are committed under circumstances of such flagrant atrociousness as to impress and shock the whole community, the ignorant as well as the intelligent; and if such rule of exclusion were applied, it would, in many cases, render the impaneling a jury impossible. Such state of things could never be contemplated by the law. All men, by natural instinct, are supposed to be more or less biased against crime in the abstract; and every member of the community, against which crime has been committed, is naturally interested and impressed with the circumstances of crimes of atrocious character. But the natural bias, however atrocious the crime, can never be regarded as a sufficient cause for the disqualification of the juror. The intellectual, as well as the moral impressions, produced by the reading or hearing of reports or statements of facts in regard to the commission of crime are such that intelligent minds cannot resist; indeed, in many cases the mind receives the impressions from such statements intuitively. But these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>impressions, with intelligent, fair minded men, are always of a hypothetical nature, resting upon the supposition of the truth of what they have read or heard. The minds of such men always remain open to the correction of former impressions, and remain entirely impartial, with power to hear and determine upon the real facts of the case, without the least bias in favor of former impressions, whatever they may have been. And therefore, in our present state of society, all that can be required of a juror, to render him competent, is, that he shall be without bias or prejudice for or against the accused, and that his mind is free to hear and impartially consider the evidence, and to render a verdict thereon without regard to any former opinion or impression existing in his mind, formed upon rumor or newspaper reports. Whenever it is shown that such is the state of mind of the juror, he should be held to be competent; and such is the rule as laid down by this court in <em>Waters v. State, </em>51 Md. 430 [(1879)]. In that case it was said 'that the opinion which should exclude a juror must be a fixed and deliberate one, partaking in fact of the nature of the pre-judgment.\u2019 \u201d 71 Md. at 299-300.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>Garlitz </em>was quoted at length for the Court by Judge Hammond in <em>Grammer v. State, </em>203 Md. 200, 211-12, 100 A.2d 257 (1953), <em>cert. denied, </em>347 U.S. 938 (1954), and again by Judge Barnes for the Court in <em>Bristow v.

That chapter extensively revised the criminal law of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">By Calhoun\u2019s \"express direction, it is contended that this provision placed an affirmative obligation on the trial court to bar the testimony of the accomplice Smallwood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The ancient practice of approver is explained in 4 W. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*329:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\"But there is another species of confession which we read much of in our ancient books, of a far more complicated kind, which is called <em>approvement. </em>And that is when a person indicted of treason or felony, and arraigned for the same, doth confess the fact before plea pleaded, and appeals or accuses others, his accomplices, in the same crime in order to obtain his pardon. In this case he is called an <em>approver </em>or prover, <em>probator, </em>and the party appealed or accused is called the <em>appellee. </em>Such approvement can only be in capital offences; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>is, as it were, equivalent to an indictment, since the appellee is equally called upon to answer it: and if he hath no reasonable and legal exceptions to make to the person of the approver, which indeed are very numerous, he must put himself upon his trial, either by battle or by the country, and if vanquished or found guilty must suffer the judgment of the law, and the approver shall have his pardon <em>ex debito justitiae. </em>On the other hand, if the appellee be conqueror or acquitted by the jury, the approver shall receive judgment to be hanged, upon his own confession of the indictment; for the condition of his pardon has failed, viz: the conviction of some other person, and therefore his conviction remains absolute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\"But it is purely in the discretion of the court to permit the approver thus to appeal or not; and, in fact, this course of admitting approvements hath been long disused; for the truth was, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, that more mischief hath arisen to good men by these kind of approvements, upon false and malicious accusations of desperate villains, than benefit to the public by the discovery and conviction of real offenders. And therefore, in the times when such appeals were more frequently admitted, great strictness and nicety were held therein; though since their discontinuance the doctrine of approvements is become a matter of more curiosity than use. I shall only observe that all the good, whatever it be, that can be expected from this method of approvement is fully provided for in the cases of coining, robbery, burglary, house-breaking, horse-stealing, and larceny to the value of five shillings, from shops, warehouses, stables, and coach-houses, by statutes 4 &amp; 5 W. and M. c. 8, 6 &amp; 7 W. III. c. 17, 10 &amp; 11 W. III. e. 23, and 5 Anne, c. 31, which enact that if any such offender, being out of prison, shall discover two or more persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>have committed the like offences, so as they may be convicted thereof, he shall, in case of burglary or house-breaking, receive a reward of 40 1., and in general be entitled to a pardon of all capital offences excepting only murder and treason; and of them also in the case of coining. And if any such person, having feloniously stolen any lead, iron, or other metal, shall discover and convict two offenders of having illegally bought or received the same, he shall, by virtue of statute 29 Geo. II. c. 30, be pardoned for all such felonies committed before such discovery. It hath also been usual for the justices of the peace, by whom any persons charged with felony are committed to gaol, to admit some one of their accomplices to become a witness (or, as it is generally termed, king\u2019s evidence) against his fellows; upon an implied confidence, which the judges of gaol-delivery have usually countenanced and adopted, that if such accomplice makes a full and complete discovery of that and of all other felonies to which he is examined by the magistrate, and afterwards gives his evidence without prevarication or fraud, he shall not himself be prosecuted for that or any other previous offence of the same degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>*329-31 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>See also </em>1 J. Bishop, <em>New Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1156-1163 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In <em>Whiskey Cases, </em>99 U.S. 594, 25 L. Ed. 399 (1879), the Supreme Court explained somewhat relative to approvers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\"Speaking upon that subject, Lord Mansfield said, more than a century ago, that there were three ways in the law and practice of that country in which an accomplice could be entitled to a pardon: <em>First, </em>in the case of <em>approvement, </em>which, as he stated, then still remained a part of the common law, though he admitted it had grown into disuse by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>long discontinuance. <em>Secondly, </em>by discovering two or more offenders, as required in the two acts of Parliament to which he referred. <em>Thirdly, </em>persons embraced in some royal proclamation, as authorized by an act of Parliament, to which he added, that in all these cases the court will bail the prisoner in order to give him an opportunity to apply for a pardon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\"><em>\"Approvers, </em>as well as those who disclosed two or more accomplices in guilt and those who came within the promise of a royal proclamation, were entitled to a pardon; and the same high authority states that besides those ancient statutory regulations there was another practice in respect to accomplices who were admitted as witnesses in criminal prosecutions against their associates, which he explains as follows: Where the accomplice has made a full and fair confession of the whole truth and is admitted as a witness for the crown, the practice is, if he act fairly and openly and discover the whole truth, though he is not entitled <em>of right </em>to a pardon, yet the usage, the lenity, and the practice of the court is to stop the prosecution against the accomplice, the understanding being that he has an equitable title to a recommendation for the king\u2019s mercy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">\"Subsequent remarks of the court in that opinion showed that the ancient statutes referred to were wholly inapplicable to the case, and that there remained even at that date only the equitable practice which gives a title to recommendation to the mercy of the crown. Explanations then follow which prove that the practice referred to was adopted in substitution for the ancient doctrine of <em>approvement, </em>modified and modelled so as to be received with greater favor. As modified it gives, as the court said in that case, a kind of hope to the accomplice that if he behaves fairly and discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the whole truth, he may, by a recommendation to mercy, save himself from punishment and secure a pardon, which shows to a demonstration that the protection, if any, to be given to the accomplice rests on the described usage and his own good behavior; for if he acts in bad faith, or fails to testify fully and fairly, he may still be prosecuted as if he had never been admitted as a witness. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Rudd, </em>1 Cowp. 331; s. c. 1 Leach, 115.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\"Great inconvenience arose from the practice of <em>approvement, </em>in consequence of which a mode of proceeding was adopted in analogy to that law, by which an accomplice may be entitled to a recommendation to mercy but not to a pardon as of legal right, nor can he plead it in bar or avail himself of it on his trial. 2 Hawk. P. C. n. 3, p. 532; 3 Russ, on Crimes (9th Am. ed.), 596.\u201d 99 U.S. at 599-600 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In <em>Byrd v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. </em>(2 Va. Cases) 490 (1826), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\"It is a mistake to suppose that the competency of accomplices depends on, or grew out of, the doctrine of approvement. An approver is one who being indicted for treason, or felony, and arraigned, confesses the fact before he pleads, and accuses others, his accomplices, in order to obtain his pardon. His approvement is equivalent to an Indictment, and if he supports it in all respects, and the person accused by him is found guilty, the approver is <em>entitled </em>to his pardon, but if he is acquitted, the approver receives judgment to be hanged, upon his own confession of the Indictment. 4 <em>Bl. Com. </em>329; <em>Rudd\u2019s </em>Case, 1 <em>Leach, </em>115. An accomplice, who voluntarily gives his evidence, is not exonerated from punishment, nor entitled to a pardon, if he succeeds in convicting a fellow prisoner, nor is he subjected to punishment in consequence of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>failure. In both cases, his acquittal, or his conviction, depends on the evidence to be adduced on his own trial. His competency depends on the ancient principle of the Common Law, before averted to, that no person is to be excluded from giving evidence on account of infamy, unless he has been <em>convicted </em>of an infamous crime.\u201d 4 Va. (2 Va. Cases) at 493 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Dabney, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 696, 706 (1842), the court referred to a legislative enactment stating that \" 'approvers shall never be admitted in any case whatsoever,\u2019 \u201d stating that the legislature had thus \"manifested its disapprobation of holding out impunity [sic] to an accomplice, as an inducement to him to become a witness against his associates.\u201d The opinion concluded by stating, \"[A]n accomplice has no right to demand such a recommendation, merely because he has given evidence on the part of the commonwealth, fully, candidly and impartially.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. The Court of Special Appeals has had a similar issue before it in <em>Oliver v. State, </em>53 Md. App. 490, 500-03, 454 A.2d 856 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The statute in question merely made it plain that the practice of approvement would not be permitted in this State. It is not authority for holding that the testimony of an accomplice is not admissible against those with whom he was associated in a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">v Three aggravating factors based on identical facts</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The jury found three of the aggravating factors spelled out in Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Rep 1. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (d): that the victim was a law enforcement officer who was murdered while in the performance of his duties; that the defendant committed the murder in furtherance of an escape from or an attempt to escape from or evade the lawful custody, arrest or detention of or by an officer or guard of a correctional institution or by a law enforcement officer; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that the defendant committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery. It is argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\"It is obvious that three aggravating factors were being urged from a single fact pattern. The practical effect of this is that in virtually every instance involving the murder of a police officer there will be two or three aggravating factors simply because it is unlikely that a police officer will be shot during the performance of his duties unless the shooter is attempting to evade arrest for some other crime. To allow such a procedure defeats the purpose of separate aggravating factors, which is to provide the possibility of enhanced punishment on the basis of discrete instances of specified conduct.\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Calhoun cites <em>State v. Rust, </em>197 Neb. 528, 538, 250 N.W.2d 867, 874 (1977), for the proposition that \"it is not reasonable to construe the definitions in such a manner as to make them overlap and make the same identical facts constitute two aggravating circumstances.\u201d He also asserts, citing <em>Clark v. State, </em>379 So. 2d 97 (Fla. 1979), that \"it has been held that where a murder is committed in the course of a robbery where money is taken only one of the two aggravating factors of murder in the course of robbery and murders for pecuniary [gain] may be applied.\u201d From this it is asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\"The evidence in this case arguably showed that the murder in this case was committed under circumstances which permitted the possibility of enhancement of the punishment from life imprisonment to death. However, there was no basis for permitting the pyramiding of aggravating factors based on precisely the same act. Such a procedure increases the chance of imposition of capital punishment without showing conduct any more dangerous or antisocial than would be present for a single aggravating factor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The statement attributed to <em>Clark </em>is correct. The statement attributed to <em>Rust </em>is likewise correct but it is of interest to note the next succeeding paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\"We believe the Legislature intended by each definition to convey a different concept, at least to the extent that some added different and important element, e.g., motive or purpose, is included in each separate definition even though some fact or facts in a particular case may pertain to more than one of the definitions, e.g., pecuniary gain may be the result.\u201d 197 Neb. at 538.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">As the State argues, the protection of police officers is a valid societal objective. This is promoted by the first aggravating circumstance in this case. As to the second aggravating factor, that of committing a murder in furtherance of an escape, it can be seen that this could apply to the murder of a civilian just as easily as to the murder of a police officer. In fact, that is precisely the situation which existed in <em>Rust. </em>By the same token, the murder of a police officer is not necessarily limited to an escape situation. An individual might be on the prowl with the objective of shooting down a police officer because of a past actual or fancied grievance or, as the State suggests, a roof top sniper, selecting randomly, could make a police officer a victim. The added element here is the conduct of attempting to escape apprehension, which justifies the use of both aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The third aggravating factor, murder committed during the commission of a robbery, does not need a law enforcement officer as a victim. It likewise does not need to be committed during an escape from lawful custody. The General Assembly through this aggravating factor seeks to deter a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">An example of overlapping aggravating factors is found in <em>State v. </em>Goodman, 298 N.C. 1, 257 S.E.2d 569 (1979). There the statutory \"(e) (4)\u201d factor was that \"[t]he capital felony was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>lawful arrest----\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-2000 (e) (4) (1980). The \"(e) (7)\u201d factor was that the \"felony was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 15A-2000 (e) (7). These have more of a similarity than do the factors at issue in the case at bar. In that instance the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\"In submitting the issue under (e) (4), the court reviewed the evidence tending to show that on the night in question while defendant, Lois,' Charles and Collins were on Rural Paved Road 2007 in Cumberland County, that Collins was shot and received some cuts to his body; that defendant and Charles then made statements to the effect that they did not want to be arrested for anything; and that they therefore proposed to take Collins to Robeson County so that he could not tell on them. The court then instructed the jury that if they found those to be the facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and believed that to be an aggravating circumstance, then they should answer the issue 'yes\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\"In submitting the issue under (e) (7), the trial court reviewed substantially the same evidence. The court then instructed the jury that if they found those to be the facts beyond a reasonable doubt and believed that to be an aggravating circumstance, then they should answer the issue 'yes\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\"We think the submission of the two issues on the same evidence was improper. This amounted to an unnecessary duplication of the circumstances enumerated in the statute, resulting in an automatic cumulation of aggravating circumstances against the defendant.\u201d 298 N.C. at 28-29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The court went on to say in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\"We do not intend to imply that the aggravating circumstances enumerated in G.S. 15A-2000 (e) can never overlap or that more than one of them can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>never arise from a single incident. We realize that, in some cases the same evidence will support inferences from which the jury might find that more than one of the enumerated aggravating circumstances is present. This duality will normally occur where the defendant\u2019s motive is being examined rather than where the state relies upon a specific factual element of aggravation.\u201d 298 N.C. at 30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In its determination of facts the jury might well have found that there was no attempt to apprehend and therefore no escape from apprehension. Moreover, the General Assembly was entitled to make the legislative judgment as to capital punishment that such facts could and should be considered as aggravating factors. It was not error to submit each aggravating factor to the jury for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">vi Alleged error in not instructing the jury as to the procedure if it could not agree</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (k) (2) provides, \"If the jury, within a reasonable time, is not able to agree as to sentence, the court shall dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\u201d Section 413 (c) (3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\"After presentation of the evidence in a proceeding before a jury, in addition to any other appropriate instructions permitted by law, the court shall instruct the jury as to the findings it must make in order to determine whether the sentence shall be death or imprisonment for life and the burden of proof applicable to these findings in accordance with subsection (f) or (h).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">From this Calhoun argues that the trial judge erred in this instance because the trial judge did not instruct the jury that if they could not agree within a reasonable time a life sentence would be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">As in subsection iii of this opinion, there is a short and a long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contention. The short answer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>that no request for such instruction was made at trial nor was any objection made upon that basis to the instructions which were given as required by Rule 757 (f). Rule 757 (h) provides that an objection is not reviewable as of right unless it is made in compliance with Rule 757 (f). We are urged that we should take cognizance of this as \"plain error\u201d within the meaning of Rule 757 (h). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980), we indicated that an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error only when the error is so \"compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental [as] to [deny] the defendant a fair trial.\u201d There is no such error in this case. Because this is a capital case in which we are affirming a sentence of death, however, we shall give the long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In this case the jury deliberated for two and a half hours. It then advised the court that it\" 'need[ed] a time for individual reflection and therefore requested] adjournment overnight or until whenever the Court decidefd].\u2019 \u201d This request was made at 5:33 p.m. The court answered by advising that they must remain together but if they desired to suspend and go to dinner that would be an appropriate time. They advised they would like to go to dinner. They were excused for dinner. Court recessed until 7:30 p.m. The jury returned with a verdict at 9:15 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Supreme Court of South Carolina recently considered such an issue in <em>State v. Copeland, </em>S.C. , 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>U.S. , 103 S. Ct. 1802 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\"Appellant Copeland argues the trial judge erred in denying his request to instruct the jury of the actual effect of failure to reach a unanimous agreement as to the punishment, and in instructing the jury that unanimity is required before a life sentence can be imposed. Copeland asserts the judge misstated the applicable law and inserted an arbitrary factor into the jury\u2019s sentencing decision by instructing 'irrespective of what your verdict or recommendation is, it must be unanimous on each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>count, that is, your verdict or recommendation must be the verdict or recommendation of all twelve of you.\u2019 Allegedly, this instruction might affect the jury\u2019s decision to impose life or death unless the jury is instructed that, in the event all cannot agree on a recommendation as to whether the death penalty should be imposed, the trial judge shall dismiss the jury and sentence the defendant to life imprisonment. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\"The trial judge correctly stated the applicable law. We stated in <em>State v. Adams </em>[277 S.C. 115], 283 S.E.2d [582,] 587 [(1981)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">The language of [\u00a7 16-3-20 (C)] provides that where a sentence of death is not recommended by the jury, a life sentence must be given. The situation implicitly envisioned here is that normally the jury will unanimously either recommend life or death. The undecided jury is the exception. That portion of the statute addressing the legal effect given to the existence of an unalterably divided jury is addressed to the trial judge only and need not be divulged to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">There is no error present.\u201d S.C. , 300 S.E.2d at 70-71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Giving the instruction to the jury before deliberation could prompt someone to hold out for just a bit more than a reasonable time to insure that the death penalty was not imposed. It likewise could cause a jury to rush through its deliberations to avoid being called back by the court and told that because a reasonable time had passed without a verdict the sentence would be life imprisonment. The statute is a mandate directed to the court, not the jury. As the jury here reached its decision within a reasonable time, no instruction was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>vii Opening statement</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">At the sentencing phase of the trial defense counsel in his opening statement to the jury said, \"There can be in this proceeding no hung jury because if the jury is not able to decide \u2014.\u201d This brought an immediate objection. His co-counsel responded that that was the law. This produced another objection, after which the trial judge said, \"I don\u2019t think that has anything to do with an opening statement or factual [recitation].\u201d The trial judge was correct. The purpose of an opening statement is to orient the jurors so that they can follow and understand the evidence as it unfolds during the trial. It is not the purpose of an opening statement to argue the merits of the case or to discuss the pertinent law. 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7\u00a7 493, 494 (12th ed. C.

The mitigating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 413 (g), relevant to this proceeding, is subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>tion (1), that \"[t]he defendant has not previously (i) been found guilty of a crime of violence; (ii) entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charge of a crime of violence; or (iii) had a judgment of probation on stay of entry of judgment entered on a charge of a crime of violence.\u201d The statute then goes on to define the term \"crime of violence\u201d as meaning, \"abduction, arson, escape, kidnapping, manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter, mayhem, murder, robbery, or rape or sexual offense in the first or second degree, or an attempt to commit any of these offenses, or the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or another crime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Calhoun in his argument to us did not and could not rely upon our recent decision in <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 465 A.2d 1126 (1983), for the simple reason that it was not decided until some months subsequent to argument in this case, although obviously he could have raised the issue we addressed in <em>Scott. </em>As Judge Davidson put it for the Court in <em>Scott, </em>that case presented \"the question whether, under Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (c) (1), evidence is admissible at a sentencing proceeding to show that an accused convicted of premeditated murder has committed other unrelated crimes for which the accused has not been convicted or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere.\u201d 297 Md. at 242. Scott there claimed, \"that under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii), admissible evidence of unrelated crimes is restricted to evidence of prior convictions, pleas of guilty or pleas of nolo contendere.\u201d 297 Md. at 243. The Court took pains in <em>Scott </em>to distinguish <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 439 A.2d 542 (1982), where we considered, as the Court put it in <em>Scott, </em>\"whether, under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (v), evidence is admissible at a sentencing proceeding to show that an accused, convicted a premeditated murder, has committed other unrelated crimes for which the accused has not been convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court pointed out that in Johnson \"[t]he accused . . . did not there contend that under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) admissible evidence of unrelated crimes was restricted to evidence of prior convictions, pleas of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>or pleas of nolo contendere and consequently that the evidence of the unrelated crime was inadmissible because, although charged with the murder, the accused had not been convicted.\u201d 297 Md. at 245. The Court said in <em>Scott:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\"Thus, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) establishes a more stringent standard of reliability for the admission of such evidence in a death penalty case than is applied in a nondeath penalty case. It precludes, in a death penalty case, any but the most reliable type of evidence of unrelated crimes \u2014 a conviction. Additionally, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) precludes, in a death penalty case, inflammatory detailed evidence of the underlying facts and circumstances surrounding unrelated crimes. As a result, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii), like \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i), serves the purpose of moderating the significantly prejudicial nature of evidence of unrelated crimes in the face of the unique severity of the death penalty.\u201d 297 Md. at 247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">It is obvious from an examination of the objection of defense counsel that at no time did he raise the issue that was raised in <em>Scott, </em>that this was an attempt to elicit information pertaining to a criminal act on the part of Calhoun for which there had been no conviction or disposition tantamount to a conviction. It also can be seen from the record quoted above that the objection was narrowed by defense counsel to whether the incident at the detention center was relevant to \"a mitigating circumstance.\u201d The court overruled the objection saying that the testimony concerned a circumstance \"which the State may establish under Article 27, Section 413 (c)3.\u201d The trial judge presumably was referring to \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) (\"Evidence of any prior criminal convictions, pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, or the absence of such prior convictions or pleas, to the same extent admissible in other sentencing procedures\u201d) since \u00a7 413 (c) (3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\"(3) After presentation of the evidence in a proceeding before a jury, in addition to any other appropriate instructions permitted by law, the court shall instruct the jury as to the findings it must make in order to determine whether the sentence shall be death or imprisonment for life and the burden of proof applicable to these findings in accordance with subsection (\u00a3) or (h).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Counsel made no general objection. His specific objection was that this bore no relationship to the specified aggravating circumstances. In <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 264, 368 A.2d 468 (1977), we said, \"[W]here counsel clearly states specific grounds for an objection without a request by the trial court, he waives the right to challenge the evidence on other grounds ...The conduct of Calhoun in this instance, if established in a criminal proceeding against him, would be the common law offense of battery. <em>See </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>604 (1972) and R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>107 (2d ed. 1969). The record here is silent as to whether Calhoun has or has not been charged and tried as a result of this incident. It is entirely conceivable that had the objection here been based upon the issue before the Court in <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. 235, that the State might well have produced evidence of such a conviction. On the other hand, it might have been obliged to admit that no criminal charges had been brought as a result of the incident or that charges had been brought but the case had not come to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In the absence of an objection focusing on the point before the Court in <em>Scott, </em>the evidence here was admissible under Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (v), which permits introduction of, \"Any other evidence that the court deems of probative value and relevant to sentence, provided the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">ix Constitutional issues</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Calhoun launches a broad based constitutional attack. We shall consider his points seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">He first contends that our \"capital punishment statute violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and Articles 16 and 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights in failing to provide standards to govern the exercise of discretion under Article 27, Sec. 412 (b) to initiate a death case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Calhoun\u2019s first basis for his claim of unconstitutionality stems from what he describes as the prosecutor\u2019s \"unbridled exercise of discretion,\u201d referring to Art. 27, \u00a7 412 (b). That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\"A person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced either to death or to imprisonment for life. The sentence shall be imprisonment for life unless (1) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of death, <em>and </em>advised the person of each aggravating circumstance upon which it intended to rely, and (2) a sentence of death is imposed in accordance with \u00a7 413.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">According to Calhoun the lack of specific standards results in an inconsistent and discriminatory application of the death penalty statute by prosecutors in violation of the limitations set by the Supreme Court in <em>Furman v. </em>Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972), and <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The State, on the other hand, argues that the Maryland statutes, specifically \u00a7 412, are in accord with <em>Furman </em>and <em>Gregg. </em>Because of the checks provided by the sentencing authority and the mandatory appellate review, the Supreme Court in <em>Gregg </em>and the several opinions filed the same day gave prosecutors wide discretion in charging capital crimes. The State claims also that to apply strict standards would result in the type of mandatory system outlawed by the Supreme Court in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>96 S. Ct. 2978, 49 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1976), and <em>Roberts (Stanislaus) v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 96 S. Ct. 3001, 49 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">An analysis of the issue begins with <em>Furman. </em>There the Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion declared statutes unconstitutional which gave judges and juries uncontrolled discretionary power to impose the death sentence. Although every Justice wrote an opinion in <em>Furman, </em>no one specifically attacked the power given to prosecutors in choosing which cases qualified as capital crimes, but rather references were made only to the \"sentencing authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Subsequently in <em>Gregg </em>the specific issue of the prosecutor\u2019s discretion was raised by the petitioner, who claimed that the Georgia statute gave the state prosecutor \"unfettered authority to select those persons whom he wishes to prosecute for a capital offense and to plea bargain with them.\u201d 428 U.S. at 199. Justice Stewart, who wrote the plurality opinion for the Court, stated in response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\"The existence of these discretionary stages is not determinative of the issues before us. At each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice system makes a decision which may remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for the death penalty. <em>Furman, </em>in contrast, dealt with the decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who had been convicted of a capital offense. Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution. <em>Furman </em>held only that, in order to minimize the risk that the death penalty would be imposed on a capriciously selected group of offenders, the decision to impose it had to be guided by standards so that the sentencing authority would focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.\u201d 428 U.S. at 199.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In a footnote Justice Stewart made clear that strict standards imposed on a prosecutor would result in an ineffective and unconstitutional system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>\"The petitioner\u2019s argument is nothing more than a veiled contention that <em>Furman </em>indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use. In order to repair the alleged defects pointed to by the petitioner, it would be necessary to require that prosecuting authorities charge a capital offense whenever arguably there had been a capital murder and that they refuse to plea bargain with the defendant____ Such a system, of course, would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\"Moreover, it would be unconstitutional. Such a system in many respects would have the vices of the mandatory death penalty statutes we hold unconstitutional today in <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, post, </em>p. 280, and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Louisiana, post, </em>p. 325....\u201d 428 U.S. at 199-200 n. 50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Justice White wrote a concurring opinion in <em>Gregg </em>which was joined by the Chief Justice and by Justice Rehnquist. It is of interest to note the analysis of prosecutorial discretion set forth by Justice White:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\"Petitioner\u2019s argument that prosecutors behave in a standardless fashion in deciding which cases to try as capital felonies is unsupported by any facts. Petitioner simply asserts that since prosecutors have the power not to charge capital felonies they will exercise that power in a standardless fashion. This is untenable. Absent facts to the contrary, it cannot be assumed that prosecutors will be motivated in their charging decision by factors other than the strength of their case and the likelihood that a jury would impose the death penalty if it convicts. Unless prosecutors are incompetent in their judgments, the standards by which they decide whether to charge a capital felony will be the same as those by which the jury will decide the questions of guilt and sentence. Thus defendants will escape the death penalty through prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>charging decisions only because the offense is not sufficiently serious; or because the proof is insufficiently strong. This does not cause the system to be standardless any more than the jury\u2019s decision to impose life imprisonment on a defendant whose crime is deemed insufficiently serious or its decision to acquit someone who is probably guilty but whose guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 428 U.S. at 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">On the basis of <em>Gregg, </em>claims of unconstitutional prosecutorial discretion under <em>Furman </em>were rejected in two plurality opinions in death penalty cases written by Justice Stewart filed the same day as <em>Gregg. Proffitt v. Florida, 428 </em>U.S. 242, 254, 96 S. Ct. 2960, 49 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1976); <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 274, 96 S. Ct. 2950, 49 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">We have not specifically dealt with the issue of prosecutorial discretion. However, in <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 720-29, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) <em>(Tichnell I) </em>we found that the Maryland statute does satisfy both federal and state requirements on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Absent any specific evidence of indiscretion by prosecutors resulting in an irrational, inconsistent, or discriminatory application of the death penalty statute, Calhoun\u2019s claim cannot stand. To the extent that there is a difference in the practice of the various State\u2019s attorneys around the State, our proportionality review would be intended to assure that the death penalty is not imposed in a disproportionate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Finally, Calhoun claims that the notice requirement of \u00a7 412 differs from \"charging\u201d the defendant as discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Gregg. </em>The written notice is a procedure required for the defendant\u2019s benefit. It ensures that there are sufficient grounds for the charges and that the defendant has notice of those grounds. The Supreme Court does not require such notice to protect the constitutionality of the death penalty statute. Therefore, the additional formality of \u00a7 412 should not be held against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>We hold that Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 412 as presently applied does not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States or Articles 16 and 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Calhoun contends that he \"is denied due process of law by the failure of the Maryland Capital Punishment Statute, on its face and in its operation, to provide a means of culling those 'similar cases\u2019 which this Court must consider under Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, Sec. 414 (e) (4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">' Calhoun argues that the provision by the General Assembly for proportionality review is unconstitutional because the statute fails to provide this Court with the means to discharge effectively its obligation to review similar cases. In other words, he is contending that the Legislature has failed to provide a means for defining the \"relevant universe\u201d of cases that we should consider in determining whether a particular sentence of death is excessive or arbitrary. By Rule 772A we have provided that trial judges in capital cases are to file a report with us in writing. The rule sets forth in substantial detail that which is to be included in the report. Calhoun contends that Rule 772A is inadequate because it fails to identify all relevant cases. He maintains that relevant cases should include not only those in which the State actually sought the death penalty but also those in which the State either withdrew its intent to seek capital punishment or chose not to seek the death penalty even though a case was ostensibly \"similar.\u201d Finally, he argues that \u00a7 414 (e) (4) has deprived him of his due process right to be heard in a meaningful manner: although the statute extends the right to proportionality review, its failure to provide a means to give content to the right results in an effective denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The State contends that the purpose of proportionality review is to determine whether the imposition of the death sentence in a particular case is aberrant or irrational. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>long as the death penalty has been imposed under similar circumstances, it is not important that a life sentence was given in another similar case. Further, the State notes that the United States Supreme Court has upheld death penalty statutes containing no provisions for proportionality review. Rather, the Court has stressed that due process and the Fourteenth Amendment require only that the death penalty not be imposed in a \"wanton\u201d or \"freakish\u201d manner; the type of statute providing for appellate review is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In several cases the Supreme Court has noted the requirement that the death penalty must be imposed in a rational and consistent manner. Although the Court appears not to require proportionality review per se, it does seem to be saying that appellate review of capital punishment cases is essential to the constitutionality of the death penalty statutes. In its recent opinions it has dwelt upon the fact that review by a state\u2019s highest court was provided. <em>See, e.g., Jurek, </em>428 U.S. 262; <em>Proffitt, </em>428 U.S. 242; <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153. Even where the Court has overturned the decision of a state court of last resort on the basis of an inconsistent standard applied in capital punishment cases, it has not articulated specific means by which state courts are to arrive at consistent results. <em>Cf. Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, 428, 100 S. Ct. 1759, 64 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1980) (State must provide sentencing authority \" 'clear and objective standards\u2019 that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,\u2019 and that make 'rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, it appears that the Supreme Court has left it to the state legislatures and courts to determine the method by which the death penalty is to be imposed in a rational manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153, the petitioner argued that the requirements of <em>Furman, </em>408 U.S. 238, were not met \"because the jury has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 203. To this the plurality opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\"This contention misinterprets <em>Furman. </em>See <em>supra, </em>at 198-199. Moreover, it ignores the role of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Supreme Court of Georgia which reviews each death sentence to determine whether it is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes. Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice.\u201d 428 U.S. at 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The plurality opinion in <em>Gregg </em>further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\"The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury. If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death.\u201d 428 U.S. at 206.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\"><em>See also Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 276 (opinion of Stewart, J.) (prompt judicial review of jury\u2019s sentencing decision acts as a safeguard against the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death sentence); <em>Proffitt, </em>428 U.S. at 258-59 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Based on the broad and general statements of the United States Supreme Court regarding proportionality review we have articulated the standard we shall apply under the similar cases provision of Art. 27, \u00a7 414 (e) (4). <em>See Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 461 A.2d 1 (1983) <em>(Tichnell III). </em>The analysis of proportionality review by Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Tichnell III </em>basically consists of three parts. First, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>reviewed for the Court the United States Supreme Court cases that have confronted the issue of proportionality review and concluded that \"the essential principle underlying the varieties of proportionality review upheld in <em>Gregg ProGtt </em>and <em>Jurek </em>is, in short, the guarantee that death sentences will be imposed in a reasonably consistent manner. <em>Tichnell [v. State], </em>287 Md. [695,] 741 [, 415 A.2d 830 (1980)].\u201d 297 Md. at 460. Second, Chief Judge Murphy reviewed for the Court the manner in which those states with proportionality review statutes similar to ours have defined the \"relevant universe\u201d of cases. 297 Md. at 461-64. Third, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\"[T]he legislatively intended inventory of cases from which 'similar cases\u2019 are to be culled encompasses only those first degree murder cases in which the State sought the death penalty under \u00a7 413, whether it was imposed or not. This interpretation of \u00a7 414 (e) (4) is consistent with the implementing provisions of Maryland Rule 772A which requires, for purposes of proportionality review, that trial judges file detailed informational reports only in such cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\"The focus of \u00a7 414 (e) (4) is upon capital cases in which the sentencing authority determined whether to impose a life or death sentence; the subsection aims to assure that upon consideration of both the crime and the defendant the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in one capital case will lead to a result similar to that reached under similar circumstances in another capital case, thus identifying the aberrant sentence and avoiding its ultimate imposition. This, of course, is the constitutional purpose of proportionality review as articulated in <em>Gregg </em>and <em>Proff\u00edtt </em>and as to which we think the General Assembly intended to subscribe in enacting \u00a7 414 (e) (4). No case is potentially similar within the contemplation of the statute, therefore, unless the death penalty was an authorized punishment.\u201d 297 Md. at 464-65.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The Court restricted the analysis of similar cases to those \"decided under constitutional death penalty statutes and to those decided under our own State law.\u201d 297 Md. at 466. Finally, we noted that proportionality review will be conducted \"in accordance with the fundamental constitutional principle of avoiding the arbitrary or capricious imposition of the death penalty by affording similar treatment to similar capital cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Under the holding of <em>Tichnell </em>III, therefore, Calhoun\u2019s contention that \u00a7 414 (e) (4) violates due process because of its failure to provide a standard for defining similar cases is unfounded. Rather, from <em>Tichnell III </em>and the cases of the Supreme Court of the United States, it appears that similar cases, in terms of a particular accused and particular crime of which he was convicted, are comprised of those involving similar aggravating and mitigating circumstances in which the State sought to have the death penalty imposed and those brought to our attention by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Calhoun contends, that our death sentence statute \"is unconstitutional because Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights denies this Court the power to exercise the review mandated by Article 27, Sec. 414 (e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Calhoun argues that because Article 23 of our Declaration of Rights precludes appellate courts from weighing and balancing the facts of a criminal case, this Court lacks the power to conduct the review authorized by Art. 27, \u00a7 414. Article 23 provides in relevant part, \"In the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s point is that under \u00a7 414 we are to independently assess the findings of the sentencing authority concerning the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and to further review similar cases. It is his claim that in doing this we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>going beyond our limited power to determine the sufficiency of the evidence. Thus, he claims that because proportionality review is prohibited by Article 23 and because that provision is a central, nonseverable feature of the capital punishment statute, the entire statute is unconstitutional. In a footnote Calhoun contends that the fact that the appellate review is of a sentence rather than a determination of guilt is inconsequential because we must engage in the same type of factual inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The State contends that Article 23 applies only to the evidence necessary to sustain a conviction at trial and not to the review of a criminal sentence. Therefore, it says \u00a7 414 (e) is a valid exercise of legislative authority and the Court is indeed empowered to conduct the proportionality review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We first note that most of the cases upon which Calhoun relies were decided prior to the amendment to the Constitution in 1950 giving this Court power to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence. The issue here was mentioned briefly in <em>Poole </em>v. <em>State, </em>290 Md. 114, 125, 428 A.2d 434 (1981) <em>(dicta). </em>We there stated that Article 23 \"applies to the trial stage of the proceeding and refers explicitly to the evidence necessary to sustain a conviction. It does not apply to the jury\u2019s role in a sentencing proceeding. <em>See Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In <em>Stevenson </em>the question before the Court was \"whether Article 23 of the Declaration of Rights to the Maryland Constitution, which provides that the jury in a criminal case 'shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact,\u2019 is unconstitutional because the provision, as construed by this Court, facially deprives a defendant of the federally secured right to due process of law.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 169, 423 A.2d 558 (1980). In reaching the conclusion that the grant to the jury of the role of \"judges of law\u201d in a criminal case did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>id. </em>at 189, Judge Digges made several observations for the Court about the functions of judge and jury. First, he noted that \"the jury was not granted, by Article 23, the power to decide all matters that may be correctly included under the generic label \u2014 'law.\u2019 Rather, its authority is limited to deciding 'the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>law of the crime,\u2019... or 'the definition of the crime,\u2019 as well as 'the legal effect of the evidence before [the jury].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178 (citations omitted; brackets in original). Second, Judge Digges reviewed for the Court various cases that discussed the role, function, and power of the jury to determine \"the law\u201d in a criminal case. He noted that \"[i]mplicit in the decisions of this Court limiting the jury\u2019s judicial role to the 'law of the crime\u2019 is a recognition that all other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Because under <em>Stevenson </em>the jury is the judge of the law only in the terms of the law or definition of the crime, it follows that the restriction \"except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction\u201d goes only to the evidence necessary to sustain a finding of guilt or innocence. Thus, the role of the jury being limited and all other matters being left to the judge, it follows that this Court has the power to review the sentencing process in a capital punishment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Calhoun claims that \"[i]n providing for the sentence of death by administration of lethal gas the Maryland Capital Punishment scheme violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Articles 16 and 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Article 16 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights forbids \"inflict[ing] cruel and unusual pains\u201d while Article 25 says that \"unusual punishment [shall not be] inflicted....\u201d At issue then is whether the enforcement of our death penalty statute by lethal gas is \"cruel and inhuman punishment\u201d as defined by the Federal Constitution and our own Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">First, under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments the Supreme Court has expressly stated that the death penalty is an acceptable form of punishment. In the plurality opinion for the Court in Gregg, 428 U.S. 153, Justice Stewart stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\"The Court on a number of occasions has both assumed and asserted the constitutionality of capital punishment... . But until <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972), the Court never confronted squarely the fundamental claim that the punishment of death always, regardless of the enormity of the offense or the procedure followed in imposing the sentence, is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution. Although this issue was presented and addressed in <em>Furman, </em>it was not resolved by the Court.. .. We now hold that the punishment of death does not invariably violate the Constitution.\u201d 428 U.S. at 168-69.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In <em>Gregg </em>Justice Stewart further said in the plurality opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\"The petitioners in the capital cases before the Court today renew the 'standards of decency\u2019 argument, but developments during the four years since <em>Furman </em>have undercut substantially the assumptions upon which their argument rested. Despite the continuing debate, dating back to the 19th century, over the morality and utility of capital punishment, it is now evident that a large proportion of American society continues to regard it as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">\"The most marked indication of society\u2019s endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to <em>Furman. </em>The legislatures of at least 35 States have enacted new statutes that provide for the death penalty for at least some crimes that result in the death of another person. And the Congress of the United States, in 1974, enacted a statute providing the death penalty for aircraft piracy that results in death.\u201d 428 U.S. at 179-80 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">It thus seems relevant to comment as to society\u2019s view that fourteen out of forty-eight times that the opportunity has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>existed to impose the death penalty under our lethal gas statute Maryland juries have done so. Six of the remaining thirty-four times in which life sentences were imposed by juries this result was mandatory by virtue of jury deadlocks. The fact that juries are willing to impose the punishment certainly carries some weight as to society\u2019s view of the death penalty as a valid form of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Later in <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S. Ct. 2861, 53 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1977), Justice White said in the plurality opinion of the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\"It is now settled that the death penalty is not invariably cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment; it is not inherently barbaric or an unacceptable mode of punishment for crime; neither is it always disproportionate to the crime for which it is imposed. It is also established that imposing capital punishment, at least for murder, in accordance with the procedures provided under the Georgia statutes saves the sentence from infirmities which led the Court to invalidate the prior Georgia capital punishment statute in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>supra.\u201d 433 U.S. at 591.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">It must not be forgotten that, as pointed out by the Chief Justice in his dissent in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\"[I]t is ... clear from the language of the Constitution itself that there was no thought whatever of the elimination of capital punishment. The opening sentence of the Fifth Amendment is a guarantee that the death penalty not be imposed 'unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u2019 The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is a prohibition against being 'twice put in jeopardy of life\u2019 for the same offense. Similarly, the Due Process Clause commands 'due process of law\u2019 before an accused can be 'deprived of life, liberty, or property.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Thus, the explicit language of the Constitution affirmatively acknowledges the legal power to impose capital punishment; it does not expressly or by implication acknowledge the legal power to impose any of the various punishments that have been banned as cruel since 1791. Since the Eighth Amendment was adopted on the same day in 1791 as the Fifth Amendment, it hardly needs more to establish that the death penalty was not 'cruel\u2019 in the constitutional sense at that time.\u201d 408 U.S. at 380.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">No one had heard of death by electrocution or by lethal gas at the time of the adoption of those constitutional provisions. The gallows was the customary method of imposing the death penalty. This was the method in use in Maryland until the more humane method of execution by lethal gas was adopted in 1955. <em>See </em>Chapter 625, \u00a7 1, Acts of 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The issue now before the Court was considered recently by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Gray v. Lucas, </em>710 F.2d 1048 (5th Cir. 1983). The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\"Gray stresses that neither the Supreme Court nor any federal court has addressed the issue whether the gas chamber constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In cases decided in the last century, however, the court approved New York\u2019s use of the electric chair, <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U.S. 436, 10 S. Ct. 930, 34 L. Ed. 519 (1890), and Utah\u2019s use of hanging and the firing squad, <em>Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 25 L. Ed. 345 (1879). In this century, a number of states have upheld the use of the gas chamber. <em>Duisen v. State, </em>441 S.W.2d 688, 693 (Mo. 1969), <em>modified by Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972); <em>People </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>40 Cal. 2d 876, 256 P.2d 911, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 827, 74 S.Ct. 47, 98 L. Ed. 352 (1953); <em>State v. Jon, </em>46 Nev. 418, 211 P. 676 (1923). See also <em>In Re Anderson, </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Cal. 2d 613, 73 Cal. Rptr. 21, 447 P.2d 117, 130 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 971, 92 S. Ct. 2415, 32 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1972). This year, the state of Nevada enacted a statutory provision which abandoned the gas chamber in favor of lethal injection. Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 176.355 (1983). Nevada thus joins New Mexico in abandoning the gas chamber in favor of lethal injection. N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-14-11 (1979). North Carolina allows death-row prisoners to choose between lethal injection or the gas chamber. In 1981, the State of Washington banned further use of hanging as a method of execution. <em>State v. Frampton, </em>95 Wash.2d 469, 627 P.2d 922 (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\"Gray argues strongly that he has produced a factual predicate clearly demonstrating that death by cyanide gas, causing asphyxiation at the cost of protracted pain over a period that may exceed seven minutes, may offend an indicated eighth amendment prohibition against the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. He contends that, therefore, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to prove the facts indicated in order to vindicate his constitutional claim in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">\"Accepting Gray\u2019s proffered facts as proven, we ultimately conclude that they do not as a matter of law establish the eighth amendment claim asserted by him and, therefore, no evidentiary hearing is required. Traditional deaths by execution, such as by hanging, have always involved the possibility of pain and terror for the convicted person. Although contemporary notions of civilized conduct may indeed cause some reassessment of what degree or length is acceptable, we are not persuaded that under the present jurisprudential standards the showing made by Gray justifies this intermediate appellate court holding that, as a matter of law or fact, the pain and terror resulting from death by cyanide gas is so different in degree or nature from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that resulting from other traditional modes of execution as to implicate the eighth amendment right.\u201d 710 F.2d at 1060-61 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We reject this contention of Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Calhoun next contends that \"[bjecause an assessment of [Calhoun\u2019s] 'future dangerousness\u2019 was a statutory factor relied upon by the sentencing body below, the Maryland Capital Punishment Statute is unconstitutional in its application in this case.\u201d He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\"Article 27, Sections 413 (c) (1) (i) and (g) (7) permit the introduction of evidence of a defendant\u2019s unlikeliness of engaging 'in further criminal activity that would constitute a threat to society,\u2019 as a mitigating factor. These sections are unconstitutional as applied in this case under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights, and Art. 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">It is Calhoun\u2019s contention that, under the Eighth Amendment and Article 25 of our Declaration of Rights the procedural limits applied in determining the type and degree of punishment to be imposed are greater in capital sentencing proceedings than in other sentencing proceedings. That is, they mandate a higher quality of evidence. In this case Calhoun contends that the evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing to demonstrate his propensity for future dangerousness was highly speculative, unreliable, and inconclusive, and that such evidence does not provide a legal basis for distinguishing those cases in which the death penalty should be imposed. From this stems his contention that the introduction of this evidence violated his constitutional rights. He cites various psychiatric studies that illustrate the speculation involved in labeling a person as having a propensity toward violence: most persons determined to be violent recidivists prove not to be involved in subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>acts or incidents of violence. He maintains that the evidence or testimony of the guard considered in viii, <em>supra, </em>not only failed to establish his future dangerousness, but also served as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance that inflamed and prejudiced the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The State, on the other hand, argues that nothing in the record of the sentencing proceeding indicates that the jury considered propensity toward violence as a factor in determining Calhoun\u2019s sentence. Nevertheless, it concedes that the evidence concerning Calhoun\u2019s behavior at the Montgomery County Detention Center was introduced for the purpose of illustrating that not even incarceration of Calhoun would prevent him from engaging in future criminal acts. The State further contends that expert psychiatric testimony is not required for a jury to be able to evaluate the significance of the guard\u2019s testimony and to determine that Calhoun was not entitled to a finding of an absence of propensity for future violence as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In several cases concerning the death penalty the Supreme Court has stated that the sentencing process must provide for determination and consideration of the particular facts at issue as well as the particular character traits and propensities of the defendant. <em>See, e.g., Zant v. Stephens, </em>U.S. , 103 S. Ct. 2733, 2743-44, 77 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1983); <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 112, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982); <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978); <em>Woodson, </em>428 U.S. at 304; <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 276. The Supreme Court apparently views such a consideration to be an essential feature of capital sentencing procedures which are in compliance with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. For example, in the plurality opinion in <em>Woodson, </em>Justice Stewart noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\"This Court has previously recognized that '[f]oy the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u2019 <em>Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55 (1937). Consideration of both the offender and the offense in order to arrive at a just and appropriate sentence has been viewed as a progressive and humanizing development. See <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S., at 247-249; <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S., at 402-403 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). While the prevailing practice of individualizing sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy rather than a constitutional imperative, we believe that in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment, see <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S., at 100 (plurality opinion), requires consideration of the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.\u201d 428 U.S. at 304.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Although several of the Supreme Court cases which stated that the particular offense and particular propensities of the defendant must be reviewed at the sentencing hearing have stressed the necessity of considering factors in mitigation, <em>e.g. Eddings, </em>455 U.S. at 113-15, and <em>Lockett, </em>438 U.S. at 605-06, other decisions have indicated that <em>all </em>relevant information, positive as well as negative, is admissible during the sentencing proceeding. It is to be noted that both the Oklahoma and Ohio statutes at issue in <em>Eddings </em>and <em>Lockett </em>strictly limited the type of evidence admissible in mitigation, unlike the situation prevailing in Maryland. In <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153, the plurality opinion noted that because information relevant to sentencing often is too prejudicial or irrelevant to the question of guilt, a bifurcated trial procedure best insures that the jury will impose the death sentence in a rational way. The plurality believed that a jury determination of the sentence was desirable in order to maintain a connection between contemporary community standards and the penal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Recently in <em>Barclay v. Florida, </em>U.S. , 103 S. Ct. 3418, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1134 (1983), the Court upheld the application by the Florida Supreme Court of the doctrine of harmless error to a capital sentencing proceeding in which the trial judge had relied on a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge, in addition to finding four statutory aggravating circumstances, noted that Barclay\u2019s extensive prior criminal record itself constituted an aggravating circumstance. <em>Id. </em>at 3422. The Florida capital punishment statute\u2019s only reference to a prior criminal record appears under the mitigating circumstances: the <em>lack of </em>a prior criminal record is a mitigating circumstance. This is similar to the situation we are confronting here: the appellant\u2019s propensity for future dangerousness was introduced by the State in order to illustrate to the jury that Calhoun would act in a violent manner while incarcerated and thus that the sentence should not be life imprisonment. The only comparable reference in our capital punishment statute is to a mitigating circumstance as provided in \u00a7 413 (g) (7), that the defendant is unlikely to \"engage in further criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d In <em>Barclay </em>the Florida court, although noting that the trial judge improperly relied on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record in imposing the death sentence, affirmed the trial judge\u2019s sentence on the basis that this constituted harmless error given the presence of several statutory aggravating circumstances. 103 S. Ct. at 3428.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In affirming the decision of the Florida court, the plurality opinion of the Supreme Court first noted that the trial judge\u2019s consideration of Barclay\u2019s criminal record as an aggravating circumstance was improper as a matter of state law. The trial judge, however, did not consider constitutionally protected conduct nor was such evidence inadmissible under Florida law. \"On the contrary, this evidence was properly introduced to prove that the mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>circumstance of absence of a criminal record did not exist.\u201d 103 S. Ct. at 3427 (Rehnquist, J., wrote the plurality opinion, joined by the Chief Justice and Justices White and O\u2019Connor). Further, the plurality cited <em>Proffitt, </em>428 U.S. 242, stating that no constitutional violation existed in a procedure under which a defendant could receive the death penalty on the basis of a combination of statutory and nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. 103 S. Ct. at 3428. Finally, the plurality stated that the Florida Supreme Court record illustrated that the harmless error doctrine was not applied in an automatic or mechanical way in capital punishment cases. This fact, combined with the Florida court\u2019s practice of reviewing similar cases, mandated a finding of no constitutional violation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In Justice Stevens\u2019 concurring opinion in <em>Barclay, </em>joined by Justice Powell, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\"The Florida rule that statutory aggravating factors must be exclusive affords greater protection than the federal Constitution requires. Although a death sentence may not rest <em>solely </em>on a nonstatutory aggravating factor, see <em>Zant v. Stephens, supra, </em>U.S., at , 103 S. Ct., at 2742-2743, the Constitution does not prohibit consideration at the sentencing phase of information not directly related to either statutory aggravating or statutory mitigating factors, as long as that information is relevant to the character of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime. <em>Zant, supra, </em>at , , 103 S. Ct., at 2743-2744, 2747-2749; <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>428 U.S., at 164, 196-197, 206, 96 S. Ct., at 2920-2921, 2936, 2940-2941; <em>Proffitt v. Florida, supra, </em>428 U.S., at 242, 248, 256-257, n. 14, 96 S. Ct. at 2960, 2964-2965, 2968-2969, n. 14. As we recently wrote in <em>Zant, </em>'What is important at the selection stage is an <em>individualized </em>determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.\u2019 U.S., at , 103 S. Ct., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>2743-2744.\u201d U.S. at , 103 S. Ct. at 3432-33 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Thus, both the plurality and concurring decisions in <em>Barclay </em>suggest that the introduction of the guard\u2019s testimony concerning Calhoun did not violate the Constitution because that evidence was relevant to an \"individualized determination\u201d of his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In addition to the previously cited cases dealing with the admissibility of evidence about the defendant\u2019s character in a capital sentencing proceeding, two Supreme Court cases have confronted directly the question of the propriety of testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s future dangerousness. First, in <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 1866, 68 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1981),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court held that the prosecution\u2019s use of psychiatric testimony at a capital sentencing proceeding to establish the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The defendant had not consented to the psychiatric examination after being informed of both his right to remain silent and the fact that the evidence could be used against him. <em>Id. </em>at 467-68. Further, because this proved to be a critical stage of the proceeding, defendant\u2019s right to counsel attached. Despite this holding, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\"[Ujnder the Texas capital sentencing procedure, the inquiry necessary for the jury\u2019s resolution of the future dangerousness issue is in no sense confined to the province of psychiatric experts. Indeed, some in the psychiatric community are of the view that clinical predictions as to whether a person would or would not commit violent acts in the future are 'fundamentally of very low reliability\u2019 and that psychiatrists possess no special qualifications for making such forecasts.\u201d 451 U.S. at 472.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Second, in <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. 262, the Supreme Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s contention that it is impossible to predict future behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\"Focusing on the second statutory question that Texas requires a jury to answer in considering whether to impose a death sentence, the petitioner argues that it is impossible to predict future behavior and that the question is so vague as to be meaningless. It is, of course, not easy to predict future behavior. The fact that such a determination is difficult, however, does not mean that it cannot be made. Indeed, prediction of future criminal conduct is an essential element in many of the decisions rendered throughout our criminal justice system. The decision whether to admit a defendant to bail, for instance, must often turn on a judge\u2019s prediction of the defendant\u2019s future conduct. And any sentencing authority must predict a convicted person\u2019s probable future conduct when it engages in the process of determining what punishment to impose. For those sentenced to prison, these same predictions must be made by parole authorities.\u201d 428 U.S. at 274-75 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Although this language must be viewed in the context of the Texas capital punishment statute, it negates Calhoun\u2019s contention that evidence concerning future dangerousness is so speculative and unreliable as to result in a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Accordingly, we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Calhoun contends, \"Article 27, sec. 413 (d) (10), which permits imposition of the death penalty upon proof that the murder was committed during the commission or attempt to commit a specified felony, is an unconstitutional aggravating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Calhoun makes two points relative to this issue, (1) that \u00a7 413 (d) (10) produces an overbroad aggravating circumstance and results in a mandatory application of the death penalty, and (2) that the death penalty for felony murder is excessive in that the punishment is disproportionate to the crime committed and there is no deterrent or retributive value in the punishment for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The State in response points out that the aggravating factor is limited in application by its own terms to murder in the commission of \"robbery, arson, or rape or sexual offense in the first degree\u201d while the felony murder statute, Article 27, \u00a7 410, pertains to \"any rape in any degree, sexual offense in the first or second degree, sodomy, mayhem, robbery, burglary, kidnapping as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 337 and 338 of [Article 27], storehouse breaking as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 33 of [Article 27] or daytime housebreaking as defined in \u00a7 30 (b) of [Article 27], or in the escape or attempt to escape from [certain penal institutions].\u201d Section 413 (d) (10) is also limited by other provisions. Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (e) (1) requires that the defendant be a principal in the first degree, thus exempting any accomplices to the felony who did not actually commit the murder. The aggravating circumstances are further limited by the mitigating circumstances of each case that are weighed against these aggravating circumstances during the sentencing proceedings. Thus, read as a whole the statute meets the <em>Gregg </em>standards and imposes the death penalty only in an \"extreme\u201d case. Gregg, 428 U.S. at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The Supreme Court has considered cases challenging the scope of aggravating circumstances in death penalty cases. In <em>Godfrey v. Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420, the plurality opinion was written by Justice Stewart. The opinion referred to <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153, and <em>Furman, </em>408 U.S. 238. It states, \"A capital sentencing scheme must, in short, provide a ' \"meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 446 U.S. at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>In <em>Godfrey </em>the petitioner was found guilty of the murder of his wife and mother-in-law. The only aggravating circumstance which applied to the facts stated, \"The offense of murder .. . was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30 (b) (7) (1982). In <em>Gregg </em>the Court had considered the same provision and found it constitutional based on the limiting interpretation of the provision by the Supreme Court of Georgia. In <em>Godfrey </em>the Supreme Court found Georgia went too far in applying the provision and as a result the aggravating circumstance was unconstitutional.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\"In the case before us, the Georgia Supreme Court has affirmed a sentence of death based upon no more than a finding that the offense was 'outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman.\u2019 There is nothing in these few words, standing alone, that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence. A person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder as 'outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman.\u2019 \u201d 446 U.S. at 428-29 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In a footnote, however, Justice Stewart recognized for the plurality that the other Georgia aggravating factors were \"more specific or objectively measurable than \u00a7 (b) (7)....\u201d 446 U.S. at 423 n. 2. One of the nine circumstances listed is similar to the aggravating factor at issue in the present case. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-30 (b) (2) (1982), states as an aggravating factor, \"The offense of murder ... was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, [(rape, armed robbery, kidnapping)] or aggravated battery, or the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of burglary or arson in the first degree.\u201d Under the Maryland statute felony murder as an aggravating circumstance is sufficiently limited by its own terms and other provisions of the statute, thus meeting the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>requirements set down by the Supreme Court in <em>Godfrey. </em>In this instance the jury found two other aggravating circumstances. However, even if this particular aggravating circumstance had been the only one found it would not result in an \"arbitrary and capricious\u201d infliction of the death sentence, as prohibited by the Supreme Court in <em>Furman, </em>408 U.S. 238. <em>See also Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Although \u00a7 413 (d) (10) is the most common aggravating circumstance, applied, this does not detract from its validity when the data relative to capital cases is placed in perspective. While the majority of capital cases where the death penalty was imposed by the sentencing authority contained (d) (10) as at least one of the aggravating circumstances (75%), there is no evidence that the majority of all murders in the State are felony murders of the type listed in \u00a7 413 (d) (10). Additionally, not all of those charged with felony murder are principals in the first degree as required under \u00a7 413 (e) (1). There appear to be sufficient limits on the application of \u00a7 413 (d) (10) to meet the criteria of the Supreme Court. Absent other evidence to the contrary, Calhoun\u2019s claim of overbreadth is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">As to Calhoun\u2019s second claim that the death penalty is excessive in felony murder cases, guidelines have been established by the Supreme Court for consideration of this issue. In <em>Coker, </em>433 U.S. 584, the Court considered several factors in deciding whether the death penalty was' an excessive punishment for the crime of rape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\"Under <em>Gregg, </em>a punishment is 'excessive\u2019 and unconstitutional if it (1) makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and hence is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering; or (2) is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. A punishment might fail the test on either ground.\u201d 433 U.S. at 592.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Primarily, the Court considered objective factors in reaching its decision, legislative judgments, and sentencing decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>made by juries. It stressed the importance of society\u2019s view of what constitutes \"cruel and unusual\u201d punishment. That the death penalty was not a disproportionate punishment for the crime of murder was recognized by Justice White in the plurality opinion, in which he compared the crime of murder to the crime of rape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\"Rape is without doubt deserving of serious punishment; but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, it does not compare with murder, which does involve the unjustified taking of human life. Although it may be accompanied by another crime, rape by definition does not include the death of or even the serious injury to another person. The murderer kills; the rapist, if no more than that, does not. Life is over for the victim of the murderer; for the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was, but it is not over and normally is not beyond repair.\u201d 433 U.S. at 598 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">More recently the Supreme Court considered whether the death penalty is valid punishment for an accomplice sentenced to death for felony murder where the accused \"neither took life, attempted to take life, nor intended to take life.\u201d <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 787, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1140 (1982). The Court found the punishment to be excessive in that case. Justice White noted for the Court that \"one state flatly prohibits capital punishment in cases where the defendant did not actually commit murder,\u201d refering to our requirement that it is only a principal in the first degree who is subject to the death penalty. Although the holding of the Court is not explicit, it appears that the Court in <em>Enmund </em>was not declaring the death penalty excessive for an accomplice in felony murder but only as applied to the circumstances of that case. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\"Enmund did not kill or intend to kill and thus his culpability is plainly different from that of the robbers who killed; yet the state treated them alike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>. and attributed to Enmund the culpability of those who killed the Kerseys.\u201d 458 U.S. at 798.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In <em>Enmund </em>the Court considered legislative decisions as evidenced by death penalty statutes then operating as well as sentencing decisions made by juries and found little support for the death penalty in accomplice felony murder cases. In this regard it should be noted that, according to the statistics in the Supreme Court opinion, Maryland is the only state, of approximately thirty-two states with death penalty statutes which flatly prohibits capital punishment where the defendant is not a principal in the first degree. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\"The question before us is not the disproportionality of death as a penalty for murder, but rather the validity of capital punishment for Enmund\u2019s own conduct. The focus must be on <em>his </em>culpability, not on that of those who committed the robbery and shot the victims, for we insist on 'individualized consideration as a constitutional requirement in imposing the death sentence,\u2019 <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978) (footnote omitted), which means that we must focus on 'relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender.\u2019 <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 304 (1976).\u201d 458 U.S. at 798 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Although under the facts in <em>Enmund </em>the Court denied the death penalty\u2019s value as a punishment, it did not deny the deterrent and' retributive value under felony murder as applicable in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\"We are quite unconvinced, however, that the threat that the death penalty will be imposed for murder will measurably deter one who does not kill and has no intention or purpose that life will be taken. Instead, it seems likely that 'capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Fisher v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 463, 484 (1946) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), for if a person does not intend that life be taken or contemplate that lethal force will be employed by others, the possibility that the death penalty will be imposed for vicarious felony murder will not 'enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.\u2019 <em>Gregg v. Georgia, supra, </em>at 186.\u201d 458 U.S. at 798-99.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In <em>Enmund, </em>on the subject of retribution, the Court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\"As for retribution as a justification for executing Enmund, we think this very much depends on the degree of Enmund\u2019s culpability \u2014 what Enmund\u2019s intentions, expectations, and actions were. American criminal law has long considered a defendant\u2019s intention \u2014 and therefore his moral guilt \u2014 to be critical to 'the degree of [his] criminal culpability,\u2019 <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 698 (1975), and the Court has found criminal penalties to be unconstitutionally excessive in the absence of intentional wrongdoing.\u201d 458 U.S. at 800.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Although Calhoun has argued his lack of intent to commit murder in the course of a felony, the operation here was planned. This was set forth in the testimony of the accomplice relative to the postmidnight meeting after they were initially scared off. The felons wore masks and gloves. Calhoun and his associate went armed. The guns must have been intended for use if circumstances required. Those instructing in the use of firearms teach that one should not point a gun at an individual unless one intends to kill that individual. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Enmund </em>found no value in the punishment for one who was neither present or armed at the time of murder, it did not deny the value of the penalty as a punishment imposed on the \"trigger man.\u201d We find \u00a7 413 (d) (10) to be a constitutional aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>G</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Calhoun claims, \"Article 27, sec. 413 (c), renders the death penalty in Maryland unconstitutional.\u201d This contention apparently is based on the belief that the section is constitutionally infirm because of its broad provisions as to evidence the sentencing authority is to consider in reaching its decision to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment. Section 413 (c) (1) states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\"(c) <em>Evidence; argument; instructions. </em>\u2014 (1) The following type of evidence is admissible in this proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\"(i) Evidence relating to any mitigating circumstance listed in subsection (g);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\"(ii) Evidence relating to any aggravating circumstance listed in subsection (d) of which the State had notified the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 412(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">\"(in) Evidence of any prior criminal convictions, pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, or the absence of such prior convictions or pleas, to the same extent admissible in other sentencing procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">\"(iv) Any presentence investigation report. However, any recommendation as to sentence contained in the report is not admissible; and \"(v) Any other evidence that the court deems of probative value and relevant to sentence, provided the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Calhoun contends that the statute fails to satisfy the constitutional mandate to limit jury discretion: it fails not only to provide clear and objective standards that provide specific guidance for the sentencing authority, but also to provide a basis for the rational review of the sentence. The fact that the jury is given the same boundless discretion in capital punishment cases \u2014 to consider reliable, nonjudicial evidence of conduct \u2014 as the trial judge is given in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>criminal cases violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The State contends that the guidance constitutionally required to be given to the jury is manifested in the Maryland statute. Thus, the jury may consider some evidence not properly admissible at the trial stage when determining the sentence to be imposed. It notes that the admissibility of evidence relating to a defendant\u2019s conduct cannot result in the creation of new, nonstatutory aggravating circumstances because such evidence is admissible only <em>after </em>statutory aggravating circumstances have been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, Judge Digges said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\"In our view, part (v) [of \u00a7 413(c)] in unambiguous terms authorizes the trial court to admit into evidence before the sentencing jury identical information concerning a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct as would normally be considered by the judge if he were imposing sentence in a non-death penalty case.\u201d 292 Md. at 442-43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">We further noted that the sentencing authority in a capital punishment case ought to be provided all relevant information. <em>Id. </em>at 443. Calhoun contends that this grant of discretion to the jury is too broad and thus violates his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He overlooks, however, both the context of the Maryland statute in which this discretion is to be exercised and various Supreme Court opinions that approve jury sentencing in death penalty cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The Supreme Court has stated several times that the jury\u2019s authority to sentence a person convicted of first degree murder to death is constitutional as long as procedural safeguards exist that \"guide\u201d and \"channel\u201d the jury\u2019s decision. <em>See Barclay, </em>U.S. , 103 S. Ct. 3418, 3424; <em>Zant, U.S. </em>, 103 S. Ct. 2733, 2742-43; <em>Proffitt, </em>428 U.S. 242, 258; <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. 262, 276; <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153, 192; and <em>Furman, </em>408 U.S. 238, 400-01 (Burger, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In <em>Furman </em>Chief Justice Burger noted that the penalty of death itself was not cruel; rather, the procedures for imposing sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. 408 U.S. 238, 397-98 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). The Chief Justice stated that legislatures must provide sentencing standards and narrow definitions of crimes for which the death penalty may be imposed in order to insure its imposition in a rational, noncapricious, and nonarbitrary manner. <em>Id. </em>at 400-01. This view was noted by the plurality opinion in <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. 153, <em>\"Furman </em>mandates that where discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be taken or spared, that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. The <em>Gregg </em>plurality recognized the problem that juries, as inexperienced sentencers, could misapply information heard in a sentencing proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\"[T]he provision of relevant information under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used in the imposition of punishment, especially if sentencing is performed by a jury. Since the members of a jury will have had little, if any, previous experience in sentencing, they are unlikely to be skilled in dealing with the information they are given.... To the extent that this problem is inherent in jury sentencing, it may not be totally correctible. It seems clear, however, that the problem will be alleviated if the jury is given guidance regarding the factors about the crime and the defendant that the State, representing organized society, deems particularly relevant to the sentencing decision.\u201d 428 U.S. at 192 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The plurality then noted that the Georgia statute provided the sentencing authority sufficient guidelines by means of its listing the aggravating and mitigating factors to be considered combined with its requiring the jury to specify the factors it used in reaching its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 197-98. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Court there stated that the combination of a carefully drafted statute and a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority was \"apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information\u201d insures rational imposition of the death penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 195. The plurality opinion further noted, \"So long as the evidence introduced and the arguments made at the presentence hearing do not prejudice a defendant, it is preferable not to impose restrictions. We think it desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, cited with approval in <em>Zant, </em>U.S. at , 103 S. Ct. at 2748.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Concerning the statute at issue in <em>Proffitt, </em>428 U.S. 242, the plurality opinion noted that the jury was provided with sufficient guidance at the sentencing phase so as to ensure that capital punishment is imposed rationally and nonarbitrarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\"While the various factors to be considered by the sentencing authorities do not have numerical weights assigned to them, the requirements of <em>Furman </em>are satisfied when the sentencing authority\u2019s discretion is guided and channeled by requiring examination of specific factors that argue in favor of or against imposition of the death penalty, thus eliminating total arbitrariness and capriciousness in its imposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\"The directions given to judge and jury by the Florida statute are sufficiently clear and precise to enable the various aggravating circumstances to be weighed against the mitigating ones. As a result, the trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion is guided and channeled by a system that focuses on the circumstances of each individual homicide and individual defendant in deciding whether the death penalty is to be imposed.\u201d 428 U.S. at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Moreover, in <em>Barclay, </em>U.S. , 103 S. Ct. 3418, the plurality opinion stated that a sentencing authority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>bringing of its own experience to bear on a sentencing determination did not constitute an abuse of discretion and thus did not violate the petitioner\u2019s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. In rejecting Barclay\u2019s argument that the trial judge improperly compared Barclay\u2019s actions to those of the Nazis in World War II, Justice Rehnquist said for the plurality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\"Any sentencing decision calls for the exercise of judgment. It is neither possible nor desirable for a person to whom the state entrusts an important judgment to decide in a vacuum, as if he had no experiences. The thrust of our decisions on capital punishment has been 'that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.\u2019 <em>Zant v. Stephens, </em>U.S. , , 103 S. Ct. 2733, 2741, 75 L. Ed. 2d (1983), quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 189, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2932, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\"It is entirely fitting for the moral, factual, and legal judgment of judges and juries to play a meaningful role in sentencing. We expect that sentencers will exercise their discretion in their own way and to the best of their ability.

Ed. 2d 913 (1976), and as long as the decision is not so wholly arbitrary as to offend the Constitution, the Eighth Amendment cannot and should not demand more.\u201d U.S. at , 103 S.

Maryland\u2019s statute, as previously analyzed in <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. 405, and <em>Tichnell I, </em>287 Md. 695, falls within the Supreme Court\u2019s prescription for a statute that provides sufficient guidance and opportunity for channeled discretion to the sentencing authority. First, the sentencing authority must determine whether any enumerated statutory aggravating circumstance exists beyond a reasonable doubt. Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (d). Second, if the sentencing authority finds that one or more aggravating circumstances exist, it must consider whether any mitigating circumstances exist by a preponderance of the evidence; as illustrated in this case, the sentencing authority is not restricted to a consideration of the specifically enumerated statutory mitigating factors. Section 413 (g). Third, the sentencing authority must determine whether the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence; only if the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances under the preponderance standard is the death sentence imposed. Section 413 (h). Fourth, the determination of the sentencing authority must be in writing and must be unanimous. Section 413 (i). Fifth, the sentencing authority must specify in writing the factors considered in rendering its decision. Section 413 (j). All of these provisions together provide the guidance and means of channeling the jury\u2019s discretion that the Supreme Court requires. Hence, we reject this contention of Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Calhoun next contends that \"Article 27, secs. 413 and 414, unconstitutionally restrict the discretion of the finder of fact in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Calhoun first contends that the Maryland death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it mandates the sentence of death in any case where one or more aggravating circumstances are found but no mitigating circumstance is found. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We hasten to point out that a mitigating circumstance was found in this instance. Thus, that portion of his contention is not before us. He claims the sentencing authority should be entitled to conclude that even if a case is within the literal terms of one or more statutory aggravating circumstances, the death penalty is unwarranted. He further contends that the capital punishment statute is unconstitutional because different factfinders may perceive particular aggravating and mitigating circumstances differently; thus, the determination of whether the death penalty should be imposed rests on \"semantic distinctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The State argues that the Maryland statute is constitutional because it permits a sentencing authority to articulate any mitigating factor \u2014 statutory or nonstatutory \u2014 deemed relevant and then to consider whether it outweighs the statutory aggravating factor or factors. Therefore, the statute does not mandate the imposition of the death penalty in any given type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In <em>Tichnell I, </em>287 Md. 695, we noted that because the Maryland statute allows for consideration of a broad range of mitigating factors, it satisfied the standards established by the Supreme Court in <em>Woodson, </em>428 U.S. 280, and <em>Roberts (Stanislaus) v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325. <em>See Tichnell I, </em>287 Md. at 728. In <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Roberts (Stanislaus), </em>as well as in <em>Roberts (Harry) v. Louisiana, </em>431 U.S. 633, 97 S. Ct. 1993, 52 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1977), the Supreme Court struck down statutes that required the mandatory imposition of the death penalty for first degree murder. The Court\u2019s primary criticism of the North Carolina and Louisiana statutes was that they precluded consideration of the particular traits of the individual defendant and the particular circumstances of the crime for which he was convicted. <em>See Roberts (Harry), </em>431 U.S. at 637; <em>Roberts (Stanislaus), </em>428 U.S. at 335-36; <em>Woodson, </em>428 U.S. at 304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Our statute provides for an individualized determination of the defendant and the crime. This fact alone would appear to insure that the death sentence is not imposed in a mandatory manner. Further, as Chief Judge Murphy noted for the Court in <em>Tichnell III, </em>297 Md. 432, in the forty-eight cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>where the State sought the death penalty it was imposed twenty times, thus negating any mandatory result. Moreover, the sentencing authority may articulate <em>any factor </em>it finds in mitigation. <em>See </em>Code (1957,1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (g) (8), which states, \"Any other facts which the jury or the court specifically sets forth in writing that it finds as mitigating circumstances in the case.\u201d Indeed, this case is a splendid example of the willingness of a jury to consider relevant information that may be weighed against a proven statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances. Here the jury determined that \"a substantial mitigating factor is the defendant\u2019s background, which has been such that he has never been integrated into society. Therefore, he has been and is unable to conform with its norms and moral values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Finally, of the forty-eight cases in which the State sought the death penalty, only one involved the situation about which Calhoun here warns: where one or more aggravating circumstances is found and no mitigating circumstance is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This contention of Calhoun also must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Calhoun claims, \"The statute unconstitutionally places the burden of proof to show mitigation on the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Calhoun argues that the statute violates his due process rights by placing an unconstitutional burden on him to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the mitigating circumstances and that they outweigh any aggravating factor. He contends that the burden of proof must be on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of any mitigating circumstance raised and that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. He asserts that the sentencing proceeding is as important as the trial, particularly when the punishment is death, and, therefore, due process protections require that the risk of error be minimized by placing the burden on the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Judge Digges said for the Court in <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 436, that this argument was \"thoroughly considered and rejected, however, in our recent decision of <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 720-34, 415 A.2d 830, 843-50 (1980), and we deem the matter to be settled.\u201d We need say no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">x Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Calhoun contends that Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.

Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 414 (e) as to factors to be considered by us relative to the sentence, we find in this case that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance under \u00a7 413 (d); the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances; and the sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant. We point out that in three of the cases we have reviewed in which the defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment \u2014 Sails, Hughes, and Quickley \u2014 the sentencing jury found several mitigating factors; in Monroe, the sentencing judge found two mitigating factors. In this case Calhoun\u2019s environment was the sole mitigating circumstance. In none of the reviewed cases where the death penalty was imposed did the sentencing authority find that three aggravating circumstances were proven beyond a reasonable doubt as in this case. It thus follows that the death sentence must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\">. Mr. Hamilton was the prosecutor.

Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 414 (e) the inventory of cases utilized for proportionality review must include not only those death-eligible cases in which the prosecutor has sought the death penalty, whether it was imposed or not, but all those death-eligible cases in which the prosecutor did not seek the death penalty. <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 485, 468 A.2d 1, 26 (1983) (Davidson J., dissenting) <em>(Tichnell III). </em>For the reasons expressed in Part I of my dissenting opinion in <em>Tichnell III, </em>I would vacate the death sentence in this case. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In addition, however, I feel impelled to note that the majority\u2019s decision is indefensible for other reasons as well \u2014 for today the majority permits a defendant, deprived of a fair and impartial sentencing proceeding, to be executed because his lawyer allegedly made a mistake. In my view, the admission of testimony concerning an incident that occurred at the Montgomery County Detention Center in August 1981 involving the defendant and a correctional officer constituted prejudicial error. For the additional reasons expressed below, I would vacate the death sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The majority here refuses to consider whether the trial court committed prejudicial error when, during the sentencing proceeding, it admitted into evidence testimony concerning the Montgomery County Detention Center incident in August 1981. The majority finds that the defendant\u2019s specific objection to this testimony was that it \"bore no relationship to the specified aggravating circumstances.\u201d Additionally, the majority finds that the specific objection \"was narrowed by defense counsel to whether the incident at the detention center was relevant to 'a mitigating circumstance.\u2019 \u201d Relying upon <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 368 A.2d 468 (1973), the majority determines that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>defendant waived his right to object to the admission of the evidence on the ground that it was inadmissible under Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii). I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The defendant\u2019s specific objections, as recognized by the majority, were that the testimony concerning the Montgomery County Detention Center incident was not relevant to either an aggravating or mitigating circumstance. In essence, the defendant\u2019s specific objections were that the testimony was inadmissible under Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (ii). More particularly, with respect to mitigating circumstances, the defendant\u2019s specific objection was that this testimony was not relevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (g) (7) \u2014 that the defendant was unlikely to engage in further criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">I do not, however, agree with the majority that by specifying \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (g) (7) the defendant waived an objection on the ground that the objected to testimony was inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) and, therefore, failed to preserve that question for review. In my view, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i), (g) (7), and (c) (iii) are integrally related.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (c) (1) (iii) are component parts of \u00a7 413 (c) (1) that must be read in conjunction with one another. <em>Scott v. State, </em>297 Md. 235, 248, 465 A.2d 1126, 1133 (1983). Testimony inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) is inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) to disprove the existence of the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7). Indeed, this Court has held that \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii) preclude \"in a death penalty case, the admission of evidence of crimes of violence for which there have been no convictions----\u201d <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. at 247, 465 A.2d at 1133. In sum, \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) is subsumed in \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In the instant case, the defendant was not required to and did not in fact specify the reasons underlying his objection and supporting his contention that under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) the objected to testimony was irrelevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7). Under these circumstances, the question before the trial court was whether the objected to testimony was inadmissible because under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) it was irrelevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7). In order to resolve that question, the trial court was required to consider all of the reasons for which the objected to testimony might be irrelevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Section 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii) collectively establish that only evidence of unrelated crimes for which there has been a conviction is admissible and that evidence of unrelated crimes for which there has been a conviction is inadmissible to prove or disprove the existence of any mitigating circumstance, including the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7). Scott, 297 Md. at 235, 465 A.2d at 1133. Accordingly, one of the reasons the trial court was required to consider in determining whether the objected to testimony was irrelevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7) was that it was unrelated to a crime for which there had been a conviction. The trial court determined that the objected to testimony was admissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) and, therefore, was admissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) to disprove the existence of any mitigating circumstance, including the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7). Thus, in light of the integral relationship be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tween \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i), (g) (7), and (c) (1) (iii), the trial court determined the question whether the objected to testimony was irrelevant to the mitigating circumstance delineated in \u00a7 413 (g) (7) and, therefore, inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) because it was inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii). There was nothing further that the defendant was required to do in order to preserve that question for appellate review. Md. Rule 522 a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, the question presented to this Court was raised in and decided by the trial court and, therefore, was properly preserved for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Even if I agreed with the majority that the question whether the objected to testimony was inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii) was not properly preserved for review, I would, nonetheless, consider and determine that question. In <em>von Lusch, </em>279 Md. at 262-64, 368 A.2d at 472, relied upon by the majority, this Court established a principle of waiver premised upon Maryland Rules 522 d and 725 f.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">\"[W]here one objecting to the admission of evidence, although not requested by the court to state his grounds, goes ahead and delineates the specific grounds for his objection, he will be bound by those grounds and will <em>ordinarily </em>be deemed to have waived other grounds not mentioned.\u201d <em>von Lusch, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>279 Md. at 263, 368 A.2d at 472-73 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The use of the word \"ordinarily\u201d makes it plain that under certain circumstances this Court may determine whether evidence was improperly admitted for reasons other than those specified at trial. Manifestly, this Court has discretion in the application of this waiver principle. I would exercise that discretion in this death penalty case.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The statutory scheme embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 413 and 414 evidences the General Assembly\u2019s recognition that the unique severity of the death penalty necessitates unprecedented modes of appellate review that require extraordinary scrutiny by this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More particularly, \u00a7 414(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\"Whenever the death penalty is imposed, and the judgment becomes final, the Court of Appeals <em>shall </em>review the sentence on the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">This automatic direct appeal mandates that this Court review a death sentence even when unchallenged by the defendant. This \u25a0 legislative mandate suggests that unchallenged errors that occur at a death penalty sentencing proceeding should not be ignored. <em>See State v. Osborn, </em>102 Idaho 405, 410-11, 631 P.2d 187, 192-93 (1981); <em>Commonwealth v. McKenna, </em>476 Pa. 428, 439-44, 383 A.2d 174, 180-81 (1978). Indeed, the legislative mandate that the right to review a death sentence cannot be waived, supports the conclusion that the principles of waiver ordinarily applicable in criminal cases should not be rigidly applied by this Court in reviewing a death penalty sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>This Court has consistently recognized that the principles of waiver ordinarily applicable in criminal cases should not be rigidly applied in death penalty cases. <em>Johnson v.

This, however, is a case involving the death penalty and we have decided to consider and determine all of the questions briefed and argued by the appellant before us whether or not tried and decided by the lower court.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Similarly, in <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 412 n.3, 439 A.2d at 547 n.3, Judge Digges, writing for the majority, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">\"[W]e shall assume without deciding that appellant\u2019s claim is properly preserved for review. We note, however, that, while 'ordinarily\u2019 we will not consider questions not properly preserved for appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 885, in a previous death penalty case we demonstrated a less strict application of this principle and exercised our discretion to consider and determine questions briefed and argued before us whether or not properly preserved for review. See Bartholomey v. State, 260 Md. 504, 513, 273 A.2d 164, 169 (1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Courts in other jurisdictions employing a variety of rationales have similarly concluded that the principles of waiver ordinarily applicable in criminal cases should not be applied in death penalty cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Illustrative is the case of <em>State v. Britt, </em>235 S.C. 395, 424, 111 S.E.2d 669, 684 (1959), in which the Supreme Court of South Carolina said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">\"The power of the law to take the life of human beings for a violation of the law is one which should be and is exercised with extreme caution. The frailties of human nature are so manifold and manifest until the law should and does place around the defendant, whose life will be taken for a violation of the law, every safeguard to enable such defendant to secure a fair and impartial trial. This Court has taken the position that in all cases involving the life of the defendant, it is not bound down to a consideration of the exceptions raised, but if anything appears in the record which would warrant a reversal of the cause, this Court will consider that matter as if raised by the exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Moreover, in death penalty cases, this Court has repeatedly considered and determined questions briefed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>argued before us even when not properly preserved for appellate review. <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 185-86, 187-88, 453 A.2d 1218, 1228, 1229-30 (1983); <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 412 n.3, 439 A.2d at 547 n.3; <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 714-15, 415 A.2d 830, 840 (1980); <em>Bartholomey, </em>260 Md. at 513, 273 A.2d at 169. Indeed, in <em>Calhoun, </em>the very case presently before us, the majority recognizes and applies this virtually universal principle. The majority twice expressly exercises its discretion to consider and determine questions that have not been properly preserved for appellate review. Thus, Judge Smith, writing for the majority, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">\"There is both a short and a long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contentions. The short answer is that counsel said, '[W]e are satisfied!,]\u2019 after the last juror was sworn subsequent to the exhaustion of Calhoun\u2019s peremptory challenges. The State then announced its satisfaction. <em>Thus, the point is waived. However, because of the nature of the case we shall give the \u2019long answer\u2019 to Calhoun\u2019s contentions.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted. Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Similarly, Judge Smith subsequently states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\"As in iii, there is a short and a long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contention. The short answer is that no request for such instruction was made at trial nor was any objection made upon that basis to the instructions which were given as required by Rule 757 (f). Rule 757 (h) provides that an objection is not reviewable as of right unless it is made in compliance with Rule 757 (f). We are urged that we should take cognizance of this as 'plain error\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 757 (h). In <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980), we indicated that <em>an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error only when the error is so \u2019compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental [as] to [deny] the defendant a fair </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>trial.\u2019 There is no such error in this case. Because this is a capital case in which we are affirming a sentence of death, however, we shall give the long answer to Calhoun\u2019s contention.\u201d </em>Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Additionally, in death penalty cases, this Court has repeatedly considered and determined questions briefed and argued before it without any discussion or comment concerning allegations that those questions had not been properly preserved for appellate review. <em>Poole, </em>295 Md. at 182, 453 A.2d at 1226-27 and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 6; <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 430-31, 439 A.2d at 557 and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 18-20; <em>Poole v. State, </em>290 Md. 114, 125, 428 A.2d 434, 440 (1981) and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 25; <em>Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 714, 717-19, 415 A.2d at 840, 842-43, and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 23, 24. Indeed, in the instant case, the majority, in Section iv Approver and Section ix C Constitutional Issues, determines questions without any discussion or comment concerning the State\u2019s allegations that those questions had not been properly preserved for appellate review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Notwithstanding the legislative requirement of extraordinary scrutiny by this Court in death penalty sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>proceedings and this Court\u2019s own previous and present express agreement with the virtually universal rule that the principles of waiver ordinarily applied in criminal cases should not be rigidly applied in death penalty cases, the majority here, without explanation or comment, applies a waiver principle. In my view, principles of waiver ordinarily applied with respect to questions not properly preserved for appellate review should not be rigidly applied in a death penalty case. Rather, in such a case, discretion should be exercised to consider and determine questions briefed and argued even if not properly preserved for appeal. Thus, unlike the majority, I would consider and determine the question, raised and argued here \u2014 whether testimony concerning the Montgomery County Detention Center incident was inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In <em>Scott, </em>the question presented was whether under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) evidence is admissible at a sentencing proceeding to show that an accused convicted of premeditated murder has committed other unrelated crimes for which the accused has not been convicted. The accused there contended that under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii), admissible evidence of unrelated crimes is restricted to evidence of prior convictions. The State contended that evidence of unrelated crimes for which the accused has not been convicted is admissible at a sentencing proceeding under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (v). This Court stated that the language of \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) through (iv) \"collectively unambiguously restricts the type of evidence admissible in a sentencing proceeding in a death penalty case to something less inclusive than what generally is admissible in a sentencing proceeding in a nondeath penalty case.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. at 246, 465 A.2d at 1132. More particularly, we concluded that \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii) preclude \"in a death penalty case, the admission of evidence of crimes of violence for which there have been no convictions....\u201d <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. at 247, 465 A.2d at 1133. Additionally, we indicated that those sections not only restrict the type of admissible evidence of unrelated crimes to crimes for which the defendant had been convicted, but also to crimes defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>as crimes of violence under \u00a7 413 (g) (l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. at 247, 465 A.2d at 1133. Finally, we concluded that the language of \u00a7 413 (c).(l) (v) \"cannot be construed as authorizing evidence of unrelated crimes to be admitted in a death penalty case, even where there has been no conviction. .. <em>Scott, </em>297 Md. at 247, 465 A.2d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The record here shows that the State neither proffered nor introduced any evidence to show that the defendant had been convicted of any crime relating to the Montgomery County Detention Center incident. Manifestly, the State has failed to satisfy its burden of proof. Moreover, the dockets of both the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County reveal that subsequent to July 1981 the defendant had not been convicted of any crimes other than those relating to the instant case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, I, unlike the majority, can only conclude that the defendant had not been convicted of any crime related to the Montgomery County Detention Center incident. Under these circumstances, the holding in <em>Scott </em>that in a death penalty case \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii) preclude the admission of evidence of unrelated crimes for which there have been no convictions is dispositive here. Accordingly, I would hold that the testimony concerning the Montgomery County Detention Center incident was inadmissible under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (iii).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Here, the trial court admitted evidence of an unrelated battery for which there was not a conviction. Under \u00a7 413 (c) (1) (i) and (iii), this evidence was inadmissible. The admission of this evidence exposed the jury to inflammatory, detailed testimony concerning the underlying facts and circumstances surrounding the unrelated crime. In closing argument, the State\u2019s Attorney drew the jury\u2019s attention to this inadmissible inflammatory testimony when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\"Can you say that he doesn\u2019t present a threat to the personnel who are charged with running our penal institutions if he could do what he did to Sgt. Hunt with that bottle of excrement. And that before being sentenced, before even going to trial, knowing that kind of information could perhaps be presented in any judicial proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In light of the impact of this testimony and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s reference to it in closing argument, defense counsel felt impelled to respond by addressing the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\"And what should we think of and how shall we apply the evidence that he threw excrement on a guard at the detention center? Shall he go to the gas chamber for that? Why is that offered? It is for you to believe that he is an animal, that he is not human, that you are not really killing a human being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In my view, the inadmissible evidence was significantly prejudicial to the defendant. Its admission constituted reversible error. Accordingly, I would vacate the death sentence for this reason, as well as for the reasons expressed in Part I in my dissenting opinion in <em>Tichnell III.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">. \u00a7 413 (c) (1) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\"The following type of evidence is admissible in this proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\"(i) Evidence relating to any mitigating circumstance listed in subsection (g);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\"(iii) Evidence of any prior criminal convictions, pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, or the absence of such prior convictions or pleas, to the same extent admissible in other sentencing procedures...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">\u00a7 413 (g) (7) establishes as a mitigation circumstance that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\"It is unlikely that the defendant will engage in further criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">.
