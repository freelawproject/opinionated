But the intestate had had brothers and sisters, who died under these circumstances: 1. Richard, who died without issue. 2. Catharine, who married Casper Wistar, and left issue, Richard, Margaret, Catharine, Rebecca, Sarah and Casper, of this family; Richard, Margaret and Rebecca are dead ; but all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>them leaving issue. 3. Anne, who married-Lukens, and left issue, John, Mary, Daniel, Derrick and Rebecca ; all of this family died in the life of the intestate, but all of them left issue. 4. John, who died in the lifetime of the intestate, but left issue Anthony (the plaintiff in error), John, Joseph and Margaret; and Margaret also died in the intestate\u2019s lifetime, leaving issue. 5. Margaret, who intermarried with Reuben Haines, and left issue Casper (the lessor of the plaintiff below), Catharine, Josiah and Reuben; Josiah is dead, leaving one son, who is now alive; and Reuben is dead, without issue. It was agreed, that Margaret, the daughter of Catharine, who was the sister of Rebecca, died in the lifetime of the intestate.

(3 Dall.

(4 Dall. Laws, 154.) The first act was passed on the 19th of April 1794 ; the second act was passed on the 4th of April 1797 ; but the intestate died between the dates of those acts, on the 13th of February 1797.

The common law being, therefore, the original guide, and the plaintiff in error being the heir at common law, his title must prevail, unless it shall appear, that an alteration in the rale has been made, by some act of the general assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Now, when the intestate died, there was but one law in existence on the subject, the law of the 19th of April 1794 ; and though the sixth section of that law provides for the case of a person dying intestate, leaving, \u201c neither widow nor lawful issue, but leaving a father, brothers and sisters,\u201d it does not provide, nor does any other of the sections provide, for the case of a ^person dying intestate, without lawful issue, and leaving no father or mother, brothers or sisters. The descent of the real estate, in this *\u2022 specific case, was not, therefore, altered or regu.ated by any act of the general assembly, when the estate was vested in the person entitled to take, at the death of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">It is probable, that if the case had been stated to the legislature, they would have directed the same distribution in the year 1794, that they have since done by the act of the year 1797 : and it is urged, that as there is equal reason for making such a distribution, where no father survives, as where a father does survive the intestate, the court ought, upon the obvious principle and policy of the law, to supply the deficiency. But it must be remembered, that the system of distributing real estates, in cases of intestacy, is an encroachment on the common law ; and wherever such an encroachment takes away a right, which would otherwise be vested in the heir-at-law, the operation of the statute should not be extended further, than it. is carried by the very words of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We are, upon the whole, unanimously of opinion, that the judgment below should be reversed; and that judgment should be given for the plaintiff in error. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\"> Lands entailed, and trust estates, descend, in Pennsylvania, according to the course of the common law.
