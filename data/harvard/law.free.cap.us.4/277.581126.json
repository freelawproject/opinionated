On the 1st of August 1804, judgment was entered, by confession, at the suit of <em>Ewing </em>v. Murray, in the common pleas of Philadelphia county ; in which the declaration was entitled of June term preceding. On the 3d of August 1804, judgment was entered, by confession, in the supreme court, against the same defendant, at the suit of Welsh, the present plaintiff; and the declaration was entitled as of March term preceding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-14\">The question submitted was, which judgment was entitled to a priority of payment, from the proceeds of the sale of the defendant\u2019s real estate ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-15\"><em>Wallace, </em>on behalf of Welsh, the present plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACW2\">contended, that the supreme court judgment, though, in fact, last entered, had a legal relation to March term; and must be preferred to the common pleas judgment, which related only to June term. He cited authorities to show the relation at common law: 14 Vin. Abr. 616; 12 Mod. 519; 3 Bl. Com. 420; 6 Mod. 191; Yelv. 35; 3 Burr. 1596; 1 Wils. 39; 2 Saund. 9. And he argued, that neither the English statute of frauds, nor the Pennsylvania act of assembly, affected the legal relation of a judgment, except only in the case of <em>bond fide </em>purchasers ; not in the case of conflicting judgments. 3 P.

He then contended, that there was an essential difference between the law of England, and the law of Pennsylvania, on the subject; that, although the question would often arise here, as lands were subject to execution and sale, it would seldom arise there ; that the practice had uniformly been to pay judgments, out of the sale of real estates, according to the actual date of entering them; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and that the point had already been adjudged in <em>Hooton </em>v. <em>Will, </em>1 Dall. 187, 450.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> s. c. 4 Yeates 198; where the case is more fully reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em> </em>The following certificates were founded on the fact of practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\u201c I certify, that while I held the office of sheriff for the city and county of Philadelphia, I uniformly settled the payment of judgments, in the case of sales of real estates, according to the actual dates of those judgments certified by the respective prothonotaries, without reference to the terms of which the said judgments were entered.
