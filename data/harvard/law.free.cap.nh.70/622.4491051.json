At the May trial term, 1899, the defendant moved that the plaintiff be required, under the 26th rule of court, to file a deposition taken by him of a witness, not a party, residing in Massachusetts. The court granted the motion and ordered the deposition to be filed by June 10 of that year. The plaintiff excepted, and duly filed a bill of exceptions, upon the ground that the deposition was his private property and subject to his own exclusive use and custody until he elected to use it, and not subject to be ordered on file or put in custody of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-17\"><em>Bingham,, Mitchell &amp; Batchellor, Dearborn &amp; Chase, </em>and <em>Brew, Jordan &amp; Buckley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-18\"><em>Lewis W.

S., <em>c. </em>204, s. 5. The plaintiff lias pointed \u2022out no inconsistency between the rule and the laws, and none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">But aside from the rule, the court had the power to make the order. \u201c Courts of justice have powers, as a necessary incident to their general jurisdiction, to make such orders in relation to the cases pending before them as are necessary to the progress of the cases and the dispatch of business.\u201d <em>Deming </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>42 N. H. 165, 178. The theory of the law is \u201cthat the court may make such orders in each case, from time to time, as justice may require\u201d <em>(11. </em>179); and whether justice required the making of the particular order complained of, was manifestly a question of fact for the exclusive determination of the presiding justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-7\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
