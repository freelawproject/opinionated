Thompson, of which the defendant James-L. Wilson is administrator; that the estate was represented as insolvent, and \u00e1 commissioner appointed whose report was accepted by the probate court. The bill further alleges that by fraud the defendant Prescott secured the allowance by the commissioner of certain claims against the estate which were not legal charges against it, and the acceptance of the commissioner\u2019s report by the probate court; and by fraudulent practices kept the plaintiff in ignorance of the allowance of such claims and the acceptance of the commissioner\u2019s report until after the expiration of the time for appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">If the claims are disallowed, the estate is solvent. The facts \u2022 upon which fraud is charged were stated in the bill, but are not material to the decision. The prayer of the bill is that Prescott may be enjoined from collecting the claims and the administrator from paying the same, or that Prescott be ordered to pay to the plaintiff such sum as she would have received from the estate if these claims had not been allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-10\"><em>E.
