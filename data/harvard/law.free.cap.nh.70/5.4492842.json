Trial by jury, and verdict for the plaintiff. The default complained of was the defendants\u2019 failure to inspect the brake on a coal car of the New Pork &amp; New England Railroad, which they had received from a connecting line at Worcester, Mass., to haul over their line to Greendale, Mass. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that he had been in the defendants\u2019 employ as a freight brakeman between Nashua and Worcester, Mass., for more than five years prior to the time of the accident. At that time he was on a siding at Green-dale, shifting out this car. There was a platform about eighteen inches wide on the end of the car for brakemen to stand upon when doing this work. The brake rod came up through the center of the platform about three or three and one half feet, with nothing to support it. This rod had a defect in it which had ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>isted for some time, but which was not readily discoverable by the plaintiff. The car was in motion, and the plaintiff was standing upon the platform; and when, in the performance of his duty, he attempted to set the brake, the rod broke because of the defect and threw him upoil the track, thus causing Iris injuries.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">The defendants were accustomed to inspect the running gear of foreign cars and occasionally the brakes far enough to discover if the chains were attached to the rods, but made no other inspection of brakes unless their attention was called to those upon some particular car. The plaintiff was a man of ordinary intelligence, familiar with his work and with this system of inspection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The defendants excepted to the denial of tlreir motion for a nonsuit; and the plaintiff, to the ruling of the court that whatever would be a defence to this action in Massachusetts is a defence here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>George B. French </em>and <em>Jeremiah J. </em>Boyle, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-8\"><em>Charles H. Burns </em>and <em>Charles J.

H. 382. The rule of the United States supreme court, that it will adopt its own construction of the common law <em>(Baltimore, etc., R. R. </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>149 U. S. 368, 378), has no application, for this court has no co-ordinate jurisdiction with the courts of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Inspection was the only duty which the law of Massachusetts-imposed upon the defendants for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit in respect of this car; and they performed this duty if they furnished competent, sufficient, and suitable inspectors, acting under proper superintendence, rules, and instructions. <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>135 Mass. 201. The defendants\u2019 habitual neglect to inspect the brakes on cars which they received from connecting lines was the only evidence of their failure to perform this duty; and while this is evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence <em>(Coffee </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>155 Mass. 21), it is not of itself sufficient to establish their liability; for the burden is on the plaintiff to show all the facts necessary to constitute Ms cause of action, and one of these facts is that the accident was not caused by a risk which he assumed when he entered the defendants\u2019 employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">A servant assumes the risk arising from all the ordinary dangers of his employment, of which he either knows or might have known by the exercise of due care; and this includes any risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>arising from the negligent performance of the master\u2019s duties, if the servant knows of this danger and voluntarily remains in the master\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Upon this point the law is the sanie both in this state and in Massachusetts. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>69 N.

The danger from insufficient brake rods on cars of this kind is so apparent that no man of ordinary prudence could fail to see and. appreciate it; and the plaintiff, by voluntarily remaining in the defendants\u2019 employment after he knew of this danger, must be held to have assumed this risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\"><em>Verdict set aside : judgment for the </em>defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b35-8\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
