Nor is there any suggestion that the trial was not fair, or that the plaintiffs- have been prejudiced by the course pursued. It is now too late for the plaintiffs to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-14\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
