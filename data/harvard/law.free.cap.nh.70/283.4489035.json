Between 1882 and 1887, the testator deposited money in the defendant bank, in the name of Nathaniel Jackson, Jr. He did not intend by so doing to make a gift, and retained the bank-book until his death in 1898. His son was known as Nathaniel Jackson, Jr., and after his decease the defendant Nathaniel was so knoAvn until 1883. The ninth clause of the will is as follows : \u201cI give and bequeath to my grandson Nathaniel Jackson my watch, one revolver, one fowling-piece, and certain books marked with his name and in the house in which I reside.\u201d The gun, watch, and revolver were of little value. Three books of no substantial value, marked \u201cNathaniel Jackson,1\u2019\u2019were found in the testator\u2019s house. By other clauses, ho gave considerable property to the defendant Nathaniel, and a portion of the estate is not disposed of by the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">The court ordered that the bank pay the deposit to the plaintiff, and the defendant Nathaniel excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-11\"><em>Samuel W. </em>Emery, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-12\"><em>Page &amp; </em>Bartlett, fox the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-13\">Peaslee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amh\">The defendant Nathaniel claims that the deposit was given to him under the description \u201c certain books marked with his name,\u201d but the evidence fails to sustain the claim. The clause in which this expression occurs is one by which the testator gave articles of no value except as family remembrances. It calls for books, not one book only; and if it should be held that this is a book, if does not answer the description, for the testator liad more than one in mind. The arguments that the testator must have intended to give something of value, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u25a0will is to be so construed as to avoid intestacy, have little weight, for by other clauses he gave Nathaniel considerable property, and upon any construction of the will died intestate as to a portion of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b312-6\">Young, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
