Facts agreed. Between April, 1895, and March, 1897, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was arraigned before the police court of Manchester upon sundry complaints charging that he kept spirituous liquor for sale contrary to law. In each instance he pleaded guilty or <em>nolo </em>contendere, and was fined $50 and costs for the first offence, and $100 and costs for subsequent offences. He paid the fines and costs to the chief of police, who paid the- same to the city treasurer. The plaintiff made a demand upon the defendants for the money so paid, but they refused to repay it. The court ordered judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-12\"><em>John O'Neill, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b604-13\"><em>George A.

S., <em>c. </em>248, <em>s. </em>8. The authority of a police court to render final judgment and impose a fine under such circumstances is confirmed by the opinion in <em>Philpot </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 N. H. 250, which holds that a respondent has no right of appeal from such a judgment. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>68 N. H. 449, 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>69 N. H. 511, that a police court has not authority under the constitution to \u201chear and determine any prosecution or action of a criminal nature \u201d where the punishment is a fine exceeding ten dollars (P. S., <em>c. </em>248, <em>ss. </em>3, 7), is not applicable to the present case. Here the respondent by his pleas confessed his guilt, and the justice\u2019s duty did not require him to \u201c hear and determine \u201d the merits of the case. The fines having been paid by the intestate for confessed violations of the law, in accordance with the judgment of the court, under the provisions of a valid statute, this action cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-7\">Parsons, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
