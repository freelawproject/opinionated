He afterward sold the stock, replacing it with new from time to time and using the proceeds as he saw fit, with the knowledge and consent of Ferguson. April 13, 1896, the defendant, a deputy sheriff, attached the stock and fixtures on a claim against Dignam, and May 5, 1896, sold them at sheriff\u2019s sale. The net amount received from the fixtures was $426.65, which he paid to Ferguson July 28, 1896. July 6, 1896, Dignam filed his petition in insolvency, and July 15, 1896, he was decreed insolvent, and the defendant was appointed messenger. August 20, 1896, the defendant paid the net amount received from the sale of the stock ($120.06) to the plaintiff, who had previous to that time been appointed assignee of Dignam\u2019s estate. October 17, 1896, the plaintiff made a demand for the proceeds of the sale of the fixtures of the defendant, which he refused to pay.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-9\"><em>Sullivan &amp; Broderick, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-10\"><em>Elijah M.

H. 192, and similar eases, cannot be maintained. The recent case of <em>Thompson v. Esty, </em>69 N. H. 55, held that only actual fraud would enable the assignee of an insolvent debtor to avoid transactions in fraud of creditors under the insolvent law. P. S., <em>c. </em>201, s. 26. In <em>Hodgdon </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>69 N. H. 136, the same doctrine was applied, although the second mortgage in that case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>.given after the amendment to the insolvency law vesting in the assignee \u201c all property which might have been taken on execution upon a judgment \u201d against the debtor (Laws 1895, <em>e. </em>68) went into effect. This case is not distinguishable from and is determined by <em>Hodgdon </em>v. <em>Libby. </em>The whole amount received from the sale of the mprtgaged property belonged to the mortgagee, unless the right of attaching creditors intervened. In neither event could the assignee take any part of the funds without first paying the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b602-6\">All concurred;</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
