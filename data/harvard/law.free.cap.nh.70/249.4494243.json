Facts found by a referee. The defendant hired the premises, situate in Keene, for an indefinite period, at a rental of $12 per month. November 20, 1897, the defendant sent the plaintiff word that he intended to vacate about the middle of December. The plaintiff never waived her right to a written notice. The premises were vacated December 15, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b277-10\">The defendant filed a set-off for the storage of goods. When the defendant took possession, a part of the house was occupied by goods belonging to the plaintiff, who promised to pay the defendant a reasonable sum fox allowing them to remain. The referee found that $39.42 was due the plaintiff, and $20.05 due the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b277-11\">Subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception, the referee found that the defendant\u2019s wife was qualified to testifiy concerning the value of the storage. It appeared that she had acted as agent for her husband, had examined the premises, agreed upon the rent to be paid, paid the rent, and transacted all the business of her husband, who was absent, but she knew nothing about the usual charges for storing goods in Keene. Judgment was ordered for the plaintiff for $19.37, and both parties excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-12\"><em>Crawford E. </em>Eening, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-13\"><em>William S.

S., <em>c. </em>246, s. 1), which he could not terminate without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, except by giving the \u201cnotice in writing \u201d required by the statute. <em>Ib., s. </em>6. The word sent to the plaintiff in November was not such notice, and the plaintiff, not having consented that the tenancy should terminate, is entitled to recover for the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">\u201c The opinions of witnesses as to the value of any real estate, goods, or chattels may be received as evidence thereof when it appears to the court that they are qualified to judge of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>value. \u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>224, s. 22. Whether in a given instance a witness is thus qualified is a question of fact to be determined at the trial. <em>Goodwin </em>v. Scott, 61 N. H. 112, 114; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>51 N. H. 50, 55; <em>Dole </em>v. Johnson, 50 N. H. 452, 459; <em>Jones </em>v. Tucker, 41 N. H. 546, 548. The referee\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s wife was qualified to judge of the value of the storage was authorized by the evidence. She knew of the capacity of the building, for she had examined it when the premises were rented. She knew how much was paid for rent, for she agreed with the plaintiff upon the amount and paid it whenever it became due. She knew the space occupied by the plaintiff\u2019s goods, for she lived in the house where they were stored. Such knowledge enabled her to estimate what proportionate part of the premises were required for the storage, and the rental value of such part in relation to the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-6\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
