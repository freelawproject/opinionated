Crippen, upon the settlement of Ms account as administrator with the will annexed of the estate of George W. Lawrence. The plaintiff was a surety on Crippen\u2019s bond. Crippen died in 1898. His estate was settled in the insolvent course, the report of the commissioner being accepted in 1895. The claim of the Lawrence estate was not presented to the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-13\">The court found that the plaintiff was prevented by accident, mistake, or misfortune from claiming the appeal; but that the petition should be dismissed unless the failure to present the Lawrence claim to the commissioner on Crippen\u2019s estate should modify the decree mentioned in the petition.

Such failure is not a defence. \u201c If the principal die, and his estate be administered in the insolvent course, the creditor is under no obligation to present his claim to the commissioner and procure what he may from that estate.
