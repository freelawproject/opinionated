After a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony had been introduced, the defendant moved that the bill be dismissed, on the ground that, as he did not ask to have the flowage rights under his deed extended, and did not wish\" or intend to.exercise any flowage rights to which he did not have a clear legal title, the referees had no jurisdiction in this case. The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-15\">The defendant also moved to dismiss the bill upon the ground that Lake Waukewan is a body of public and navigable water, and that the provisions of the flowage act are not applicable to any navigable waters in this state. The committee filed a report, stating the facts and assessing the plaintiff\u2019s damages, past and prospective, in separate sums.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-16\"><em>Stone Shannon </em>and <em>E.

The capacity of the dam to raise the water is not the measure of the right for which damages are to be assessed under the mill act, but damages are to be based upon the actual interference with and raising of the water by the proposed management of the dam and its appurtenances. The mill-owner is not required to pay for a greater right than he takes. <em>Town </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>56 N. H. 255. If the mill-owner does not claim to exercise any flowage right under the mill act, he cannot be compelled to acquire or pay for a right which he does not desire to take. In such case there is no jurisdiction in proceedings under the act to determine the extent of the defendant\u2019s pre-existing legal right, or whether sucli right has been exceeded to the plaintiff\u2019s damage. This statutory proceeding provides for the assessment of damages when the mill-owner exercises tire flowage right given by the mill act.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">If the defendant\u2019s answer disclaims all right to flow the plaintiff\u2019s land under the authority of the mill act, there can be no assessment of damages upon a petition under the act. Such answer is a conclusive record that estops the defendant from claiming in an action for dam\u00e1ges for past flowing, or at any time, that at the commencement of the proceedings he was exercising a flow-age right under the mill act. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Company, </em>67 N. H. 180. As the pleadings have not been transferred, it does not appear whether the claim now made was properly put upon the record. In the course of the hearing, however, the defendant moved to dismiss the bill, on the ground that, as he did not ask to have the flowage rights under his deed extended, and did not wisli or intend to exercise any flowage rights to which he did not have a clear title, the referees had no jurisdiction in this case. No reason is perceived why the dismissal of the bill upon this ground, upon the defendant\u2019s request, stated in the report of the committee and in the order of dismissal, would not furnish a record as conclusive as an estoppel against the defendant in any subsequent proceeding as a formal disclaimer in the answer. If this ground was not, but should have been, taken in the answer, the question is whether leave should now be given to amend the answer. In <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>51 N. H. 188, it was held that a mill-owner, who had filed a petition under the act and been heard before a committee, could not, after the committee had reported, as of right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>become nonsuit. \u2019If in the present case the defendant had not objected to the jurisdiction of the referees until after the assessment of damages, it would clearly be too late to make the claim. In <em>Town </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>56 N. H. 255, 260, it was said: \u201cIt might happen that the mill-owner at the hearing would desire to stipulate for lowering his dam, or in some other way provide that less land should be flowed or damaged by maintaining it,\u201d implying that at the hearing the mill-owner might change his specification of the flowage right he proposed to take. While he cannot he by and take the chances of a favorable award until after the damages are assessed, there is no reason why he should be compelled to purchase flowage rights he does not want, because of a mistake in pleading, or because, possibly, of a mistake as to his own rights and needs, discovered in the course of the hearing. Upon the defendant\u2019s filing an amended answer disclaiming all flowage right, under sections 12 to 19, chapter 142 of the Public Statutes, the bill will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">As the defendant proceeded to a trial of the facts instead of insisting upon the objection that he claimed no flowage right, in which case there would have been no occasion for the reference to a committee, such order as to costs will be made in dismissing the bill as justice requires. Since the necessary result of the defendant\u2019s disclaimer is the dismissal of the petition for want of jurisdiction, the other questions raised are not material. As the dismissal of the petition upon this ground conclusively establishes against the defendant his non-exercise of any statutory flowage right, the question whether under the law and the facts he has any such right, should he desire to exercise itj is not before us. Whether the right exists is not property considered or determined until such right is claimed and in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
