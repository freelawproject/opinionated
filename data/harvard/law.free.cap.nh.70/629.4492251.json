Trial by tbe court. December 17, 1897, when tbe defendant and his son were boarding with the plaintiff, the defendant conveyed to her a pair of horses as security for all money he was then owing or might at any time thereafter owe her. The property replevied subsequently came into tbe plaintiff\u2019s possession, and she claimed to hold it by virtue of a lien, under the provisions of section 1, chapter 141, of the Public Statutes, for the board of the defendant and his son. There was due her on the date of the writ $90 on this account, but the horses conveyed to her as security for the board were of sufficient value to payT that claim. The court found a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-8\"><em>Osgood &amp; Osgood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-9\"><em>David W.
