Plea, the general issue. Facts found by the court. The corporation was formed under the general law, in May, 1893, with a, capital of $2,500, divided into 100 shares of the par value of $25 each. The associates took no steps to have the stock subscribed, but the defendants without authority obtained subscriptions for 107 shares. There was no formal ratification of the defendants\u2019 acts, but on September 16, 1893, at a meeting of directors elected by the associates at the first meeting held in May, it was voted \u201c <em>\\o </em>instruct the secretary to . . . assess the stockholders five dollars per share.\u201d No allotment or apportionment of the stock was ever made so as to avoid the over-subscription.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-11\"><em>Dearborn </em>&amp; Chase, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-12\"><em>Lewis W.

There was authority for the issuance of only 100 shares, and until these should be allotted or apportioned no contract of membership could exist upon which either the corporation or subscribers would be liable. <em>Melvin </em>v. Hoitt, 52 N. H. 61, 67. No allotment or apportionment having been made, the subscribers never became shareholders in the corporation or liable for any of the shares subscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-15\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
