Verdict for-the plaintiff.

The defendants excepted on the ground that the statement was not warranted by the evidence. It appearing that the statement was fully justified by the evidence, the exception was overruled upon the plaintiff\u2019s, motion, \u201c as frivolous, vexatious, and groundless,\u201d and judgment ordered on the verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-17\">Young, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
