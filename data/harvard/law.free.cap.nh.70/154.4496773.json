Facts agreed. November 9, 1896, the defendant'as deputy sheriff, in a suit brought by Henry E. Austin against Sally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>W. Fifield, attached her property, consisting of a livery-stable stock and building, and the property, being receipted for, went back into her possession. Subsequently she mortgaged the same property to one Aiken. In the mortgage were inserted the words : \u201cSubject to an attachment made by Henry E. Austin, of said Franklin, on a suit now pending in the supreme court of New Hampshire.\u201d January 26, 1898, Aiken sold and assigned this mortgage to the plaintiff, both parties having knowledge of the attachment and of the fact that the property was then in the possession of Fifield by reason of the receipt being furnished. At the October term, 1898, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff in said suit, and afterward a portion of the mortgaged property was sold to satisfy the judgment, against the objection of the plaintiff who claimed the property under his mortgage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-5\"><em>James B. </em>Barnard, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-6\"><em>Bdward B.

This was not lost by his taking a receipt and allowing the property to go into possession of the debtor. By virtue of the attachment, the officer could at any time take the property from either the receiptor or the debtor. As between the debtor and the officer, the attachment was still in force. \u201cThe special property acquired by the officer under his attachment remained and he could assert it at airy time, unless the rights of third parties had intervened.\u201d <em>Buzzell </em>v. <em>Hardy, 58 </em>N. H. 331, 332. The rights of third parties with notice that the attachment was still subsisting are no greater than those of the debtor. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Farwell, </em>10 N.
