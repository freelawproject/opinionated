J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAL\">The question arising upon the agreed case is the sufficiency of the notice for the biennial meeting, November, 1898, in the town of Lancaster, and the ground of complaint is that the selectmen failed to post their warrant agreeably to the statutory requirement in respect of time. There is now, however, no occasion to consider the effect of this failure of duty, because by an act approved January 31, 1899, and which went into effect upon its passage, the legislature, in the exercise of its curative power to correct irregularities, has provided \u201c That the selectmen\u2019s warrant for, and the votes and proceedings thereunder at, the biennial election and meeting in the town of Lancaster, held in said town on the eighth day of November, 1898, are hereby legalized and confirmed.\u201d Laws 1899, <em>c. </em>151.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In view of this legislation, which manifestly does not impair -vested rights or the obligation of contracts, and' is not therefore \u25a0within the prohibition of article 23 of the bill of rights against retrospective laws <em>(Farnum's </em>Petition, 51 N.
