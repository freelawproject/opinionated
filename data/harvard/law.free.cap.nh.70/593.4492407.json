They correctly describe a life estate. The only fact that can raise a doubt that this was the estate intended is the use of the words \u201c what may be left \u201d to describe tlie remainder bequeathed after the decease of Amanda. There may be an implication in these words that the life tenant was to have the right to use some of the principal of the property as well as the income; but in the absence of evidence as to the nature and extent of the property, the relationship of the legatees to the testator, and other circumstances tending to show the standpoint hi which the words were used <em>(Stratton </em>v. Stratton, 68 N. H. 582, 586), it cannot be found that the intent was to give Amanda anything more that a life estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
