The statute (Laws 1895, <em>c. </em>115) enacting (s. 3) that \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to furnish or cause to be furnished, in any hotel, boarding-house, restaurant, or at any lunch counter, oleomargarine, butterine, or any similar substance, to any guest or patron of said hotel, hoarding-house, restaurant, or lunch counter, Avithout first notifying such guest or patron that the substance so furnished is not butter,\u201d is plainly within the authority granted the legislature by article 5 of part 2 of our constitution, \u201cto make . . . all manner of wholesome and reasonable orders, laws, statutes, ordinances, directions, and instructions, either with penalties or Avithout, so as the same be not repugnant . . . to this constitution, as they may judge for the benefit and welfare of this state and for the governing and ordering thereof, and of the subjects of the same.\u201d \u201c Under this grant the power of the legislature to regulate the sale of articles of food, and to legislate for the prevention of adulteration, deception, and fraud in the sale of provisions, is unquestioned.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>64 N.
