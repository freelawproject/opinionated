The deed under which the defendants claim states that the land is in Pinkham\u2019s Grant; but the lots described are in Green\u2019s Grant,\u2014 a tract adjoining Pinkham\u2019s Grant on the north. The referee found that to determine \u201c what land was covered by the deed would be conjecture ; \u201d \u201c that the description in the deed is contradictory, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>under the circumstances, indefinite.\u201d The intention of the parties being determinable, \u201c not by rules of law, but by the balance of probabilities found in the competent evidence tending to prove the fact of intention \u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Furbish, </em>68 N. H. 123, 134), the deed must fail, since the evidence is so indefinite and contradictory that any determination of the question would be mere conjecture. The defendants never had possession of the land, and the failure to show title by deed applicable to the property in question is fatal to their claim. As against them, the plaintiffs, who are in possession, are entitled to a decree. P.
