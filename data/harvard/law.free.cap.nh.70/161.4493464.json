Facts found by a referee, as follows: December 1, 1898, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>plaintiff owned the premises in question, and the def\u00e9ndant occupied them at a monthly' rental of six dollars per month, payable in advance. At this time she demanded ten dollars per month, which the defendant refused to pay, but did offer her six dollars, which she declined. February 27, 1899, the defendant deposited in the Manchester Savings Bank, in the name of the plaintiff, the sum of twelve dollars, to pay for the January and February rent, taking a book therefor in the name of the plaintiff. On or about March 1, Mrs. Kehoe, a sister of the plaintiff and her agent in this matter, demanded the rent, and the defendant paid her six dollars for the December rent, and gave her the bank-book aforesaid, which she took, saying it was all right. There 'was no evidence that Mrs. Kehoe had authority tq accept anything as payment for rent other than' money, and I find she had no such authority, unless implied as a matter of law. I find, however, that tins book was accepted by Mrs. Kehoe for the rent. Within a reasonable time the plaintiff returned the book to the defendant, who has since had it, and demanded twelve dollars in money for the two months\u2019 rent, which the defendant refused to pay. The plaintiff then served a seven days\u2019 notice to quit on the defendant, which was sufficient to entitle her to possession of the premises unless the receipt of the bank-book, as herein stated, shall be held to be payment of rent for January and February, in which event there is to be judgment for the defendant. The court ordered judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-5\"><em>Sullivan &amp; Broderick, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-6\"><em>David W.
