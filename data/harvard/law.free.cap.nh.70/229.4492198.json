W. French, deceased testate, made a devise as follows: \u201c I give, bequeath, and devise unto Wm. F. Westgate, . . . my executor hereinafter named, a certain tract or parcel of land, ... in trust, nevertheless, for the uses and purposes following: to have and to hold the same until such time as my son, Nahum W. French, and my daughter, Sarah M. Nutter, may or shall agree to have the same sold, and then to sell the same without license from the probate court for said county, and the proceeds of said sale to divide equally between \u201d them; that the defendant Westgate was duly appointed trustee and has acted in that capacity; that the plaintiff, Nahum W.

The prayer is for an order of sale, an accounting, and damages. The defendants moved to dismiss the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><em>Smith &amp; Sloane, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>William F.

It was a power coupled with a trust. 1 Per. Tr., s. 248. Equity has jurisdiction to cause such powers to be executed. 1 Sto. Eq. Jur., <em>ss. </em>533, 1061; P. S., <em>c. </em>205, <em>s. </em>1. There is no action at law winch would afford an adequate remedy <em>(Kendall </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>60 N. H. 527), and the legislature has not given probate courts jurisdiction in such matters. P. S., c. 198. The allegations of the bill state a case that is within. eqMty jurisdiction. If the defendant Nutter has changed her mind and does not now agree to a sale, it does not follow that the plaintiff is not entitled to have the sale made. Nutter may be bound by the agreement wMch she entered mto, or, if not, the circumstances may be such that the plamtiff is entitled to relief notwithstanding her opposition. EqMty, having jurisdiction of tMs. matter, can afford complete relief, Mcludmg the assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s damages, if any, growmg out of the trustee\u2019s neglect and the settlement of the trustee\u2019s account. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Savings Bank, </em>58 N. H. 421. It is unnecessary to determine whether eqmty would take jurisdiction of the accounting if that alone were the object of the suit, or whether it would leave that matter to the statutory jurisdiction of the probate court. <em>Lebanon Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>65 N.
