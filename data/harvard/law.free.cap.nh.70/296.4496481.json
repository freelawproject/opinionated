Facts found by the court. The defendant impounded four calves found doing damage in his inclosure. The damage consisted in eating some apples that had fallen from the trees, and cropping and treading down grass, and did not exceed ten cents in actual value. Upon these facts a verdict for the plaintiff was found, which the defendant moved to set aside for error in the application of the law to the facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-13\"><em>Almon F.

Com. 6. A similar right is given by our statute which provides that \u201c a person may impound any swine, neat cattle, horses, sheep, or other creatures doing damage in his inclosure.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>144, <em>s. </em>1. Both under the common law and the statute, the essential prerequisite to the right to impound is that the animals must be doing damage when taken. The finding of fact that the calves when impounded were doing damage in the defendant\u2019s inclosure is conclusive in favor of lfis right to impound them. Although the damages were small, yet they were actual, and therefore were sufficient to justify the defendant in impounding the ammals.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">The case of <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Green, </em>33 N. H. 318, relied upon by the plaintiff, is not in conflict with the views here expressed, because in that case there not only was no finding that the animal im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>pounded was doing damage when taken, but, on the contrary, there was an express finding that no damage was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-6\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
