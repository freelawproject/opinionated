D. 1857, entitled \u2018An act relating to the competency of witnesses,\u2019 or by reason of this act, may be taken and used in the same manner now by law provided for the deposition of witnesses in civil actions; <em>provided, however, </em>that said party shall not be obliged to answer any \u25a0question, or produce any document, the answering or producing of which would tend to criminate himself. . . . The provisions of the aforesaid act, of which this is an amendment, shall extend and be applied to all actions, suits, and proceedings at law or in equity.\u201d Laws 1858, <em>c. </em>2090, ss. 1, 2; P.

Laws 1869, <em>c. </em>23, s. 1.

No question as to the plaintiff\u2019s right to refuse to .answer any questions tending to incriminate her is reserved. The objections taken by counsel on that ground are not open to the plaintiff as the case now stands. <em>Rancour\u2019s Petition, </em>66 N. H. 172, 175.
