Section 16, chapter 287, of tbe Public Statutes, which provides for tbe compensation of officers when tlieir presence is required in tbe police court, contains nothing to show that they are to be paid more when their presence is required as witnesses than when it is required for other purposes. So it is improbable that the legislature intended to pay officers who were attending court for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">A witness who is recognized or summoned must appear before the grand jury and submit to an examination in respect of any matters within bis knowledge. This examination may be completed at once, or continued from day to day to suit tbe convenience of the grand jury, and tbe witness must remain in attendance until it is completed. \u201c Tire fees of witnesses shall be, for each day\u2019s attendance at tbe supreme . . . court, . . . one dollar and twenty-five cents; . . . for each mile\u2019s travel to and from tbe place of testifying, six cents.\u201d P. S., <em>e. </em>287, <em>s. </em>13. This section makes tbe witness\u2019 fees depend neither on the number of times be lias recognized or has been summoned, nor on the number of indictments found on bis evidence, but on his travel and attendance. The reason for this is plain. Interest in tbe event of tbe action always tends to discredit tbe witness, and tbe legislature would never intentionally discredit all witnesses who come before tbe grand jury, by making tlieir fees contingent on tbe number of indictments found on tlieir testimony. <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>42 N. H. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">It does not appear that tbe plaintiff\u2019s services in preparing cases for trial were rendered at tbe request of tbe defendants, or that tbe charges therefor have been approved by tbe proper officer.

S., <em>c. </em>256, s. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b617-11\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: tbe others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
