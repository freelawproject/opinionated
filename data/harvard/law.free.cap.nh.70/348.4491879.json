Saxton, an employee of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-12\">The plaintiff testified that he went to the freight yard oh January 15, 1899, as he had frequently done, to see if there were cars of coal consigned to local dealers, so that he might apply for a job of shoveling. While in the yard he heard shouting and saw men running. Saxton walked up to him, seized lfim', asked Mm where he was going, and started to draw a black-jack, whereupon the plaintiff broke away and ran about a hundred feet, when he was shot m the back. He made no assault upon Saxton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-13\">Saxton testified that he was employed by the defendants to clean and care for the lamps in the freight yard. Prior to the day of the shooting, he had driven from the yard certain persons, denominated the \u201cscut beer gang,\u201d whose habit it.was to loiter there, and who had fought with him and made threats against him. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reported these affrays to the defendants\u2019 agent, and was told to look out for himself. On January 15, 1899, Saxton saw members of the \u201c beer gang,\u201d the plaintiff being\u2019 one of the party, going toward the freight'yard. He followed them and found the plaintiff on the watch. After an unsuccessful attempt to seize the plaintiff, Saxton ran down the yard, and seeing others gathering, apparently to make a fight, fired a revolver at the end of a freight car for the purpose of frightening the crowd and protecting himself. He did not think the bullet could have hit the plaintiff. Saxton was not an officer or a watchman. He had no orders to drive the \u201c beer gang \u201d from the freight yard, and was required only to report their presence there; but whenever he saw them going to the yard it was his practice to follow them and order them off the defendants\u2019 premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence a nonsuit was ordered, subject to his exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>Sullivan </em>&amp; <em>Broderick, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-7\"><em>Oliver E.
