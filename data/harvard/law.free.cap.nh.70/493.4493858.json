An instrument under seal, dated August 1, 1878, between .David F. Clark and Mason <em>W. </em>Tappan, was in tlie following terms: \u201c Witnesseth that in consideration of tlie rents and covenants hereinafter reserved- and contained, on tlie part of tlie said Tappan to be paid and performed, tlie said Clark doth lease to tlie said Tappan a certain piece of land in said New-bury, at Pine Cliff, so called, on the east side of Sunapee lake, on which said Tappan\u2019s cottage now stands, containing one half acre, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>more or less, and bounded as follows, to wit: . . . The said lessee and Ms heirs having the right at any time during the terms hereinafter mentioned to terminate their lease and remove his cottage aforesaid from said premises, and, with the consent of the lessor, to sell' or let the same to be occupied on said premises, with the privilege also of renewing tMs lease at the expiration of the term, on the same terms and conditions as herein contained. . . . To have and to hold the same to him from the first day of August, 1878, the term of twenty years next ensuing, unless this lease shall be sooner terminated by the lessee as aforesaid, paying therefor yearly during the said term, to the said Clark, Ms heirs and assigns, the yearly rent of 'three dollars, to be paid on the first day of August in each year, the first payment to be made on the first day of August, 1878. And the said David Clark agrees with the said Tappan that the said Tappan and Ms heirs shall peaceably possess the said premises durmg said term without the lawful interruption or eviction of any person whatsoever. And the said Tappan agrees that he will pay to the said Clark the said yearly rent of three dollars, at the days and times above mentioned, . . . and the same premises and every part thereof will peaceably deliver up to the said Clark, his heirs and assigns, at the termination of this lease, and that he will not underlet to any person unless with the consent of said lessor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">June 21, 1887, Tappan\u2019s admmistrator assigned the lease to Hiram D. Upton, and July 2, 1894, the latter assigned it to his wife, the plaintiff. The owner of the remainder quitclaimed \u00bfthe premises, subject to the lease, to the defendant Hosmer, December 8, 1888. The defendants knew that the premises had been assigned to Upton, but did not know that they were subsequently assigned to the plaintiff. September 1, 1897, the plaintiff gave the defendants notice that she desired a renewal of the lease. They replied, denying that the lease was assignable and refusing to renew. Upton paid $500 for the assignment of the lease, and added much to the value of the cottage on the premises by improvements and repairs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>Edwin F. </em>Jones, for the plamtiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-7\"><em>Eastman &amp; Hollis, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-8\">Pike, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajl\">The defendants say that the plaintiff is not entitled to a renewal because of a breach of the covenant not to assign. The plaintiff says that the lease contained no such covenant, and that if it did, all rights that resulted to the lessor and Ms heirs therefrom were waived by the acceptance of rent from the plaintiff\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In order that the parties to a lease may be bound by covenants, it is not necessary that they be expressed in any special form. It is sufficient if the intention of the parties can be gathered from the instrument, read in the light of the competent evidence bearing upon its interpretation. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Lake Co., </em>54 N. H. 242; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Society, </em>56 N. H. 191, 197; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>58 N. H. 511; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>58 N. H. 326; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>58 N. H. 391; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Ordway, </em>59 N. H. 378; <em>Goodale </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>60 N. H. 528; <em>Kennard </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>63 N. H. 303, 310. Besides the lessee\u2019s covenant not to underlet without the lessor\u2019s consent, the lease provided that the lessee and his heirs should have \u201c the right at any time ... to terminate their lease and remove his cottage \u201d; also that \u201c with the consent of the lessor \u201d they might \u201c sell . . . the same to be occupied on the premises.\u201d <em>No </em>restrictions were placed upon the sale of the cottage after removal, upon a termination of the lease; but the lessee, his heirs and assigns, were not permitted to make a sale of it, to remain upon the premises, without the consent of the lessor, his heirs and assigns. The purpose of the restrictive clause appeal's to have been not so much to control the sale of the cottage, as to prohibit the lessee, liis heirs and assigns, from making an assignment of the lease without first obtaining the consent o\u00a3 the lessor, his heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">This view is strengthened when it is considered that the lease provided for the payment of the yearly rental and for the delivery of the premises at the termination of the lease, to the lessor, his \u201c heirs and assigns,\u201d and that, although rights under the lease were expressly granted to the lessee and his \u201cheirs,\u201d none were expressly granted to his \u201c assigns.\u201d It is true that a lease is assignable whether the word \u201c assigns \u201d appears hi the lease or not. <em>Spear </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>8 N. H. 174. So, also, the term survives although it is not expressly limited to the lessee and his \u201cheirs.\u201d 1 Wash. It. I\u2019. *'368. But the use of the words \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d in connection with the lessor\u2019s name, and the omission of \u201c assigns \u201d in connection with the lessee\u2019s, indicate that \u201c assigns \u201d was not omitted because, as a matter of law, the lessee could make a legal assignment in its absence. The use and disuse of these words were to make plain the parties\u2019 intention, that although the fee of the estate might descend to the lessor\u2019s heirs or pass by deed to his grantee, the premises should not be used by an undertenant or by the lessee\u2019s assignee without the consent of the lessor, his heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The lease having passed by assignment to the plaintiff without the consent required by the lease, it remains to be considered whether, as she claims, the defendants waived any of their rights resulting from the breach of the covenant by the acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>rent from her husband. There could be no waiver unless they knew of this assignment, or were chargeable with constructive notice by reason of the record. It appears, however, that they had no knowledge of this fact, and unless the record makes them chargeable with notice there could have been no waiver. The purpose of a record of a conveyance of real estate is to establish priority as respects conveyances from a common grantor. It affects subsequent purchasers only, and cannot be considered notice t\u00f3 the original lessor or his assigns. The lease having been assigned to the plaintiff in breach of the covenants of the original parties, she is not entitled to a renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">It appears, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s husband paid $500 for the assignment of the lease, and that he added largely to the value of the cottage by improvements and repairs. It does not appear that there was any intent upon the plaintiff\u2019s part to defeat any of the rights of the lessor and his assigns under the lease. Under such circumstances it would be unjust to allow the defendants 'to retain the cottage. The plaintiff\u2019s petition is denied, but she will be allowed a reasonable time in which to remove the cottage from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-7\">Peaslee, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
