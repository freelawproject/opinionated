Facts found by the court. Before December 18,1897, the defendant had signed a note with O. Caron &amp; Co.,, for their benefit, and had receipted for goods which had been attached in an action against them. On that date the note was due, and Caron &amp; Co. sold to the defendant the said contracts, upon consideration of his promise to pay the note and claim. He paid these December 20, 1897. Caron &amp; Co. were adjudged insolvent January 25, 1898, and the plaintiff was appointed assignee. The sale of the contracts was not made in the ordinary course of business.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-8\"><em>David W.

S., <em>e. </em>201, s. 26. The only consideration for the sale to the .defendant was his promise to pay certain debts of the insolvents for which he was already liable; and since the sale was not made in the ordinary course of business, the assignee is entitled to recover. The defendant having paid nothing into the estate, the question whether in such a case a vendee of personal property would be entitled to a return of the consideration, paid in good faith, does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AZo\">Young, J., did not sit: the others\u2019concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
