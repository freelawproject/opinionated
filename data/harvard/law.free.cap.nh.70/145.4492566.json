Facts agreed. William Currier, deceased, left a widow (tlie plaintiff) and three children. By his will he nominated his two sons for executors, and ordered and directed them to pay his just debts and funeral charges within one year from his decease. The next provision is as follows: \u201c Third, to my wife, Mary A. Currier, I give, devise, and bequeath one third part of all my real estate situate in the city of Franklin in said county of Merrimack, the same to be in full of all her claim for dower and homestead. Also one third of my personal property of which I may die possessed.\u201d By the fourth, fifth, and sixth items he gave legacies to his daughter and two grandchildren, amounting to $225. The seventh item is as follows : \u201c All the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, real, personal, and mixed, wherever found and however situate, I give, bequeath, and devise to my two sons, Myron C. Currier and William W. Currier [the executors], to share and share alike.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-9\">His property consisted of real estate appraised $3,810,\u2014 all situated in Franklin excepting a cemetery lot appraised $10,\u2014 and personal property appraised $832.30, seven eighths of which consisted of notes, bonds, and book accounts. According to the executors\u2019 account as allowed by the judge of probate, there were the following demands against the estate :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-10\">Expenses of administration .... $385.81</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-11\">Funeral expenses ..... 142.05</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-12\">Expenses of last sickness .... 164.88</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-13\">Debts ....... 796.54</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-14\">Legacies ....... 225.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-15\">Cost of gravestones ..... 25.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-16\">$1,739.28</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-17\">The executors sold two thirds of one piece of real estate to raise money to pay these claims. The appeal is from a decree of distribution of the balance in the executors\u2019 hands, by which the plaintiff was not allowed any part of the personal property.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>JEdward B.

The plaintiff says that the testator intended thereby to give her one third of both real estate and personal property, \u2022 without diminution by the payment of debts and other charges; while, as to the personal property, the defendants say that the intention was to give her only one third of the balance left after the payment of the claims that are ordinarily chargeable to it by the rules of law. The natural and ordinary meaning of the language used by the testator sustains the plaintiff\u2019s claim. \u201c All my real estate situate in the city of Franklin,\u201d is a definite and clear description of property. \u201cMy personal property of winch I may die possessed,\u201d is no less definite and clear. The particular property intended by each description can readily be ascertained. The first is a specific devise. The connective \u201calso,\u201d and the absence of modifying terms, tend to \u25a0show that the second was intended to be of the same class. Ownership of an undivided fractional part of a mass of personal property consisting of articles of different kinds is practicable. The law provides means for severing the rights of tenants in common in such property as well as in real estate. <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>67 N. H. 533. Moreover, this personal property consisted largely of notes, bonds, and book accounts \u2014 species of property that are convertible into money and readily divisible. But' it is unnecessary to determine whether, according to the testator\u2019s intention, the bequest of personal property was technically a specific legacy. The plaintiff is not seeking a third part of the property in species, but a third part of the sum with which the executors were charged on account of the personal property in their settlement with the judge of probate. The language of the bequest tends to show, at least, that the fractional part of each kind of property intended was a fractional part of the whole,\u2014 that diminution of the personal property was no more expected than diminution of the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">It is said that the testator\u2019s language has an artificial or technical meaning in consequence of the general rule of law which makes the personal property of a deceased person hable for the payment of the just demands chargeable to his estate before his real estate can be appropriated for the purpose. P. S., <em>c. </em>194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>s. 1. This rule does not control the testator\u2019s intent, but is simply evidence to be considered with other evidence in ascertaining what his intent was. Tf the testator used the language in this sense, lie must have intended that the plaintiff should receive nothing from his personal property, for the just demands chargeable to his estate largely exceeded in amount the value of that property. The language in that sense would be meaningless\", and it would be worse than absurd to introduce it into the will, for it would inevitably lead to controversy. On the other hand, reason and common sense lead to the conclusion that he intended to benefit the plaintiff'' by this provision. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>23 N. H. 149; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Mathes, </em>49 N. H. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It might be claimed upon the same reasoning and with equal force, that the testator intended that the language used in reference to the real estate should be understood in a similar sense. The lawful demands chargeable to his estate required an appropriation of a portion of the real estate for their payment. But the defendants do not, and with reason could not, claim that the plaintiff is entitled to one third of only the residue of the estate after the payment of the demands against it. The difference in the wording of the third and seventh items of the will is conclusive on this point. As has already been noticed, the third item disposes of \u201c one third part of all my real estate \u201d and \u201c also one third part of my personal property of which I may die possessed,\u201d while the seventh item disposes of \u201call the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, real, personal, and mixed, wdierever found and however situate.\u201d The third item refers to the several kinds of property as entireties, while the .seventh refers to what may be left after the payment of the demands against the estate. For the same reason, the statutes fixing the share of a widow in the estate of her late husband do not sustain the defendants\u2019 position. According to these statutes, the plaintiff'' would be entitled to one third part of the testator\u2019s personal and real estate, \u201c after the payment of debts and expenses of administration.\u201d The language of the will conflicts with these provisions so far as real estate is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The direction in the second item of the will, that the executors should pay the testator\u2019s debts and funeral charges within one year from his decease, is consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The item is entirely independent of the one under which her rights arise; no reference is made, directly or indirectly, in one to the other. The order of their arrangement has no significance. The first, second, and seventh items have a connection with each other. The first nominates the defendants executors, the second directs them as to the payment of debts and funeral charges, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the seventh gives them the residue of the 'estate. They all relate to the defendants and their rights and duties. That -which was given to them was the residue of the property left after they had discharged the obligations which the law and the will placed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It seems more probable than otherwise that the testator used the language of the third item of the will in its natural and ordinary sense rather than in the artificial and technical sense for which the defendants contend. The decree of the probate court should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-7\">Blodgett, C.
