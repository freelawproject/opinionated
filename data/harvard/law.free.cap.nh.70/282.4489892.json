Facts agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">The nuisance complained of was alleged to be carried on by the defendant Piper and one Gray, in a building situate on South Avenue, and owned by one Sartwell., The petition was filed August 24, 1899. Subsequent thereto, the occupants removed to another building on another street, where they have since maintained a nuisance of the kind complained of in the petition. The petitioners moved that Piper and Gray be temporarily enjoined from maintaining the nuisance complained of in the building at the new location.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-10\"><em>G.

P. S., <em>c. </em>205, s. 4; Laws 1899, <em>c. </em>81, s. 1; <em>State </em>v. Saunders, 66 N. H. 39, 90; <em>State </em>v. Batcheller, 66 N. H. 145; <em>State </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>66 N. H. 622. The building to which Piper and Gray moved after this proceeding was begun was not complained of or described in the petition, and the question whether they should be enjoined for maintaining' a nuisance therein is therefore not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-14\">Blodgett, C.
