The plaintiffs\u2019 manager, after, stating the number of hours occupied in drilling, testified, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, as follows: \u201cWe always charge forty cents an hour; it has been our custom; and sometimes fifty cents an hour for similar labor.\u201d On cross-examination he stated that the plaintiffs paid one of the three men who did the drilling $3 a day (of ten hours), and the other two $2.50 a day each. There was other evidence regarding the cost of the labor, all to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b236-13\">The jury were instructed, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s contention' in the opening statement and closing argument of Iris counsel, that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover under the foregoing provision of the contract the difference between the actual cost of the drilling and the cost of making the excavation if there had been no rock in the way, without any profit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-14\"><em>Hamllett &amp; Runnells, </em>for the'plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Bertis A.

H. 209, 224. The evidence of the customary charge made by the plaintiffs in their business had some tendency to prove the usual market or reasonable price or value of labor so furnished. Upon the question of the cost of goods, evidence of their value is competent as having some tendency to show their cost. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>55 N. H. 38, 41. It cannot be said that evidence of the value or market price of such labor compared with the price or value of labor employed in other excavation, as shown by its market or usual price or value, or by other evidence, would not have some tendency to show the probable increased expense occasioned to the plaintiffs by the necessary drilling or blasting. The expense to the plaintiffs in procuring, directing, and paying the muscular force employed was as much a part of the expense of drilling and blasting as the actual payments made for the manual performance of the work. If it should be considered that the charge included a profit above the actual expenditure for the laborers employed and the other items of expense understood to be included therein, the evidence, so far as it related to the profit usually charged, was merely immaterial upon the issue tried. The jury were instructed not to allow any profit. It does not appear that the instructions have been disregarded, or that the evidence was used for any purpose for which it was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-7\">Chase, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
