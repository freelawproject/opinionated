The plaintiffs also offered to show by a creditor, who was not a party of record, transactions between the witness and Dakin. The administrator did not elect to testify, and the evidence was excluded, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-12\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence the appeal was dismissed, subject to exception.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-13\"><em>Osgood &amp; Osgood, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-14\"><em>Burnham, Brown &amp; Warren </em>and <em>Allan M.
