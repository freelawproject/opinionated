Facts- agreed. In 1868 tlie plaintiffs constructed a telegraph Hue in the highway from Hampton to Hampton beach, but its location was not authorized by the selectmen of the town, :as required by law. June 5, 1867, the Telegraph Company duly filed with the postmaster-general a written acceptance ol tlie restrictions and obligations required by the act of congress approved July <em>24, </em>1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">The Exeter Street Railway Company were empowered by their charter to extend their track over Hampton Road, and the selectmen of the towns through which tlie road was to he built were to lay out the read in like maimer as highways are laid out and \u201c determine the distance at which tlie track shall he laid from the sidetracks or footpaths.\u201d The railroad track was laid out accordingly, in sncli a way that some of the plaintiffs\u2019 poles interfered with running cars. It w'ould have been practicable to locate it so that there would be no interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 poles and wires. May <em>24, </em>1897, the Telegraph Company were notified by the selectmen to remove such poles as would interfere with tlie passage of cars, hut the Telegraph Company refused to comply. The Franklin Construction Company built the railroad for the Exeter Street Railway Company, and, in so doing, took some of the plaintiffs\u2019 wire .and used it as guys for the trolley wire of the railroad. This wire was not so situated as to cause any interference with the construction or operation of the railroad track. The Construction Company also cut down some poles and wire which were so located as to interfere with the running of cars, and left them beside t-lie road,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-12\"><em>Streeter, Walker Hollis, </em>for tlie plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-13\"><em>Edwin Gr.

Mason, </em>64 N. H. 98<em>; Baker </em>v. <em>Beers, </em>64 N. H. 102, 105), and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment therefor. Both defendants are hable, \u2014 the Construction Company for appropriating it in the construction of the road, and the railroad company for receiving and holding it as their own. <em>Dotey </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>6 N. H. 247, 249; <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>13 N. H. 494, 499<em>; Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>30 N. H. 164, 169; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>45 N.

H. 520, 525; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>68 N. H. 232.
