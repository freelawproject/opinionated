Her will, made in January, 1879, contains the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-15\">\u201cI make the following provision relative to my eight shares of the capital stock of the Casco National Bank at Portland, Maine, bought by me while Isabella Jacobs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-16\">\u201c1st.

Jacobs, son of the testatrix, was a soldier in the Civil War, and after Ms discharge he resided until 1868 at Saco, Maine. At that time he met with a heavy loss of government bonds, and the peculiar circumstances of their disappearance so affected him that he decided to leave Saco. Before going he made the following remark in the presence of Ms mother and sister: \u201c It will be a long time before you see or hear from me again.\u201d At that time he was twenty-eight years old. Since Ms departure from Saco no member of his family has heard from him directly or indirectly, although due inquiry has been made. A former executor of the will and the plaintiff have both made active efforts to ascertain his whereabouts, but no information regarding Mm has been obtained. When he left Saco he was unmarried, and no report of Ms marriage has come to the knowledge of any person interested in his estate, or to the former executor, or to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-11\">The shares of bank stock and their accumulated earnings are now held by the plaintiff as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of Mrs. Remick and trustee under her will. Charlotte A. Sloman, one of the defendants, claims the dividends and their present accumulations, and also future dividends upon the shares during her lifetime. The plamtiff asks advice and direction, as to the disposition of the accumulated income of the shares and the future dividends.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>William F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOZ9\">Upon the agreed facts, the legal presumption is that Arthur long since deceased. .Evidence that a party has not been heard of for seven years rebuts the presumption of the duration of life. <em>Smith </em>v. Knowlton, 11 N. H. 191, 196; <em>Brown </em>v. Jewett, 18 N. H. 230, 231; <em>Forsaith </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>21 N. H. 409, 425; <em>Mooers </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>29 N.

This being so, and it evidently having been the intention of the testatrix, in case Arthur did not return to Saco, that Charlotte should have the use of the designated fund after sufficient time from the testatrix\u2019s death had elapsed to justify the presumption of his death, we are of the opinion that Charlotte is entitled to receive the present accumulations of the fund and its future income during her life, less the reasonable expenses of executing the trust; and the plaintiff is so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
