George F.&amp;J. C.

They also referred to a note made by Montgomery H. Throop, one of the commissioners of the new Code, to section 779. They further argued that the sections of the new Code relating to poor persons did not apply to this case; that no provisions were made by these sections to enable a party against whom costs are <em>already </em>awarded to enable her to avoid the payment of these costs, or to proceed in her action without paying the same. Section 461 reads that a person shall not be prevented from prosecuting an action <em>\u201c by reason of his being liable for the costs of a former action brought by him against the same defend-a/ntf </em>and therefore no provision was made by the new law differing from the Eevised Statutes for the non-payment of costs in <em>the </em>action, viz., in the <em>present </em>action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-6\">Brady, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AIu\">I think the provisions of the Eevised Statutes do not exempt the party from the payment of costs which accrue prior to leave granted to prosecute in <em>forma pauperis. </em>If the party proceed without obtaining such leave, the subsequent application does not relate back. The proceeding by appeal is not a cause of action within these provisions, and is not embraced in the liberty contemplated. The preliminary objection is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
