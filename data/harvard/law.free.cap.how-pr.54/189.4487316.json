Some of these transactions made a profit, which was divided, and Meyer took his share; but a large decline in real estate took place, and among other parcels owned by the parties were two parcels of lots for which Meyer had not paid any thing, but the whole money was paid by the Wormsers, under Meyer\u2019s agreement to pay them. There was no writing between the parties, and Meyer refused to pay, and defended denying the agreement to pay, or that he had any interest in the lots, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>because the statute of frauds requires that a transfer of any interest in land shall be in writing, otherwise it shall be void. The plaintiffs alleged that he was a copartner with them, and that such a copartnership could be formed to speculate in real estate the same as in merchandise, and that in such a case no writing is necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>D. M. Porter, </em>for plaintiffs, argued the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">\u201cA partnership may exist between dealers and speculators in real estate for the purpose of buying and selling lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">\u201c It seems it is not necessary to the existence of such a partnership that it be evidenced by a written agreement signed by the partners; it may be created by parol.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Partnerships in real estate transactions are governed by the same rules as are commercial and other copartnerships, save as modified by the rules of law in reference to the conveyance and transmission of real estate <em>(Olcott </em>agt. <em>Wing, </em>4 McLean, 15; <em>Dale </em>agt. <em>Hamilton, </em>5 <em>Hare, </em>369; <em>Burmell </em>agt. <em>Taintor, </em>4 <em>Conn., </em>568; 1 <em>Penn. R., </em>147; <em>Kramer </em>agt. <em>Arthur, </em>7 <em>id., </em>166; <em>Chester </em>agt. <em>Dickerson, </em>54 <em>N. Y., </em>1).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">\u201cA copartnersnip may be formed to buy and sell land as well as in vendible property. It is an agreement merely to share in the profit and loss of negotiations. The rules for transferring lands may be different from those for the transfer of personal property, but that can make no difference in the result as to profit and loss <em>(Dudley </em>agt. <em>Littlefield, </em>21 <em>Maine, </em>421, 422).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-10\"><em>\u201c </em>There can be no doubt as to the right of any member of a firm, instituted for the purpose of trading in lands, to purchase real estate for the firm, and to bind all the members for the payment of the consideration-money <em>(Sage </em>agt. <em>Sherman, </em>2 <em>Conn., </em>431, 432; <em>Williams </em>agt. <em>Gillies and others, 53 How. Pr. R., </em>429). The parol agreement by the defendant to take a share in the plaintiff\u2019s interest in a trading adventure is valid and binding, although the only consideration passing from the defendant to the plaintiff for such share, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>his right to take it, was the obligation to share in the losses. \"Upon such an agreement the plaintiff may maintain an action against the defendant to recover contribution for the losses of the adventure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 promise to account to the defendant for one-half of the profit is supported by the obligation incurred by the defendant to share one-half of the losses; and hence it is a case of mutual promises, reciprocally binding.\u201d The agreement was not within the clause of the statute of frauds requiring agreements for the sale of goods to be in writing <em>(Coleman </em>agt. Eyre, 45 <em>N. Y., </em>38).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">In this last case the goods had already been bought and paid for by the plaintiff, and the defendants simply agreed to take an interest in the adventure. The evidence in this case clearly establishes the copartnership, and judgment should be given to the plaintiffs for the amount, with interest and costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-7\"><em>L.

That both sums aforesaid, due to the plaintiffs from the defendant aforesaid, on the 3d day of October, 1877, amount to'the sum of $15,954.98.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">And as conclusion of law: That plaintiffs are entitled to judgment, with costs, and an extra allowance of five per cent on the sum of $15,954.98.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Judgment ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
