Keenan, terre-tenant. The death of the defendant being suggested, Hawkins, his administrator, was substituted. Michael C. Cadmus was afterwards, on his own application, allowed to defend as terretenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The mortgage was dated September 1st 1834, from Dickinson to Harper, to secure $2359.59, and James Young became owner of the premises bound by it, May 27th 1842. The city of Philadelphia, May 19th 1859, entered a claim against Young for taxes of 1856, which had in fact been paid by Young February 2d 1859. To a <em>scire facias </em>on the claim issued September 10th 1859, the sheriff returned <em>\u201c </em>made known by posting\u201d a copy of the writ on the premises, and publication in a newspaper, \u201c agreeably to the Act of Assembly.\u201d Judgment was entered November 26th 1859 for $99.90, for want of an affidavit of defence. Young died January 27th 1860, and without any <em>scire facias </em>to his personal representatives, .a <em>levari facias </em>issued on the tax judgment, February 17th 1860, under which the property was sold to Keenan for $20, and deed made in September of the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">On the 19thv of October 1860, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia issued an order to the administrators of Young to sell the premises for the payment of his debts. They were sold under that order on the 20th of November 1860, to Cadmus, for $2725. The sale was confirmed December 20th 1860, and the deed of the administrators delivered to Cadmus and recorded on the 22d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">Jackson appeared by counsel before the auditor who distributed the estate of Young, and claimed, and there was awarded to him, the sum of $2042.98 on account of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">On the trial, before Hare, J., the record of all the proceedings in relation to the tax sale were offered by the plaintiff and admitted against the objection of Cadmus, who excepted to the admission. Cadmus offered to prove by J. N. Brown, Esq., that he was the attorney of the administrators of Young, that he took the receipt for the taxes, 1856, to Mr. Poulson, solicitor, for the receiver of taxes, the attorney of record in the said suit and execution, City <em>v. </em>Young, who gave him an order to the sheriff to stay the said sale, which order he delivered to the sheriff before the said sale. The offer was overruled, and an exception taken. Cadmus submitted the points contained in the specification of errors, which were denied. The jury found against Hawkins and Keenan the whole amount of the mortgage, and <em>for </em>Cad-mus ; but, on a reserved point, judgment was entered for $763.34, the balance after deducting the amount awarded to Jackson by the auditor.

There is an utter contradiction in the two judgments. Keenan\u2019s title was as much discharged by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale, as ever it can be under this judgment against him: Morris <em>v. </em>Garrison, 3 Casey 226.

Keenan was served as a terre-tenant, and Cadmus came in' on his own application and was permitted to defend as a terre-tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>On the 16th November 1864, the cause came to trial, when a verdict was rendered for plaintiff for $3026.17, as to Hawkins and Keenan, and for defendant as to Cadmus, and afterwards the court ordered judgment upon reserved points against Hawkins, administrator, &amp;c., and Keenan for $765.64, the balance due to Jackson on the mortgage. No judgment appears to have been entered on the verdict in favour of Cadmus.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Upon this state of facts \u00a3he counsel for the defendant moves to quash the writ of error, and argues that as neither Hawkins nor Keenan object to the judgment that was rendered against them, and as there was neither verdict nor judgment against Cadmus, it is not competent for him to assign errors to the judgment against the others, and which is the only judgment upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We incline to think that Cadmus is entitled to his writ of error. The 9th section of the Act of 22d May 1722, Purd. 409, gives the writ not merely to parties, but to \u201c any person or persons who shall find him or themselves aggrieved with the judgment,\u201d &amp;c. In Steele <em>v. </em>Bridenbach, 7 W. &amp; S. 150, it was denied to a creditor in a proceeding to distribute a debtor\u2019s goods, simply because he had not excepted to the auditor\u2019s report nor taken any part in the proceedings in court; and though the very point was not presented in the case of Fraley <em>v. </em>Steinmetz, 10 Harris 437, and Mevey\u2019s Appeal, 4 Barr 80, it is impossible to observe what the court says about the rights of defence which a terre-tenant possesses and to doubt that he may have a writ of error when it is necessary to extricate his title from jeopardy, or, perhaps, even to clear it of a cloud.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">And such, in effect, is the rule at common law. In 2 Saunders R. 46, note 6, it is laid down that no person can bring a writ of error unless he is a party or privy to the record, <em>or is prejudiced by the judgment; </em>the rule upon the subject being that a writ of error can only be brought by him who would have had the thing if the erroneous judgment had not been given. Thus, in an action for land against a tenant, the heir must bring error in case of the tenant\u2019s death. And it may be brought by a tenant to reverse his own judgment if erroneous or given for a less sum than he has a right to demand: Johnson <em>v. </em>Jebb, 3 Burr. 1772. So, if an action be brought against A. as a feme sole who is in truth a feme covert, the husband may join her in a writ of error after judgment, from respect to the interest he has in her person and services: Jaques <em>v. </em>Cerar, 2 Saunders 101 f, in note.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">These are instances, and many more might be adduced, where parties and persons against whom no judgment has been rendered may have the writ to reverse a judgment that shall prejudice their legal rights if left unquestioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Is not Cadmus in a position to be aggrieved by the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that was r\u00e9ndered in favour of the mortgagee ? At the impetration of the writ of <em>scire facias </em>he was in point of fact a terretenant. The writ was directed to terre-tenants. And though Cadmus was not served, his subsequent appearance, by leave of the court, made him to all legal intents a party to the record. The <em>sei. fa. </em>was upon a mortgage, and a mortgage is a specific lien upon the premises described in it, and when the mortgagee has got a judgment against his mortgagor and terre-tenants he has a right to sell the premises to the highest and best bidder. Now Cadmus claimed to own the premises relieved of the mortgage, and though he might, perhaps, battle successfully with a future vendee of the sheriff, can it bd said that a judgment which commits him to such a battle does not aggrieve him ? His title would have prevailed and he would have had the thing if the judgment, which he complains of as erroneous, had not been given. As between him and Jackson there could be no further litigation if Cadmus\u2019s fundamental proposition that the Orphans\u2019 Court sale divested the lien of the mortgage had been sustained, for if it divested it for part of the debt it divested it altogether: Mevey\u2019s Appeal, 4 Barr 80. But his proposition was not sustained, for a judgment was rendered on that very mortgage, and whether it was against him or another, it subjects the premises to liability of sale, endangers his title, impairs its marketableness and exposes him to the costs of litigation, and, therefore, we think him so aggrieved by the judgment as to be entitled to his writ of error. The motion to quash it is accordingly dismissed. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The writ of error well sued by Cadmus, what benefit shall he take from it ? Shall the only judgment we find upon the record be reversed at his instance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Regarded as a judgment against the land, and a judgment in <em>scire facias sur mortgage </em>is a judgment <em>in rem </em>(Wickersham <em>v. </em>Fetrow, 5 Barr 260), it is obviously erroneous if the lien of the mortgage was divested by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Whatever doubts may formerly have existed on the subject, none exist now in Pennsylvania that an Orphans\u2019 Court sale of a decedent\u2019s real estate is a judicial sale, and divests the lien of mortgages as well as of all other debts that are capable of ascertainment in moneys numbered. \u201c Such real estate,\u201d says the 20th section of the Act of 24th February 1834, Purd. 289, \u201c so sold, shall not be liable in the hands of the purchaser for the debts of the decedent.\u201d These are simple but very effective words. They encourage bidders to pay outside prices, and they sweep off all liens which debts of the decedent may have occasioned, except only certain fixed liens like a widow\u2019s dower, which are incapable of pecuniary admeasurement. And a mortgage given by a former owner of the estate is a debt of the decedent who dies seised of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the estate as truly as if he had made the mortgage himhelf: Moore <em>v. </em>Shultz, 1 Harris 101. Nor is it within the protection of the Act of 6th April 1830, Purd. 325, for the sale is not made upon the process which is contemplated by that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The ordinary legal effect of such a sale, therefore, is to divest the lien of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In strong contrast with this sale was such a sale as that which the sheriff made to Keenan. It was a sale upon a judgment for taxes which were assessed long after the mortgage was recorded, and no sale for taxes so assessed divests the lien of a mortgage. To this effect the two Acts of Assembly of 11th April 1835 and 16th April 1845, Purd. 325, are* express. See also Perry <em>v. </em>Brinton, 1 Harris 202. And not only did not that sale divest the lien of the mortgage, but it left in Young\u2019s heirs an interest which sprung from the right of redemption for two years. This indeed is all the interest which the counsel for the defendant in error will agree remained to Young\u2019s estate upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court could act; and it being all which that court could order to a sale, it was all that Cadmus could purchase; and as he did not redeem within two years, it is argued that he took nothing by his purchase, or rather that he forfeited by laches the imperfect right which he did take.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">To this view it is answered in the first place, that the taxes were paid before the lien was entered for them, and that all judicial process founded upon paid taxes was null. This answer cannot prevail, because there is the judgment for the taxes in full force, and it cannot be collaterally impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In Delaney <em>v. </em>Gault, 6 Casey 63, it was held that in a subsequent ejectment an owner who had not been served with the <em>scire facias </em>might show that the taxes were paid before the <em>scire facias </em>issued, but here Young must be regarded as a party served, and if so, his defence should have been made to the <em>scire facias. </em>For this reason we think there was no error in rejecting the evidence of the payment of the taxes. Paid or not, there was a legal judgment for them founded on what the law makes the equivalent of personal service of process, and whilst it remains unimpeached, it concludes Young and all claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">In the next place, the above position of the counsel for defendant in error is attempted to be answered by pointing to the fact that Jackson, the mortgagee, came before the auditor and took from the proceeds of the Orphans\u2019 Court sale more than $2000 of his mortgage-money, and therefore it is argued Cadmus\u2019s title must be held to relate back to the date of the mortgage. The argument is, that he took the title as clear and unencumbered as when it was first mortgaged to Harper. We cannot deduce this conclusion from the authorities to which we have been referred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>If the sale had been on the mortgage, or upon a bond accompanying it, the- lien would have been divested and the mortgage satisfied, however far short of the principal debt the purchase-money had fallen; but even then there would have been no substitution of the purchaser to the title of the mortgagee, because a mortgagee, as such, has no title to which a purchaser can be substituted. He is a mere encumbrancer. If he have the title still in him, as a vendor may have, undoubtedly he would be decreed to convey upon receipt of the purchase-money, .but here was a mere security for money, and the fund that was distributed was not raised by proceedings upon that specific security, but by a proceeding for the payment of debts in general. As far as the mortgagee received proceeds of the sale his debt is satisfied. As to the unpaid balance the question is, whether his mortgage lost its lien ? I know of no principle of law that would justify us in carrying the purchaser\u2019s title by relation back to the date of the mortgage-debt, any more than to the date of any of the other debts of the decedent, which moved the court to order the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">What other answer does the defendant\u2019s position admit of ? If it cannot be answered \u2014 if it must be admitted that the Orphans\u2019 Court sold and Cadmus bought only the right of redemption, then it will follow that that estate or interest expired with the limitation of two years, and Cadmus has no position in court. But the major proposition assumes that the sheriff\u2019s sale to Keenan was valid. If this were not so \u2014 if that sale was incompetent to divest the interest of Young\u2019s heirs, then the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court attached to a substantial interest the whole estate, and passed it to Cadmus cleared of all li\u00e9ns. When Young died on the 27th of January 1860, though he stood in the place of the mortgagor, he had more than an equity of redemption, he had the full and absolute estate in fee simple, encumbered indeed by the mortgage, by the city\u2019s judgment for taxes, and by whatever other debts he owed, but subject to those encumbrances his seisin was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">That such is the estate of a mortgagor in possession is shown by the cases, a sufficient sample of which are Wentz <em>v. </em>Dehaven, 1 S. &amp; R. 317; Schuylkill Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 Id. 419 ; Bowen <em>v. </em>Oyster, 3 Penna. Rep. 244. As such the estate descended to Young\u2019s heirs the instant he died, and thereupon the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court attached, for purposes of administration, in the interest of creditors as well as of the widow and heirs: Horner &amp; Roberts <em>v. </em>Hasbrouck, 5 Wright 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The manifest policy of our law is, wholly to commit to the Orphans\u2019 Court the conversion of decedent\u2019s real estate as well as his personalty into money, for the payment of debts. In pursuance of this policy, the 35th section of the Act of 24th Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ary 1834 would have restrained proceedings in the Common Pleas for the conversion of Young\u2019s estate, and left the duty to the Orphans\u2019 Court, had application been made ; but either from ignorance that such proceedings were going on, or from other cause, the administrators failed to apply. The administrators had been appointed on the 17th February 1860 \u2014 the very day the <em>levari facias </em>issued upon the city\u2019s judgment; but they -were not warned, and there is nothing upon the record to indicate notice to them that their decedent\u2019s estate was about to be sold at sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The city\u2019s judgment having been obtained in the lifetime of the decedent, though at a time when probably he was on his deathbed, it was not subject to the 34th section of the Act of 1834, which requires widows and heirs to be warned before real estate is seized in execution for a decedent\u2019s debts. Yet why was it nqt subject to the 35th section of that act ? This section in very express terms forbids an execution to issue upon a judgment obtained in the lifetime of the decedent, until the personal representatives (who are the administrators) have been warned by <em>scire </em>facias, notwithstanding the <em>teste </em>of such execution may bear date antecedently to his death. This section changed the <em>old </em>rule which carried back the effect'of the execution to its teste, which was usually the first day of the term to which it issued ; but it did not alter the practice of fully executing writs of execution, where the death occurs pending tibe writ. The death of Young, however, did not occur pending the <em>levari </em>facias, but before it issued, and it is immaterial whether before or after the day on which it bore teste.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Now there is the rule of the statute for such a case as this. \u201cNo execution shall issue,\u201d says the legislature, \u201cuntil the personal representatives have been warned by <em>sci. </em>fa.\u201d Had this rule been observed, the administrators would not have been ignorant of the proceedings in the Common Pleas, and would no doubt have restrained it under the 35th section; but by not observing it, the very mischief intended to be averted, happened in the sacrifice of the decedent\u2019s homestead for $20.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">It is not a case of irregular process, but it is a defect of power to take any process of execution before <em>sci. fa., </em>and nothing can be more imperative than the denial of this power. Then it is the case of void process, for surely that which is expressly forbidden by law must be void process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Sheriff\u2019s vendees buy at their peril. Not only must there be a legal judgment, but a legal execution also, to make a sheriff\u2019s sale valid. But it was urged in argument with great pertinacity, that Keenan\u2019s title is not in question here, and our right to pass upon it was very earnestly denied. If his title be not in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>why is he upon the record as a terre-tenant ? Jackson seeks the fruits of a judgment against Keenan upon the mortgage which he holds on the premises, and unless Keenan is indeed a terre-tenant, that is a claimant to <em>title </em>in the premises, he has no right to be upon the record, and Jackson has no right to a judgment against him. It is idle, therefore, to argue that .Keenan\u2019s title is not in question. He stands as a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale under void process, and the liability of the premises in his hands for the balance due upon Jackson\u2019s mortgage is the vital question of the cause. The premises are not liable if the lien of the mortgage was divested by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale. The lien was divested by the Orphans\u2019 Court sale upon all the interest sold. The interest sold was the fee simple and not a mere redemption right, unless the sheriff\u2019s sale to Keenan was valid. But it was not valid because not made upon legal process. The conclusion is inevitable, therefore, that Jackson is entitled to take no benefit from the present <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">If, on the other hand, Keenan\u2019s title can be held above impeachment, the mortgagee, Jackson, would nullify the Orphans\u2019 Court sale after taking the bulk of its proceeds, would leave Cadmus nothing for the money he paid, and would enable Keenan to perfect his title by paying the balance of the mortgage. Consequences which would flow from a wanton infraction of both the letter and policy of a beneficent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We cannot consent to the setting aside the statute for the benefit of such consequences. When a creditor who has got a judgment for a debt once paid, cannot .afford to wait the year which the law gives for settling a dead man\u2019s estate, but is in such hot haste that he must issue his execution within a month after the death, let him see to it that he proceed according to law.; that he do not force a sale upon process which the law forbids. And a mortgagee who looks to an Orphans\u2019 Court sale to reimburse his mortgage-debt, should not forget that it is the quality of such a sale to divest the lien of his mortgage, and therefore, if he bid not the property to a sum sufficient to cover his mortgage, his remedies upon that instrument are gone, and his only recourse must be to his bond, if there be one accompanying the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
