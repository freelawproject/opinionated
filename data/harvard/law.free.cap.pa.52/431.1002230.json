The husband died September 2d 18o4; a transcript was entered in the Common Pleas December 16th 1864, and an execution issued out of the court. On the 24th of March a rule to open the judgment was discharged, and on the 19th of August 1865, a rule to restrain the plaintiff from levying on the wife\u2019s property was discharged. Discharging the rules was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-14\"><em>D.W. Patterson </em>and <em>O. J.

This very point was decided in Lacock <em>v. </em>White, 7 Harris 495. Her remedy was by appeal from the justice\u2019s judgment, but though an appeal was taken it was not carried up within the statutory period, and so she lost the benefit of it. For all purposes except lien the judgment still remains before the justice, and if it be assailable for the reasons suggested, there is the place to attack it. It would violate all rules of judicial procedure, as well as common courtesy, for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>court to overhaul a judgment which remains within the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">These observations apply as well to the rule for setting aside the execution as to that for opening the judgment. If the plaintiff is entitled to an execution upon the lien entered in the Common Pleas, the objection to the original judgment cannot impair his right, else the preposterous result might be reached of a court empowered only to enforce payment of a judgment out of the defendant\u2019s realty, reversing and vacating instead of collecting it, whilst the jurisdiction within which it remains, sustains it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The difficulty is that the appellant slipped her time, and is now complaining in the wrong tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The decree dismissing the rule is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
