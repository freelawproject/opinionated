About 6 o\u2019clock in the evening the court was adjourned over until 7 o\u2019clock in the same evening. Just as the crier had finished pronouncing the adjournment, and as the judges had arisen to their feet, the jury entered the court-room with their verdict. The judges resumed their seats, and with the counsel present, ordered the prothonotary to take the verdict of the jury, which was done. The judges had not left the bench, and the lawyers had not left the bar of the court-house. After the verdict was entered upon the minutes of the court, the judges, officers of the court and members of the bar, left the court-house, and returned again at 7 o\u2019clock, the hour to which the court stood adjourned. The verdict was taken without objection on either side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-14\">\u201c The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel request that the above statement may be signed by the court, and filed so as to be made part of the record, which is done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-15\">The verdict was for the defendants, and judgment was entered on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-16\">The following errors were assigned:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-17\">1.

But the case is solved by an answer to the question, What is an adjournment ? It is an act, not a declaration. In the proper order of procedure the announcement of the crier precedes, and does not follow, adjournment. It is but a proclamation to those in attendance of the time to which the court intends to adjourn, and gives notice of the formal act of adjournment. But adjournment is the act of separation and departure, and until this has fairly taken place, the act is incomplete. The fact of giving the order of adjournment, and the act of rising to the feet preparatory to separation, is not actual adjournment, if the judges are yet on their bench, and those remain who are concerned in the business before them. The court is not yet fully dissolved, and can recall the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>order of adjournment. The parties before them are yet subject to their orders. Such was this case. Just as the crier had finished pronouncing the adjournment, and as the judges had risen to their feet, the jury entered with their verdict. The counsel were present, the judges still on their bench, and the members of the bar yet within it. The judges immediately resumed their seats, and directed the prothonotary to take the verdict ; which he did, and recorded it in the presence of the counsel of both parties. Under these circumstances the receiving of the verdict was good whether the counsel objected or did not. They were present, and were deprived of no privilege. The plaintiffs in error lost no right, and missed no opportunities of which they might not have availed themselves. The reason of the law and the facts of the case are against them, and we should be doing no service to society or to the interests of justice were we to encourage such nice technicalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The other error was not pressed, and has nothing in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
