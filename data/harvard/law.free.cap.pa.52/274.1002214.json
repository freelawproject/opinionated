This tract was sold to Hagerty, the defendant, on the 2d of April 1852, the deed to him containing the following clause: <em>\u201c </em>Six hundred dollars of the consideration money above mentioned, however, to be and remain in the premises during the natural life of Anna Fretz, widow of John Fretz, deceased, now married to Abraham Stover, the legal interest thereof to be paid to the said Anna, annually, on the 1st day of April in any year during her natural life ; and immediately after her death the said sum of six hundred dollars to her two sisters, Elizabeth Geisinger and Susanna Stover, now deceased, in equal shares, or their legal representatives.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">Joseph, on the 29th of March-, sold his part to Michael and David Helsel, the deed containing this clause: \u201c The' sum of six hundred dollars, part of the purchase-money aforesaid (being a dower), shall be and remain in the premises above described, and be a lien thereon, the annual interest thereof, at 6 per cent., to be paid to Anna Stover, formerly Fretz, widow of John Fretz, deceased, by the said Michael Helsel and David Helsel, their heirs and assigns, during her natural life; and at the decease of the said Anna Stover, they, the said Michael Helsel and David Helsel, their heirs and assigns, shall well and truly pay the aforesaid sum of six hundred dollars to Elizabeth Geisinger and Susanna Stover, sisters of the said Anna Stover, widow of John Fretz, deceased.\u201d The title of this part is now in the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">Anna having survived her husband Fretz, on the 10th of March married Abraham Stover (who had been the husband of her sister Susanna Stover, then deceased), and died April 11th 1859, leaving him to survive her, but leaving no children. From the date of the partition till her death, Anna received her annual interest from the successive owners of the lands. After her death her husband took out administration on her estate, and having indemnified the defendants, received from each of them the one-half of the sum charged on their respective tracts, claiming it as administrator of Anna.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">The beneficial plaintiffs in these suits are the children and grandchildren of Elizabeth Geisinger, it being agreed that they are entitled to recover if Elizabeth, were she living, could recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">The question submitted to the court was \u201c whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover of the defendants the money bequeathed to Elizabeth Geisinger, on the death of Anna Fretz without heirs; and whether, under the will and the several subjections in the deed, Abraham Stover, the second husband of the said Anna, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>is her heir within the purview of the will, and the force and effect of the Intestate Laws ? and Avhether the said sums were legally-paid to Abraham Stover, administrator of Anna Stover, deceased. If the court be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered in each case in favour of the plaintiffs, and against the defendants, John Hagerty and Michael Helsel, in the sum of $300, with interest from the date of the death of the said Anna Stover ; if the court be of opinion that the plaintiffs cannot recover, then judgment to be entered generally for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The court (Chapman, P. J.) delivered the following opinion: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\"><em>\u201c </em>David Stover, by his will, makes the following bequest: \u2018 I give and bequeath unto my true and well-beloved daughter, Anna Stover, noAv wife of John Eretz, of Nockamixon toAvnship, four hundred and fifty pounds ; and it is my will if Anna dies without heirs, and immediately thereafter of John\u2019s death, that said portion shall be due and payable to her two sisters, Elizabeth and Susanna, to them, their heirs and assigns for ever, share and share alike, and solely by them redeemable.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">\u201c If, when applied to real estate, this clause would have conferred upon Anna Eretz an estate tail, it follows the gift of the \u00a3450 would have been absolute; and that it would is quite certain, for the word * heirs\u2019 would have been construed to mean issue : Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388, and the words \u2018 without issue\u2019 to mean an indefinite failure, unless there is something in the context to restrict the rule which declares that dying without issue shall be taken to contemplate an indefinite failure of issue. Is there anything which can be interpreted to have that effect, and to cut doAvn the legal signification to a failure of issue at the death of the first taker ? In regard to personal property very slight circumstances are laid hold of, as sufficient to indicate an intention that a limitation over on death without issue shall take effect at a definite time, to wit, on the death of the first taker: Bedford\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 22; Diehl <em>v. </em>King, 6 S. &amp; R. 32; Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnetz, 17 Id. 295. The limitation over to persons in being, after the death of the first taker, of itself, it has often been held, raises a strong presumption that the testator did not contemplate an indefinite failure of issue. Here such presumption arises in full force, for the limitation over was expressly to his daughters Elizabeth and Susanna, then living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-9\">\u201c But the testator has employed language which must operate as a restriction upon the legal construction of the words dying <em>\u2018 </em>without heirs\u2019 or issue. The legacy is to be <em>due </em>and <em>payable </em>to the sisters \u2018 immediately <em>there </em>after of John\u2019s death.\u2019 Now, this is directly opposed to the idea of an indefinite failure of issue. If it entered into the mind of the testator that John might die before his wife Anna, it cannot be supposed he did not intend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>limitation to take effect upon Anna\u2019s death, without issue. She did survive her husband, and a contingency which the testator did not express happened. It must have been his intention that, as soon as John was out of the way, whether he died before or after his wife, upon her death without issue, the gift over should immediately vest. Any other construction involves an absurdity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">\u201c A period is fixed for the legacy to become <em>1 </em>due and payable,\u2019 that is, immediately after John\u2019s death. This was an event certain to take place ; and though the period was not, and could not, be as definitely determined as it was in the case of Nichols <em>v. </em>Hooper, 1 P. Wms. 198, 2 Jarman 311, which was a case held to relate to real estate, this principle must apply here. The postponement being only to the happening of an event certain to take place, and not beyond the time or limitation allowed by law, the contingency was not too remote. But when was it intended by the testator the limitation over to the ulterior legatees should vest ? Surely not at the death of John, for nothing is given to him, he was not indicated as a beneficiary, the payment to the sisters of Anna was merely postponed during life. Why this was cannot be clearly determined, but there must have been some time for the legacy to vest in them. That time was her death.; and the rule is where the postponement of distribution takes place from considerations not connected with the legatee personally, but attributable to some motive of convenience to the estate of the testator, the vesting will relate back to the anterior event \u2014 that was in this case the death of Anna. If, then, it was the intention the legacy should vest in the ulterior legatees on the death of Anna, the idea of an indefinite failure of issue must be dismissed, and it must be held the testator meant a failure of issue at her death only, which disposes of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">\u201c It is contended that under the ruling of Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey 217, the second husband of Anna, to wit, Abraham Stover, would take as \u2018 heir\u2019 under the will. But surely he can have no claim on this ground, when the testator expressly excluded the first husband from such a pretension. Besides, the word \u2018 heirs,\u2019 as used in this will, is to be treated as a word of limitation, and not as a word of description. This ease differs entirely from Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey 217, cited on the argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">\u201c It was much discussed whether this legacy was charged on the land. Under the circumstances, it is immaterial whether it was or was not, although I may remark, as the residue of real and personal estate, after the payment of debts and legacies, was a blended fund, and thus given to Abraham and Joseph, there can be no doubt but the will made it a charge upon the land though the land was not the primary fund out of which the legacy was to be paid. The deeds by Joseph and Abraham subjected the land, to the payment of .the money, and agreeably to the disposition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the will as the intention of the testator has been interpreted, and agreeably, too, to what appears to have been the understanding of Anna, for instead of claiming the principal, she accepted of the annual interest of the respective owners of the land up to the time of her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Judgment will be entered in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendants, in each case, for the sum of $300, with interest from the death of Anna Stover, previously Fretz, to the present time, the amount to be ascertained by the prothonotary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">The judgment thus entered was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-8\"><em>J. L. Dubois, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av6\">The gift was an absolute one to Anna: Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris 388 ; being absolute, no qualification annexed will defeat it: Reifsnyder <em>v. </em>Hunter, 7 Harris 41; Walker <em>v. </em>Vincent, Id. 369. Abraham Stover would be entitled as heir of his wife: Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey 217 ; Porter\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 201. This legacy is a charge on the land and also an absolute gift: Fisher <em>v. </em>Redsecker, 7 Harris 113.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-9\"><em>H. </em>P. <em>Ross, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A14c\">The defendants accepted conveyances charged with the payment of these sums to the defendants in error, and are liable by their own contract: Pidcock <em>v. </em>Bye, 3 Rawle 185; Unangst <em>v. </em>Kraemer, 8 W. &amp; S. 391. The acts of Anna in her lifetime conclude her. She suffered the money to remain with the executors from 1821 to 1835; acquiesced in the arrangement by which under the partition, &amp;c., the land was chargeable with the interest to her and the principal to her sisters, and received the interest all her life: Ackla <em>v. </em>Ackla, 6 Barr 229; Whichcote <em>v. </em>Lyle, 4 Casey 73; Share <em>v. </em>Anderson, 7 S. &amp; R. 43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-10\">The gift to Anna was for life only, for the limitation was on an event which must necessarily occur within the time limited by law. And as to personalty, slight circumstances are laid hold of to restrain the limitation to a definite period: Bedford\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 22, 6 S. &amp; R. 32, 17 Id. 295 ; Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin, 10 Barr 498 <em>; </em>Moffit <em>v. </em>Strong, 10 Johns. 16 ; <em>vide </em>also Wright <em>et ux. v. </em>Brotherton, 2 Rawle 133.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered, May 15th 1866, by</p>\n<author id=\"b278-12\">Woodward, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsV\">If the opinion of the learned judge on the bequest of 450?. to Anna Fretz in her father\u2019s will were more doubtful than it is, there is a circumstance disclosed in the stated case which would dissuade us from placing a different construction upon the will. I allude to the fact, that in 1835, when Abraham and Joseph Stover, sons and residuary devisees of the testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>made partition between themselves of the real estate, they charged' half of Anna\u2019s legacy on 153 acres which Joseph took, and the other half on 134 acres which Abraham took, the annual interest thereof to be paid to Anna during her life, and at her decease the principal to be paid to her sisters Elizabeth Greisinger and Susanna Stover.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">This was a construction of the testator\u2019s will that gave Anna only a life interest in the legacy, and she acquiesced in that construction all her life by receiving the annual interest from her brothers or their successors in title without once demanding the principal to be paid to her. And these successors read the will in the same way, for they accepted title-deeds that amounted to covenants on their parts to pay the interest to Anna for life, and the principal after her death to her sisters or their heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">For more than thirty years, therefore, all parties in interest have concurred in understanding the will to mean just what the learned judge expounded it to mean. Anna, for whose benefit this particular bequest was intended, enjoyed it during life in the manner she thought her father intended, and now, if it could be demonstrated, never so clearly, that he meant she should have had an absolute interest in the legacy instead of its usufruct, it would ill become us to say in direct opposition to the terms of the will, that it shall not be \u201c due and payable to her two sisters, Elizabeth and Susanna, to them, their and assigns for ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">But it is not utterly certain that the technical construction of the words, \u201c if Anna dies without heirs,\u201d would impute an indefinite failure of issue, because the intention that the legacy should go over, an event which was before the testator\u2019s mind, is most clearly expressed. What was the event ? Manifestly the death of Anna without living children. It was a bequest of personal property, and in such cases it was said in Bedford\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 22, that very slight circumstances are laid hold of as sufficient to indicate an intention, that a limitation over on death without issue shall take effect at a definite time, to wit, at the death of the first taker.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The circumstances in this case are of a nature imperatively to .demand such a construction, and therefore the judgment in each case is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
