M. Marshall and William Walker, who, with Robert McPherson, not summoned, composed \u201c The Merchants\u2019 and Farmers\u2019 Bank.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b28-12\">The suit was on the following instrument:</summary>\n<summary id=\"b28-13\">No. 916. Allegheny, March 24th 1862.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b28-15\"><em>If not presented at </em>maturity, <em>it will he continued as a renewal. </em>$14,145, specie. J. C. Porter, <em>Cashier. </em>The pleas were <em>non assumpserunt </em>and tender.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b28-17\">It was admitted that the consideration of the certificate was $11,000 in gold and $3145 in New York exchange, which at the date of the certificate was equivalent to gold. It was also proved that \u201c specie,\u201d on the margin of the certificate, meant, that it was payable \u201c in coin \u2014 gold or silver.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b28-18\">The plaintiff, with a notary, on the 27th of March 1863, demanded payment of the amount and interest in specie, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>was refused by the cashier, who offered \u201c to pay it in legal-tender notes.\u201d The certificate was then protested.</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b29-11\"><em>A. H. Miller </em>and <em>James Veech, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AHV\">The late Acts of Congress made treasury notes a legal tender, but the laws making gold and silver coins a legal tender have not been repealed. There being two kinds of <em>lawful </em>money at the date of the certificate, the parties might elect either; they chose \u201cspecie,\u201d or the <em>hind </em>of money left with the defendants. The case of Mixed Money, Davies Rep. 48, stated in Story on Prom. Notes, \u00a7 390, n. 2, is disapproved in Story\u2019s Confl. of Laws, \u00a7 313, n. 2.</p>\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b29-14\"><em>Hamilton Acheson </em>and <em>Marshall &amp; </em>Brown, for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The consideration of the note being in specie does not imply a promise to pay in specie. The legal effect of the undertaking was to pay in money generally, and there was no waiver of the right of defendants to pay in legal-tender notes. The act makes these notes a legal tender in payment of all private debts. The design was to create a national currency to be an equivalent to coin. Courts then cannot declare otherwise, nor render judgments recognising a difference, when the law says there shall be none. A dollar by law is a dollar, whether represented by coin or <em>lawful </em>notes.</p>\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b28-10\">Error to the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Allegheny county.</em></p><p id=\"b28-14\">Six <em>months after date The Merchants\u2019 and Farmers\u2019 BanJc will pay </em>James Graham, Esq., Fourteen Thousand One Hundred and Forty-Five <em>Dollars with interest till due at the rate of </em>five <em>per cent, per annum.</em></p><p id=\"b29-6\">The court (Stowe, J.) charged, as stated in the assignments of error.</p><p id=\"b29-7\">The jury found accordingly, and the plaintiff took a writ of error.</p><p id=\"b29-8\">The errors assigned were, that the court charged:\u2014</p><p id=\"b29-9\">\u201c 1. That fit .is immaterial whether there was a special agreement to pay in specie or not: or, whether the agreement or contract was made before the passage of the Act of Congress [of February 25th 1862], or afterwards \u2014 the agreement is simply void.</p><p id=\"b29-10\">\u201c 2. You will return a verdict simply for the amount of the certificate of deposit with interest at 5 per cent., till demand, 27th March 1863, adding interest from bringing of suit to the present time.\u201d</p><p id=\"b29-12\">In Searight <em>v. </em>Calbraith, 4 Dall. 325, where the payment was to be made in Paris, the court left it to the jury to find whether assignats or specie was intended.</p><p id=\"b29-13\">If the offer to the notary to pay in \u201c legal-tender notes\u201d was a tender (which it was not), the tender should have been kept up, and the money should have been in court at the trial: Sheredine <em>v. </em>Gaul, 2 Dall. 190; Williams <em>v. </em>Bentley, 3 Casey 294. The plaintiff\u2019s demand for <em>gold </em>did not dispense with this duty. The plaintiff is entitled to interest between the time of the demand and bringing the suit.</p><p id=\"AZI\">The instrument is a non-negotiable promissory note for the payment of money generally, unless the words \u201c specie\u201d in the margin is made part of it. The note having all words necessary to make a complete contract, there is no need for additional words. The words in the body of a writing, are the substance where-unto special regard is to be had: Marins, 4th ed., p. 83. \u201c Specie\u201d is no part of the note: Payne <em>v. </em>Clark, 19 Miss. 152 ; Mears <em>v. </em>Graham, 8 Blackf. 144; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 R. I. 398; Norwich Bank <em>v. </em>Hyde, 13 Conn. 279. Marginal memoranda may <em>be </em>referred to when the body of the note is obscure: Riley <em>v. </em>Dick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ens, 19 Ill. 29; Saunderson <em>v. </em>Piper, 5 Bing. N. C. 425 (85 E. C. L. R.); 2 Green. Ev. \u00a7 251.</p><p id=\"b30-7\">This currency was created for the public convenience, and individual rights must yield to the public interest when there is a conflict.</p><p id=\"b30-8\">A tender does not extinguish the debt, but bars a claim for interest. The failure to plead the tender in time, and bring the money into court, only subjects the defendants to costs and interest from the issuing of the. writ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
