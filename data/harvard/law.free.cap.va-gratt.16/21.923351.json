Cralle against Joseph and Thomas R. Friend\u2019, Samuel II. Early and wife, and others, asking for an account of the rents, issues and profits of a certain salt property and a tract of land in the county of Kanawha, which the Friends owned as tenants in common with the plaintiff and the other defendants, and of which the Friends had held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>exclusive possession. The record is very voluminous, but the facts necessary to show the points decided by the court are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">Dr. John J. Cabell died in 1834, leaving a large real estate in the city of Lynchburg, and in the counties of Ledford and Kanawha. In the county of Kanawha he owned a valuable salt property, and a tract of land. The persons entitled to share his estate were his widow and five children, viz: Mrs. Cralle, wife of Richard K. Cralle; Mrs. Ward, wife of Henry C. Ward; Mrs. Friend, the wife of Thomas R. Friend; Paulina Cabell, and Henry Ann Cabell, who afterwards married Samuel n. Early. Thomas R. Friend qualified as administrator on the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">In November, 1834, a friendly bill was filed in the Hustings court of Lynchburg, by the widow and heirs of John J. Cabell, for a division of his estate; and on the same day commissioners were appointed to make the division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-11\">Prior to October, 1835, Henry C. Ward had died, Paulina Cabell had died an infant intestate and unmarried, and Mrs. Cralle had died, leaving an infant daughter, Mary C. Cralle; and in October of that year, these deaths were suggested; and Mary O. Cralle was made a party plaintiff. And the court set aside the former order appointing commissioners to divide the estate; and at the same time reappointed them, with directions to assign the widow her dower, and to divide the property among the four surviving heirs, Mary C. Cralle being substituted for her mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-12\">The commissioners divided the property in Lynchburg, allotting to the widow her third, and to each of the heirs her fourth in severalty; but in relation to the salt property on the Kanawha they say: <em>\u201c </em>That a portion of Dr. Cabell\u2019s real estate, to wit, the salt works and furnace on the Kanawha, do not seem to them capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>division; and as tliey are now of great value, and as their present value may hereafter be still more increased or diminished, according to a variety of circumstances, they have felt it their duty to give to each party a certain designated interest therein, so that each may be alike profited by an advancement of its value, or suffer equally from any further depreciation.\u201d And the property having been valued at twenty-five thousand dollars: to Mrs. Cabell, the widow, was allotted one-third for her dower, at $8,333 34, and to each of the four surviving heirs was allotted one-fourth of the remainder, at $4,166 66. And the tract of land om the Kanawha was allotted to the four heirs, each one undivided fourth thereof, valued at $3,750.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-3\">The commissioners having made their report, the parties seem to have taken possession of the real estate allotted to them in severalty; and nothing more\u201d was done in the case until November, 1845, when the report was directed to lie one month for exceptions; and no further proceedings appear to have been taken in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">By deed, bearing date the 19th December, 1835, Mrs. Cabell, the widow of Dr. Cabell, acting for herself and as guardian of her daughter, Henry Ann Cabell, leased to Thomas K. Friend her third of the said salt property, and Henry Ami Cabell\u2019s one-fourth of the remaining two-thirds thereof, for ten years, commencing on the 25th of December, 1836. For the widow\u2019s third he was to pay $500 a year, and for Henry Ann Cabell\u2019s interest he was to pay $300 a year. And it was agreed that if the widow died before the end of the ten years, the lease as to her part was to cease; and if Henry Ann Cabell attained to the age of twenty-one years, or married before the ten years expired, upon the happening of either of these contingencies, the lease as to her interest was to cease; or if it continued thereafter, it was to be at the pleasure of the said Henry Ann, if she at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tained tlie age of twenty-one years, or of her husband if she should marry before the time expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">By another deed of the same date, Mrs. Ward, for the consideration of $8,750, conveyed to \u00a1Thomas R. Friend her fourth in the two-tliirds of the said salt property, her fourth in the third thereof allotted to Mrs. Cabell for life, and her fourth of the tract of land on the Kanawha.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-10\">Thomas R. Friend having thus acquired the interest of Mrs. Cabell, Henry Ann Cabell, and Mrs. Ward, and being entitled to another fourth in right of his wife, took possession of the said salt property, and he and his father, Joseph Friend, worked it in partnership until 1842. In January of that year Thomas R. Friend conveyed all his interest in the property to Joseph Friend, who continued to work the property on his own account from that time. ' When they took possession the property was very much out of repair; and whilst it was occupied by them very expensive improvements were made upon it, by which the issues and profits of the property were greatly increased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-12\">It appears that Mrs. Cabell lived until some time in the year 1843. In the same year Henry Ann Cabell attained the age of twenty-one years; and in 1846 she married Samuel H. Early, a marriage settlement having been previously executed, whereby her property <em>Was </em>conveyed to Jubal A. Early, in trust for her separate use. It appears, too, that the rent due to Mrs. Cabell was paid, as was th$fc due to Henry Ann Cabell, up to 1843, a part of it having been paid to Early after the marriage. And Joseph Friend, in his answer, avers that neither Henry Ami Cabell, after she came of age, nor her husband, after the marriage, ever expressed any wish to change the terms of his holding under the lease aforesaid; \u201c and hence he has always hitherto regarded himself as holding and occupying under the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>rent reserved.\u201d It also appears that the plaintiff Cralle had received from Hewitt, Euffner &amp; Oo. $500 a year as dead rent for his interest as tenant by the curtesy in the property up to the year 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\">Before the bill was filed in this case, Mrs. Ward and Mrs. Thomas K. Friend had died; the latter leaving four infant children siirviving her, who were parties defendants in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">In 1848 the court directed accounts of the rents, issues, and profits of the salt property and the tract of land on the Kanawha, whilst in the possession of the Friends, to be taken: one, of these accounts was to commence when they took possession, and be continued until the 28th of January, 1842, when Thomas K. Friend conveyed his interest in the 'property to Joseph Friend, and was to be charged to them jointly; and another was to extend from that period imtil the first day of the next term of the court, and was to be charged to Joseph Friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">The commissioner returned his report, which was excepted to by all the parties; and the cause came to be heard on the 22d of February, 1853, when the court made a decree, which was changed in some respects by another decree, made on the 11th of February, 1855, By these decrees the court held that the co-tenants of the Friends were entitled to share in the actual profits made on the salt property, according to their several interests, and to recover from the Friends their share of the net profits which had been received by them, except for such time as the shares of any of the parties were actually rented, or for which they had theretofore received compensation. And having determined the1 interests of the different parties in the profits, and fixed the time from which they were each entitled to share them; and having also fixed the nature of allowances which should be made to the Friends; and deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that they were not to be charged with interest upon the annual profits, the report was recommitted with instructions to the commissioner, to restate and settle the account upon the evidence then in the record, or which might be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-9\">From this decree Samuel II. Early and wife, and the trustee, Jubal <em>\u00abL. </em>Early, applied for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-10\">The case was most elaborately argued in printed notes, upon all the questions raised in it, by Beverly B. Johnston and Price for the appellants, and Conway Bobinson and Fry for the appellees, Thomas B. and Joseph Friend; but the decision of the court involves but two of these questions. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-11\"><em>For the </em>Appellants, it was argued</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaL\">If the court had no jurisdiction of the case, the defendant must have been badly advised, when he asserted in his answer, wdiich he also swore to, that the regular course had been pursued for the attainment of rents and profits. And with the perfect assurance which he felt, that upon taking the account, a large balance would be found in his favor, he might well challenge the investigation. That investigation has. been made. It wTas prayed for by the one party and conceded by the other, each claiming a balance in his favor. But these expectations could not possibly be realized on both sides. A balance could not be on both sides\u2014one or the other must be the creditor and the other the debtor. One or the other party must' be disappointed in his hopes. So the learned and able counsel for the defendants, fearing that their client was too sanguine, when he anticipated a large balance upon settlement in his favor, have now, for the first time, discovered that the court cannot take jurisdiction of the case to ascertain the actual amount of the balance, or on which side it will fall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>An account of rents and profits being the object of tlie suit, and being-prayed for in the bill, and being acquiesced in, in the answer, there being no plea to the jurisdiction, it seems to us that without the aid of our act of Assembly, and without'the aid of any adjudicated case, but upon the general principle, and general practice of a court of equity, it would require the want of jurisdiction to be very palpable before it would, at this stage of the case, dismiss the bill. <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis's ex'ors, 7 </em>Leigh, 720; <em>White </em>and McCall, not reported.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-3\">Lithe first of these cases, Judge Carr says, p. 738: \u201cI think, however, the accounts have been taken wrong. The Ruffners must be treated as tenants in common with Prior, not as trsepassers. They are liable for a fair Share of the profits, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-4\">Judge Tucker , says, p. 743: \u201cFirst as to rents and profits: I have no question that in the settlement of them, the Ruffners ought to be treated as tenants in common with Prior, and those claiming under him.\u2014 They claim to hold Reynold\u2019s interest at a very early period by contract with him, and, therefore, held in Ids right one moiety, while they wrongfully took the exclusive enjoyment and possession of the other moiety, which did not belong to the3n.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">Here both Judges treat the Ruffners as tenants in common with Prior, and those claiming under him, and therefore were liable to a fair share Of the profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">Where a bailiff is made by contract, and not by law, he must consent to the relation. When he takes the profits to himself exclusively, being tenant in common in possession, the law makes him bailiff because of his interest and his excessive receipts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">To review' all the numei-ous authorities cited upon this subject by the learned counsel on the other side, would be as tedious as we apprehend it would be unprofitable. We believe that when the. court comes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>review them, they will find them, at least many of them, inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-9\">Here is a property which cannot be occupied by more than one proprietor. It cannot be occupied jointly. It is indivisible, so the Lynchburg court held, in a\" suit in which all these parties were parties, and by its decree they are bound. It is productive of large profits, in the hands of a judicious agent or bailiff, rendered so principally on account of the Salt water and the Coal. How, after the Salt water and Coal have been used until the water is nearly exhausted, and has receded fifteen or eighteen hundred feet; and the Coal is diminished in quantity, rendered more difficult of access, if not literally consumed, an account, of profits is inadmissible in a Court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-10\">It may not be amiss to ascertain who a bailiff is in legal contemplation: A bailiff is one who has the administration and charge of lands, goods and chattels, to make the best benefit for the owner. Coke Litt, 172; 1 Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7446. \u201cAnd against whom, therefore, an action of account would lie for the profits which he had made, or might by his industry or care, have reasona-. bly made, his reasonable charges and expenses being deducted.\u201d 2 Eonb Eq., B 2, eh. 7, \u00a7 6, and note n.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-11\">The remedy in equity in cases of account, is generally more complete and adequate than it is or can be at law.

Coke'Litt. 199, h, 200 b; but this statute gave a remedy by giving an action \u2022of account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-4\">The case of <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>2 P. Wms., E. 644, referred to by Mr. Eobinson, is not deemed a very conclusive authority, to establish anything in this case against us. The account in that ease was directed, and the only question of any difficiilty, was as to the time at which the account should commence. It was ordered to commence with the plaintiff\u2019s title:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">There is as little to our prejudice in the case of <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>1 Atk., R. 489. The party entering and holding the estate of an infant was held to account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">And so in 1 Story\u2019s Equ. \u00a7 511, cited by Mr. Eobinson, where several of the authorities referred to by him are cited, it is stated that where a stranger enters into an infant\u2019s lands, he shall account to the infant for rents and profits. This is so at common law, and also where there is even no unity of estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">The same may be said of the cases of <em>Newburgh </em>v. <em>Beckerstaffe, </em>1 Vern., R. 295, and <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Bertie, </em>2 Vern., R. 332.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-8\">After treating these authorities with the utmost respect, it cannot be said that they have any controlling influence upon this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-9\">One tenant in common, as between himself and a stranger, is in possession of the whole. This is the effect of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>3 Kernan\u2019s, R. 173; but, we will add, being in possession and taking the whole of the profits, his co-tenant can compel him to account as bailiff. Code, \u00a7 14, p. 586.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-10\"><em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>12 Mass., R. 149, decides that rents and profits cannot be recovered at common law, and that whether the statut\u00e9 of 4 Anne, was in force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>in Massachusetts or not, is immaterial, as the case, was not brought under that statute; but see not.e (a) at the end of the case, for the doctrine we contend for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-9\">In <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>2 Wash. Cl. R., 482, the plaintiff failed because of a misdescription. He claimed that the money sued for had been received for him, when it appeared that it had been- received for a Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-10\">It is supposed that the case of <em>Henderson </em>v. Eason, <em>9 </em>Eng., L. &amp; E. R., 339, which is referred to and commented on in the 3rd voh Eob. Prac., (newr) page 173, has shed a flood of light upon this subject. We think, however, that case differs widely from this. There the profits were taken as the Court said, not received, so as to bring the case within the operation of the statute of 4 Anne. Here the profits were received; there the subject of the profits was a farm.which had been cultivated by the defendant; no waste was alleged; here the use of the property necessarily impaired its value in perpetuity; the water was exhausted and the coal consumed. These injuries were irreparable. The receipts grew out of the use which necessarily injured the property. To use was to injure and exhaust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-11\">Thus this case is clearly distinguishable from Hender<em>son </em>v. Eason, and in sustaining the plaintiff here, the Court need not interfere with that case. Were it not so, the Court might not feel bound to follow that case, in disregard of many others of at least equal respectability. It might not see the substantial difference, as the English court thought it did, between the words receive and take, and upon that criticism, it seems the case turned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-12\">In <em>White </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>the court uses this language: <em>\u201c </em>The court is, therefore, of opinion that there is no error in the decree affirming the right of the complainant to call for an account of the rents and profits, or in ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tabling the extent of their interest, under the. devise of James King, and the determination of the bequest to Carson, to be four twenty-sevenths of the whole amount of the rents and profits, and to require said White to account, as tenant in common, holding possession of the whole subject, and appropriating the whole profits to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-4\">Here the court expressly decides that one tenant in common has-the right to call on his co-tenants for an account of rents and profits.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">It would be vain to say that that was a suit against White as receiver of the. court, and, therefore, distinguishable from this. It was a suit against him both as receiver and tenant in common, and his liability as tenant in common, not as receiver, is expressly affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">It would be equally vain to attempt to distinguish that ease from this, by saying that White had been tenant of the property, and had held over, without contract, after his term expired, and for that reason he was liable to an accoiint; for such was also the case in this as to the Friends, and Early and wife. Indeed, we think it would be difficult to distinguish that case from this, upon any ground calling for a different principle of settlement; except in this case the court can ascertain with tolerable certainty the amount of profits, which in that case it could not do; and thus, in this case it can do what in that it Would have done if it could.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">The point most labored in the very elaborate and learned argument of Mr. Kobinson, is Ms position, founded mainly on the decision of the court of the Exchequer chamber, in the ease of <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Eason; </em>that no account of rents, issues and profits, lay in favor of one tenant in common against his co-tenant, who has had the sole occupation of' the estate, and taken or received the issues and profits exclusively. As a general proposition in regard to real estate, we hold that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>decision is' not, and, at least since \u2022 the statute of Anne, has not been law in Virginia. The practice in our inferior courts has been uniform and unvarying. The view of the profession, as to the existence and universality of the right, has been general; and the decisions of the court of Appeals, wherever the point has arisen, whether directly or incidentally, have been clear and strong\u2014maintaining the right-and' enforcing the remedy to the fullest extent, wherever the circumstances of cases rendered the account possible; and where it was not <em>to-be </em>attained for want of proper evidence, giving the utmost annual value justified by the known facts of the cause. So much for the known and recognized rule of decision in Virginia, on tins most interesting question. It appears to us, that if we be right as to the existence of such a course of practice, and such an uniform course of decisions in Virginia, as we submit has obtained in our courts, it must settle this question in our favor. We submit that such would be the result in regard to real estate, merely employed and cultivated for agricultural purposes. But the case of salt estates is different and peculiar; and even under a different course of adjudication, would have necessarily worked out a new and juster rule for itself from the very necessity of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-10\">Such an estate is generally impartible from its physical nature, yet more from difficulties which are inseparable from the subject and its mode of use and enjoyment. It is a fact forming part of this case, and' conclusive between'these parties, that this salt property is not capable of partition. If this had\" not been so declared in this case by the decision of the court at Lynch-burg; yet the fact is apparently and incontrovertibly true in itself. How, then, stood this estate when the Friends first, and Joseph Friend subsequently, obtained the sole occupation, which they afterwards held, and which, in its consequences, is now the subject of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>present controversy? It was a single tenement, improved with the well, furnace and fixtures, (including a coal mine,) necessary for the manufacture and -sale of salt. It was incapable of being divided amongst the heirs according to their interests therein. It was capable of large production; but that product must be the result of a single operation of the work. These works must be carried on as a unit; separate, disunited, several, working of this estate at the same time by several tenants in common, is manifestly impossible. Ho one proprietor could be forced to work the estate. But whenever he elected to enter, occupy, and operate the estate, the legal consequences arising from his own act, and from the interests and rights of his co-tenants in the estate, became the inevitable and inseparable conditions of his act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-4\">\"Why should not interest be allowed? In <em>Ruffner's </em>v. <em>Lewis\u2019 ex\u2019rs, 7 </em>Leigh 720, there were large accounts on both sides, rendering it uncertain on which side the balance avouM fall. They also occupied as owners, and believed themselves to be so. They had employed their skill, capital and enterprise on the property in good faith as owner. Hot so here. The Friends knew they Avere not owners. They knew they must account for receipts, and when they received the money, which ought at least at the end of the year to have been paid over, why should they not pay interest?

See Co. Lit., 2005 / 1 Tlio. Co., 787, Am. ed. 910. The liability to account for the profits of an infant\u2019s lands was an exception to the general rule requiring a <em>contract </em>to be shown to support the action of account. <em>King of France </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>cited in 3 Yeates R., 251; <em>Thouron </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>6 Whart.

The general rule applied to every tenant in common who was an adult; to every one who was competent tG eater on the land or bring an action if he was disseised thereof; to every one who was competent to make a contract with his co-tenants in eommon, or to decline making such contract. \u201c If,\u201d says <em>Parke </em>R.? \u201c\u201cone tenant in common occupied and took the whole profits, the other had no remedy against him whilst the tenancy in common continued, unless he was put out of possession, when he might have his ejectment, or unless he appointed the other to be his bailiff as to his undivided moiety, and the other accepted the appointment, when an action of account would lie as against a bailiff of the owner of the entirety of an estate. Until the statute of Anne this state of the law continued.\u201d 17 Adol &amp; El., n. s. 718; 79 Eng. C. L.; 9 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>Eq.

The evidence authorizes the conclusion that if there be any enterprise uncertain and hazardous in the extreme, it is that of the manufacture of salt; and that to such a case as that before the court, the application of the principle of <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Eason </em>is peculiarly proper. What the Exchequer Chamber deemed just with respect to the very uncertain and expensive crop of hops, cannot be less just with respect to the more uncertain and more expensive product of salt wells. If Joseph Friend has taken the whole of the salt that he raised, \u201cis he to be accountable in such a case, when it is clear that if the speculation had been a losing one altogether, he could not have called\u201d on the plaintiff or Early for a share of the losses, as he would have been enabled to do if the property had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>been worked \u201c by the mutual agreement of the co-tenants?\u201d Having employed his capital and his industry in this hazardous enterprise, without the co-operation of the plaintiff or Early, they have no right now to subject him to another hazardous operation\u2014that of ascertaining, from the various statements and conflicting views of witnesses, and the uncertain judgment of a commissioner upon unsatisfactory \u25a0 evidence, whether or no he made a profit and what was the amount of that profit. Although he has taken the proceeds of all the salt that he raised, \u201che cannot be said to receive more than his just share and proportion to which he is entitled as a tenant in common. He receives, in truth, the return for his own labor and capital, to which his co-tenant has no right.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\">It may well be that a Court of Equity had jurisdiction in <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis' ex'ors, 7 </em>Leigh, 720, without its following that there was jurisdiction to decree an account of profits in this cause. It may be considered clear, as Judge Story says, (1 Story\u2019s, Eq. \u00a7 512,) \u201cThat if there is a trust, and the cestui que. trust comes into equity upon his title to recover the estate, he will be decreed to have the further relief of an account of the rents and profits.\u201d But, in our case there is no such equitable ground for interference. It is the case of a legal right asserted\u2014asserted by one who is not an infant\u2014and who has no remedy in equity for any thing bej-ond what he is entitled to recover at law. \u201cThere being no trust nor infant in the case,\u201d an account of xunts and px\u2019ofits should be refused here, as it wras x-e-fused in <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>2 Vern.

The Friends stood in no such relation to the plaintiff or to Early; they occupied, not as agents or trustees of others, but in their own right, and were under no obligation to anybody to keep any account at all of what they received or what they spent in the business. The court is induced first to commit the error of treating the Friends as bailiffs of the plaintiff a,nd of Early, and then this error is made the basis and the only basis\u2014the only j ustification\u2014for still greater errors\u2014still greater injustice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-9\">In a case wherein Lord Eldon overruled a motion for a receiver, he considered the defendant as having a charge for all the expenditure he had incurred, and said, <em>\u201c </em>it is impossible to remove him from the possession without reimbursing him all he has laid out,\u201d and is liable to, with reference to both the present and the old concerns.\u201d <em>Norway </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>19 Ves. R. 144. So when a bill is filed for partition, if it appear that the defendant has been at ex3)ense in improving the premises, a court of equity will not interfere for the jfiaintiff but on the terms of his making an allowance for such expenditure. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>8 Price\u2019s R. 518. And in cases in which the working being by agreement between the parties, an account is allowed of the profits, it is also directed to be of the expenditure and of the sums contributed. The plaintiff must undertake to bear his share of the expenditure; he will not be allowed to dispute any <em>bona fide </em>expenditure of the defendants, and he must allow to the defendants interest upon the excess of their expenditure beyond their proper proportion. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>27 Eng.

It was not raised by any of the defendants in the court below by plea, answer, or otherwise, so far as the record shows; but on the contrary, the answers of the principal defendants, in effect, admitted the jurisdiction of the court. The only notice which seems to have been taken of the subject in that court is contained in the decree 'of the 22d day of February, 1853, in which an opinion is expressed by the court that it had jurisdiction of the case, upon the principles declared by the court of Appeals in the case of <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis\u2019 ex\u2019rs, </em>7 Leigh 720. H the defendants, Joseph and Thomas K. Friend, are bound to account with the plaintiff and their other co-tenants in common for rents and profits of the common property, while it was solely occupied and enjoyed by the Friends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>as claimed by the bill, then, undoubtedly, a court of equity has jurisdiction of the case. It involves the settlement of an account of rents and profits in which, according to that supposition, the plaintiff and defendants have a common interest in different proportions, and some of the parties concerned are infants. I will, therefore proceed to consider the case upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The appellees, the Friends, by their counsel, contend that they are not bound to account at all for such rents \u2022 and profits to their co-tenants in common, at least to such of them as were adults when the property was occupied and enjoyed as aforesaid; and that, therefore, the bill ought to have been dismissed. They insist that, as tenants in common, they had a right to occupy and use any part, or all of the common property, without being accountable, in any form or to any extent, to their co-tenants, unless they contracted with them for such accountability, or ousted or excluded them from the possession, or unless they destroyed or ivasted the common property; none of which they say, did they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">This would certainly have been the case at common law. \u201cIf one joint-tenant, or tenant in common of land,\u201d says Colee, \u201c malceth his companion his bailiff of his part, he shall have an action of account against him, as hath been said. But, although one tenant in common, or joint tenant, without being made bailiff take the whole profits, no action of account lieth against him: for in an action of accoimt, he must charge him either as a guar- \u2022 dian, bailiff, or receiver, as hath been said before; which he cannot do in this case, unless his companion constitute him his bailiff. And, therefore, all those books which affirm that an action of account lieth by one tenant in common or joint-tenant against another, must be intended, when the one maketh the other his bailiff, for otherwise, never his bailiff to render an account, is a good plea.\u201d 1 Tho. Co. <em>787 </em>marg. And in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>a note bv the editor, it is said: \u201cAt common law joint- \" \u2019 J tenants and tenants in common had no remedy against each other, where one alone received the whole profits of the estate, since he could not be charged as bailiff or receiver to his companion, unless he actually made 1dm so.\u201d Id. 788, note (R.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">But the statute 4 Anne c. 16, \u00a7 27, was passed in England to remedy this defect of the common law. And a similar statute was passed in this country at an early period, and has ever since continued in- force. In the Code, p. 586, ch. 145, \u00a7 14, it. is in these words: \u201c An action of account may be maintained against the personal representative of any guardian, bailiff, or receiver, and also by one joint-tenaiit or tenant in common, or his personal representative, against the other as bailiff, for receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion, and against the personal representative of any such joint-tenant or tenant in common.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">But it is contended that this statute mak\u00e9s a joint-tenant or tenant in common liable to account to his co-tenants only where he receives money, or something else given or paid by another, which all the tenants are entitled to in proportion to their interests as such, of which one receives more than his just share, according to that proportion; and not where he merely has the sole occupation and enjoyment of the property, even though, by the employment of his own industry, skill and capital, he makes a profit by such occupation and enjoyment, and takes the whole profit to his own use: and that, therefore, the Friends, not having received any rent from others for which they are accountable, but having only occupied and enjoyed the property as aforesaid, are not liable to account to their co-tenants for any profits which may have been made by such occupation and enjoyment, nor for any rent or other compensation whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>, In support of this position a very important ease, decided in 1851 in the Exchequer chamber, <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>17 Ad. and El. N. S. 701, 79 Eng. C. L. R., is cited and much relied on by the counsel of the Friends; and it must be admitted that it fully sustains their position, and, if it were a binding authority, might be conclusive of this case. The question came fairly up for decision in that case. It was an action of account founded on the stat. 4 Anne c. 16, by Robert Eason against the executor of his co-tenant in common, Edward Eason. The pleadings were in proper form. On the trial of the issues, evidence was given that the two Easons were tenants in common of a. farm .from November, 1833, to November, 1838, during which time Edward Eason occupied the whole on his own account; that he cultivated the same on his own account solely, and appropriated the produce to his own use; that he cropped the farm in the usual way, kept the usual quantity of live and dead stock, and farmed well; and that he received all the produce of the farm, and sold it on his own account. Yerdict was found for the plaintiff, and upon an account thereafter taken the sum of \u00a3900 was- found to be due to him, for which judgment was accordingly rendered. The case was brought by error from the Queen\u2019s Bench to the Exchequer chamber, where it was fully and ably argued. Parke B., in delivering the judgment of the court lays great stress on the word \u201c <em>receiving </em>\u201d in the statute. <em>\u201c </em>Every case,\u201d he says, <em>\u201c </em>in which a tenant in common <em>receives </em>more than his share is within the' statute; and account will lie when he does <em>receive, </em>but not otherwise.\u201d \u201c He is to account when he <em>receives, </em>not <em>ta7c.es, </em>more than comes to his just share.\u201d What, then, is a \u201creceiving\u201d of more than comes to his just share, within the meaning of that provision of the statute of Anne? It appears to us that, construeing the act according to the ordinary meaning of the words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>this provision of the statute was meant to apply only to cases where the tenant in common receives money or something else, where another person gives or pays it, which the co-tenants are entitled to simply by reason of their being tenants in common, and in proportion to their interests as such, and of which one receives and keeps more than his just share according to that proportion. The statute therefore includes all eases in which one of two tenants in eoinmon of lands leased at a rent payable to both, or of a rent 'charge, or any money payment or payment in kind, due to them from another person, receives the whole or more than his proportionate share according to his interest in the subject of the tenancy. There is no difficulty in ascertaining the share of each, and determining when one has received more than his just share; and he becomes, as to that excess, the bailiff of the other, and must account. But when we seek to extend the operation of the statute beyond the ordinary meaning of- its words, and to apply it to eases in which one has enjoyed more of the benefit of the subject, or made more by its occupation, than the other, we have insuperable difficulties to encounter.\u201d The learned Judge proceeds to enumerate these difficulties, and concludes by reversing the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench. See 3 Bob. Prac. 173 (new ed.), where this ease is fully stated, and other eases on the subject are referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">This decision certainly settles the construction of the statute in England. But it is somewhat remarkable that its construction had not there been settled long before. . And it would seem that until that decision was made the current, or at least the preponderance, of judicial opinion in that country was the other way. That was the opinion of Vice Chancellor Wigram in <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Burchell, </em>3 Hare 97, 25 Eng. Ch. R. decided in 1843; though afterwards reversed by Lord Chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Cottenham, 2 Phill. 127,22 Eng. Ch. R., upon the ground that mere occupation by one of several tenants in common of an estate, if unaccompanied by exclusion, does not make him liable for rent to his co-tenants, and that . . . the nature of the occupation in that case did not amount to such exclusion. That was the opinion also of Vice Chancellor Shadwell in <em>Hendersons. Eason, </em>15 Simons 303, 38 Eng. Ch. R., decided in 1846; though Lord Cottenham doubted, on appeal, whether the claim allowed by the Y. C. could be maintained, and directed an action to be brought. 2 Phill. 22 Eng. Ch. R. 308. And that was also the opinion of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>12 Ad. <em>&amp; </em>El. N. S., 64 Eng. C. L. R. 986, decided in 1848, on a case stated for the opinion of the court by order of a judge after issue joined in an action brought by direction of the Lord Chancellor as aforesaid. Lord Denman C. J. in delivering the opinion of the court, said: \u201cThe case stated that he (the defendant) had occupied and received the. whole profits, but no part was underlet; he received no rent, nor anything but the profits derived from the culture of the,lands, to the expense of which the plaintiff in no way contributed. It was contended that the defendant was not liable as bailiff, because it appeared that he had not received <em>rent, </em>and because it did not appear that he had received more than his just proportion.\u2014 But we think that the words, \u2018 rents, issues and profits,\u2019 include the proceeds, of the land, whether in money or in kind; &amp;c.\u201d The Lord Chancellor, it appears, being dissatisfied with that proceeding for some cause, directed another action to be brought; which was accordingly brought, and was finally decided in the court of Exchequer Chamber as before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">If the decision of that court, instead of being made in 1851, had been made before the statute of 4 Anne C. 16, S. 27 was adopted by us, the construction which that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>decision settles in . England, would have been adopted by implication along with the statute. But as at the time of the adoption of the statute by us there had been no English decision construing it, we are left free to construe it according to its apparent meaning and the probable intention of the legislature,'without being controlled by subsequent decisions in England or elsewhere, other than in our own State. Though certainly we will always pay due respect to decisions out of our State, and none are entitled to more respect than those of the English courts, and especially the court of Exchequer Chamber.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">What then is the moaning of the words in our statute, \u201cfor receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion\u201d? What did the legislature intend by the use of those words? Did they only intend to make a tenant in common accountable to his co-tenants for receiving from a stranger on account of rents and profits of the property more than the just share or proportion of such tenant? Or did they intend to make him accountable for receiving more than his just share or proportion of the rents and profits, whether paid by a stranger or derived from his own occupation and enjoyment of the property? I think they intended the latter. The former construction may be a reasonable one in England, where the ordinary mode of deriving profit from real estate is by renting it out; but not in this State, where real estate is generally occupied and used by the owner. With all deference to the court of Exchequer Chamber, I think the construction they put upon the word \u201c <em>receiving\u201d </em>is too technical and narrow, at least for our country; and if it be a just one in England, it is because of circumstances existing there which do not exist here. I do not see the force of the distinction drawn by that court between the words <em>\u201creceive\u201d </em>and <em>\u201ctake\u201d </em>in this connection. I think the word <em>\u201creceiving\u201d </em>in the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ute literally means a receiving of profits as well by use and occupation as by renting out the property. At all events there is, in substance, no difference between them, and the former is as much within the reason and the meaning of the law as the latter. If a tenant in common rent out the property and receive more than his j ust share of the rent, he is accountable- for the excess to his-co-tenants. Why should he not be alike accountable when, instead of renting out the property, he solely occupies and uses it, and thus receives more than his just share of the profits? Why should he be told: \u201cIf you rent out the property and receive the rent, you must share it out with your co-tenants. But if you solely occupy and use it and take all the profits, you will not he accountable to them ?\u201d Would he hesitate between these \u25a0 alternatives ?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">I think tlie same principle precisely applies to the two cases. And the only difficulty which exists is, in the application of the principle to one of the cases. That difficulty ivas much commented on by the court in tlie case decided by the Exchequer Chamber; and was one of the causes, if not the chief cause, of that decision.\u2014In the case of rent received from a stranger, \u201cthere is no difficulty\u201d the court said \u201cin ascertaining the share of each and determining when one has received more than his just share.\u201d' But in the case in which one has enjoyed more of the benefit of the subject, or made more by its occupation than tlie other, \u2018\u201cwe have insuperable difficulties to encounter.\u201d The court then proceeded to enumerate the difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">I readily admit the existence of difficulty, but not thait it is insuperable; certainly not in all cases. It consists in the fact, that the occupying tenant has rights as well as his co-tenants, which two classes of rights must, if possible, be reconciled. The statute was not designed to take away or impair the rights of the occupying ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ant, but to require them to be so used as not to interfere with those of his co-tenants. Each tenant has a right to occupy and use the common property, but not to the exclusion of his co-tenants. The occupation of one, does not necessarily exclude 'the occupation of the others.\u2014 They cannot, by remaining out, make the occupying tenant their bailiff against his will. lie can be made their bailiff only by contract with them; or, under the statute, by receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion. It is often difficult to determine, when, by mere occupation and use of the property, he receives more than his just share. And it is still more difficult to lay down any general rule on the subject. <em>This </em>rule at least may be laid down, that whenever the nature of the property is such as not to admit of its use and occupation by several, and it is used and occupied by one only of the tenants in common, or wherever the property, though capable of use and occupation by several, is yet so used and occupied by one as in effect to exclude the others, he receives more than comes to his just share or proportion, in the meaning of the statute, and is accountable to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">This rule is of easy application to this case, and is I think sufficient for its solution. The salt property, of which the rents and profits are the subject of controversy here, if capable of use and occupation by several, which is at least extremely doubtful, has certainly been so used and occupied by the Friends as in effect to exclude their co-tenants therefrom. The Friends have solely occupied and used it and derived all the benefit which they could have derived from it had they been the sole owners. And they so occupied and used it as plainly to indicate that they considered themselves, and must have been considered by the other parties concerned, as renters of the property and not as tenants in common merely. They actually held the dower interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of Mrs. Cabell, being one undivided third of the property, and the interest of Mrs. Early, being one undivided fourth of the other two-thirds, under a lease for ten years, dated the 19th day of December, 1835, at a certain annual rent for each interest. These interests, with others which they owned, made them proprietors of almost the entire subject. After the determination of the lease they continued to occupy and use the property as before. Indeed, they never, until recently, denied their accountability to their co-tenants in some form or to some extent, for a participation in the rents and profits, but seem to have admitted their liability to Early and wife, or her trustee, for the same annual rent of her interest after she became of age as before, on the ground that they continued to hold that interest under an implied contract, on the terms prescribed by the.expired lease; and to the proprietors of the other outstanding interests, for the yearly value thereof in the condition in which the property was when it came into the hands of the Eriends. They only denied the light of their co-tenants to participate in issues and profits which may have arisen alone from their labor, skill and capital in the use of the property, without being accountable for the losses of the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The construction of the statute for which I contend is, I think, the same which has always been acted upon in this State. It was acted upon without question in the only ease on this subject decided by this court; I mean <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis' ex'rs, 1 </em>Leigh 120; which was argued by counsel of great experience and ability. The question in that case was, not whether the defendants were liable at all, but on what principle and to what extent. Carr, J., said: <em>\u201c </em>The Ruffners must be treated as tenants in common with Prior, not as trespassers. They are liable for a fair share of the profits, and entitled to full compensation for their expenses fairly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>reasonably incurred, as well those attending their abortive efforts to find water, as their more fortunate ones.\u201d The opinion of Tucker, P., was to the same effect, and the other judges concurred therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The same construction has also been adopted and well established in South Carolina. In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>1 McMullan\u2019s Equ. R, 75, before Chancellor Harper in 1830, the defendants, who were tenants in common with the plaintiffs of a tract of land, had taken possession of it and cultivated all the cleared land. They also cleared and cultivated another portion of the land, and made improvements; and the question was, whether and to what extent they were chargeable ? \u201c I am of opinion,\u201d said the chancellor, \u201cthat defendants ought to be charged with the rent of land'estimated as it was when they took possession of it, and are not to be charged with the rent of the newly cleared land, or credited for improvements. There is nothing, I think, in the objection, that the defendants did not receive rent, but cultivated the lands themselves. To cultivate and have the use of lands, is to receive the rents and profits, though the occupier is his own tenant.\u201d This decision, (at least as to the rents and profits of the cleared land, the other part of the decree not having been appealed from,) was afterwards affirmed on appeal. In <em>Holt, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Robertson. </em>Id. 475, before chancellor Desaussure, in 1831, and afterwards in the court of Appeals, the decision was to the same effect. And so also was it in <em>Hancock, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Day, </em>Id. 69, decided by the Court of Appeals in 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The case of <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>12 Mass R. 149, decided in 1815, was cited and much relied on as being to the same effect with the decision of the Exchequer Chamber before referred to. Eut the action in that case was a common law action , of account, and not an action upon the statute 4 Anne e. 16; and most of the remarks of Parker C. J., refer to the common law, and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>statute. The property in that case consisted of houses, lands and wharves, and though they were for a period in the sole possession and occupancy of the defendants, it does noj; appear that their occupation of the property was of such a nature as to exclude their co-tenants therefrom. In a note to that ease, it is stated, <em>\u201c </em>that it does not seem to be necessary that the defendant should have received profits otherwise than by his occupancy, in order to give a cause of action to the plaintiff upon the statute. It is sufficient if he have any way received more of the issues or profits than comes to his just share and proportion;\u201d for which is cited Dane\u2019s Ab. ch. 8, art <em>3, </em>\u00a713.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">I, therefore, think the Friends are accountable for rents and profits to their co-tenants in common, and the question next to be considered is, in what manner and to what extent are they so accountable ? Are they accountable for issues and profits actually made by the application of their labor, skill, and capital, to the property; or are they accountable for the fair yearly value of the property in the condition in which it was at the time it came to their possession <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">I think the latter is the just and true measure of accountability, and one that is perfectly consistent with the statute. There is a very material difference between the nature of a liability of a bailiff at common law, and of a tenant in common who is a bailiff under the statute. The former is a fiduciary, bound to manage the estate to the best advantage and make all the profit he can for the owners, and to keep and render to them a full and fair account of his transactions; and he is liable, not only for rents and profits actually received, but also for such as might have been received without his default: while the latter is accountable only for rents and profits actually received, more than his just share and proportion. He is bailiff only by virtue of his receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>more than his just share, and in an action of account against him, it is an essential averment of the declaration that he has received more than his share. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>Willes, P. 208; <em>Sturton </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>13 Mees and Welsb. 17; 79 Eng. C. L. R. 718. He is not a fiduciary nor a trespasser, but has a right to occupy and use the property. When he rents it out and receives the rent there is no difficulty in ascertaining the amount for which he is accountable. When, instead of renting it out, he occupies and uses the whole to the exclusion of his co-tenants, and thus, in effect, becomes himself the renter, there is more difficulty; but it seems to me that the just and true rule is, to charge him with a reasonable rent for the use and occupation of the property in the condition in which it was when he received it, and to hold him accountable to his co-tenants for their just shares of such rent. This rule does justice to all parties concerned, and gives the same just measure of compensation to the co-tenants whether the property be rented out by one of them, or be occupied and used by him to the exclusion of the rest. \u2022 It does not make the compensation in the latter case depend Upon the accident of his being a good or a bad manager, a prudent and cautious person, or a wild and reckless speculator.\u2014 It is just to the occupying tenant, who having occupied and used the property instead of renting it out, ought to be accountable to the same extent as if he had rented it out and received the rent. It is just to his co-tenants, who are entitled to a share of the rent of the property, but not of the issues and profits of his labour, skill and capital applied to its use. They do not share in the <em>risk </em>and ought not to share in the <em>profit </em>of the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">The rule is not inconsistent with any authority that I have seen. In <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewis\u2019s ex'ors, supra, </em>an account was taken of rents, profits, &amp;c., but no question was raised in that case as to the correct mode of adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ment, and the one adopted may have been more favorable to the occupying tenant, than to have charged him with a rent; especially as he was allowed by the express terms of the decree, not only for permanent improvements, and for his expenses and actual services in his successful operations, but also for his expenses, labor and services in the course of his unsuccessful experiments. In <em>Thompson v. </em>Bostick, supra, the rule in question was adopted. \u201c If the whole estate,\u201d said Chancellor Harper, \u201cwere let to tenants, and certain rents reserved, as is commonly the case in England, there would be little difficulty. But what rule shall be adopted when one tenant in common has occupied part of the premises himself ? I know of no other than to estimate the rent of the whole premises, and then to value the rent of that portion of the premises occupied by the tenant in possession, with reference to the condition they were in at the time he took possession.\u201d 1 McMullen\u2019s Equ. R. <em>77.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">There may be peculiar circumstances in a case making it proper to resort to an account of issues, profits, &amp;c., as a mode of adjustment between the tenants in common; and that was perhaps the case in <em>Ruffners </em>v. <em>Lewies ex\u2019ors; </em>but such cases would merely be exceptions to the rule I have laid down, which, I think, is properly applicable to most, if not all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">It applies, I think, with peculiar propriety to this case; in which the occupying tenants, the Friends, had themselves a large interest in' the subject as tenants in common, and were lessees (or one of them at least a lessee) of other large interests therein of other tenants in common, and embarked and were- for many years engaged in a most haz\u00e1rdous operation upon the property, requiring,' for its successful result, the expenditure of a vast amount of labor and of capital, and the exercise of the greatest skill and prudence. During all this period the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>proprietors of the outstanding interests stood aloof, and did not offer to join in the adventure, to contribute to the means of its prosecution, to run the risk of its failure, and take the chance of its successful issue. They cannot now come forward and say, the operation has been successful and they, are entitled to a share of the profits. The most they are entitled to is their share of a reasonable rent. The Friends are accountable for that. Being themselves proprietors of some, and lessees of other, interests in the subject, and occupying and using the whole of it, it is just and right, and what they must have expected and intended, that they should pay a reasonable rent for the outstanding interests. But upon no principle of justice are they bound, to account for issues and profits. Nor could such an account now be settled So as even to approach a correct result. It is no easy matter to keep an account of transactions so extensive, and running through so long a s\u00e9ries of years, and be prepared with proper vouchers for a settlement\u2014 and the Friends were under no obligation to do so. Then they are accountable only for a reasonable rent, and the next question is, How is the amount of such rent to be ascertained <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">In regard to the appellants, I think there can be no difficulty. Mrs. Early\u2019s interest of one-fourth of two-thirds of the property, was leased by her guardian to Thomas B. Friend, at an annual rent of three hundred dollars, for a term of ten years, subject to be determined, after her arrival at age or marriage, at the election of her or her husband. She arrived at age in 1843, \u00e1nd married in 1846, but, as it is averred in the answer of Joseph Friend and not disproved nor denied, neither she nor her husband has \u201cever expressed any wish to ehange the terms of respondent, holding under the lease aforesaid, and hence he has always hitherto regarded himself as holding and occupying under the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>rent reserved.\u201d The lease commenced December 25, 1836, and of course expired, if not determined before by election as aforesaid, December 25,1846. There was no such election to determine it before, and therefore, by its terms, it continued in force until the last mentioned. day. And Joseph Friend having after that day continued to hold and use the property as before, without any objection on the part of Early and wife or her trustee, he might be considered holding, on the terms of the previous lease; according to the authorities cited by his counsel, to wit: 2 Rob. Prac. 378-9 (newed); <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em>79 Eng. C. L. R. 505; <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>36 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. 429. In <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Mumford, </em>10 Wend. R. 351, it was held that the presumption of law, that a tenant who holds over after the expiration of his lease continues to hold under the landlord and on the' terms of the lease, does not apply to a tenant in common who leases the undivided interest of his co-tenant. \u201cThe fact of his not leaving possession,\u201d said the court, \u201cdoes not authorize the inference that he still intends to hold under the lease; on the contrary the presumption is, that he holds under his own title, which gives him a right to the possession and enjoyment of the whole estate, liable however to account to his co-tenants at law, 1 R. S. 90, or in equity 8 Cow. R. 304. This presumption of possession by virtue of his own title may undoubtedly be rebutted, and then he would hold, as to the moiety of his. co-tenant, as any other tenant and subject to the same rules of law.\u201d If there be any such presumption it is rebutted in this case by the express admission of Joseph Friend that after the expiration of the lease \u201che always regarded himself as holding and occupying under the original rent reserved.\u201d I therefore think that the rent for the interest of Mrs. Early during the whole period of the use and occupation of the property by the Friends ought to be at the rate paid by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>In regard to the proprietors of the other outstanding interests, there may he more difficulty. But I think it ought to he presumed, as to them, that the rent agreed to he paid to Mrs. Early, that is three hundred dollars, was a fair and reasonable rent for her interest of one-fourth of two-thirds; which would make the annual rent of the whole property, while in the use and occupation of the Friends, eighteen hundred dollars; and that they ought to be charged with rent at that rate, unless it be proved that a reasonable rent would be more; in which case they ought to be charged with such reasonable rent. I think the Friends ought to pay at least the same rate of rent for the other outstanding interests as for that of Mrs. Early. They derived the same benefit, in proportion, from those interests as from hers; and the fact that they made no contract for the use of the former, is certainly no reason for paying less rent for them than for the latter. They must have expected and intended to pay the same rate of rent to all the other parties interested in the property with themselves as they agreed to pay fpr the interest of Mrs. Early, except the dower interest for which an annual rent of five hundred dollars was agreed to be paid.\u2014 Why less rent in proportion was agreed to be paid for the dower interest than for that of Mrs. Early, does not appear. It may have been because the former interest was determinable at any time by the death of the dowress, while the latter was more permanent. At all events I tlfink the agreed rent of the latter is a fairer criterion than that of the former for the ascertainment of the amount of rent to be paid for the other outstanding interests. I think the proprietors of those interests having made no contract with the Friends or either of them, ought to have the liberty of showing if they can, especially as most of them were infants during the use and occupation of the property by the Friends, that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>reasonably worth more rent in proportion' than what was agreed to be paid for the interest of Mrs. Early.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The Friends being accountable to their co-tenants for a reasonable rent of the property, and not for the issues and profits of their operations thereon, ought to pay interest on the rent of each year from the end of such year until payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Upon the whole I think that so much of the decrees of the Circuit court as is in conflict with the foregoing opinion is erroneous and ought to be reversed, with costs to the appellees, the Friends, as the parties substantially prevailing, and the cause remanded to the Circuit court, to be proceeded in to a final decree according to the principles above declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of' Mow- \u25a0 cube J.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Decrees reversed- <em>in favor of the cuppellees.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
