Smith, administrator of Robert T. Norris deceased, against George Layne, to recover a slave named Tina. Upon the trial the jury found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>a special verdict, and the facts so far as is necessary to show the grounds of this court\u2019s decision are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-4\">Daniel Norris of the county of Nelson died in November 1821, having first made his will which was duly admitted to probate in the County court; and Christopher T. Estes qualified as executor thereof. The testator left a widow, Constance P. Norris, and Robert T. Norris, his only child, an infant under twenty-one years of age.\u2014 By his will Daniel Norris left a woman named Franky to his widow for her life; and directed that she should then be free; and that the widow should be decently maintained during her life or widowhood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-5\">A few days after the qualification of the executor, he placed in the possession of Mrs. Norris, Eranky and another slave Judith who had been left to Mrs. Norris until she attained the age of twenty-one years, and the four small children of Franky, for whose support the executor was to pay her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">In October 1825 Mrs. Norris renounced the provision made for her by the will of her husband; but the estate was not divided, and dower was not assigned to her; and she continued to hold the women put into her possession ; and the executor allowed her to have other slaves of the estate from time to time, and furnished her with other aid for her support. She held the slave Franky in her possession from February 1825 until 1833 or 1831, when she sold her life estate in her to the defendant George Layne, and delivered her into his possession. The defendant by virtue of the sale and. purchase continued in possession of Franky until the death of Mrs. Norris. After the purchase and before the death of Mrs. Norris, viz: in 1835, Franky became the mother of the slave Tina in the declaration mentioned; and Layne has held uninterrupted possession of Yina from the date-of her birth in 1835, until the institiitionof this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The jury find that Mrs. Norris died in June 1839; that Robert T. Norris came of age some time in the year ' 1831; and died on the 21st of October, 1839, leaving a widow, and an infant daughter who intermarried with the plaintiff Smith in 1850, and attained the age of twenty-one years in 1851. The plaintiff qualified as administrator of\u2019Robert T. Norris on the 21st of .June, 1852, up to which time the estate of Robert T. Norris had remained without a personal representative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-11\">The Circuit court rendered a judgment-upon this verdict in favor of the plaintiff; and thereupon Layne applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment; which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-12\"><em>Garland, </em>for the appellant, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amb\">that Layne\u2019s possession of the slave Tina was adversary from her birth, or at least from the death of Mrs. Norris in June-1839; and therefore plaintiff\u2019s right to recover was barred.\u2014<em>Spotswood </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 139 ; <em>Newby\u2019s adm'r </em>v. <em>Blakey, 3 </em>Id. <em>57; Elam </em>v. <em>Bass's ex'ors, </em>4 Munf. 301; <em>Garland v.

Norris having .died in 0ctq-o ber of the same year, he was not entitled to the possession at any time during his life. And as there was no representative of his estate until the plaintiff qualified in 1852 the time did not begin to run-until that qualification. They relied on 1 Rev. Code of 1819, ch. 104, \u00a7 53, 55, p. 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>They insisted further that Layne having taken possession rightfully under his purchase from Mrs. Norris of her life estate, his continuing to hold after her death was not adversary, until he did some act denying the title of the remainderman. <em>Kitty </em>v.

That here no such act was done; and the special verdict does not find that the possession was adversary ; and the court will presume it was not. <em>Pur. cell </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>4 Gratt. 16; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Snidow, </em>4 Leigh 14.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b255-4\">Moncure J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u2022 This is a supersedeas to a judgment in favor of tlie plaintiff on a special verdict, in an action of detinue brought by Eobert T. Norris\u2019s adm\u2019r against George Layne for a slave named Yina.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The most favorable view which can be taken of the case for the plaintiff, is to suppose that his intestate Eobert T. Norris was entitled to the slave in controversy in remainder at the death of his mother Mrs. Norris, to wit: on the 21st of June, 1839. Supposing him to have <em>then </em>become entitled to the possession of the slave, the only question is, whether he and his personal representative continued to be so entitled for sixteen years thereafter, and until the institution of the action, in July 1855?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">At the death of Mrs. Norris, the defendant Layne, who had purchased her life estate in Franky, the mother of Yina, who was born after the purchase, was in possession of Yina, and has ever since remained in such possession. The action of the remainderman Eobert T. Norris <em>then </em>accrued, and not having been instituted for more than-five years thereafter, it would have' been barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>act of limitations, if it liad been pleaded. And wherever the act of limitations would be a bar to an action for property, it gives to the defendant such a title to the property as enables him'to maintain his defence under the general issue, and would even enable him to maintain an action for the property. 1 Rob. Pr. (new) 506, citing 3 H. &amp; M. 57; <em>4 </em>Id. 139; <em>4 </em>Munf. 301; Id. 501; 5 Craneh 358; 11 Wheat. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">But it was contended by the counsel for Robert T. Norris\u2019s adm\u2019r, that Mrs. Norris, the life tenant, having died after the 1st day of March, to wit: on the 21st day of June 1839, her assignee Layne was entitled to the possession of Yina until the end of the year 1839, under sections 53 and 55, or one of them, of ch. 10\u00e9, 1 R. 0 , 1819, p. 388. And that Robert T. Norris having died before the end of the year, to wit: on the 21st of October 1839, and having no personal representative until within five years before the action was instituted, it would not have been barred by the act of limitations, and therefore the defendant did not acquire title to the property by his possession thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The answer to this argument is, that the case falls under neither of the categories created by these two sections. The 53d section applies to slaves employed in making a crop; the 55th, to slaves let or hired to another. The slave in controversy was, at the death of Mrs. Norris, neither \u201cemployed in making a crop,\u201d n'or \u201clet or hired to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">It was further contended that a particular tenant who continues to hold the property after the expiration of the particular estate, if not regarded as a fiduciary in reference to the remainderman, will yet not be considered as holding adversely to him, at least until after demand made, or the lapse of a reasonable time for the delivery of the property; and therefore that the defendant did not hold the slave Yina adversely to Robert T. Norris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>at the time of his death, which was only four months after that of his mother. Bo that, in that view, the action, having been brought within five years after the \" \u25a0qualification of a personal representative of Eobert T. Norris, was brought in due time.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">There is no fiduciary relation between the particular tenant and remainderman after the termination of the particular estate. And if the particular tenant continues to hold and enjoy the property thereafter, he will be considered as holding it adversely to the remainderman unless it be shown affirmatively that he holds it by his authority or permission. He will not be considered as tenant at will or at sufferance of the remainderman, but is like any other person who wrongfully holds and enjoys the property of another. His case is very different from that of a lessee, holding over after the expiration of the lease; in which case, the law implies a tenancy from year to year, on the terms of the lease, as being consonant alike to the justice of the cuse and the presumed intention of the parties. In the case of a particular tenant holding over after the right of possession of the remainderman accrues, there is no foundation, in any prior contract of the parties, for such an implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Lastly it was contended that the possession of the defendant should have been expressly found in the special verdict to have been adverse to the title of the plaintiff, and cannot be inferred to have been so from the facts therein found.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Such adverse possession is, in effect, found in the special verdict. It expressly finds that the defendant \u201cheld uninterrupted possession of the slave in controversy from the date of her birth in 1835 until the institution of the suit,\u201d which was in 1855 ; and it does not find that such possession was by authority or permission of the plaintiff or his intestate, nor any fact from which such authority or permission can, however remotely, be inferred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>According to the facts found, the law of the case is for the defendant; and certainly the court will not presume ' the existence of other facts not found which would make the law of the case otherwise. It will rather presume, in favor of the verdict, that all the material facts of the case were therein found. Possession is the <em>indicium </em>of title to personal property, and when found Toy a special verdict to be in a defendant, the law infers it to be adverse, in the absence of any finding to the contrary. Although if is an inflexible rule that the court upon a special verdict cannot infer other facts from those found, yet it is the province of the court to make all legal inferences from the facts found in the verdict. 1 Bob. Pr. (old) 373 and cases cited; 3 Munf. 1; 5 Leigh 615; 4 Id. 37; 11 Id. 281; 4 Gratt. 16. The cases relied on in the argument to show that the possession of the defendant must be found in the verdict to be adverse or will not be inferred by the court to be so, are not in conflict with the principle as above laid down. <em>Williams </em>v <em>Snidow, </em>4 Leigh 14, and <em>Purcell, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>4 Gratt. 16, were referred to-. Both of these cases were writs of right, and according to the facts found in each, the possession of the defendant was clearly not adverse. In the former, an executory contract for the sale of land was rescinded by mutual consent of parties, and while the vendee remained in possession thereafter, without paying any rent and without pretence of title, the original vendor conveyed the land to the intermediate vendor, and the question was, whether the deed operated to pass the legal title to the land; in other words, whether such possession was adversary to the grantor; and the court held that it was not. The latter, was an action brought by one coparcener against another or the assignee of another, and the possession of the defendant was held not to be adverse, the verdict not having found an actual disseisin or ous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ter of the demandant nor facts which in law constitute such actual disseisin or ouster. See also <em>Pownal </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 Leigh 172, which admits of a similar explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">These cases depend on this principle; that a possession not adversary in its commencement will be presumed not to be adversary in its continuance, unless and until the presumption be repelled by proof that the party in possession claimed to hold adversely to the other party and with his knowledge. But the principle does not apply to this case. Here the possession of the defendant was adversary in its commencement; that is after the right of possession of the remainderman accrued. Hntil then the defendant held under his own title, and he never at any time held under the title of the remainderman.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The judgment of the Circuit court is reversed and judgment rendered on the special verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Judgment reversed, and entered for the defendant below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
