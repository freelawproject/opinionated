White, of the county of Caroline, died about the year 1856, leaving a widow and four infant children, and possessed of a\u2019large -real estate of eleven hundred and fifty acres, some forty slaves, and stock, farming implements, &amp;c., suitable for such an estate, hank stock, &amp;c. Woodson Wright qualified as adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>trator upon the estate, and acted as such until his health failed, and he was succeeded by P. L. Marye. Mrs. White qualified as guardian of her children, and acted as such for the eldest of them, John B. White, until he came of age in 1860. She was removed from the guardianship of the others, of two of whom William S. Barton became the guardian, and Charles Herndon became the guardian of the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">In August 1860 John B. White filed his bill in the Circuit court of Caroline county, in which he states that Mrs. White is entitled to dower in the real estate of her late husband, and that the children are each entitled to a fourth thereof. That though the estate is a large one, yet from its peculiar position dower cannot be allotted to the widow, nor partition made among the children without great injury to the parties; and that their interest will be promoted by a sale of the entire subject, and the assignment of dower and distribution of the proceeds of sale according to the rights of the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">He further states that an equal division of the slaves in kind according to the rights of the parties cannot be made, and that for other causes, a sale of the slaves should be made and the proceeds of sale divided. But if the court should be of opinion that Mrs. White is entitled to have her third in kind,he asks that this third maybe assigned to her; and the other two-thirds sold, and the proceeds of sale distributed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The guardians of the infant defendants were appointed guardians <em>ad litem </em>to defend them in this suit; and they filed answers concurring in the opinion expressed in the bill, that partition of the real estate could not be conveniently made, and that the interest of the parties would be promoted by a sale. And they also concur in the opinion that a sale of the slaves would be for the interest of the infants. They also state that among the slaves to be sold or divided are three named Billy, Jim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Carter, tire offspring of a -woman named Nancy, which are claimed by Mrs. \"White as her separate property, by gift by deed from her brother Lawrence Battaile, Jr.; but which they insist became the property of her husband upon her marriage with him. This deed is filed with the answers; and by it Lawrence Battaile, Jr., in March 1827, conveys to trustees Nancy and her two children John and George and her future increase, in trust for the benefit of his mother Ann Hay Battaile, for her life, and after her death to \u201cAnn Champ Battaile, (Mrs. White) and the heirs of her body forever. But should the said Ann Champ Battaile die without heir or heirs of her body, in that case\u201d he gives the said slaves and the increase of Nancy, to his niece Sarah Bobinson Battaile ; -with a further limitation over upon the death of the latter without heir or heirs of her body.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">Mi\u2019s. White demurred to the bill, for want of equity; \u2022and answered claiming her dower in the land and her one-third of the slaves, in kind; and objected to a decree for the sale of either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\">A number of witnesses were examined as to the difficulty of assigning the widow her dower in the land, and dividing the remainder among the heirs; all of whom expressed a very decided opinion that such assignment and partition of the' land would be very injurious to the parties; and they state the grounds of their opinion.\u2014 They also express the opinion that it would be for the interest of the infants that the slaves should be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">The cause came on. to be heard in September 1860, when the court overruling the demurrer of Mrs. White, and being of opinion from the evidence, that partition of the real estate could not be conveniently made in kind without.a serious diminution in its value, and that the interest of the parties interested would be^ promoted by a sale; appointed commissioners to sell the land. And not deciding for the present whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>limitation over of tlie slave Nancy and lier increase upon tlie death of Mrs. White without issue, was void or not, the court appointed other commissioners to allot to Mrs. White one-third of the slaves in value of which her husband died possessed, if such partition could be made.\u2014 And the cause was removed to the Circuit court of Spottsylvania county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">The commissioners appointed to assign to Mrs. \"White her share of the slaves, made their report; from which it appeared that they had assigned to her two of the descendants of Nancy. And in October 1860 the cause came on again to be heard, when the court confirmed the report; and it appearing to the court that the limitation over of the slaves Billy and Carter descendants of Nancy, allotted to the widow, cannot possibly take effect until after the death of the widow, and declining to decide whether the said limitation is valid or not, the commissioners therein after appointed to sell the slaves remaining after the allotment of her third to the widow, were directed to invest the proceeds of the sale of the slave Jim in Virginia State stock to await the further order of the court. And commissioners were appointed and directed to sell the slaves remaining which were owned by the plaintiff and the infant defendants in common, and the perishable estate either at public or private sale, as they should think best; and after paying the expenses of said sale and tlie costs of the suit, to pay over the nett proceeds, to the complainant and the guardians of the infants; one-fourth to each of the infants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">From this decree in the cause Mrs. \"White applied to this court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>R. T. </em>Daniel, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-7\"><em>Barton </em>and <em>Herndon, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-8\">Lee J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVS\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The court is of opinion that as it is not made to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>pear that it was impossible to assign to the appellant her dower of and in the real estate of her husband, it was not competent for the court of equity, in the exercise of its general power, to decree a sale of the whole property, and to provide a compensation in money to the appellant in lieu of her dower, against her will and without her consent, however much it might be to the interest of the heirs at law of the decedent to have a sale of the whole estate and a monied compensation allowed to the appellant, instead of a sale of two-thirds of the estate and the remainder in the life estate of the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">And the court is further of opinion, that a widow entitled to dower in the estate of her deceased husband, is neither a joint-tenant, coparcener, nor tenant in common with the heirs at law, within the meaning of the statute concerning partition, in the Code of Virginia; and that therefore no power is conferred by that statute upon the court of equity to sell the whole estate against her will and without her consent, and compel her to receive a monied compensation out of the proceeds in lieu of her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">And the court is further of opinion, that whether the limitation in the deed of the said Lawrence Battaile, Jr. of the 19th of March, 1827, was a good executory limitation over or the contrary, (as to which the court deems it unnecessary to express any opinion,) yet that the said deed did not create a separate estate for the sole and exclusive use of the appellant; but that the marital rights of her husband attached upon such interest as she took under the said deed, and that such interest should be disposed of as the other personal estate of the said Edmund P. White deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">And the court is further of opinion that if there was other perishable personal estate of the said Edmund P. WTiite, besides the said slaves, as seems to be contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>plated by the said decree, the failure of the appellant to make any express claims to the same, did not bar her right to an interest therein; and that the Circuit coui\u2019t should have respected her right to a distributable share thereof, and not directed the whole proceeds of the sale of the same to be paid over to the children of the said Edmund P. White deceased, to her exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Thus the court is of opinion that the said decrees are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Therefore l'eversed with costs, and cause remanded, with directions to proceed in the same according to the principles hereinbefore declared, and further as justice and equity shall require.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Which is ordered to be certified, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Decrees reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
