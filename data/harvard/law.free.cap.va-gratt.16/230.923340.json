A sick man receives a sum of money in bank notes which he hands to his wife for safe keeping until he should get well enough to put them in hank; and he dies a few days after. After his death his executor applies to the widow for the bank notes which she refuses to deliver to him, saying she intends to keep them. He sues her in assumpsit for the money, and the declaration contains only the common counts.

If it was necessary to sue as executor, as the declaration commenced in the name of B as executor of the testator, though it alleged that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff and promised to pay to the plaintiff, yet, in support of the justice of the case, it may he construed as a declaration in the plaintiff\u2019s character of executor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">This was an action of assumpsit in the Circuit court of the county of Alexandria, by Thomas A. Brewis, executor of John Lawson deceased, against Isabella Lawson. The declaration contained only the common counts, and whilst it commenced in the name of Thomas A. Brewis, executor of John Lawson, it charged that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, and promised to pay the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">The defendant pleaded <em>\u201cnon </em>assumpsitand on the trial demurred to the evidence. That evidence was that on the 3d day of June, 1851, T. A. Brewis, the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>came to the room where John Lawson, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, was sick in bed, and counted out to him a sum of money, upwards of six hundred dollars, in notes, and asked Lawson if he (Brewis) should carry the money back to the store. That Lawson said \u201cHo, he would be better after a while, and would then arrange it for the bank.\u201d Lawson then handed the money to his wife, the defendant, and told her to put it aside until he felt better, and that he would arrange it for the bank. That John Lawson died on the 18th of June, 1851; and that between that date and the time when Brewis qualified as executor of the estate of Lawson, Brewis asked Mrs. Lawson for the money which he handed to John Lawson, and Mrs. Lawson refused to give it to him, saying she intended to keep it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">There was \u2022 a verdict for $569.85, with interest from the 19th of June, 1851, until paid, subject to the demurrer to evidence; and upon the demurrer the court below gave a j udgnient for the defendant. \u25a0 \"Whereupon Brewis applied to this court for a <em>swpersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A93\"><em>Brent </em>and Kinzer, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>F.

It remained in her possession during his life, and at his death, which took place a few days after, it was still his property. She made no claim to it as hprs, during his life, nor, so far as appears, did she dispose of any part of it to her own use 'or that of her husband. After his death the plaintiff, though before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>he had qualified as executor under the will of his testator, called oil the defendant for the money, but- she re-fr18*3^to surrender it, saying that she intended to keep it.</p>\n<p id=\"A6b\">Kowas this money was part of the assets of the estate of the testator, it is clear that the plaintiff is entitled to recover it in some form of action, and in some character either individual or representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">But it is said that if the plaintiff he entitled to recover,, he cannot do go in this action, hut should have declared on the special case-, or in trover and conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">I do not think the plaintiff was- bound to declare specially. The action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money had and' received will lie whenever one has the money of another which he has no right to retain, but which <em>ex cequo et </em>bono, he should pay over to that other: This action has of late yearn been greatly extended, because founded on principles of justice ; and it now embraces all cases in which the plaintiff has equity and conscience on his side, and the defendant is bound by ties of natural justice and equity to- refund the money. In s-ueh a case, no express promise need be proved, because from sucli relation between the parties the law will imply a debt and give this action founded on the equity of the plaintiff\u2019s case, as it were upon a contract, <em>quasi ex eontraetu </em>as the Homan law expresses it, and upon this debt founds- the requisite undertaking to pay. <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Macfarlan, </em>2 Burr. R. 1005, 1008, 1012; Per Butler J., <em>Straton </em>v. <em>Rastall, </em>2 T. R. 366, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Here this money was part of the assets of the plaintiff\u2019s testator, and it was the duty of the defendant <em>ex ceqv,o&gt; et bono, to pay </em>it o-ver to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Kor do I think the plaintiff was bound to declare in <em>trover </em>and conversion. The money handed to the defendant by the testator was in bank n-otes, and if it be-conceded that upon the refusal of the defendant to- deliver the same to the plaintiff, trover might be-maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>as for a <em>tort, </em>it by no means follows that <em>assumpsit </em>could not be brought. There are many cases in which a party aggrieved who has a clear remedy by action as for a <em>tort, </em>may waive the <em>tort </em>and sue in assumpsit. Thus an action against a common carrier is for a <em>tort </em>and supposed crime, but <em>asszwipsit </em>will lie for the same cause. Per Lord Mansfield, <em>Hambly </em>v. <em>Trott, </em>Cowp. R. 371, 375.\u2014 So if a man takes a horse from another, and brings him back again, an. action of trespass may be brought, but the owner may bring assumpsit for the use and hire of the horse. <em>Ibid. </em>If a bankrupt, on the ev\u00e9 of his bankruptcy, fraudulently deliver goods to one of his creditors, the assignees may recover the goods in trover, or waive the tort and bring assumpsit. <em>Smith, &amp;c., </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>4 T. R 211. If a stranger takes my goods and delivers them to another a contract may be implied, and I may bring an action of trover for them or of assumpsit to recover their value. Per Lord Abinger, <em>Bassell </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>10 Mees. &amp; Welsh. 350. In this case it was decided that the assignees of a bankrupt who after the bankruptcy had delivered goods to the defendant to meet an accommodation bill which they were about to give the bankrupt, might waive the <em>tort </em>and sue in assumpsit. So a master whose apprentice has left him and entered into the service of another, who persuades him to remain with him after he had found out who he was and from what shop he had deserted, may waive the <em>tort </em>and bring assumpsit against the defendant for the work and labor of the apprentice. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Stewart, 3 </em>Maule &amp; Selw. 191. See also <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>Comb. R. 450; <em>Eades </em>v. <em>Vandeput, </em>5 Easts R. 39; <em>Lightly </em>v. <em>Clowston, </em>1 Taunt, R. 112. So if a man take the goods of another aiid sell them, the owner may waive the trespass and sue him for money had and received. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>12 Pick. R. 120; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Stewart, 3 </em>Maule &amp; Selw. 191. See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>5 Pick. R. 285.\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Other illustrations may be derived from the cases, but I will not stop to give them. I think that in no case could ex6rcise of the right to elect between an action in <em>tort </em>and assumpsit be more appropriate than in this.\u2014 The bank notes were received and treated by the testator as money, and as such were received and retained by the defendant, and though trover might lie to recover the notes, the law will imply a promise to pay the amount to. the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">It is said however that the plaintiff can only recover in his character of executor, and that here he has\u201d not declared as executor but in his individual character.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The cause of action here accrued after the death of the testator. He had and could have, no cause of action against his wife, but her. retention of the money gave to the plaintiff an action to recover it as part of the assets of the estate of his testator. And although the demand by the plaintiff was before his qualification as executor, yet the refusal to pay was not upon that ground but because she intended to keep the money as her own; and as she continued to keep it until after the plaintiff\u2019s qualification as executor, his right to sue accrued immediately upon his qualification. How where, an executor sues in respect of a cause of action which accrued in' the lifetime of the deceased, he must declare in his representative character. But where the cause of action accrued after the death of the testator, if the money recovered will be assets, the executor may declare in his representative character or in his own name. <em>Mowry </em>v. Adams, 14 Mass. R. 327; <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>14 Pet. R. 33. But if necessary, the declaration may, I think, in support of the justice of the case, be considered as a declaration in the plaintiff\u2019s character as execxitor. The Circuit court so thought, for the judgment for costs against the plaintiff directed them to be levied of the assets of his testator. The plaintiff declared as executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of John Lawson, and the other allegations referring to him may reasonably be considered as referring to him in his character of executor; and upon the demurrer to evidence, I think, they should be so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">1 think the Circuit court erred in rendering judgment for the defendant, instead of for the plaintiff upon the demurrer to evidence, and the same should be reversed and judgment now rendered for-the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Lee J.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Judgment reversed; and entered for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
