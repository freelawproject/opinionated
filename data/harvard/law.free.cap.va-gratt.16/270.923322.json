II. Ferguson and others filed their petition in the County court of Halifax county contesting the election of James R West, as sheriff of the county. The proceeding was in form according to. the act of April 22,1852, ch. 71; and West having appeared to maintain his election, the case was heard by the County court at its August term, when the court adjudged and declared that West was duly elected sheriff of the county of Halifax for the term prescribed by law; to commence on the first of the next January: and then proceeded to render a judgment against the petitioners for the defendant\u2019s costs. The petitioners thereupon applied to the judge of the Circuit court of Halifax for a writ of prohibition to stay the enforcement of the j udgment for costs'. Hpon this petition a rule was made directing West and the County court to show Gause why the writ of prohibition should not he awarded. Arid at the October term of the court the case came on to be heard when the court made the rule absolute, and prohibited the defendant West from further proceedings to enforce the judgment for costs against the petitioners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>To this judgment West applied to this court for a <em>sv$ei sedeas </em>which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-4\"><em>Macfarland </em>and Roberts, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Read, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-6\">Robertson, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZt\">Costs were not recoverable at common law. It is true that in actions in which damages were given the costs of the plaintiff were in reality considered and included in the <em>qumitum </em>of damages, and he thus indirectly recovered his costs, or their equivalent. But he could not do this in actions in which no damages were given; and the defendant could not, in any case whatever, recover his costs, either directly or indirectly.\u2014 It is by virtue of statute law alone that any judgment for costs, <em>eo </em>nomine, can be rendered in favor of either party. 3 Black. Comm. 399; Com. Dig. Tit. Costs; Viner\u2019s Abr. Tit. Costs; 1 Rob. Prac. (old ed.) 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u25a0The act under which the proceedings in this case were had (acts 1852 ch. 71) provides that the returns of the elections of sheriffs, and of certain other officers, \u201cshall be subject to the enquiry, determination and judgment of the respective county and corporation courts,\u201d and that \u201cthe said courts shall in judging of said elections, proceed upon the merits thereof, and shall determine finally concerning the same according to the constitution and laws of tins commonwealth\u201d; but no authority is given by it to said courts to render any judgment for costs. If such authority exists it must be found in some statute conferring upon the courts general power over the subject of costs. The only enactments having any bearing on the question under consideration, are to be found in sections 4 and 8 of chapter 185 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The fourth section authorizes the court, \u201cupon any motion (other than for a judgment for money), or upon any interlocutory order or proceeding,\u201d to \u201cgive or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fuse costs, at its discretion, unless it be otherwise pro-<em>i </em>Vlded.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">The eighth section declares that, \u201cexcept where it is otherwise provided, the party for whom final judgment is given in any action, or in a motion for judgment for money, whether he be plaintiff or defendant, shall recover his costs against the opposite party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Unless the proceedings under the statute of 1852, in the case of a contested election, can be considered as a \u201cmotion,\u201d or an \u201caction,\u201d or an \u201cinterlocutory order or proceeding,\u201d it is clear that they are not embraced by either of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">They certainly do not fall within the terms \u201cinterlocutory order or proceeding\u201d ; and it seems equally clear that they are neither a \u201cmotion,\u201d nor an \u201caction.\u201d These words have a well understood technical meaning, and cannot, by any stretch of construction, be made to embrace such proceedings as are directed to be had in cases of contested elections. These proceedings are novel and peculiar in their character, and seem designed rather for the purpose of ascertaining, on behalf of the public, who has been duly elected, than of enabling rival candidates to litigate, on their own behalf, the question of right to an office. Ho contest can be commenced unless complaint of an undue election, or false return, is made by fifteen or more of the qualified voters, two of whom must make oath or affirmation to the truth of the facts stated in the complaint. This must be filed in the Clerk\u2019s office within ten days after the election, and the party whose election is contested must within ten days after the complaint, be served with a copy of it. The defeated candidate, who is the only other party who can be supposed to have any personal interest in the matter, cannot, at his own pleasure, enter upon the contest; and it may be commenced and prosecuted without his knowledge, or against his wish. He is not a necessary party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>in any stage of the proceedings. Indeed the complaint may be made and the election set aside when there has been no candidate except the one whose election is contested. In this case the defeated candidate was not one of the complainants, and the only thing in the record from vvhieh his name is to be ascertained is the statement, to be found in the decision of the court, of the number of illegal votes upon his poll.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Proceedings like these cannot be regarded as a \u201cmotion,\u201d or an \u201caction,\u201d within the purview of the statutes regulating costs between parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Frivolous contests are guarded against by the requirement of an affidavit as to the truth of the complaint, by the number of complainants necessary to commence a contest, and the trouble and expense to which they must be subjected in prosecuting it. These safeguards are sufficient without superadding a liability for costs to the party whose election is contested. Such liability would operate as an undue discouragement to the institution of a contest in which the whole community is as much interested as the complainants. The refusal to give costs to either party seems to be the best mode of avoiding the discouragement of proper contests on the one hand, and the encouragement of frivolous ones on the other. But whether this be so or not, it is enough for us to know that the legislature has not authorized any judgment for costs to be given in sueh eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The County court in rendering such judgment exceeded its jurisdiction, and a writ of prohibition was a proper proceeding to arrest the execution of said judgment for want of authority in the County court to render the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In this view of the case it is not necessary to decide the question which has been raised as to the right of two &lt;of the members of the County court to act as justices.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The judgment of the Circuit court must he affirmed, with costs and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"A2h\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Robertjo j.
