Defendant was also convicted of two counts of armed robbery, MCL 750.529, and four counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b. Defendant appealed, asserting that his convictions for both first-degree felony murder and armed robbery violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. The Court of Appeals concluded that there was no evidence that defendant had committed the separate offenses of robbery and larceny and therefore held that defendant\u2019s armed robbery convictions violated double jeopardy. As a result, the Court of Appeals vacated defendant\u2019s two convictions and sentences for armed robbery and the accompanying convictions for felony-firearm. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued December 27, 2005 (Docket No. 257353). We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in its double jeopardy analysis by comparing the felony-murder convictions to the non-predicate felonies of armed robbery. Because armed robbery was not the predicate felony involved in the instant felony-murder convictions, reversal is not required pursuant to <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328; 308 NW2d 112 (1981). We further conclude that the language \u201csame offense\u201d in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the same thing in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of the Double Jeopardy Clause as it does in the context of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand addressed by the Court in <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565; 677 NW2d 1 (2004). We therefore hold that <em>Blockburger </em>sets forth the proper test to determine when multiple punishments are barred on double jeopardy grounds. Because each of the crimes for which defendant here was convicted, first-degree felony murder and armed robbery, has an element that the other does not, they are not the \u201csame offense\u201d and, therefore, defendant may be punished for each. Accordingly, we reverse the part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals that vacated the armed robbery convictions and sentences and two of the felony-firearm convictions and sentences, and remand this case to the trial court to reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences for armed robbery and the accompanying felony-firearm convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">At approximately 10:30 a.m. on January 7, 2003, a customer entering the City Tire store in Pontiac discovered the bodies of store employee Stephen Putman and store owner Richard Cummings. Putman had died of a gunshot wound to the neck and Cummings had died from two gunshot wounds to the head. The police determined that $2,000 in cash that Cummings brought to the store from home to use in the store\u2019s cash register was missing, as were the store\u2019s proceeds from that morning. In addition, Pontiac police officers interviewed the victims\u2019 families and determined that both Putman\u2019s and Cummings\u2019s wallets were missing and that the money Cummings carried in his front pocket was also missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>On January 8, 2004, the police received a call from Tywanda Smith, defendant\u2019s wife, who informed them that defendant confessed to her that he had committed the murders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith testified that defendant told her that he first asked \u201cthe young guy [Putman]\u201d for the money but that \u201cthe young guy acted like he didn\u2019t know what [defendant] was talking about and [defendant] shot him.\u201d Defendant then asked the \u201cold guy [Cummings]\u201d where the money was, and Cummings responded, \u201cWhat do you think you are going to do? You going to rob me?\u201d Cummings then hit defendant on the hand with an unknown object and defendant responded by shooting Cummings twice in the head. Defendant then admitted that, after the shootings, he took money and a set of keys from the store, but did not take any vehicle. Defendant also told Smith that the police had no evidence implicating him in the murders because he threw the gun into the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Defendant was prosecuted for two counts of first-degree felony murder, with larceny as the predicate felony, two counts of armed robbery, and four counts of felony-firearm. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted on all charges. He appealed, contending that his convictions for two counts of felony murder and two counts of armed robbery committed during the course of the murders constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution. The Court of Appeals undertook its analysis by noting that larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>there was no evidence that defendant committed the separate offenses of robbery and larceny. Slip op at 2. On that basis, the Court of Appeals concluded that armed robbery, not larceny, was the predicate felony for the instant felony-murder convictions and, therefore, that it was bound by <em>Wilder </em>to reverse the armed robbery convictions as well as the accompanying felony-firearm convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 475 Mich 864 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A double jeopardy challenge presents a question of constitutional law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 states that \u201c[n]o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The primary goal in interpreting a constitutional provision is to determine the text\u2019s meaning to the ratifiers, the people, at the time of ratification. <em>Wayne Co v Hathcock, </em>471 Mich 445, 468; 684 NW2d 765 (2004). Justice COOLEY described this principle of constitutional interpretation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>A constitution is made for the people and by the people. The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. \u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d [Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations (Little, Brown, &amp; Co, 1886), p 81 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The Double Jeopardy Clause affords individuals \u201cthree related protections: (1) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 574. The first two protections are generally understood as the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand of double jeopardy, while the third protection is commonly understood as the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">A. \u201cSAME OFFENSE\u201d FOR SUCCESSIVE PROSECUTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Before 1973, the Court consistently construed Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause in a manner consistent with the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. See, e.g., <em>In re Ascher, </em>130 Mich 540, 545; 90 NW 418 (1902) (stating that \u201cthe law of jeopardy is doubtless the same under both [the federal and Michigan constitutions]\u201d);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>People v Schepps, </em>231 Mich 260, 267; 203 NW 882 (1925) (quoting <em>Ascher </em>for the proposition that the Court is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the view of double jeopardy protections set forth by federal courts); <em>People v Bigge, </em>297 Mich 58, 64; 297 NW 70 (1941) (holding that \u201c[t]his State is committed to the view upon the subject of former jeopardy adopted by the Federal courts under the Federal Constitution\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In <em>People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267; 183 NW 177 (1921), the Court addressed the issue whether a defendant\u2019s conviction in municipal court of driving an automobile while intoxicated served as a bar to a subsequent prosecution for manslaughter arising out of the same drunken driving incident. We began our analysis by noting that under the federal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment, a defendant who commits two or more separate offenses during a single criminal transaction may be prosecuted for each, as long as the offenses are different. <em>Id. </em>at 275, citing <em>Gavieres v United States, </em>220 US 338; 31 S Ct 421; 55 L Ed 489 (1911). To determine whether two offenses are the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes, the Court cited the \u201csame elements\u201d test articulated by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in <em>Morey v Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass 433, 434 (1871). The <em>Morey </em>rule, which would later be adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blockburger, </em>held that offenses are not the \u201csame offense\u201d if each statute requires proof of an element that the other does not. The Court concluded that the misdemeanor offense of driving an automobile while intoxicated was not the \u201csame offense\u201d as involuntary manslaughter and therefore affirmed the subsequent conviction. <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Thus, before 1973, the Court had construed Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause in a manner consistent with the interpretation of the Fifth Amendment by federal courts, <em>Ascher, supra </em>and held that the test for determining whether offenses are the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes was whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Townsend, supra. </em>However, in <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973), the Court abandoned this traditional understanding, and instead adopted the \u201csame transaction\u201d test for the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand of double jeopardy. Shortly thereafter, in <em>People v Cooper, </em>398 Mich 450, 461; 247 NW2d 866 (1976), the Court also abandoned the federal approach to successive prosecutions by different sovereigns in favor of a rule under which successive prosecutions could only proceed if \u201cit appears from the record that the interests of the State of Michigan and the jurisdiction which initially prosecuted are substantially different.\u201d Finally, in <em>Robideau, </em>the Court declined to adhere to the <em>Blockburger </em>test in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy in favor of a rule intended to ascertain whether the Legislature intended to impose multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In <em>Nutt, </em>the Court granted leave to appeal to determine whether <em>White\u2019s </em>interpretation of the language \u201csame offense\u201d in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 was consistent with the people\u2019s understanding when they ratified the constitution. We undertook our analysis by noting that <em>White\u2019s </em>creation of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test was inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201coffense\u201d as a \u201ccrime\u201d or \u201ctransgression.\u201d <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 588. Moreover, and most critically, we concluded that <em>White\u2019s </em>test was inconsistent with the understanding of the term \u201csame offense\u201d on the part of the ratifiers of our constitution. First, we noted that the framers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>constitution recognized that the Court had interpreted the double jeopardy provision of the 1908 Constitution in a manner consistent with the federal constitution. Second, we quoted the Address to the People, 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3364, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201c[Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15] is a revision of Sec. 14, Article II, of the present constitution. The new language of the first sentence involves the substitution of the double jeopardy provision from the U.S. Constitution in place of the present provision which merely prohibits \u2018acquittal on the merits.\u2019 This is more consistent with the actual practice of the courts in Michigan.\u201d <em>[Nutt, supra </em>at 590.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In other words, when the people ratified Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, they were advised that \u201c(1) the double jeopardy protection conferred by our 1963 Constitution would parallel that of the federal constitution, and (2) that the proposal was meant to bring our double jeopardy provision into conformity with what this Court had already determined it to mean.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 590. In 1963, the federal Double Jeopardy Clause permitted successive prosecutions for all crimes committed during a single \u201ctransaction,\u201d as long as each crime required proof of a fact that the other did not. <em>Blockburger, supra </em>at 304. The <em>Nutt </em>Court noted that the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201c \u2018focuses on the statutory elements of the offense. If each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>withstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 576 (citation omitted). Because the \u201csame transaction\u201d test set forth in <em>White </em>is inconsistent with the federal approach, it is also inconsistent with the understanding of the ratifiers and, as a result, was overruled. <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 591-592.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In <em>People v Davis, </em>472 Mich 156; 695 NW2d 45 (2005), the Court granted leave to appeal to determine whether the rule announced by <em>Cooper </em>for determining whether successive prosecutions by different sovereigns were barred on double jeopardy grounds was consistent with the meaning of \u201csame offense\u201d set forth in the constitution. We undertook our analysis by noting <em>Nutt\u2019s </em>conclusion that the ratifiers of our constitution intended that Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause be construed consistently with Michigan precedent and the Fifth Amendment. At the time of ratification, the federal courts held that prosecution by one sovereign does not preclude a subsequent prosecution by a different sovereign based on the same act, where \u201c \u2018by one act [the defendant] has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartkus v Illinois, </em>359 US 121, 132; 79 S Ct 676; 3 L Ed 2d 684 (1959) (citation omitted); see also <em>Heath v Alabama, </em>474 US 82, 88; 106 S Ct 433; 88 L Ed 2d 387 (1985). The rule set forth in <em>Cooper </em>was based on the Court\u2019s detection of a trend in federal cases that brought <em>Bartkus </em>into disrepute. However, we recognized in <em>Davis </em>that this \u201ctrend\u201d never came to fruition and, in fact, the United States Supreme Court validated the <em>Bartkus </em>reasoning in <em>Heath. </em>Therefore, in accord with the understanding that Michigan\u2019s double jeopardy provision should \u201cbe construed consistently with the federal double jeopardy jurisprudence that then existed,\u201d we overruled <em>Cooper </em>in <em>Davis, supra </em>at 168, and held that a defendant who commits one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>criminal act that violates the laws of two different sovereigns has committed two criminal acts for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In sum, offenses do not constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d for purposes of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand of double jeopardy if each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">B. \u201cSAME OFFENSE\u201d FOR MULTIPLE PUNISHMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"ARC\">X. PRE-X963 CASELAW</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">At issue in this case is whether \u201csame offense\u201d has the same meaning in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy as it does in the context of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand. Pursuant to <em>Nutt, </em>we first examine Michigan caselaw addressing the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy at the time of the ratification of the 1963 Constitution. While Michigan courts routinely applied the federal standard to the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand, the Court did not address the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand until 1976. <em>Robideau, supra </em>at 481. Therefore, we must examine federal caselaw to determine how the Fifth Amendment was applied in the context of multiple punishments at the time our constitution was ratified. In <em>Blockburger, </em>the defendant was convicted of selling eight grains of morphine hydrochloride outside its original packaging<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and of engaging in that sale without a written order of the purchaser as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>required by the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claimed that because both convictions stemmed from a single narcotics sale, he could lawfully be punished only once for that single act. The United States Supreme Court undertook its analysis by noting that the language of the statutes created two distinct criminal offenses. In order to determine whether a defendant who, by a single act, commits two distinct criminal violations may be punished for both, the United States Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not. <em>Gavieres v. United States, </em>220 U.S. 338, 342 .... In that case this court quoted from and adopted the language of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in <em>Morey v. Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433: \u201cA single act may be an offense against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.\u201d Compare <em>Albrecht v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 1, 11-12[; 47 S Ct 250; 71 L Ed 505 (1927)]<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark>.... <em>[Blockburger, supra </em>at 304.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Because each of the violations of the Harrison Narcotic Act at issue contained an element that the other did not, the United States Supreme Court held that the defendant could be punished for each violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the \u201csame elements\u201d approach to multiple punishments in <em>Gore v United States, </em>357 US 386; 78 S Ct 1280; 2 L Ed 2d 1405 (1958). In <em>Gore, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of selling heroin \u201cnot in pursuance to a written order\u201d of the person receiving the drugs; two counts of dispensing drugs that were not \u201cin the original stamped package or from the original stamped package\u201d; and two counts of facilitating concealment and sale of drugs, with knowledge that the drugs had been unlawfully imported. The defendant argued that the purpose behind each statute was to outlaw the nonmedicinal sale of narcotics and, therefore, Congress desired to punish only for a single offense when these multiple infractions are committed through a single sale. The United States Supreme Court disagreed, noting that, as in <em>Blockburger, </em>Congress\u2019s decision to create three separate criminal violations, each with elements independent of the others, demonstrated that it intended that each violation be punishable separately. The Court went on to characterize the defendant\u2019s argument as a policy argument and opined that such policy matters are better left to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">In effect, we are asked to enter the domain of penology, and more particularly that tantalizing aspect of it, the proper apportionment of punishment. Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, whether one believes in its efficacy or its futility,... these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy. <em>[Id. </em>at 393.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>To summarize, at the time the 1963 Constitution was ratified, the United States Supreme Court had interpreted the language \u201csame offense\u201d in the Fifth Amendment to mean multiple punishments were authorized if \u201c \u2018each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does <em>not Blockburger, supra </em>at 304 (citation omitted). While there was no Michigan caselaw construing the language \u201csame offense\u201d as it applied to the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy, our courts had defined the term \u201csame offense\u201d for purposes of successive prosecutions by applying the federal \u201csame elements\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">2. POST-1963 CASELAW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The Court first addressed the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy in <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303; 247 NW2d 303 (1976). In <em>Martin, </em>the defendant was convicted of both possession and delivery of the same heroin. The Court noted that while a defendant can be charged for each act that constitutes a separate crime, \u201cwhen tried for an act which includes lesser offenses, if the jury finds guilt of the greater, the defendant may not also be convicted separately of the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. The Court found that possession of the heroin was a lesser included offense of its delivery because \u201c[possession of the heroin present in <em>this </em>case was that necessary to its delivery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307 (emphasis in original). In other words, rather than focusing on the elements of the charged offenses, the Court focused on the facts of the particular case. While the Court cited a similar analysis by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>O\u2019Clair v United States, </em>470 F2d 1199, 1203 (CA 1, 1972), it failed even to cite <em>Blockburger, </em>let alone explain why the \u201csame elements\u201d test did not apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Rather, the Court justified its approach by quoting with approval the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine in <em>State v Allen, </em>292 A2d 167, 172 (Me, 1972), which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">The possession of narcotic drugs is an offense distinct from the sale thereof. But in the instant case the possession and sale clearly constituted one single and same act. The possession, as legally defined, is necessarily a constituent part of the sale, as legally defined. Where the only possession of the narcotic drug is that incident to and necessary for the sale thereof, and it does not appear that there was possession before or after and apart from such sale, the State cannot fragment the accused\u2019s involvement into separate and distinct acts or transactions to obtain multiple convictions, and separate convictions under such circumstances will not stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In <em>People v Stewart (On Rehearing), </em>400 Mich 540; 256 NW2d 31 (1977), the Court addressed the similar issue whether a defendant could be punished for the possession and sale of the same narcotic. The Court began its analysis by acknowledging that a defendant may possess a narcotic without selling it and, likewise, may sell a narcotic without possessing it. However, the Court again failed to acknowledge <em>Blockburger </em>and instead applied the fact-based approach of <em>Martin, </em>concluding that \u201cfrom the evidence adduced at this trial, the illegal possession of heroin was obviously a lesser included offense of the illegal sale of heroin. When the jury in the case at bar found the defendant guilty of the illegal sale of this heroin, they necessarily found him guilty of possession of the same heroin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>406 Mich 374; 280 NW2d 793 (1979), the Court addressed the question whether double jeopardy forbade separate convictions and sentences for felony-firearm, MCL 750.227b, and the underlying felony. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>undertook this analysis by noting that the language of MCL 750.227b, defining the offense as a \u201cfelony\u201d and requiring that the two-year sentence must be served \u201cin addition to\u201d the sentence for the underlying felony, demonstrated \u201cthat the Legislature intended to make the carrying of a weapon during a felony a separate crime and intended that cumulative penalties should be imposed.\u201d <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, supra </em>at 391. In order to determine whether such an intention was consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Court then applied the \u201csame elements\u201d test from <em>Blockburger. </em>The Court observed that \u201c[i]n applying the <em>Blockburger </em>rule, the United States Supreme Court has focused on the legal elements of the respective offenses, not on the particular factual occurrence which gives rise to the charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395. Applying <em>Blockburger, </em>the Court then determined that the felony at issue, second-degree murder, contained an element that felony-firearm did not, namely a killing committed with malice, and, likewise, that felony-firearm contained an element that second-degree murder did not, namely that the defendant carried or possessed a firearm during the commission of any felony. Therefore, the Court concluded that the imposition of multiple punishments was not barred on double jeopardy grounds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">However, in <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79; 289 NW2d 674 (1980), the Court reverted to the fact-based approach of <em>Martin </em>and <em>Stewart. </em>In <em>Jankowski, </em>the defendant was convicted of armed robbery, larceny over $100, and larceny in a building as the result of one felonious taking. The Court began its analysis by noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that, unlike in <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, </em>there was no clear intention on the part of the Legislature that the crimes at issue be punished separately. The Court assessed the facts adduced at trial and determined that, because there was only one felonious taking, the larceny convictions constituted lesser offenses to the armed robbery conviction and therefore the larceny convictions were barred by double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Court applied the same reasoning to first-degree felony murder and the predicate felony in <em>Wilder. </em>In <em>Wilder, </em>the defendant was convicted of both armed robbery and first-degree felony murder for a killing committed during the perpetration of that robbery. The Court began its analysis by noting that under the fact-based approach set forth in <em>Martin </em>and <em>Stewart, </em>if \u201cthe proof adduced at trial indicates that one offense is a necessarily or cognate lesser included offense of the other, then conviction of both the offenses will be precluded.\u201d <em>Wilder, supra </em>at 343-344. The Court held that because the evidence required to prove first-degree felony murder also requires proof of the armed robbery, armed robbery is a lesser offense of first-degree felony murder and therefore multiple punishments for each offense were barred by double jeopardy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court went on to explain that its approach to the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy differed from the federal approach set forth in <em>Blockburger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[T]he test concerning multiple punishment under our constitution has developed into a broader protective rule than that employed in the Federal courts. Under Federal authority, the Supreme Court established the \u201crequired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>evidence\u201d test enunciated <em>in Blockburger[, supra]. </em>See also its original expression in <em>Morey v Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass 433 (1871). In <em>Blockburger, </em>the Court outlined their test:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\u201cThe applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>[Blockburger, supra </em>at] 304.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">This approach isolates the elements of the offense as opposed to the actual proof of facts adduced at trial. See <em>Harris[, supra]; United States v Kramer, </em>289 F2d 909, 913 (CA 2, 1961). Under this test, convictions of two criminal offenses arising from the same act are prohibited only when the greater offense necessarily includes all elements of the lesser offense. Accordingly, conviction of both offenses is precluded only where it is impossible to commit the greater offense without first having committed the lesser offense. From the perspective of lesser included offenses, the Supreme Court in cases concerning double jeopardy has thus adhered to the common-law definition of such offenses. See <em>People v Ora Jones </em>[395 Mich 379, 387; 236 NW2d 461 (1975)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">The Federal test in <em>Blockburger </em>can thus be distinguished from this Court\u2019s approach in two principal ways. First, we find the proper focus of double jeopardy inquiry in this area to be the proof of facts adduced at trial rather than the theoretical elements of the offense alone. Proof of facts includes the elements of the offense as an object of proof. Yet, the actual evidence presented may also determine the propriety of finding a double jeopardy violation in any particular case. See <em>[Martin, supra </em>at 309; <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 548; <em>Jankowski, supra </em>at 91].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Second, we have held that double jeopardy claims under our constitution may prohibit multiple convictions involving cognate as well as necessarily included offenses. <em>[Wilder, supra </em>at 348 n 10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Finally, in <em>Robideau, </em>the Court addressed the issue whether double jeopardy prohibits multiple punishments for convictions of both first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b(1)(c) (penetration under circumstances involving any \u201cother felony\u201d), and the underlying \u201cother felony\u201d of either armed robbery or kidnapping used to prove the charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The Court undertook its analysis by noting that double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments constitutes a restraint on the courts, not the Legislature. The Court acknowledged that, where the intention of Congress is not clear, federal courts rely on <em>Blockburger </em>to determine whether Congress intended to permit multiple punishments. However, the Court rejected the <em>Blockburger </em>test, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">When applied in the abstract to the statutory elements of an offense, [the <em>Blockburger </em>test] merely serves to identify true lesser included offenses. While it may be true that the Legislature ordinarily does not intend multiple punishments when one crime is completely subsumed in another, <em>Blockburger </em>itself is of no aid in making the ultimate determination. Although its creation of a presumption may make a court\u2019s task easier, it may also induce a court to avoid difficult questions of legislative intent in favor of the wooden application of a simplistic test. <em>[Robideau, supra </em>at 486.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In place of <em>Blockburger, </em>the Court set forth \u201cgeneral principles\u201d to be used when assessing legislative intention. Those principles include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">Statutes prohibiting conduct that is violative of distinct social norms can generally be viewed as separate and amenable to permitting multiple punishments. A court must identify the type of harm the Legislature intended to prevent. Where two statutes prohibit violations of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>social norm, albeit in a somewhat different manner, as a general principle it can be concluded that the Legislature did not intend multiple punishments. For example, the crimes of larceny over $ 100, MCL 750.356; MSA 28.588, and larceny in a building, MCL 750.360; MSA 28.592, although having separate elements, are aimed at conduct too similar to conclude that multiple punishment was intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">A further source of legislative intent can be found in the amount of punishment expressly authorized by the Legislature. Our criminal statutes often build upon one another. Where one statute incorporates most of the elements of a base statute and then increases the penalty as compared to the base statute, it is evidence that the Legislature did not intend punishment under both statutes. The Legislature has taken conduct from the base statute, decided that aggravating conduct deserves additional punishment, and imposed it accordingly, instead of imposing dual convictions. <em>[Id. </em>at 487-488.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Court applied its new test by first looking to the maximum penalty available under each statute to determine whether the Legislature intended to permit multiple punishments. Where the Legislature designates a lower maximum penalty for the \u201clesser\u201d crime than for the \u201cgreater\u201d crime, the Court held that it can be inferred that the Legislature did not intend multiple punishments. However, the Court held that the fact that first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the predicate offenses of armed robbery and kidnapping all carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment served as evidence that the Legislature did intend multiple punishments there. Moreover, the Court found that the \u201csocial norm\u201d the Legislature intended to protect by enactment of the criminal sexual conduct statute, i.e., protecting citizens against nonconsensual sexual penetration, would be poorly served by classifying the predicate felony as the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>If we were to conclude that only one conviction could result from fact situations such as the cases at bar, the result would be that the defendants, having completed the predicate felonies of kidnapping and robbery, could then embark on one of the most heinous crimes possible, with no risk either of a second conviction or a statutorily increased maximum sentence. <em>[Id. </em>at 490.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Court concluded therefore that under its test, the Legislature intended that first-degree criminal sexual conduct and the predicate felonies of armed robbery and kidnapping be punished separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">3. <em>ROBIDEAU </em>AND THE RATIFIERS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Robideau\u2019s </em>creation of a new rule to determine whether two statutory offenses constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes was predicated on the Court\u2019s conclusions in previous cases that: (1) Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause afforded greater protections than the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution, <em>Wilder, supra </em>at 348 n 10; and (2) the <em>Blockburger </em>test did not account for Michigan\u2019s then-current recognition of \u201ccognate\u201d lesser included offenses as \u201clesser offenses\u201d under a fact-driven analysis. This conclusion that the Michigan Constitution affords greater protection than the Fifth Amendment has no basis in the language of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, the common understanding of that language by the ratifiers, or under Michigan caselaw as it existed at the time of ratification. Further, the concern expressed by the Court that <em>Blockburger </em>does not account for cognate lesser included offenses is no longer pertinent in light of <em>People v Cornell, </em>466 Mich 335, 353; 646 NW2d 127 (2002).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, nothing in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the constitution indicates that the ratifiers intended to give the term \u201csame offense\u201d a different meaning in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy than it has in the context of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand. In the absence of any evidence that the term \u201csame offense\u201d was intended by the ratifiers to include criminal offenses that do not share the same elements, we feel compelled to overrule <em>Robideau </em>and preceding decisions that are predicated on the same error of law, and to hold instead that <em>Block-burger </em>sets forth the appropriate test to determine whether multiple punishments are barred by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We conclude that in adopting Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, the ratifiers of our constitution intended that our double jeopardy provision be construed consistently with then-existing Michigan caselaw and with the interpretation given to the Fifth Amendment by federal courts at the time of ratification. We further conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that the ratifiers intended that the term \u201csame offense\u201d be given the same meaning in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy that it has been given with respect to the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand. As we noted in Nutt, <em>supra </em>at 594 (citation omitted), \u201c \u2018there is no authority, except <em>Grady [v Corbin, </em>495 US 508; 110 S Ct 2084; 109 L Ed 2d 548 (1990)], for the proposition that [the Double Jeopardy Clause] has different meanings [in different contexts],\u2019 \u201d and <em>Grady </em>has been specifically overruled by <em>United States v Dixon, </em>509 US 688, 704; 113 S Ct 2849; 125 L Ed 2d 556 (1993). At the time of ratification, we had defined the language \u201csame offense\u201d in the context of successive prosecutions by applying the federal \u201csame elements\u201d test. In interpreting \u201csame offense\u201d in the context of multiple punishments, federal courts first look to determine whether the legislature expressed a clear intention that multiple punishments be imposed. <em>Missouri v Hunter, </em>459 US 359, 368; 103 S Ct 673; 74 L Ed 2d 535 (1983); see also <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor, supra. </em>Where the Legislature does clearly intend to impose such multiple punishments, \u201c \u2018imposition of such sentences does not violate the Constitution,\u2019 \u201d regardless of whether the offenses share the \u201csame elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and emphasis deleted). Where the Legislature has not clearly expressed its intention to authorize multiple punishments, federal courts apply the \u201csame elements\u201d test of <em>Blockburger </em>to determine whether multiple punishments are permitted. Accordingly, we conclude that the \u201csame elements\u201d test set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>best gives effect to the intentions of the ratifiers of our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">C. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We first conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in its double jeopardy analysis by comparing the first-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>degree felony murder conviction with the non-predicate felony of armed robbery.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There is no Michigan author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ity for the proposition that double jeopardy forbids the imposition of multiple punishments for felony murder and a non-predicate felony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, the proper offenses to be analyzed under the <em>Blockburger </em>test are the felonies for which defendant was convicted \u2014 first-degree felony murder and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Defendant\u2019s convictions of first-degree felony murder and the non-predicate armed robbery withstand constitutional scrutiny under the \u201csame elements\u201d test. The elements of first-degree felony murder are: \u201c \u2018(1) the killing of a human being, (2) with the intent to kill, to do great bodily harm, or to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result [i.e., malice], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(3) while committing, attempting to commit, or assisting in the commission of any of the felonies specifically enumerated in [MCL 750.316(1)(b), here larceny].\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750, 758-759; 597 NW2d 130 (1999) (citation omitted). The elements of armed robbery are: (1) an assault and (2) a felonious taking of property from the victim\u2019s presence or person (3) while the defendant is armed with a weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 757. First-degree felony murder contains elements not included in armed robbery \u2014 namely a homicide and a <em>mens rea </em>of malice. Likewise, armed robbery contains elements not necessarily included in first-degree felony murder \u2014 namely that the defendant took property from a victim\u2019s presence or person while armed with a weapon. Accordingly, we conclude that these offenses are not the \u201csame offense\u201d under either the Fifth Amendment or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 and therefore defendant may be punished separately for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">IV RESPONSE TO JUSTICE KELLY</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Justice KELLY asserts that we have \u201csystematically and drastically altered Michigan double jeopardy jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 340. In fact, our goal in interpreting provisions of our constitution is, and has always been, to give those provisions the meaning that the ratifiers intended. When the people ratified Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15, they understood that the term \u201csame offense\u201d would be construed as it always had been under Michigan caselaw on that point, i.e., in a manner consistent with the interpretation of the federal constitution. This was a critical understanding at the time, since the federal Double Jeopardy Clause had not yet been \u201cincorporated\u201d and applied against the states. See <em>Benton v Maryland, </em>395 US 784; 89 S Ct 2056; 23 L Ed 2d 707 (1969). Thus, the state Double Jeopardy Clause carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>far greater independent significance than it does today, and the people took care to state their intentions about what it meant. These intentions must serve as the touchstone in determining the meaning of Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. However, in <em>White </em>and its progeny, this Court disregarded the intentions of the ratifiers and substituted its own judgments regarding how double jeopardy principles should apply in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Court began this process of judicial amendment in <em>White </em>when it abandoned the \u201csame elements\u201d test that had been recognized in this state for at least 60 years, <em>Ascher, supra </em>at 545, in favor of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test advocated by Justice Brennan in his <em>concurring </em>statement in <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 448; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970). While <em>White </em>extolled the virtues of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test and noted that it had been adopted by \u201cmany\u201d other state courts, it failed to mention that the test had been explicitly <em>rejected </em>in both <em>Ascher </em>and <em>Townsend. </em>Moreover, the Court dismissed out of hand a statement made just one year earlier by the authoring justice in <em>White </em>that the question whether the \u201csame transaction\u201d test should be adopted was \u201cproperly a decision for the Legislature and not for this Court.\u201d <em>People v Grimmett, </em>388 Mich 590, 607; 202 NW2d 278 (1972). Thus, the Court dismissed the holdings of <em>Ascher, Townsend, </em>and <em>Grimmett, </em>each of which was consistent with the express intentions of the ratifiers, in order to pursue what <em>the Court </em>believed was the \u201conly meaningful approach to the constitutional protection against being placed twice in jeopardy.\u201d <em>White, supra </em>at 257-258.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>Cooper, </em>the Court continued to implement its own preferred policies in the realm of double jeopardy. The Court began its analysis by acknowledging that pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>1963 federal easelaw, specifically <em>Bartkus, </em>had held that when a defendant by one act violates the laws of two different sovereigns, double jeopardy does not bar the defendant\u2019s prosecution by both. Despite acknowledging that <em>Bartkus </em>remained good law, the Court hesitated to apply its rule, identifying an alleged \u201ctrend\u201d away from the logical underpinnings of that decision. However, it also hesitated to adopt the defendant\u2019s position that the dual-sovereignty doctrine should be overruled in its entirety. Rather, the Court articulated a new \u201cmiddle\u201d position derived from a post-1963 decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Under this new rule, successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns were permissible only when \u201cthe interests of the State of Michigan and the jurisdiction which initially prosecuted are substantially different.\u201d <em>Cooper, supra </em>at 461. While the Court claimed that our constitution was the source of its authority for this new approach, it failed to cite <em>any </em>Michigan easelaw, and acknowledged that its holding was based, at least in part, on \u201c \u2018some consideration [of] public policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>People v Beavers, </em>393 Mich 554, 581; 227 NW2d 511 (1975) (Coleman, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Thus, at the time <em>People v Nutt </em>was decided, this Court\u2019s double jeopardy jurisprudence had become largely unmoored from its constitutional foundation. In <em>White </em>and its progeny, the Court had disregarded the ratifiers\u2019 understanding of the phrase \u201csame offense,\u201d and instead implemented a definition of the term that was consistent with its own ideas of \u201cpublic policy.\u201d However, in <em>Nutt, </em>we recognized that it was the <em>ratifiers\u2019 </em>policy choices, and not those of the judiciary, which must govern our interpretation of the constitution. When <em>White </em>adopted the \u201csame transaction\u201d test, it acted contrary to the expressed intentions of the ratifiers that Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause be inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>preted in a manner consistent with the federal constitution, in accord with our then-existing caselaw. Therefore, in order to implement the policy determinations of the people, we overruled <em>White </em>and reinstated the meaning of the phrase \u201csame offense\u201d as it was understood by the ratifiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Likewise, in <em>People v Davis, </em>we recognized that the entire foundation for <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>rejection of the dual-sovereignty doctrine had been its \u201cdetection of a trend\u201d calling <em>Bartkus </em>into question. In fact, the opposite proved to be true, and the United States Supreme Court later affirmed the dual-sovereignty doctrine in <em>Heath. </em>Because <em>Cooper </em>had been wrong about the status of federal double jeopardy analysis at the time of ratification, its adoption of the Pennsylvania standard in dual-sovereignty cases became simply untenable. Rather, the correct standard \u2014 that intended by the ratifiers \u2014 is that a defendant who commits one criminal act that violates the laws of two different sovereigns has committed two different offenses for double jeopardy purposes. <em>Davis, supra </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Justice KELLY does not even purport to argue that <em>Robideau </em>can be maintained in light of <em>Nutt </em>and Davis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, Justice KELLY would apparently over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>rule all of our <em>existing </em>double jeopardy jurisprudence and return this Court to the days when it could safely disregard the intentions of the ratifiers, at least when such intentions conflicted with judicial preferences and assessments of public policy. The approach championed by Justice KELLY is simply incompatible with the paramount duty of the judiciary to construe the people\u2019s constitution to mean what the ratifiers intended it to mean. Moreover, in order to maintain <em>Robideau, </em>this Court would be required to hold that the term \u201csame offense\u201d means different things depending on which double jeopardy protection is at issue, a proposition that has no historical or textual basis. <em>Nutt, supra </em>at 594. Therefore, in order to restore Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 to the meaning the ratifiers intended, <em>Robideau </em>must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In addition to restoring the law to what the ratifiers of the constitution manifestly intended, we believe that by its double jeopardy decisions, this Court has also restored a more responsible criminal justice system than that urged by Justice KELLY. In particular, this Court\u2019s approach to double jeopardy will better ensure that criminal perpetrators be punished for <em>all, </em>not merely <em>some, </em>of their offenses; at the same time, it will make it more likely that policy and prosecutorial judgments assigned by our constitution to the legislative and executive branches are undertaken by those branches, rather than by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We conclude that \u201csame offense\u201d in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 means the same thing in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand of double jeopardy as it does in the context of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand addressed by the Court in <em>Nutt. </em>The test set forth in <em>Robideau </em>for determining whether the Legislature intended to permit multiple punishments is inconsistent with the understanding of the ratifiers of our constitution that Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause be construed consistently with the Fifth Amendment, and therefore <em>Robideau </em>must be overruled. We further conclude that the <em>Blockburger </em>same-elements test, as the reigning test in this Court in the context of the \u201csuccessive prosecutions\u201d strand and in the federal courts in the context of the \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d strand in 1963, effectuates the intentions of the ratifiers. Because each of the felonies of which defendant was convicted, first-degree felony murder and armed robbery, has an element that the other does not, they are not the \u201csame offense\u201d under either Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 or US Const, Am V. Accordingly, we reverse the part of the judgment of the Court of Appeals that vacated the armed robbery convictions and sentences and two of the felony-firearm convictions and sentences, and remand this case to the trial court to reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences for armed robbery and the accompanying felony-firearm convictions and sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-6\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b412-7\">WEAVER, J.

Rather, to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain each of the instant convictions, this Court must review the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to the prosecution ... and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u201d <em>People v Hampton, </em>407 Mich 354, 368; 285 NW2d 284 (1979) (citations omitted). Here, the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that after the murder, both victims were missing their wallets, the store\u2019s keys were missing, and money was missing from the cash drawer of the store. A reasonable juror could well conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant stole the money, the keys, and the wallets. Further, a reasonable juror could well conclude that there were two separate takings of property in this case \u2014 the keys and the money from the cash drawer (which belonged to the store) and the wallets and the cash from the victims. Thus, despite a lack of clarity by the prosecutor in his closing argument, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the separate offenses of armed robbery and larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Nor are we persuaded by Justice Cavanagh that the Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95; 341 NW2d 68 (1983), supports the Court of Appeals conclusion that there was only one taking. In <em>Wakeford, </em>defendant robbed a market at gunpoint, forcing two separate cashiers to turn over the proceeds of their registers. Defendant claimed that his two convictions of armed robbery violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because each occurred during the same criminal transaction. This Court rejected that argument, noting that defendant assaulted and robbed two separate people and, therefore, could be held criminally hable for both. We also noted in dictum that, had this been a larceny charge, \u201cthe theft of several items at the same time and place constitutes a single larceny.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 112. Justice Cavanagh seizes on this dictum to support his argument that, once the instant defendant was convicted of larceny, that conviction encompassed all the property stolen in this case and that \u201cno property remained that could have been separately taken as part of an armed robbery.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 330. We disagree. In <em>Wakeford </em>there was a single victim from whom the defendant took multiple items. Thus, the dictum from <em>Wakeford </em>suggests that a defendant may not be convicted of multiple counts of larceny for different items taken from a single victim. However, in the instant case, there were <em>three different </em>victims \u2014 the proprietor of the store, Putman, and Cummings. It cannot be the case that once a defendant engages in a larceny, the defendant is free to take property from anyone else in the immediate vicinity without fear of any additional punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> Because armed robbery is not the predicate felony for the instant first-degree felony murders, we need not address Wilder\u2019s holding that the constitution bars multiple punishments for first-degree felony murder and the predicate felony, or Justice Cavanagh\u2019s concern that <em>Block-burger </em>\u201chas its limitations\u201d in cases involving compound offenses. <em>Post </em>at 326.

Today the majority adopts the \u201csame elements\u201d test set forth in <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 304; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932), to determine what comprises \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d under Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. Because I believe that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is not always sufficient to enforce double jeopardy protections, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The Double Jeopardy Clause in both the Michigan Constitution and the United States Constitution protects against both successive prosecutions and multiple punishments for the \u201csame offense.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the multiple punishment context, the Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that a defendant\u2019s total punishment will not exceed the punishment authorized by the Legislature. <em>People v Whiteside, </em>437 Mich 188, 200; 468 NW2d 504 (1991). The United States Supreme Court has characterized the <em>Blockburger </em>test as a \u201crule of statutory construction\u201d that it has \u201crelied on... to determine whether Congress has in a given situation provided that two statutory offenses may be punished cumulatively.\u201d <em>Whalen v United States, </em>445 US 684, 691; 100 S Ct 1432; 63 L Ed 2d 715 (1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But simply applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test does not end the inquiry. \u201cThe <em>Block-burger </em>test is a \u2018rule of statutory construction,\u2019 and because it serves as a means of discerning congressional purpose the rule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u201d <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981). Thus, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is not an end in itself; it merely assists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>in determining the Legislature\u2019s intent regarding the appropriate punishment for multiple offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The use of <em>Blockburger </em>alone has its limitations, particularly in cases involving a compound offense, such as felony murder. The <em>Blockburger </em>test does not always recognize the relationship between a compound offense and its predicate offenses. For example, when comparing the abstract elements of felony murder and one of its predicate felonies, the offenses will be deemed separate offenses under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. But to convict a defendant of felony murder, the prosecution must establish that the defendant committed the underlying felony. Accordingly, the predicate offense to a felony-murder charge is a necessary element of felony murder, and conviction of both would violate double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">When applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test to compound offenses, it is essential to account for the necessarily included predicate offense rather than limiting the inquiry to the abstract elements of the compound offense. We recognized this requirement when we held that double jeopardy analysis for compound offenses relies \u201cnot upon the theoretical elements of the offense but upon proof of facts actually adduced.\u201d <em>People v Wilder, </em>411 Mich 328, 346; 308 NW2d 112 (1981). Similarly, when the United States Supreme Court applied <em>Blockburger </em>to the District of Columbia felony-murder statute, it held that multiple prosecutions for felony murder and the predicate offense of rape were barred even though the felony-murder statute does not <em>always </em>require proof of rape, but could also be based on robbery, arson, or kidnapping, among other offenses. <em>Whalen, supra </em>at 694. The Court noted that \u201c[i]n the present case, however, proof of rape is a necessary element of proof of the felony murder, and we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>unpersuaded that this case should be treated differently from other cases in which one criminal offense requires proof of every element of another offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court \u201cconcluded that, for purposes of imposing cumulative sentences under [the felony-murder statute], Congress intended rape to be considered a lesser offense included within the offense of a killing in the course of rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n 8. In sum, both Michigan and federal courts consider a predicate offense to be necessarily included within a compound offense, even if the abstract elements of the compound offense do not, in every case, encompass the elements of the predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Applying the \u201csame elements\u201d test of <em>Blockburger, </em>the majority concludes that defendant\u2019s convictions for felony murder based on larceny and the non-predicate offense of armed robbery survive constitutional scrutiny. <em>Ante </em>at 318-319. But the majority errs in only comparing the abstract elements of felony murder and armed robbery. Under <em>Wilder </em>and federal law, felony murder and its predicate offense are the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes because the felony-murder conviction necessarily includes all the elements of the predicate offense. The majority fails to account for the necessarily included elements of the predicate offense. Here, defendant\u2019s prosecution for felony murder necessarily put him \u201cin jeopardy\u201d of a conviction of larceny as a lesser included offense. Accordingly, the relevant comparison is between the offense of larceny and armed robbery. It is well established that larceny is a lesser included offense of armed robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>People v Jankowski, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>408 Mich 79, 92; 289 NW2d 674 (1980), disavowed on other grounds, <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95, 111 (1983). As such, a defendant cannot be subjected to multiple prosecutions for both larceny and armed robbery. \u201cWhatever the sequence may be, the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution and cumulative punishment for a greater and lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161, 169; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977). Defendant\u2019s convictions for armed robbery must be vacated in light of his convictions for felony murder with a predicate offense of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">It is also important that we keep in mind the fundamental purpose of engaging in the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u2014 to discern legislative intent. If the Legislature did not intend to impose cumulative punishments for felony murder and its predicate offense, it would follow that it did not intend to impose multiple punishments for felony murder and offenses that entirely encompass the predicate offense. The legislative intent to impose only one punishment for committing felony murder would also apply to lesser and greater included offenses of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>predicate offense. This is particularly true in the present case, which features a noteworthy relationship between the offense of felony murder and the non-predicate offense of armed robbery. Here, defendant could have been prosecuted for felony murder with a predicate felony of armed robbery rather than larceny. Had that occurred, it would have been even more apparent that a simultaneous larceny conviction would violate double jeopardy principles because larceny is a lesser included offense of armed robbery and there was no evidence of separate takings. The government should not be permitted to evade the prohibition against double jeopardy by manipulating the charges it brings against a defendant. Such maneuvering demonstrates the very governmental overreaching that the double jeopardy provision is intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In sum, comparing abstract elements does not adequately enforce the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, particularly in cases involving compound offenses. Comparing the elements of two offenses may indicate whether the Legislature intended to impose cumulative punishments, but it does not serve as an exclusive method for determining whether the Double Jeopardy Clause has been violated. The majority\u2019s application of <em>Blockburger </em>threatens to undermine the protections against double jeopardy guaranteed by the Michigan Constitution and safeguarded by <em>Wilder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Additionally, the majority contends that the evidence adduced at trial could have supported a finding that two takings occurred \u2014 the store\u2019s keys and money in a larceny and the victims\u2019 wallets in an armed robbery. <em>Ante </em>at 317 n 15. But we have not permitted the offense of larceny to be divided this way. \u201c[T]he theft of several items at the same time and place constitutes a single larceny.. . . The appropriate \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>larceny is the taking at a single time and place without regard to the number of items taken <em>...Wakeford, supra </em>at 112.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By contrast, \u201cthe appropriate \u2018unit of prosecution\u2019 for armed robbery is the person assaulted and robbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When defendant was found guilty of all the elements of larceny, that offense involved <em>all </em>the property that was taken in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, after defendant was found guilty of larceny, no property remained that could have been separately taken as part of an armed robbery. The Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that there was no factual basis supporting separate offenses of larceny and armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Vacating defendant\u2019s armed robbery convictions and related convictions of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony is necessary to enforce the prohibition against double jeopardy.

Rather, I believe that the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>dence that defendant committed the separate offenses of robbery and larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In his opening statement, the prosecutor argued to the jury that defendant took the following items: Put-man\u2019s wallet, Cummings\u2019s cash, Cummings\u2019s wallet, the keys to the store, and the cash from the cash register. The prosecutor also explained that, in order to prove felony murder, all he had to show was (1) that defendant murdered Cummings and Putman, (2) that he did it with malice, and (3) that he was attempting a larceny at the time he committed the murders. With regard to the armed robbery, the prosecutor explained that he had to prove that defendant committed robbery with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In his closing statement, the prosecutor summarized for the jury what he believed the evidence showed. Specifically, with regard to the armed robbery, the prosecutor noted (1) that defendant took the keys and (2) that money was taken from several locations, including Cummings\u2019s front pocket, the men\u2019s wallets, and the cash drawer. With regard to felony murder, the prosecutor argued that defendant caused the deaths of Cummings and Putman. He said that, when defendant caused their deaths, defendant had the intent either to kill the victims or to do them great bodily harm. With regard to the predicate offense of larceny, the prosecutor explained that, if defendant \u201cwas either stealing or attempting to steal at the time he killed these two men, which we have shown, he is guilty as charged of both counts of Felony Murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Although a prosecutor\u2019s comments are not evidence, they are intended to summarize the evidence put before the jury. Clearly, the prosecutor in this case did not distinguish between the separate acts of armed robbery and larceny. Rather, he treated the two crimes as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>interchangeable and failed to identify the items stolen with the individual crimes. In fact, when restating the items that defendant allegedly stole during the armed robbery, the prosecutor named all the stolen items.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">However, if defendant stole all the items during the armed robbery, none remained to be stolen during the larceny. In order to satisfy the predicate offense of larceny, the prosecutor stated that he had already shown that defendant was either stealing or attempting to steal from the two men. However, when he made that assertion, the prosecutor was referring to the proofs he had just discussed with regard to the armed robbery. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was no evidence that defendant committed both armed robbery and larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The majority notes that a reasonable juror could have concluded that there were two separate takings: the money from the cash drawer and the wallets from the victims. However, the prosecutor did not make this distinction. Moreover, the facts of this case should not be read in a vacuum. In making the distinction it does, the majority is essentially acting as a super-prosecutor and a thirteenth juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was insufficient evidence of two takings, and that defendant was convicted of both felony murder and the predicate felony. As the Court noted, it is well established that convictions and sentences for both felony murder and the predicate felony for felony murder violate double jeopardy. <em>Wilder, </em>411 Mich at 345-347. The proper remedy is to vacate the conviction and sentence for the underlying felony. Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Appeals judgment and vacate defendant\u2019s two convictions for armed robbery and the cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>responding two convictions for felony-firearm, as well as the sentences for those convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">It is unnecessary in this case for the Court to choose whether the proper test for determining if a double jeopardy violation has occurred is set forth in <em>Blockburger</em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or <em>Robideau. </em>However, the majority takes this step, and I state my strong disagreement. <em>Robideau </em>should not be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Michigan Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides: \u201cNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d Similarly, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides: \u201cNo person shall be . . . subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The Double Jeopardy Clause primarily offers three protections: it protects against (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 468, citing <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711, 717; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The first two protections are commonly referred to as the \u201csuccessive prosecution\u201d strand, and the third protection is commonly referred to as the \u201cmultiple punishment\u201d strand. According to the majority, the instant case concerns the third protection. As noted in <em>Robideau, </em>\u201c[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a court from imposing more punishment than that intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 469. Accordingly, \u201c \u2018the question under the Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are \u201cmultiple\u201d is essentially one of legislative intent....\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Ohio v Johnson, </em>467 US 493, 499; 104 S Ct 2536; 81 L Ed 2d 425 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">RECENT CHANGES IN MICHIGAN\u2019S DOUBLE JEOPARDY JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It should be noted that there are few areas of the law in which the current Michigan Supreme Court majority has altered state law more than double jeopardy jurisprudence. Ten years after the 1963 Michigan Constitution was ratified, this Court decided <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973). There, the Court held that the \u201csame transaction\u201d test should be used to determine if serial prosecutions violate the state constitution\u2019s double jeopardy provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Thirty years later, the majority of this Court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> overruled <em>White </em>and instead adopted the \u201csame elements\u201d test, also referred to as the <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>People v Nutt, </em>469 Mich 565; 677 NW2d 1 (2004). Specifically, the majority in <em>Nutt </em>concluded that, in adopting the Michigan Double Jeopardy Clause, \u201cthe people of this state intended that our double jeopardy provision would be construed consistently with Michigan precedent and the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591. Accordingly, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>federal courts used the same-elements test in interpreting the term \u201csame offence\u201d under the federal constitution, this Court likewise adopted the same-elements test. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The dissent in <em>Nutt</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rejected the majority\u2019s application of the same-elements test and noted that it \u201cis not as entrenched in federal jurisprudence as the majority claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). The dissent noted that the United States Supreme Court has used other tests, because it recognized that the same-elements test is not an adequate safeguard to protect a citizen\u2019s double jeopardy rights. <em>Id. </em>at 598-599, citing <em>Ashe v </em>Swenson, 397 US 436, 443-444, 447; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970), <em>Ball v United States, </em>470 US 856, 105 S Ct 1668, 84 L Ed 2d 740 (1985), <em>In re Nielson, </em>131 US 176; 9 S Ct 672, 33 L Ed 118 (1889), <em>Harris v Oklahoma, </em>433 US 682; 97 S Ct 2912; 53 L Ed 2d 1054 (1977), and <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Specifically, the dissent noted that a technical comparison of the elements is neither constitutionally sound nor easy to apply. <em>Nutt, </em>469 Mich at 600. Essentially, the dissent opined that the same-elements test is nothing more than a method that can be used to interpret statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 598, citing <em>Albernaz v United States, </em>450 US 333, 340; 101 S Ct 1137; 67 L Ed 2d 275 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In a similar vein, in 1976, this Court decided <em>People v Cooper, </em>398 Mich 450; 247 NW2d 866 (1976). In <em>Cooper, </em>the defendant was acquitted in federal court, then tried in state court on charges for the same criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 453. The issue was whether his right to be free from double jeopardy under either the Michigan or United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>States Constitution had been violated. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201cConst 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 prohibits a second prosecution for an offense arising out of the same criminal act unless it appears from the record that the interests of the State of Michigan and the jurisdiction which initially prosecuted are substantially different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Again, nearly 30 years later, the same majority of the Michigan Supreme Court that overruled <em>White </em>in <em>Nutt </em>overruled <em>Cooper </em>in <em>People v Davis, </em>472 Mich 156; 695 NW2d 45 (2005).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The majority in <em>Davis </em>relied on its analysis in <em>Nutt </em>for this proposition: The double jeopardy provision of the Michigan Constitution should be construed consistently with federal double jeopardy jurisprudence that existed at the time the 1963 Michigan Constitution was ratified. <em>Id. </em>at 168. Accordingly, applying federal double jeopardy jurisprudence, the majority in <em>Davis </em>concluded that the Michigan Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the defendant\u2019s successive prosecutions in Michigan and Kentucky. <em>Id. </em>at 158. The reason was that the states are separate sovereigns deriving their authority to punish from distinct sources of power. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">I dissented in <em>Davis.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>My dissent reviewed this state\u2019s common-law history before we became a state, our constitutional history, and the language of the Address to the People before the constitution was ratified in 1963. It rejected the majority\u2019s claim that the voters of our state intended that Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause be interpreted exactly as the federal provision is interpreted. <em>Id. </em>at 182 (KELLY, J., dissenting). I also noted that <em>Cooper </em>properly relied on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Michigan Constitution, and that the <em>Cooper </em>rule was necessary to protect the individual\u2019s and the state\u2019s respective interests. <em>Id. </em>at 184.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, we come to the instant case. In 1984, this Court decided <em>Robideau </em>and specifically addressed the multiple-punishment strand of Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court noted that, although the United States Supreme Court had adopted the <em>Block-burger </em>same-elements test, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of issues of multiple punishment suggested a struggle to set forth a single standard. <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Turning to Michigan caselaw, <em>Robideau </em>concluded that Michigan\u2019s double jeopardy analysis had been no more consistent than federal double jeopardy analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 484. In deciding the appropriate test to use in Michigan, this Court explicitly rejected the <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 485-486. Specifically, it stated that, although Blockburger\u2019s \u201ccreation of a presumption may make a court\u2019s task easier, it may also induce a court to avoid difficult questions of legislative intent in favor of the wooden application of a simplistic test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. Instead, this Court used the traditional means of determining legislative intent: the subject, language, and history of the statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Now, more than 20 years after <em>Robideau </em>was decided, the same majority that overturned <em>White </em>and <em>Cooper </em>overturns <em>Robideau. </em>Relying once again on its analysis in <em>Nutt, </em>the majority holds that <em>Blockburger </em>set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the proper test to determine when multiple punishments are barred on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">It is beyond argument that the majority of this Court has systematically and drastically altered Michigan double jeopardy jurisprudence. For nearly 30 years, this Court applied <em>White </em>to cases involving successive prosecutions and <em>Cooper </em>to cases involving two sovereigns. For more than 20 years, this Court applied <em>Robideau </em>to cases involving multiple punishments. However, in rapid succession, the majority of this Court has discarded each of these precedents and created its own double jeopardy jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">I dissented in <em>Nutt </em>and <em>Davis </em>because I did not agree that <em>White </em>and <em>Cooper </em>should have been overturned. Today, I again dissent because I do not agree that <em>Robideau </em>should be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">THE <em>ROBINSON</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"AT6\">A. WHETHER THE CASE WAS WRONGLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">This Court laid out the factors to consider in departing from the rule of stare decisis in the <em>Robinson </em>case: (1) whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided, (2) whether the decision at issue defies \u201cpractical workability,\u201d (3) whether reliance interests would work an undue hardship if the authority is overturned, and (4) whether changes in the law make the decision no longer justified. <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>First, I believe <em>Robideau </em>was correctly decided. In <em>Robideau, </em>this Court exhaustively reviewed federal caselaw concerning double jeopardy. <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 472-480. After concluding that federal jurisprudence offered no concrete guidance, this Court exhaustively reviewed Michigan caselaw concerning Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 480-484. Similarly, this Court found that Michigan\u2019s double jeopardy analysis had not been consistent. <em>Id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This Court noted that it had concluded in <em>White </em>that the transactional approach was the correct standard to use with regard to successive prosecutions. <em>Id. </em>at 485. However, because different interests were involved, a different standard was needed for cases involving multiple punishments. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, after conducting an extensive caselaw analysis, this Court explicitly rejected the <em>Blockburger </em>test, preferring instead traditional means of determining the intent of the Legislature: the subject, language, and history of the statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 486.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Robideau </em>was based on the Michigan Constitution and Michigan caselaw. The test in <em>Robideau </em>adequately safeguards a Michigan citizen\u2019s right to be free from multiple punishments for the same offense. As noted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Robideau, </em>when multiple punishments are involved, the Double Jeopardy Clause is a restraint on the prosecution and the courts, not on the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 469. The test in <em>Robideau </em>ensures that the defendant does not receive more punishment than intended by the Legislature. Accordingly, it adequately protects the double jeopardy rights of Michigan citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Moreover, the <em>Robideau </em>Court was free to use its own preferred methods of ascertaining judicial intent. As noted repeatedly throughout <em>Robideau, </em>the <em>Block-burger </em>test is simply a method for determining legislative intent. <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 473, 478, citing <em>Gore v United States, </em>357 US 386; 78 S Ct 1280; 2 L Ed 2d 1405 (1958) (stressing that <em>Blockburger </em>was decided as a matter of legislative intent), and <em>Albernaz, </em>450 US at 338 (noting that the <em>Blockburger </em>test was merely a means to determine legislative intent and that the presumption created by the <em>Blockburger </em>test could be rebutted by a clear indication of legislative intent to the contrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">I believe this is the proper lens through which to view Blockburger: It is simply one of many methods by which a court can discern the Legislature\u2019s intent. It is not a definitive test that should, or could, be used in every case. Indeed, as noted by this Court in <em>Robideau, </em>\u201cit would be quite contrary to established principles of federalism for the United States Supreme Court to impose on the states the method by which they must interpret the actions of their own legislatures.\u201d <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 486. Accordingly, the <em>Robideau </em>Court was within its authority to reject the <em>Blockburger </em>test and instead fashion a test that properly reflected the protections of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The majority believes that the constitution\u2019s ratifiers intended our double jeopardy provision to be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>consistently with the interpretation given the Fifth Amendment by federal courts at the time of ratification. I disagree. As I noted in my dissent in <em>Davis, </em>the sole concern in revisiting the Double Jeopardy Clause in our state constitution was to clarify that jeopardy attaches when a jury is sworn, as our courts had interpreted. <em>Davis, </em>472 Mich at 181 (KELLY, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In <em>Davis, </em>I also rejected the majority\u2019s claim that the people of Michigan intended to adopt the federal interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, I did not agree with the majority that the ratifiers knew how the United States Supreme Court had interpreted the federal Double Jeopardy Clause and that they accepted it. <em>Id. </em>I did not agree that the ratifiers were willing to allow the federal government to interpret our constitution for us. <em>Id. </em>I continue to believe that my analysis in <em>Davis </em>was correct. Therefore, I continue to reject the majority\u2019s presumption that the voters of our state intended that Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause be interpreted exactly as the federal provision is interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The majority overturns <em>Robideau </em>also in the belief that the Michigan Constitution does not afford greater protections than does the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. As an initial matter, I would note that the <em>Robideau </em>Court did not expressly base its decision on this assertion. Regardless, this Court has, for decades, determined that our constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy affords greater protection than does the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 507 n 5 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting), citing <em>People v Wakeford, </em>418 Mich 95, 105 n 9; 341 NW2d 68 (1983), <em>People v Carter, </em>415 Mich 558, 582-584; 330 NW2d 314 (1982), <em>Wilder, </em>411 Mich at 343-349, <em>People v Jankowski, </em>408 Mich 79, 91-92, 96; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>289 NW2d 674 (1980), and <em>White. </em>Accordingly, for the reasons I have stated, I continue to believe <em>Robideau </em>was correctly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">B. PRACTICAL WORKABILITY PROBLEMS</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The next <em>Robinson </em>factor to consider is whether the decision at issue defies \u201cpractical workability.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464. I do not believe that it does. In interpreting statutes, courts are charged with the responsibility to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent in writing such statutes. <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). <em>Robideau </em>set forth a nonexhaustive list of factors a court could consider in determining legislative intent. I believe that the test set forth in <em>Robideau </em>is workable. It is no more difficult to apply than any other method that this Court uses to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The majority adopts the <em>Blockburger </em>test. However, as indicated by the <em>Robideau </em>Court, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is not an easy test to apply consistently. This Court noted that, among other difficulties that arise from the application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, it \u201cfails to recognize that the Legislature does not always create crimes in neat packages which are susceptible to a pure greater and lesser included offense analysis.\u201d <em>Robideau, </em>419 Mich at 487 n 6. Moreover, the <em>Blockburger </em>test \u201cmay also induce a court to avoid difficult questions of legislative intent in favor of the wooden application of a simplistic test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. The difficulty in applying <em>Blockburger </em>is one of the reasons, if not the main reason, this Court specifically declined to adopt the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In <em>Nutt,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the dissent noted that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is an inadequate safeguard because it leaves the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tutional guarantee at the mercy of the Legislature\u2019s decision to modify statutory definitions. <em>Nutt, </em>469 Mich at 600, quoting <em>United States v Dixon, </em>509 US 688, 735; 113 S Ct 2849; 125 L Ed 2d 556 (1993) (White, J., dissenting). Therefore, it is the <em>Blockburger </em>test, not the <em>Robideau </em>test, that defies practical workability.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">C. HARDSHIP BECAUSE OF RELIANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The next <em>Robinson </em>factor to consider is whether, if the decision were overturned, reliance interests would work an undue hardship. <em>Robinson, </em>462 Mich at 464. \u201c[T]he Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466. Overturning <em>Robideau </em>would work an undue hardship. As indicated above, Michigan courts have followed the test for more than 20 years. It has become a fundamental part of Michigan double jeopardy jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">D. CHANGES IN THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The final <em>Robinson </em>factor is whether changes in the law make the decision no longer justified. <em>Id. </em>at 464. There has been no change in Michigan\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, and the test set forth in <em>Robideau </em>has been applied since its inception in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The majority notes that the concern expressed by this Court in <em>Robideau </em>that <em>Blockburger </em>does not account for cognate lesser-included offenses is no longer pertinent in light of <em>People v Cornell, </em>466 Mich 335, 353; 646 NW2d 127 (2002). As an initial matter, the <em>Robideau </em>Court\u2019s reasoning was much more diverse than the majority implies. The <em>Robideau </em>Court did not reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the <em>Blockburger </em>test solely because it did not account for cognate lesser-included offenses. Rather, this Court noted that federal double jeopardy jurisprudence was inconsistent and that <em>Blockburger </em>was difficult to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Regardless, in <em>Cornell, </em>the same majority that overturned <em>White, Cooper, </em>and now <em>Robideau </em>held that an offense is an \u201coffense inferior to that charged in the indictment\u201d for purposes of MCL 768.32(1) when \u201c \u2018the lesser offense can be proved by the same facts that are used to establish the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354-355 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">I dissented in <em>Cornell </em>and noted\" that, in coming to this conclusion, the majority strayed beyond the matter at hand, which was lesser-included misdemeanor offenses. <em>Cornell, </em>466 Mich at 376 (KELLY, J., dissenting). I noted that, whereas the majority devoted pages of discussion to cognate lesser included offenses, its holding applied to necessarily included felony offenses. Therefore, I disagreed with the majority\u2019s analysis in <em>Cornell </em>and do not believe it affects the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Accordingly, after considering all the <em>Robinson </em>factors, I conclude that <em>Robideau </em>should not be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">There was no need, other than one springing from the majority\u2019s desire to rewrite Michigan double jeopardy jurisprudence, to overturn <em>Robideau </em>or determine whether <em>Robideau </em>or <em>Blockburger </em>is the appropriate test to apply. Rather, the Court of Appeals was correct. There was no evidence in this case that defendant committed the separate offenses of robbery and larceny.
