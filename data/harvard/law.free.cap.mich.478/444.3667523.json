We further consider whether <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, </em>166 Mich App 81; 420 NW2d 131 (1988), was correctly decided. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>deciding these questions, we first hold that under <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 US 1032; 104 S Ct 3479; 82 L Ed 2d 778 (1984), illegally seized property is not immune from forfeiture. We also agree with the holding in <em>United States v </em>$639,558, 293 US App DC 384, 387; 955 F2d 712 (1992), that property subject to forfeiture that was illegally seized \u201cis not \u2018excluded\u2019 from the proceeding entirely.\u201d Instead, the illegally seized property \u201cmay be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of estabhshing its existence, and the court\u2019s <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Because we find that the exclusionary rule was never meant to preclude illegally seized property from a subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding involving that property, we hold that, in accord with <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>and MCL 333.7521, as long as the order of forfeiture can be established by a preponderance of evidence untainted by the illegal search and seizure, the forfeiture is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">For the reasons summarized by the Court of Appeals in its decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment and order, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that, although the money was illegally seized, there was a preponderance of untainted evidence to support a finding of civil forfeiture pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment, and we further conclude that the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>reached the correct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Claimant Tamika S. Smith was driving west on 1-94 when she was stopped for speeding by Michigan State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Trooper James Lass. Smith was traveling with her two small children in a rental car rented by her adult male passenger, claimant Todd F. Fletcher. Trooper Lass obtained photo identification in the form of a driver\u2019s license from both Smith and Fletcher and checked both licenses for outstanding warrants. Lass discovered that Smith\u2019s license had been suspended, and that Fletcher\u2019s license was valid, but that Fletcher had been identified as an individual to whom \u201cofficer safety caution\u201d applied. After checking Fletcher\u2019s criminal history, Trooper Lass learned that Fletcher had been arrested previously for possession of cocaine and for weapons offenses. On the basis of this information, Trooper Lass returned to the rental car and apparently advised Smith that he was going to search the trunk of the rental car, in which Trooper Lass subsequently discovered a backpack containing $180,975 in cash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith was cited for speeding and driving on a suspended license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The state filed a complaint for forfeiture of the currency discovered in the backpack, pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f). Before the forfeiture proceeding, claimant Smith filed a motion to suppress evidence of the backpack and its contents on the basis that the evidence was illegally seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment because Smith did not consent to the search of the rental car. The circuit court agreed with Smith, determined that there was no probable cause to search the trunk of the car, and granted Smith\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>While the circuit court ruled that the $180,975 in currency was suppressed, the court allowed the prosecutor to introduce other evidence during the forfeiture proceeding. Specifically, the prosecutor presented evidence to show that Smith was a drug courier and that the $180,975 seized by Trooper Lass had been intended for the purchase of illegal drugs. The prosecutor submitted evidence that in the three months before Smith was stopped for speeding, Smith had rented several different rental cars at least four times for three days each time; that she had driven for several hundred miles on each occasion, but could not recall where she had driven; and that Smith\u2019s tax records indicated that she generally earned between $4,000 and $5,000 a year and had no income in 2002, the year when she was stopped for speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In addition, an expert in the area of illegal drug trafficking testified that 1-94, the highway on which Smith was driving when she was stopped, is a recognized major drug corridor between Detroit and Chicago, with large amounts of cash found in rental cars traveling west, and large amounts of illegal drugs recovered in rental cars going east. The circuit court further found that Smith\u2019s explanation of how she came to be traveling with $180,975 in cash was neither consistent nor credible. Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of forfeiture, concluding that, even when the illegally seized evidence is excluded, the prosecutor established by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was intended to buy illicit drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Claimant Smith appealed, and the Court of Appeals, finding no clear error, affirmed the forfeiture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>sought leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision, and we granted leave to appeal to consider \u201c(1) the proper application of the exclusionary rule in a forfeiture proceeding in which the property subject to forfeiture has been illegally seized, and (2) whether <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, </em>166 Mich App 81 (1988), was correctly decided.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This Court reviews de novo questions of law. <em>Cowles v Bank West, </em>476 Mich 1, 13; 719 NW2d 94 (2006). The proper application of the exclusionary rule in a civil forfeiture proceeding is a question of law subject to review de novo. <em>People v Stevens (After Remand), </em>460 Mich 626, 631; 597 NW2d 53 (1999). A trial court\u2019s decision in a forfeiture proceeding will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A finding is clearly erroneous where, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">APPLICATION OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE TO CIVIL FORFEITURE UNDER MCL 333.7521</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">A forfeiture proceeding pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f) is a proceeding in rem. As such, the item that is the subject of the forfeiture proceeding is the \u201coffender\u201d and the \u201cclaimant\u201d is the owner, or perhaps only a possessor, of the item in question. As the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>States Supreme Court explained in <em>Various Items of Personal Property v United </em>States:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">It is the property which is proceeded against, and, by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient. In a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person who is proceeded against, convicted and punished. The forfeiture is no part of the punishment for the criminal offense. <em>Origet v United States, </em>125 U. S. 240, 245-247 [8 S Ct 846; 31 L Ed 743 (1888)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v Pennsylvania, </em>380 US 693; 85 S Ct 1246; 14 L Ed 2d 170 (1965), the United States Supreme Court held that the exclusionary rule applied to forfeiture proceedings because forfeiture proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature. In this case, the prosecutor has raised questions about the continuing viability of <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan. </em>However, the prosecutor has not appealed the suppression order, and, therefore, this issue is not before us. Nevertheless, while <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>has not been overruled and, thus, is still applicable, several subsequently decided cases indicate that the underpinnings of <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>have been weakened.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">For example, when the United States Supreme Court was presented with the question whether to exclude evidence from a federal civil tax proceeding on the basis that the evidence was obtained by a state law-enforcement officer relying in good faith on a defective warrant, the Court declined to extend the exclusionary rule to the federal proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court recognized that the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule, which is a judicially created remedy, is to deter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>future unlawful police conduct. As such, courts impose the exclusionary rule in criminal proceedings to deter police officers from making future illegal searches and seizures. Thus, the United States Supreme Court recognized that to further extend the exclusionary rule would not be prudent given that \u201cthe additional marginal deterrence provided by forbidding a different sovereign from using the evidence in a civil proceeding surely does not outweigh the cost to society of extending the rule to that situation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In <em>Pennsylvania Bd of Probation &amp; Parole v Scott, </em>524 US 357, 363; 118 S Ct 2014; 141 L Ed 2d 344 (1998), the United States Supreme Court explained that it has \u201crepeatedly declined to extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials.\u201d Additionally, the Supreme Court has declined to apply the exclusionary rule when the proceedings fall outside the offending officer\u2019s primary focus.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court has \u201cnever suggested that the exclusionary rule must apply in every circumstance in which it might provide marginal deterrence.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The deterrent function is strongest where the unlawful conduct would result in a criminal penalty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Extending the rule beyond the officer\u2019s primary zone of interest would have, at most, only an incremental deterrent effect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>As acknowledged by the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, </em>\u201cthe Michigan forfeiture statute [MCL 333.7521(1)(f)] closely parallels the analogous federal statute, 21 USC 881(a)(6).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> MCL 333.7521(1)(f)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is contained within the controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>substances article of the Public Health Code. In summary, \u00a7 7521(1)(f) provides for the forfeiture of \u201cany thing of value that is furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled substance ... in violation of this article [or] that is traceable to an exchange for a controlled substance,... or that is used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of this article ... .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Forfeiture proceedings under the administrative section of the Michigan Public Health Code are not within the offending police officer\u2019s primary zone of interest. The primary goal of a police officer is to collect evidence to be used to convict a defendant in a criminal proceeding. The police officer\u2019s main focus is not on obtaining evidence for a civil forfeiture action.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">We further note, as amicus curiae, the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan, correctly observes, that there is a distinction between civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings. As mentioned in <em>Various Items of Personal Property, supra </em>at 580-581:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">At common law, in many cases, the right of forfeiture did not attach until the offending person had been convicted and the record of conviction produced. But that doctrine did not apply, as this court in an early case pointed out, where the right of forfeiture was \u201ccreated by statute, <em>in rem, </em>cognisable on the revenue side of the exchequer. The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offense is attached primarily to the thing; and this, whether the offense be <em>malum prohibitum, </em>or <em>malum in se.\u201d The Palmyra, </em>[25 US (12 Wheat) 1, 14; 6 L Ed 531 (1827)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">There is an additional distinction between civil and criminal forfeitures, namely that the latter are punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>in nature, while the former are not. Section 7521(1)(f) is not a criminal statute. There are no penalties or fines associated with a violation of this section. Further, there are no provisions for inquiry into the guilt or innocence of the owner or possessor of the item subject to forfeiture. Instead, the intent of civil forfeiture statutes like \u00a7 7521(1)(f) is to remove from circulation all cash, property, and contraband used to further drug-trafficking. Indeed, in <em>Bennis v Michigan,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court affirmed this Court\u2019s decision that forfeiture under Michigan\u2019s nuisance abatement statute<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was appropriate even when the joint owner of the forfeited vehicle was innocent. In so holding, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">[Petitioner] claims she was entitled to contest the abatement by showing she did not know her husband would use it to violate Michigan\u2019s indecency law. But a long and unbroken line of cases holds that an owner\u2019s interest in property may be forfeited by reason of the use to which the property is put <em>even though the owner did not know that it was to he put to such use. [Id. </em>at 446 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Given the distinctions between a criminal proceeding against a defendant accused of a crime and a civil forfeiture against the offending object, we decline to rule that the exclusionary rule ever acts as a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>bar to bringing a forfeiture proceeding against an object that has been illegally seized. We instead examine the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>and consider whether that decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\n<em>In re FORFEITURE OF UNITED STATES CURRENCY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the forfeiture of the $180,975 in currency on the basis of <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency. </em>Like claimant Smith herein, the petitioner there, Kenneth Williams, moved to suppress evidence of controlled substances and $30,632.41 in cash illegally seized from his home by the police. The trial court granted Williams\u2019s motion to suppress and all criminal charges were dismissed. Thereafter, the city of Lansing brought a forfeiture proceeding against the seized items, and the trial court ruled in the city\u2019s favor. Williams appealed, arguing that the trial court erred because illegally seized evidence could not be the subject of a subsequent forfeiture action. The Court of Appeals, when faced with the issue now before us, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">Michigan courts have not decided the specific question whether property seized pursuant to a search warrant which is subsequently held invalid may still be subject to forfeiture under the Michigan forfeiture statute. However, this Court has stated that property and monies described in the analogous federal statute are subject to forfeiture even where the seizure of the property subject to the forfeiture is subsequently found to be unlawful. <em>Michigan State Police v 33d District Court, </em>138 Mich App 390, 395; 360 NW2d 196 (1984). <em>[In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, supra </em>at 87-88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Williams contended, as does claimant Smith here, that <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>bars a forfeiture pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ceeding when the subject of the forfeiture is illegally seized property. The Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, supra </em>at 88-89, disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>holds that evidence and property illegally seized cannot be used in a forfeiture proceeding, and not that the illegally seized property cannot be forfeited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">The decision in <em>United States v \u201cMonkey\u201d a Fishing Vessel, </em>725 F2d 1007, 1012 (CA 5, 1984), addressing forfeiture of illegally seized property under federal law, is instructive:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cThis court recently decided that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201c \u2018even ... if the seizure were illegal, it would not bar the government\u2019s right to claim the vehicle through forfeiture proceedings. Improper seizure does not jeopardize the government\u2019s right to secure forfeiture if the probable cause to seize the vehicle can be supported with untainted evidence. <em>United States v Eighty-Eight Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars, </em>671 F2d 293, 297-298 (CA 8, 1982); <em>United States v One 1975 Pontiac Lemans, </em>621 F2d 444, 450-451 (CA 1, 1980); <em>United States v One Harley Davidson Motorcycle, </em>508 F2d 351, 351-352 (CA 9, 1974). This position is not contrary to <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v Pennsylvania, </em>380 US 693; 85 S Ct 1246; 14 L Ed 2d 170 (1965). That case holds that an object illegally seized cannot in any way be used either as evidence or as the basis for jurisdiction. Therefore, evidence derived from a search in violation of the fourth amendment must be excluded at a forfeiture proceeding. In the case at bar, all evidence of probable cause was developed independent of the seizure of the vehicle. Thus, even if a warrant were required, the failure to secure it would not bar the forfeiture of the vehicle.\u2019 <em>[United States v One 1978 Mercedes Benz, 4-Door Sedan, </em>711 F2d 1297 (CA 5, 1983).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">We hold that illegally seized property is forfeitable under MCL 333.7521; MSA 14.15(7521), so long as the probable cause for its seizure can be supported with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>untainted evidence and any illegally seized property is excluded from the forfeiture proceeding. In this case, the illegally seized articles were never introduced into evidence. Thus, the circuit court complied with an interpretation of Michigan\u2019s forfeiture statute which parallels the federal statute and is consistent with this opinion, despite its erroneous assertion as to the holding of <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We first note that the Court of Appeals panel in the instant case erred in relying on the erroneous standard of proof cited in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>when the panel held that \u201cprobable cause supported by untainted evidence existed for the seizure.\u201d <em>In re Forfeiture of $180,975, </em>slip op at 2. The correct burden of proof is a <em>preponderance of the evidence, </em>not <em>probable cause.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that while <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>holds that illegally seized evidence and property cannot be used in a subsequent forfeiture proceeding, <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>does not state that illegally seized property cannot be forfeited. We disagree, however, with the Court of Appeals inclusion in its analysis of the questionable conclusion made by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>holds that \u201c \u2018an object illegally seized <em>cannot in any way </em>be used either as evidence or as the basis for jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Although <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>characterized the forfeiture proceeding in that case as being \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d and requires application of the exclusionary rule to forfeiture proceedings, neither <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>nor the exclusionary rule prevents the mention of the illegally seized property that is the subject of the forfeiture proceeding. In fact, in <em>Lopez-Mendoza, supra </em>at 1039-1040, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018body\u2019 or identity of a defendant or respondent in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred. A similar rule applies in forfeiture proceedings----\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit properly interpreted <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan </em>and <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>in <em>United States v $639,558:</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">When illegally seized property is itself the \u201cdefendant\u201d in the forfeiture proceeding, it may not be \u201crelied upon to sustain a forfeiture,\u201d <em>Plymouth Sedan, </em>380 U.S. at 698, but it is not \u201cexcluded\u201d from the proceeding entirely. Such property may be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of establishing its existence, and the court\u2019s <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over it. This, we think, is the import of the Second Circuit\u2019s recent statement that with respect to unlawfully obtained property that is the subject of the forfeiture suit, \u201cthe property itself cannot be excluded from the forfeiture action,\u201d <em>United States v. $ 37,780 in U.S. Currency, </em>920 F. 2d 159 at 163 (2d Cir. 1990). In other words, as the Supreme Court suggested in <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032 at 1041, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984), the fact that the defendant property had been seized after an illegal search does not \u201cimmunize\u201d it from forfeiture, any more than a defendant illegally arrested is immunized from prosecution. <em>United States v. Crews, </em>445 U.S. 463 at 474, 100 S. Ct. 1244, 63 L.Ed.2d 537 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(1980). See, e.g., <em>United States v. One (1) 1987 Mercury Marquis, </em>909 F.2d 167 at 169 (6th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. U.S. Currency $31,828, </em>760 F.2d 228 at 230-31 (8th Cir. 1985). Thus, other evidence, legally obtained, may be introduced to establish that the property should be forfeited to the government. <em>United States v. One (1) 1971 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle, </em>508 F.2d 351 (9th Cir. 1974). In this case the government apparently had no such other evidence and, for that reason, the district court dismissed the action after ordering the cash (and the keys and ledgers) suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We agree with the conclusions in <em>United States v $639,558 </em>that (1) the illegal seizure of property does not immunize it from forfeiture, and (2) illegally seized property that is the subject, or \u201cres,\u201d of the forfeiture proceeding may be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of establishing its existence and the court\u2019s in rem jurisdiction over it. We therefore find that the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>reached the correct result. We further hold that illegally seized property is forfeitable under MCL 333.7521 as long as the forfeiture can be supported by a preponderance of untainted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">While illegally seized evidence itself is physically excluded, it is not entirely excluded from the forfeiture proceeding. However, questions concerning this excluded evidence should be limited to the circumstances surrounding its existence. For example, in the case of illegally seized cash, the state should not be permitted to exploit the search by asking how the money was packaged, or whether evidence of drugs was detected on the money. In addition, any other legally obtained evidence may be introduced to support the forfeiture.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Justice MARKMAN, in dissent, questions the propriety of permitting the consideration of the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of illegally seized property during a forfeiture proceeding.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Further, the dissent apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>would immunize the illegally seized property such that a court could not consider <em>anything </em>regarding that property, even the presence of a large sum of money, <em>post </em>at 485-486. Yet this reasoning has been rejected. In <em>United States v $493,850 in United States </em>Currency,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the government sought to forfeit illegally seized cash, but the claimant asserted that the cash could not even be mentioned during the forfeiture proceeding and that the illegally seized cash should be treated as if it were a \u201cwidget.\u201d The United States District Court for Arizona disagreed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">However, the Court does not believe that exclusion of the cash means the Court must consider the defendant cash as a \u201cwidget.\u201d The Court believes it can still take notice of the fact that the defendant is cash. This is obviously stated in the caption of the case. Perhaps the denominations making up the amount and the actual money itself cannot be put into evidence. However, there is no way for the Government to show that a \u201cwidget\u201d is the product of a drug transaction and, therefore, the Court does not believe it has to disregard the fact that one of the defendants is cash.<footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Because a basic purpose of a drug forfeiture proceeding is to establish that the item subject to forfeiture (here the $180,975 in cash) is connected to drug activity, a court cannot be forced to pretend that the cash does not exist. Nor must the court turn a blind eye to the conclusions one reaches when considering all of the circumstances surrounding its existence and its implications. Rather, we apply a commonsense approach to drug forfeiture hearings in which the item subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>forfeiture has been excluded from evidence:<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> while the court may not consider the specific physical characteristics of the item itself, the court can consider evidence presented in relation to the fact of the item\u2019s existence, such as the fact that claimant\u2019s testimony about the money itself is questionable. This approach in no way redefines the judicially created exclusionary rule. Here, the court can consider the reliability of the claimant\u2019s testimony concerning the money\u2019s origin, its existence in her rental car its intended purpose, the amount of the money in relation to her reported income, the fact that she was traveling along a known drug corridor in a rental car and that she had rented several cars in the preceding weeks, and any other circumstantial factors not specifically related to the physical characteristics of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Our conclusion is supported by <em>United States v $22,287 in United States Currency,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan held that the circumstances surrounding illegally seized cash may be considered. The court held that although all the evidence seized during an illegal drug raid ($22,287 in currency, a bag of heroin, two scales, and some firearms) was excluded, the forfeiture was still supported on the basis of a conversation between a police officer and a purported drug seller, as well as certain circumstances concerning the money. Specifically, the court noted that $22,287 was \u201can unusually large amount of cash for any individual to have on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>hand\u201d and, further, that the amount of cash was \u201cvery close to the price of \u2018nineteen five\u2019 ($19,500.00) noted by Johnny [purported drug seller] as the cost of an \u2018lb\u2019 (pound of heroin).\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> These are precisely the type of factors regarding the existence of the cash that the dissent would preclude from consideration.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">EVIDENCE SUPPORTING FORFEITURE</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Turning now to the circuit court\u2019s forfeiture hearing, we note that the circuit court correctly excluded evidence of the illegally seized backpack and its contents. Our next inquiry is whether there was a preponderance of <em>untainted </em>evidence to support the forfeiture. First, with respect to the $180,975 in cash found in the claimant\u2019s rental car, while the cash itself was excluded from evidence, the trial court could properly consider the implications of the presence of such a large amount of cash in the vehicle. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \u201ccarrying a large sum of cash is strong evidence of some relationship with illegal drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Here, as noted in the circuit court\u2019s findings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the ruling of drug forfeiture was based in part on the presence of the $180,975 in currency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\">Well, what do we have here? We have a very large amount of money. It is not illegal to have it. It is unheard [sic] of, but it is mighty unusual to have One Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($180,000) in cash being transported in this vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The circuit court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">It is also a little unusual and I guess it would create in one\u2019s mind a suspicion, which isn\u2019t sufficient, but it is a suspicion when the person transporting it [cash] and driving the vehicle has no apparent means to produce that kind of income or have that kind of money. And Exhibit 3 tells us that her [claimant\u2019s] income peaked I think at one year at Fourteen Thousand (14,000) and usually it is Four to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) a year. So there is no good explanation why she would have it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The circuit court\u2019s suspicion about the claimant\u2019s ability to produce such a large amount of income, given the evidence of claimant\u2019s negligible taxable earnings, is also a factor that federal courts have used in concluding that there is sufficient evidence to support a drug forfeiture. For example, in <em>United States v $174,206 in United States Currency, </em>320 F3d 658, 662 (CA 6, 2003), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that evidence of the claimants\u2019 lack of legitimate income, by itself, was sufficient evidence to support the forfeiture of cash:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The United States has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the properly [$174,206 in cash] is traceable to the drug offenses and is thus subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6). The evidence before the district court showed that the Claimants\u2019 legitimate income was insufficient to explain the large amount of currency found in their possession. State tax records showed that Richard had filed no income tax returns from 1994 through 1999, and that Love had filed no income tax returns from 1994 through 1997. Love\u2019s 1998 and 1999 returns showed income of $ 15,147.00 and $ 15,995.00, respectively. In sum, then, the United States showed that the Claimants had a total of $31,142 in legitimate income between 1994 and 1999. The Claimants\u2019 safe deposit boxes contained $174,206.00. This evidence of legitimate income that is insufficient to explain the large amount of property seized, unrebutted by any evidence pointing to any other source of legitimate income or any evidence indicating innocent ownership, satisfies the burden imposed by the statute.<footnotemark>[31]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The circuit court\u2019s ruling of forfeiture was also based on the testimony of the expert on illegal drug trafficking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">And what we have discovered from hearing the testimony of the expert is that when in patrolling the interstate, and I-94 particularly, that I-94 is a corridor for transporting drug monies westbound and drugs eastbound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">And on the number of stops with large amounts of money with very little exception, large amounts of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>without drugs headed westbound and large amounts of drugs without money is headed easthound. So, what this tells us is that the probability that this is a westbound transportation of drug money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Further, that more often than not rental cars are used for this purpose, and that there are frequent rental of vehicles from Detroit hy the petitioner [claimant] for us. And that makes it more likely that she was transporting drug money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Federal courts have held that evidence seized in a known drug corridor is probative in drug forfeiture cases. For example, in <em>United States v $87,375 in United States Currency, </em>727 F Supp 155, 161 (D NJ, 1989), the district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">The fact that a large amount of money was being transported southward from New York through a well known drug corridor by a Colombian national who resides in Miami further supports the Government\u2019s showing of probable cause.<footnotemark>[32]</footnotemark> The reputation of an area for criminal activity may be relied on to support an inference of criminal conduct. See <em>United States v. Rickus, </em>737 F.2d 360, 365 (3d Cir. 1984). The area where Mr. Camacho was stopped by Trooper Tomasello, along Route 40 in Salem County, New Jersey, carries such a volume of drug traffic that it is commonly known as \u201cCocaine Alley.\u201d See <em>United States v. $ 33,500, </em>Civil Action No. 86-3348(MHC) (D.N.J. Aug. 17, 1988); United States v. $ 32,310, Civil Action No. 85-4004(MHC) (D.N.J. June 23, 1988). Colombia is a known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>major source of drugs which eventually get trafficked throughout the United States, and Miami is a known center for drug trafficking and money laundering. <em>United States v. $ 364,960, </em>661 F2d at 323-24; <em>United States v $ 5,644,540, </em>799 F.2d 1357, 1363 (9th Cir 1986). We are entitled to take such common experience considerations into account. <em>United States v. $ </em>319,820,620 F. Supp. [1470, 1477 (ND Ga, 1985)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">A claimant\u2019s explanation for the presence of large amounts of cash is also evaluated in drug forfeiture cases. Federal courts have held that a claimant\u2019s false statement is probative of drug activity. \u201c[IJnconsistencies and contradictions are relevant in determining whether the government has met its burden in justifying forfeiture.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> For example, in <em>United States v Funds in the Amount of </em>$30,670,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the claimant gave inconsistent testimony about the source of the $30,670 in cash contained in the his gym bag seized by drug enforcement agents. In finding under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d that there was a preponderance of evidence supporting forfeiture, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered the inconsistency and unreliability of the claimant\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Calhoun\u2019s [claimant\u2019s] explanations regarding his travel to Phoenix are suspect. On the day his cash was seized, Calhoun was traveling to Phoenix, a recognized source city for illegal narcotics. See, e.g., <em>[United States v] $22,474 [in United States </em>Currency], 246 F.3d [1212] at 1216 [(CA 9, 2001)] (\u201cPhoenixf] [is] a known source city for drugs.\u201d); cf. <em>United States v. Currency, U.S. $ 42,500.00, </em>283 F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir. 2002) (giving weight to fact that claimant was \u201ctraveling from New York to San Diego, well known source cities for drugs\u201d); <em>United States v. $ 141,770.00 in U.S. Currency, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>157 F.3d 600, 604 (8th Cir. 1998) (giving weight to fact that claimant was traveling from California, \u201ca drug source state\u201d). He had made frequent trips to Phoenix \u2014 seven trips within two months, not three as he claimed. Calhoun alleged that he stayed at the same hotel each trip (at \u201c55th and the expressway\u201d) but could not recall the hotel\u2019s name; subpoenaed travel records indicate that Calhoun did not stay at any hotel at \u201c55th and the expressway.\u201d Yet he stayed in Phoenix at least 27 nights during the two months he had been traveling there (making his forgetfulness all the less credible). All of these inconsistencies are relevant in weighing whether the government has established its burden justifying forfeiture. See <em>[United States </em>u] <em>$ 242,484 \\in United States </em>Currency], 389 F.3d [1149, ] 1164 [(CA 11, 2004)] (finding it proper to consider claimant\u2019s inconsistent statements and changing stories in considering whether the government\u2019s burden is met); $ <em>22,474, </em>246 F.3d at 1217 (\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] inconsistent statements about the money and his reasons for being in Phoenix tended to support an inference that the money was drug related.\u201d); <em>United States v. $ 67,220.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>957 F.2d 280, 286 (6th Cir. 1992) (\u201cMisstatements are probative of possible criminal activity.\u201d) <em>[United States v Funds, supra </em>at 467.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">As was the case in <em>United States v Funds, </em>claimant here gave unreliable and inconsistent testimony about why she had $180,975 in cash in the trunk other rental car.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In addition, claimant\u2019s testimony that she in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tended to use the money to buy a house in Indianapolis was not credible.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> And while the dissent has suggested that if the cash subject to forfeiture is removed from consideration, claimant\u2019s behavior appears \u201cordinary and innocent,\u201d <em>post </em>at 486, we remind the dissent that the circuit court had the benefit of judging the credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony on the stand juxtaposed with the testimony of the illegal drug trafficking expert. Given claimant\u2019s inability to provide a credible explanation for how she came to have such a large amount of cash in a rental car, while traveling along a known drug trafficking corridor, and given her unexplained and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>repeated history of using rental cars, as well as the absence of evidence supporting her explanation for the intended use of such a large amount of cash, the circuit court could properly find that her behavior was not \u201cordinary and innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that ultimately the circuit court found claimant\u2019s testimony unpersuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">Her [claimant\u2019s] testimony [is] that she was transporting the money to buy a house and in the Indianapolis area, that there is no buy/sell agreement. There is no documentation. There is no substantiation of that. Her testimony about the money and how it happened to get into the car was changing and ambiguous, and very honestly not very credible. So when all gets said and done, I don\u2019t give much credibility to her testimony given the contradictions involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In deciding whether there is sufficient evidence to support a ruling of drug forfeiture, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that \u201cwe look to the totality of circumstances and do not try to pick them off, one by one, by conjuring up some alternative hypothesis of innocence to explain each circumstance in isolation.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We conclude that the exclusionary rule was not meant to immunize illegally seized property from a subsequent civil forfeiture proceeding in which the seized property is the subject of the proceeding. We hold that, in accord with <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>and MCL 333.7521, as long as the forfeiture can be established by a preponderance of untainted evidence, the forfeiture is valid. Consequently, it was appropriate for the circuit court to proceed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>forfeiture hearing as long as the illegally seized currency was excluded from evidence. As summarized by the Court of Appeals in its opinion affirming the circuit court, a preponderance of independent evidence supported the forfeiture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">At trial, expert testimony was presented that I-94 is a primary \u201cpipeline\u201d for narcotic sales. Couriers carry large sums of money west on I-94 to purchase drugs in Chicago. The drugs are then transported and delivered east to Detroit and other eastern cities. Cash is the customary method of payment; cars are the most common form of conveyance; couriers frequently use rental cars; and the trips are quick. The evidence indicated that claimant was driving a rental car. Further, in the three-months before the stop, claimant had rented at least four cars for three days each, placed several hundred miles on each car, and did not recall where she had driven. Additionally, her tax records reflected that from 1998 through 2001, claimant generally earned between $ 4,000 and $5,000 a year. An expert opined that the large amount of cash claimant was transporting west on I-94 was consistent with claimant\u2019s being a courier and intending to purchase drugs. <em>[In re Forfeiture of $180,975, </em>slip op at 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Reviewing the circuit court\u2019s findings, under the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d we agree with the Court of Appeals that the circuit court did not clearly err in determining that although the money had been illegally seized, there was a preponderance of untainted evidence to support a civil forfeiture pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals judgment below and we further conclude that the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>reached the correct result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-9\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\"> Because it was not clear that Smith consented to the search of the trunk, after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted Smith\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the backpack and its contents on the ground that the seizure was illegal under the Fourth Amendment, US Const, Am IV, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> No criminal charges arising out of this incident were ever filed against Smith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\"> <em>In re Forfeiture of $180,975, </em>unpublished memorandum opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued December 28, 2004 (Docket No. 249699).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> <em>In re Forfeiture of $180,975, </em>475 Mich 909 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\"> <em>People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448; 339 NW2d 403 (1983); <em>People v United States Currency, </em>148 Mich App 326, 329; 383 NW2d 633 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> <em>Kitchen v Kitchen, </em>465 Mich 654, 661-662; 641 NW2d 245 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\"> 282 US 577, 581; 51 S Ct 282; 75 L Ed 558 (1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\"> <em>United States v Janis, </em>428 US 433, 454; 96 S Ct 3021; 49 L Ed 2d 1046 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> <em>Id. </em>at 453-454.

Because we concluded that the officer\u2019s observations did not amount to a reasonable suspicion and therefore the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, we applied the exclusionary rule to suppress the illegally obtained evidence. <em>LoCicero </em>is thus distinguishable in that it does not address the application of the exclusionary rule in a civil forfeiture proceeding in which the illegally seized property is the \u201cdefendant.\u201d Further, <em>LoCicero </em>does not hold that the identity of the defendant or the circumstances surrounding the existence of the defendant may not be considered when the defendant is illegally seized. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>implications and circumstances surrounding evidence that is the subject of forfeiture and that has been illegally seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The dissent implies that in determining that there was insufficient independent evidence to support a forfeiture, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v $639,558 </em>did not permit the consideration of the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of the illegally seized money; however, the circuit court, in fact, did not even rule on this issue because the prosecutor had already conceded that he could not proceed without the suppressed evidence. <em>United States v $639,558, supra </em>at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In addition, the dissent asserts that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v \u201cMonkey\u201d </em>also did not rely on the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d concerning suppressed evidence, \u201cbut rather held that a forfeiture was supported <em>in spite of </em>the suppression,\u201d <em>post </em>at 482 (emphasis in original), because of independent evidence.

Although evidence of such property was suppressed here, the majority improperly relies on a variety of \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d and \u201cimplications\u201d concerning the illegally seized property (in this case, money) to support the forfeiture award. Absent consideration of these \u201ccircumstances\u201d and \u201cimplications,\u201d the remaining untainted evidence would clearly be insufficient to support the forfeiture. By these means, the majority seeks to make painless the suppression of evidence by rendering it largely irrelevant; in the end, the suppression constitutes a mere inconvenience that has little effect on the government\u2019s ability to use the illegally seized property as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">It is important to note at the outset that the applicability of the exclusionary rule to forfeiture proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ings in general, and the propriety of the trial court\u2019s suppression of the $180,975 in particular, are <em>not </em>at issue here. The prosecutor has not chosen to appeal either of these decisions. Therefore, we must assume for purposes of this appeal that the suppression of evidence was constitutionally required. The <em>only </em>issues on appeal are whether the suppressed evidence may be used to support the forfeiture, and whether, absent this evidence, there is sufficient untainted evidence to support the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Claimant Tamika Smith was stopped for speeding while traveling west on I-94 in a rental car with her two children and an adult male named Todd F. Fletcher. A Law Enforcement Information Network (LEIN) search revealed that Smith\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended. After the state trooper ticketed Smith for speeding and driving on a suspended license, the trooper searched the trunk of the car without Smith\u2019s consent and discovered a backpack filled with $180,975.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The prosecutor subsequently filed the instant complaint for forfeiture of the $180,975, pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted Smith\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to suppress evidence of the money on the basis that it had been seized pursuant to an illegal search, and the prosecutor did not appeal. Following a bench trial, the trial court entered a judgment of forfeiture, finding that, even without the illegally seized evidence, the prosecutor had established that the money was intended to purchase illicit drugs. The court based its decision on the fact that: (1) Smith had \u201ca very large amount of money\u201d; (2) Smith\u2019s income peaked at $14,000 a year and she was usually making $4,000 to $5,000 a year; (3) westbound 1-94 is a known corridor for transporting drug monies from Detroit to Chicago; (4) rental cars are frequently used to transport drugs; and (5) Smith had frequently rented cars in Detroit. The Court of Appeals affirmed, further noting that \u201can expert [witness] opined that the large amount of cash claimant was transporting west on I-94 was consistent with claimant\u2019s being a courier and intending to purchase drugs.\u201d Unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 28, 2004 (Docket No. 249699), slip op at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">A. EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The exclusionary rule generally bars the introduction into evidence of materials seized and observations made during an unconstitutional search. <em>Weeks v United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>States, </em>232 US 383; 34 S Ct 341; 58 L Ed 652 (1914); <em>Silverman v United States, </em>365 US 505; 81 S Ct 679; 5 L Ed 2d 734 (1961); see also <em>People v LoCicero, </em>453 Mich 496, 508; 556 NW2d 498 (1996) (\u201cThe exclusionary rule forbids the use of direct and indirect evidence acquired from governmental misconduct, such as evidence from an illegal police search.\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643, 648; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961) (\u201c \u2018[T]he Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 563, defines \u201cexclusion\u201d of evidence as \u201c[t]he action by the trial judge in which he excludes from consideration by the trier of fact whatever he rules is not admissible as evidence.\u201d To \u201cexclude\u201d is defined by <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997) as \u201c1. to shut or keep out; prevent entrance of. 2. to shut out from consideration, privilege, etc. 3. to expel and keep out; thrust out; eject.\u201d \u201cSuppression of evidence\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he ruling of a trial judge to the effect that evidence sought to be admitted should be excluded because it was illegally acquired,\u201d and to \u201csuppress evidence\u201d as \u201cto keep it from being used in a trial by showing that it was either gathered illegally or that it is irrelevant.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1440. To \u201csuppress\u201d is defined as \u201cto do away with by or as if by authority; abolish; stop (a practice, custom, etc.); to withhold from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>disclosure or publication (evidence, a book, etc.); to keep (a thought, memory, etc.) out of conscious awareness.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Thus, once suppressed or excluded, evidence should generally be treated as nonexistent and withheld from disclosure and consideration in legal proceedings, except under very specifically delineated exceptions. See, e.g., <em>United States v Havens, </em>446 US 620; 100 S Ct 1912; 64 L Ed 2d 559 (1980) (although illegally seized evidence is inadmissible as substantive evidence, it is admissible for impeachment purposes); <em>United States v Calandra, </em>414 US 338; 94 S Ct 613; 38 L Ed 2d 561 (1974) (illegally seized evidence is admissible in grand jury proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">As the majority correctly notes, in a civil forfeiture proceeding where the illegally seized property is itself the \u201cdefendant,\u201d such property is not entirely excluded from the forfeiture proceedings, but rather, \u201cmay be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of establishing its existence, and the court\u2019s <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over it.\u201d <em>$639,558, supra </em>at 715 n 5. In other words, the excluded property may be identified as the defendant in a forfeiture proceeding, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 US 1032, 1039-1040; 104 S Ct 3479; 82 L Ed 2d 778 (1984), but may not be \u201crelied upon to sustain a forfeiture.\u201d <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v Pennsylvania, </em>380 US 693, 698; 85 S Ct 1246; 14 L Ed 2d 170 (1965); <em>$639,558, supra </em>at 715 n 5. Despite its exclusion, the illegally seized property remains subject to forfeiture under MCL 333.7521 if the forfeiture can be supported by a preponderance of other, untainted evidence. See <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, supra </em>at 89; <em>People v United States Currency, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>158 Mich App 126, 130; 404 NW2d 634 (1986); <em>United States v \u201cMonkey,\u201d a Fishing Vessel, </em>725 F2d 1007, 1012 (CA 5, 1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">B. MAJORITY\u2019S REDEFINITION OF EXCLUSIONARY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">While the majority purports to apply this law, it effectively redefines the law to avoid the necessary consequences of the exclusionary rule. It does this through its central assertions that the use of suppressed evidence \u201cshould be limited to the circumstances surrounding its existence,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 460, that the court must not \u201cturn a blind eye to the conclusions one reaches when considering all of the circumstances surrounding [the suppressed evidence\u2019s] existence and its implications,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 462<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that \u201cwhile the court may not consider the specific physical characteristics of the item itself, the court can consider evidence presented in relation to the fact of the item\u2019s existence, such as the fact that claimant\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>about the money itself is questionable,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 463.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority also effectively redefines this law through its conclusion that \u201cthe court can consider the reliability of the claimant\u2019s testimony concerning the money\u2019s origin, its existence in her rental car, its intended purpose, the amount of the money in relation to her reported income . . ., and any other circumstantial factors not specifically related to the physical characteristics of the money,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 463, and that \u201cthe trial court could properly consider the implications of the presence of such a large amount of cash in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 464. Apparently, all that the majority would exclude from consideration is the color of the currency and the Presidents who are pictured on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">However, as noted, suppressed evidence is admissible only to \u201cestablish its existence,\u201d not \u201cthe <em>circumstances </em>surrounding its existence\u201d or their \u201cimplications.\u201d While we may consider the fact that the excluded property subject to forfeiture <em>exists, </em>as a consequence of the suppression, we may not rely on <em>any other </em>information relating to this property, such as the place where it was found, its value, its physical characteristics, or any explanation regarding its origin or intended use, to sustain the property\u2019s forfeiture. The \u201cestablishment of its existence\u201d exception to suppression is required to allow identification of the defendant property and to justify the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the property. Because suppressed evidence is inadmissible for broader purposes, <em>LoCicero, supra </em>at 508, the majority\u2019s new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>rule, which allows the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of the illegally seized property and their \u201cimplications\u201d to be considered, constitutes an incorrect reading of the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In avoiding the necessary consequences of the exclusionary rule, the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and now the majority have each made increasing use of evidence that must be considered nonexistent. The trial court based its forfeiture, in part, on the fact that Smith was transporting \u201ca very large amount of money,\u201d which was unlikely to be the product of her legitimate income, and that Smith had not given a credible explanation for the presence of the money in the trunk of her rental car. The Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[a]n expert opined that the large amount of cash claimant was transporting west on 1-94 was consistent with claimant\u2019s being a courier and intending to purchase drugs.\u201d Slip op at 2. The majority quotes with approval both the trial court and Court of Appeals decisions, and concludes that \u201cwhile the cash itself was excluded from evidence, the trial court could properly consider the implications of the presence of such a large amount of cash in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>C. MAJORITY\u2019S RELIANCE ON IRRELEVANT CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">I cannot recall an opinion of this Court that employs caselaw as much to obscure as to illuminate. The several dozen cases cited in the majority opinion, with a single exception, either stand for undisputed propositions of law or are irrelevant to the question whether the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d and \u201cimplications\u201d of illegally seized property may be considered to support a forfeiture. With that single exception, the cases cited by the majority can fairly be characterized as standing for three distinct propositions of law \u2014 none of which is in dispute and none of which actually supports the rule announced by the majority. These propositions of law may be stated as follows: (1) illegally seized property may only be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of establishing its existence and the court\u2019s jurisdiction over it; (2) illegally seized property may still be forfeited, as long as the forfeiture is supported by sufficient untainted evidence; and (3) the circumstances surrounding the <em>lawful </em>seizure of property, such as the amount or value of the property, a claimant\u2019s lack of legitimate income, the place where the property was seized, and a claimant\u2019s false statements, can be relied on to support a forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">There is no dispute, for example, that illegally seized property may be offered into evidence for the limited purpose of establishing its existence and the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Moreover, there is no dispute that illegally seized property may be forfeited on the basis of other, lawfully obtained evidence. However, the cases cited by the majority in support of these commonplace propositions of law do <em>not </em>speak to the permissibility of allowing consideration of the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d or \u201cimplications\u201d of illegally seized property. From a commonplace proposition, the majority pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ceeds to an invented proposition. Indeed, some of the cases cited by the majority are not merely irrelevant, but support the opposite of the majority\u2019s new rule. For example, in <em>$639,558, </em>evidence of a positive drug-dog sniff of the claimant\u2019s luggage and money seized from his luggage were suppressed because of an illegal search. With that evidence suppressed, the only remaining untainted evidence was the fact that the claimant was engaged in a \u201csuspicious\u201d form of travel and that he was departing from a city known to be a source of drugs \u2014 evidence that bears a striking similarity to the untainted evidence in the instant case. Solely on the basis of the untainted evidence, the prosecutor conceded,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals did not dispute, that there was insufficient evidence remaining to support the forfeiture. In other words, the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of the illegally seized money, such as the fact that the claimant was carrying a \u201clarge amount of money,\u201d were not considered and, therefore, the forfeiture proceeding was dismissed. Likewise, in <em>\u201cMonkey\u201d, </em>the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not rely on the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d of the evidence illegally seized from the fishing vessel, but rather held that a forfeiture was supported <em>in spite of </em>the suppression on the basis of inferences resulting from the claimant\u2019s criminal trial and certain admissions made by the claimant in his appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Finally, the majority purports to set forth a catalog of cases supporting its view that the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d and \u201cimplications\u201d of illegally seized property may be considered to support a forfeiture. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>each of these cases, with, as already noted, a single exception, involved <em>legal </em>searches and seizures. Once more, there is no dispute that evidence drawn from <em>lawfully </em>seized property is fully admissible in support of a forfeiture. <em>Any </em>information concerning such evidence, including their \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d and \u201cimplications,\u201d was admissible in support of their forfeiture. Most certainly, these cases do not stand for the majority\u2019s proposition that unlawfully obtained evidence may be relied on to sustain its own forfeiture.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Once the majority\u2019s irrelevant caselaw is set aside, there is not much left. All that remains is a single trial court decision containing not a single sentence of reasoning and not a single word of analysis, indeed a decision subsequently rendered a nullity by the appellate court. <em>United States v $22,287 in United States Currency, </em>520 F Supp 675, 680 (ED Mich, 1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>$22,287, </em>the court noted that $22,287, which had been excluded, constituted \u201can unusually large amount of cash for any individual to have on hand, [and] is very close to the price of \u2018nineteen five\u2019 ($19,500.00) noted by Johnny [an alleged drug dealer] as the cost of an \u2018lb\u2019 (pound of heroin).\u201d As a result, the court relied on this excluded evidence, as well as other untainted evidence, to grant the forfeiture. The court reached this conclusion with absolutely <em>no </em>analysis justifying its reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>on the suppressed evidence. Moreover, the persuasive force of this case \u2014 already minimal to begin with given its absence of analysis \u2014 is further diminished, if not altogether nullified, by the fact that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently determined that no illegal search had occurred and therefore rejected <em>any </em>exclusion of evidence. 709 F2d 442 (CA 6, 1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">D. PROPER APPLICATION OF EXCLUSIONARY RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The majority acknowledges that the <em>only </em>purpose for which excluded evidence may be used in the instant forfeiture action is to establish its \u201cexistence\u201d and the court\u2019s jurisdiction over it, but then concludes that other information regarding the excluded property is admissible. However, under traditional understandings of what it means for property to be \u201csuppressed,\u201d the trial court could not rely on the fact that Smith was actually carrying money in the car, that the money was seized in a known drug corridor, that the amount of money was substantial, that Smith did not have the means to legitimately possess this amount of money, or that Smith could not give a credible explanation about why she was carrying this amount of money with her.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Under the rule of <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, </em>except for its mere existence, <em>all </em>other evidence pertaining to the money is deemed inadmissible; no matter how indispensable this evidence, the court may not rely on it in support of a forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Absent the suppressed evidence, the evidence in this case is clearly insufficient to support forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, the untainted evidence \u2014 what is left after the illegally seized money has been excluded from consideration, as it must be\u2014 supports two points of fact: (1) Smith, who has a very low income, was driving a rental car to Chicago for the fifth time in three months; and (2) drug couriers frequently carry large sums of money from Detroit to Chicago in rental cars. However, absent the evidence that Smith was actually carrying a large sum of money in a drug corridor at the time of the stop, there is simply no logical connection or nexus between these propositions. Such a logical connection or nexus is simply severed by the exclusionary rule. What is left is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Smith, a person of low income, was a frequent traveler between Detroit and Chicago, a well-recognized drug corridor, in a rental car. These circumstances undoubtedly describe many persons who are not involved in the drug trade, and they describe what may be understood as entirely innocent behavior. It is only when the money is taken into consideration that this ordinary and innocent behavior is transformed into something less benign.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is only when the money is taken into consideration that there is some semblance of a \u201cdrug courier profile\u201d that emerges. Yet, the money cannot be taken into consideration because it has been suppressed and because the prosecutor has chosen not to challenge this suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Moreover, Smith made no admissions of any kind, no evidence arose out of any criminal proceedings against her (for there were no such proceedings), Smith was not traveling with a known drug courier, and there was no witness testimony connecting Smith and large amounts of money, or otherwise indicating her involvement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>drug trafficking. Accordingly, the untainted evidence is insufficient to support the forfeiture under MCL 333.7521(1)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">III. OBSERVATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">This Court has previously acknowledged the \u201cvery high cost of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>People v Goldston, </em>470 Mich 523, 540; 682 NW2d 479 (2004); see also <em>People v Hawkins, </em>468 Mich 488, 500 n 9; 668 NW2d 602 (2003). When suppression occurs, the prosecutor on behalf of the people is deprived of essential evidence in the presentation of his or her case, the fact-finder is denied access to potentially relevant facts and information, the justice system is impeded in its ability to discern the truth about wrongdoing, and the people must suffer within their communities persons who have harmed others and gone unpunished for their conduct. As Justice CORRIGAN has observed, by denying the fact-finder access to evidence, the exclusionary rule \u201cimpedes, rather than promotes, the truth-seeking function of the judiciary and thereby hinders public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Goldston, supra </em>at 540 n 9. The criminal trial regrettably must proceed \u201cas though the dead body in the basement did not exist, as though the illegal firearm under the sofa was never really there, and as though the incendiary materials in the garage were merely a figment of one\u2019s imagination.\u201d <em>Goldston, supra </em>at 545 (MAEKMAN, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Given that there is no more important function of government than ensuring domestic tranquility and protecting people from violent predators, the costs of the exclusionary rule are extraordinarily high. I do not favor this rule, for I do not believe that it is required by the constitution. Nonetheless, the United States Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>preme Court has mandated this rule, and evidence that is illegally seized must be suppressed. And \u201csuppressed\u201d means \u201csuppressed\u201d; it does not mean that courts may characterize evidence as \u201csuppressed\u201d while, in fact, relying upon that evidence to support its own forfeiture. While I too might wish that suppression of evidence could be less painful to the justice system, it is precisely because of its painfulness that I, as well as others in the majority, have been so concerned about the rule for so long. Where evidence has been illegally obtained, the rule of suppression requires that the legal system be deprived of even the most credible evidence, including whatever \u201cimplications\u201d can be drawn from its \u201csurrounding circumstances.\u201d The majority alleviates the costs of suppression, but only by transforming suppression into something other than what it must be.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On the basis of MCL 333.7521, <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency, </em>and the traditional meaning of \u201csuppression,\u201d I would hold that suppressed evidence is admissible in a civil forfeiture proceeding for the limited purpose of establishing its existence as the defendant and the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the property, but that such evidence may not properly be relied on in a substantive fashion to sustain a forfeiture, even when this is done purportedly to assess the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the existence\u201d of the evidence, and the \u201cimplications\u201d of the evidence. Rather, the trial court must determine whether legally seized evidence, i.e., untainted evidence, is sufficient to sustain the forfeiture. Because the untainted evidence here was not sufficient to support the forfeiture, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate the judgment of forfeiture.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> MCL 333.7521(1)(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">The following property is subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">(f) Any thing of value that is furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled substance, an imitation controlled substance, or other drug in violation of this article that is traceable to an exchange for a controlled substance, an imitation controlled substance, or other drug in violation of this article or that is used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of this article including, but not limited to, money, negotiable instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ments, or securities. To the extent of the interest of an owner, a thing of value is not subject to forfeiture under this subdivision by reason of any act or omission that is established by the owner of the item to have been committed or omitted without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent. Any money that is found in close proximity to any property that is subject to forfeiture under subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) is presumed to be subject to forfeiture under this subdivision. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> The majority argues that <em>LoCicero </em>is not applicable to this case, because <em>LoCicero </em>addressed the exclusionary rule in the context of a criminal proceeding, rather than a civil forfeiture proceeding. I fail to see the slightest relevance in this observation. The fact remains that the evidence in this case <em>was </em>suppressed and that the prosecutor did not challenge this suppression. The only question before this Court concerns the <em>impact </em>of that suppression, an impact that our decision in <em>LoCicero </em>accurately described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> As the majority correctly notes, the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Forfeiture of United States Currency </em>relied on an erroneous standard of proof; the correct burden of proof is \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d not \u201cprobable cause.\u201d See <em>People v United States Currency, </em>158 Mich App 126, 130; 404 NW2d 634 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"> In support of this assertion, the majority cites <em>United States v $242,484 in United States Currency, </em>389 F3d 1149, 1167 (CA 11, 2004), in which the federal court stated, \u201c[W]e do not take an academic or theoretical approach. Instead, we eschew clinical detachment and use a common sense view to the realities of normal life.\u201d Whatever a \u201ccommon sense view\u201d may suggest to the majority, this statement is taken entirely out of context. Unlike the instant case, <em>$242,484 in United States Currency </em>involved a lawful search after which the evidence of money was not suppressed. The court there merely addressed the extent to which evidence of money could be considered for the purposes of establishing probable cause that the money was related to illegal drugs. While the federal court\u2019s proposition is commonplace, the majority\u2019s application of this proposition is extraordinary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> It is not clear whether the majority is suggesting that the suppressed evidence of money was properly admitted because it was used to impeach Smith. The majority simply utters this assertion without any apparent context or purpose. However, even if this evidence <em>were </em>used for such a purpose, it was <em>also </em>used by the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and the majority for obvious non-impeachment purposes to affirmatively support a finding of forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> Moreover, the majority fails to apply its own rule in an understandable or consistent manner. On the one hand, that the money was seized in a rental car driven by a low-income driver in a known drug corridor are all circumstances relied on by the majority to sustain the present forfeiture. <em>Ante </em>at 464-472. On the other hand, the majority states that \u201cthe state should not be permitted to exploit the search by asking how the money was packaged, or whether evidence of drugs was detected on the money.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 460. However, the latter are also \"circumstances surrounding the property\u2019s existence.\u201d I fail to understand, and the majority does not explain, the basis for differentiating those circumstances that the majority would allow to be considered and those circumstances that it would not. What are the standards for distinguishing between these classes of \u201ccircumstances\u201d?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\"> Apparently, the prosecutor in <em>$639,558, </em>unlike the majority, understood that \u201csuppressed\u201d means \u201csuppressed,\u201d and \u201cexcluded\u201d means \u201cexcluded,\u201d and thus recognized that the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d or \u201cimplications\u201d of illegally seized property could not be used to support its forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b571-5\"> The majority responds that these cases are relevant because they relate to the prosecutor\u2019s belated argument that the exclusionary rule does not apply to a civil forfeiture proceeding. <em>Ante </em>at 464 n 29. However, the issue of the applicability of the exclusionary rule to a civil forfeiture proceeding is <em>not </em>before this Court; the <em>only </em>issue is whether the suppressed evidence may be used to support its own forfeiture. Thus, the cases strewn throughout this opinion by the majority may be \u201crelevant,\u201d but only to an irrelevant issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> Given that this Court is not bound by the decisions of lower federal courts, perhaps the majority might wish to share what it is they find most persuasive in the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\"> That is, because the trial court erred in excluding evidence, the Sixth Circuit had no need to consider whether the trial court also erred in relying on excluded evidence; concomitantly, if the trial court had not erred, it would also have had no need to rely on excluded evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> The majority argues that this dissent\u2019s \u201creasoning has been rejected\u201d in <em>United States v $493,850 in United States Currency, </em>2006 US Dist LEXIS 2370 (D Ariz, January 23, 2006). <em>Ante </em>at 462. In that case, the \u201c[cjlaimants argue[d] [that] the Court may not even acknowledge that one of the defendants is money but rather must deal with the defendant money as if it were a \u2018widget.\u2019 \u201d <em>$493,850 in United States Currency, supra </em>at *15. The court held that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">does not believe that exclusion of the cash means the Court must consider the defendant cash as a \u201cwidget.\u201d The Court believes it can still take notice of the fact that the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>cash. This is obviously stated in the caption of the case. Perhaps the denominations making up the amount and the actual money itself cannot be put into evidence. However, there is no way for the Government to show that a \u201cwidget\u201d is the product of a drug transaction and, therefore, the Court does not believe it has to disregard the fact that one of the defendants is cash. <em>[Id. </em>at *15-16.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\"><em>$493,850 </em>merely stands for the proposition that the illegally seized cash must be identified as what it is, i.e., that the defendant\u2019s identity need not be obscured or hidden. Moreover, the trial court did not rely on the fact of the money, or any inferences drawn from the amount of money identified as the defendant, in order to support the forfeiture. Rather, it relied exclusively on untainted evidence, including the facts that the claimants met on several occasions with known drug dealers, were negotiating with the drug dealer on price, and the vehicle that the government sought to forfeit was observed by the police at the drug dealer\u2019s home. Nothing in <em>$493,850 </em>refutes what is set forth in this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> The majority argues that Smith\u2019s \u201cbehavior was not \u2018ordinary and innocent\u2019 \u201d if we take into consideration \u201cclaimant\u2019s inability to provide a credible explanation for how she came to have such a large amount of cash in a rental car\u201d and \u201cthe absence of evidence supporting her explanation for the intended use of such a large quantity of cash,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 470 and 471, \u201cjuxtaposed with the testimony of the illegal drug trafficking expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, this is quite true <em>if </em>we are allowed to consider these circumstances. But that, of course, is the nub of the question. <em>Are </em>we allowed to consider these circumstances under the exclusionary rule? I believe not, because such evidence has been made nonexistent under the rule for almost all purposes. Because the majority evaluates the presence of the money in Smith\u2019s car, the amount of the money, and the source and use of the money, it is clearly acting beyond the scope of the exclusionary rule. Credible or not, the trial court could not rely on this evidence to establish that the money was connected to an illegal drug activity. Absent such evidence, Smith resembles any other person who travels from Detroit to Chicago in a rental car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFv\">(dissenting).

The Supreme Court has not overruled <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan. </em>In fact, that Court continues to recognize its viability.
