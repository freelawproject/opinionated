Generally, the provision of the General Property Tax Act (GPTA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at issue in this case, as well as recent amendments of the GPTA, reflect a legislative effort to provide finality to foreclosure judgments and to quickly return property to the tax rolls. However, this legislative regime is problematic when the property owner is not provided with constitutionally adequate notice of the foreclosure. This is because MCL 211.78k(6) serves to insulate violations of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution and of the Michigan Constitution from judicial review and redress, thereby completely denying the property owner procedural due process. As applied to the limited class of property owners who have been denied due process in this statutory foreclosure scheme, this provision of the GPTA is unconstitutional. Therefore, for the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Wayne Circuit Court\u2019s order vacating the judgment of foreclosure and restoring the church\u2019s title to the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The property owner in this case, Perfecting Church, purchased two parcels for use as parking lots during its church services. Both parcels were transferred by a single deed that the church properly recorded. Nevertheless, after the church purchased and recorded a <em>single deed </em>for both the parcels, the Wayne County Treasurer listed one parcel on the Wayne County foreclosure listing. The church paid the outstanding taxes on that parcel and the treasurer assured the church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that there were no further outstanding taxes on either parcel. Despite those assurances, the treasurer initiated foreclosure proceedings against the other parcel. However, the church never received notice of the pending foreclosure because the treasurer did not comply with the notice provisions of the GPTA. Specifically, the treasurer sent the statutorily required notice to the <em>previous </em>owner and did not post a notice on either of the parcels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the church had no notice of the foreclosure proceedings. The Wayne Circuit Court entered a judgment of foreclosure. After the redemption period passed, Wayne County sold the property to the intervening parties, Matthew Tatarian and Michael Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Subsequent to the sale, the church learned of the foreclosure and sale, and it filed a motion for relief from the foreclosure judgment in the Wayne Circuit Court. That court granted the church\u2019s motion and the Court of Appeals denied the intervening parties\u2019 delayed application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4This Court granted their application for leave, directing the parties to address two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">(1) whether the trial court retained jurisdiction to grant relief from the judgment of foreclosure pursuant to MCR 2.612(C), notwithstanding the provisions of MCL 211.87[l](1) and (2); and (2) whether MCL 211.78[Z] permits a person to be deprived of property without being afforded due process.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">This Court reviews questions of law, such as issues of constitutional and statutory construction, de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Under the GPTA, a \u201cforeclosing governmental unit shall file a single petition with the clerk of the circuit court of that county listing all property forfeited and not redeemed to the county treasurer under [MCL 211.78g] to be foreclosed under [MCL 211.78k].... \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before the hearing on the petition, the foreclosing governmental unit must provide proof of service of the notices required under the statute, as well as proof of the personal visit to the property and publication.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The circuit court then must make a series of factual determinations to complete the foreclosure process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 9At the time the county foreclosed the church\u2019s property, the GPTA provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5)(c) and (e),<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> fee simple title to property set forth in a petition for foreclosure filed under section 78h on which forfeited delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees are not paid within 21 days after the entry of judgment shall vest absolutely in the foreclosing governmental unit, and the foreclosing governmental unit shall have absolute title to the property. The foreclosing governmental unit\u2019s title is not subject to any recorded or unrecorded lien and shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>be stayed or held invalid except as provided in subsection (7)<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The statute also provides for an appeal to the Court of Appeals within 21 days of the judgment of foreclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 Finally, the GPTA provides property owners who claim they did not receive any notice an action for monetary damages in the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The intervening parties challenge the propriety of the grant of relief from judgment obtained by the church. They argue that MCL 211.78k(6) precludes the circuit court from staying or holding the governmental unit\u2019s title invalid. Furthermore, because the church did not avail itself of the redemption or appeal provision contained in subsections 6 and 7, it is limited to an action for monetary damages under MCL 211.78l.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The intervening parties accurately construe these provisions of the GPTA. If a property owner does not redeem the property or appeal the judgment of foreclosure within 21 days, then MCL 211.78k(6) deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction to alter the judgment of foreclosure. MCL 211.78k(6) vests <em>absolute title </em>in the foreclosing governmental unit, and if the taxpayer does not redeem the property or avail itself of the appeal process in subsection 7, then title <em>\u201cshall not </em>be stayed or held invalid....\u201d This language reflects a clear effort to limit the jurisdiction of courts so that judgments of foreclosure may not be modified other than through the limited procedures provided in the GPTA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The only possible remedy for such a property owner would be an action for monetary damages based on a claim that the property owner did not receive any notice. In the majority of cases, this regime provides an appropriate procedure for foreclosing property because the statute requires notices that are consistent with minimum due process standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">However, the church argues that because the county denied it due process when taking its property, the church can avoid the limitations of the statute. The intervening parties respond that regardless of the property owner\u2019s claim, the statute only provides for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>remedy once the redemption and appeals period has passed \u2014 a claim for monetary damages under MCL 211.78l.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">As stated, we believe that the intervening parties\u2019 interpretation of the GPTA is correct. The act does not provide an exception for property owners who are denied due process. Thus, the intervening parties correctly assert that the GPTA does not provide relief for the church or other property owners who are denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The question then becomes whether such a regime is constitutional when it operates to deprive a property owner of its property without due process. This Court must presume a statute is constitutional and construe it as such, unless the only proper construction renders the statute unconstitutional.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court recently has held that \u201cdue process requires the government to provide \u2018notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u201c \u2018when notice is a person\u2019s due. . . [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, \u201c[d]ue process does not require that a property owner receive <em>actual notice </em>before the government may take his property.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>As noted above, the statute permits a foreclosing governmental unit to ignore completely the mandatory notice provisions of the GPTA, seize absolute title to a taxpayer\u2019s property, and sell the property, leaving the circuit court impotent to provide a remedy for the blatant deprivation of due process. That interpretation, allowing for the deprivation of due process without any redress would be patently unconstitutional.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Unfortunately, as noted above, the plain language of the statute simply does not permit a construction that renders the statute constitutional because the statute\u2019s jurisdictional limitation encompasses all foreclosures, including those where there has been a failure to satisfy minimum due process requirements, as well as those situations in which constitutional notice is provided, but the property owner does not receive actual notice. In cases where the foreclosing governmental unit complies with the GPTA notice provisions, MCL 211.78k is not problematic.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, MCL 211.78l provides in such cases a damages remedy that is not constitutionally required. However, in cases where the foreclosing entity fails to provide <em>constitutionally adequate </em>notice, MCL 211.78k permits a property owner to be deprived of the property without due process of law. Because the Legislature cannot create a statutory regime that allows for constitutional violations with no recourse, that portion of the statute purporting to limit the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>court\u2019s jurisdiction to modify judgments of foreclosure is unconstitutional and unenforceable as applied to property owners who are denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Because there is no construction of the GPTA that renders the statute constitutional in cases where the taxing authority has denied the taxpayer due process, the statute is unconstitutional as applied to those individuals. In the present case, the county completely failed to comply with the notice provisions in the GPTA. As such, the county deprived the church of its property without providing due process. Therefore, for the reasons stated, we affirm the order of the Wayne Circuit Court that restored the church\u2019s title to the property in question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-6\">Taylor, C.J., and CORRIGAN and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> MCL 211.1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\"> MCL 211.78i requires the foreclosing entity to notify the property owner by certified mail.

Specifically, does the GPTA deprive a circuit court of jurisdiction to grant relief under MCR 2.612(C) from its prior foreclosure judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I would hold that the relevant provisions of MCL 211.78 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in effect at the time the petition for foreclosure was filed in this matter did not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction to grant respondent Perfecting Church relief from the circuit court\u2019s foreclosure judgment. I therefore concur in the result reached by the majority affirming the circuit court\u2019s order granting Perfecting Church\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">On July 1, 1999, respondent Perfecting Church purchased two vacant Wayne County properties for $100,000 and used both properties as parking lots for church service attendees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 14, 2002, the Wayne County Treasurer filed a petition for foreclosure listing several thousand properties with unpaid taxes for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>year 2000. The properties at issue here, the second lot and the first lot, were included in those foreclosure proceedings. On March 10, 2003, the Wayne Circuit Court entered a judgment of foreclosure regarding both of the vacant properties owned by Perfecting Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Pursuant to MCL 211.78i, the treasurer\u2019s office had a duty to mail notice of the pending foreclosure to the current owner, Perfecting Church. However, because of a recording error in the treasurer\u2019s office, the properties were not listed on the tax rolls as being owned by Perfecting Church, and so the treasurer\u2019s office sent the foreclosure notice to the <em>former </em>owner, <em>not to </em>Perfecting Church. In addition, the posted notice of foreclosure was incorrectly placed on a neighbor\u2019s adjacent lot, rather than on either the first lot or the second lot owned by Perfecting Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Consequently, Perfecting Church never received notice of the pending foreclosure. It was not until October 2003, seven months after the circuit court entered the foreclosure judgment, that Perfecting Church became aware of the tax delinquency pertaining to the first lot when the church\u2019s general manager saw it listed in the Wayne County forfeiture listing. After contacting the Wayne County Treasurer\u2019s office, Perfecting Church obtained and paid the tax bill for the first lot on October 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">At that time, Perfecting Church also inquired about the tax status of the second lot and was advised by the treasurer\u2019s office that payment of taxes on the first lot would cover the second lot as well, because both properties were listed on the same deed. Apparently, this assertion by the treasurer\u2019s office was incorrect, and Wayne County subsequently sold the second lot at auction. On November 4, 2003, the treasurer conveyed the second lot by quitclaim deed to the purchasers at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the auction, intervening appellants Matthew Tatarian and Michael Kelly (appellants).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On May 14, 2004, pursuant to MCR 2.612(C)(1)(d) and (f), Perfecting Church filed a motion for relief from the judgment of foreclosure in the Wayne Circuit Court, alleging that it never received notice of the property foreclosure, which constitutes a violation of MCL 211.78i, MCL 211.78j, and MCL 211.78k; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; and US Const, Am XIV, \u00a7 1. On July 7, 2004, the circuit court granted Perfecting Church\u2019s motion and vacated the foreclosure judgment. Appellants filed a delayed application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals, asserting that MCL 211.78l(1) and (2) barred Perfecting Church from pursuing a motion for relief from the judgment of foreclosure, and that Perfecting Church was required to settle the matter in the Court of Claims. The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal on the basis of lack of merit in the grounds presented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Appellants sought leave to appeal in this Court. This Court granted the application and directed the parties to include among the issues to be briefed: (1) whether the trial court retained jurisdiction to grant relief from the judgment of foreclosure pursuant to MCR 2.612(C), notwithstanding the provisions of MCL 211.78l(1) and (2); and (2) whether MCL 211.78l permits a person to be deprived of property without being afforded due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Lapeer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Co Clerk v Lapeer Circuit Judges, </em>465 Mich 559, 566; 640 NW2d 567 (2002). Questions of statutory construction are also reviewed de novo. <em>Grimes v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>475 Mich 72, 76; 715 NW2d 275 (2006). Finally, questions concerning the constitutionality of a statutory provision are subject to review de novo. <em>City of Taylor v Detroit Edison Co, </em>475 Mich 109, 115; 715 NW2d 28 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The GPTA authorizes county treasurers to foreclose on tax-delinquent property and to sell the property at auction to satisfy tax delinquencies. <em>Republic Bank v Genesee Co Treasurer, </em>471 Mich 732, 737; 690 NW2d 917 (2005). However, a person may not be deprived of property without due process of law. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; US Const, Am XIV, \u00a7 1. In <em>Dow v Michigan, </em>396 Mich 192, 210; 240 NW2d 450 (1976), this Court held that due process requires that before the government takes a person\u2019s property by foreclosure, the person must be afforded notice and the right to contest the foreclosure. Following our decision in <em>Dow, </em>the Legislature added additional notice provisions to the GPTA to satisfy the constitutional due process requirements set forth in <em>Dow. </em>See, e.g., <em>Smith v Cliffs on the Bay Condo Ass\u2019n, </em>463 Mich 420, 428-429; 617 NW2d 536 (2000). As a result, the GPTA sets forth an extensive set of procedures to provide a property owner with notice in the tax foreclosure and sale process. <em>Id. </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This Court must presume that MCL 211.78 <em>et seq. </em>are constitutional. <em>People v McQuillan, </em>392 Mich 511, 536; 221 NW2d 569 (1974). A presumption exists that the Legislature would not violate the constitution. <em>Id. </em>If a statute can be interpreted as being either constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>or unconstitutional, this Court must choose the constitutional interpretation of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Among the foreclosure provisions of the GPTA, three are relevant to the disposition of this case: MCL 211.78i(10), MCL 211.78k(6), and MCL 211.78l(1) and (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> MCL 211.78(2) affirms that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this act relating to the return, forfeiture, and foreclosure of property for delinquent taxes satisfy the minimum requirements of due process . . ..\u201d The reference to \u201cthe minimum requirements of due process\u201d is substantially repeated in MCL 211.78i(10), which defines the notice required of governmental entities before foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Section 78i(10)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">The failure of the foreclosing governmental unit to comply with any provision of this section shall not invalidate any proceeding under this act if the owner of a property interest or a person to whom a tax deed was issued is accorded the minimum due process required under the state constitution of 1963 and the constitution of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Essentially, \u00a7 78i(10) provides that as long as the property owner against whom foreclosure is sought is accorded notice satisfying minimum due process, the failure of the governmental entity to comply with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>provisions in this section does not invalidate the proceeding. The linchpin of a valid foreclosure then is that a property owner must be \u201caccorded the minimum due process required under the state constitution of 1963 and the constitution of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The next relevant provision is MCL 211.78k(6), which defines the state of the title to the foreclosed property. The version of \u00a7 78k(6) in effect at the time of this foreclosure stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Fee simple title to property set forth in a petition for foreclosure filed under section 78h on which forfeited delinquent taxes, interest, penalties, and fees are not paid within 21 days after the entry of judgment shall vest absolutely in the foreclosing governmental unit, and the foreclosing governmental unit shall have absolute title to the property. The foreclosing governmental unit\u2019s title is not subject to any recorded or unrecorded lien and shall not be stayed or held invalid except as provided in subsection (7).<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In other words, once a valid judgment of foreclosure is entered, MCL 211.78k(6) establishes that the fee simple title to the foreclosed property \u201cshall vest absolutely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the foreclosing governmental unit, and the foreclosing governmental unit shall have absolute title to the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">After title vests in the foreclosing governmental entity pursuant to \u00a7 78k(6), MCL 211.78l establishes what remedy is available to the owner of the extinguished property interest. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(1) If a judgment for foreclosure is entered under section 78k and all existing recorded and unrecorded interests in a parcel of property are extinguished as provided in section 78k, the owner of any extinguished recorded or unrecorded interest in that property who claims that he or she did not receive any notice required under this act shall not bring an action for possession of the property against any subsequent owner, but may only bring an action to recover monetary damages as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(2) The court of claims has original and exclusive jurisdiction in any action to recover monetary damages under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">MCL 211.78l thus provides that once the prior owner\u2019s interest in a foreclosed property has been extinguished, the prior owner \u201cshall not bring an action for possession of the property against any subsequent owner, but may only bring an action to recover monetary damages as provided in this section.\u201d Moreover, MCL 211.78l(2) states that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cany action to recover monetary damages under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Here, respondent Perfecting Church did not bring an action for possession against appellant subsequent owners. Instead, Perfecting Church sought relief from the foreclosure judgment on the basis that the judgment was void because Perfecting Church never received notice of the foreclosure action. Appellants do not contest that Perfecting Church was deprived of notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>but argue that, despite this fact, MCL 211.78l precludes Perfecting Church from challenging the foreclosure. Appellants argue that MCL 211.78l limits Perfecting Church to seeking recovery for monetary damages, and establishes that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over such an action. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">As a preliminary matter, I note that a circuit court has power to grant relief from a judgment under MCR 2.612(C). MCR 2.612(C)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">(1) On motion and on just terms, the court may relieve a party or the legal representative of a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding on the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">(a) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">(b) Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under MCR 2.611(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">(c) Fraud (intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">(d) The judgment is void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">(e) The judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; a prior judgment on which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated; or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">(f) Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, MCL 211.78l does not <em>divest </em>the circuit court of its power to grant relief from a judgment as specified by MCR 2.612(C)(1). Indeed, nothing in either MCL 211.78l or MCL 211.78k(6) removes the circuit court\u2019s power to grant relief from a judgment of foreclosure under MCR 2.612(C). MCL 211.78l(1) only prohibits a displaced property owner from bringing a new <em>action </em>for possession. An \u201caction\u201d is a proceeding in court. Black\u2019s Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Dictionary (7th ed). A motion for relief from a judgment of foreclosure under MCR 2.612(C) is a <em>motion </em>to set aside an existing judgment. A \u201cmotion\u201d is an application requesting a court to make a specified ruling or order. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed). It does not constitute a separate action. Therefore, MCL 211.78l does not apply to situations where a property owner files a motion for relief from a judgment under MCR 2.612(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Further, MCL 211.78k(6) only addresses the state of the title that the government receives. Although MCL 211.78k(6) states that the government\u2019s title shall not be \u201cstayed or held invalid,\u201d the government can only receive fee title to the property through a <em>valid foreclosure proceeding. </em>In situations where the property owner did not receive \u201cthe minimum due process required under the state constitution of 1963 and the constitution of the United States,\u201d the foreclosure proceeding is invalid under MCL 211.78i(10). <em>In re Petition by Wayne Co Treasurer for Foreclosure of Certain Lands for Unpaid Prop Taxes, </em>265 Mich App 285, 293; 698 NW2d 879 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It follows that a foreclosing governmental unit cannot receive fee title to property when the property owner was not provided with minimum due process notice of an impending foreclosure. Therefore, MCL 211.78k(6) does not preclude a circuit court from modifying its judgment pursuant to MCR 2.612(C) when a property owner has not been provided constitutionally adequate notice of the foreclosure. The majority and I disagree on this point. While the majority holds that the language of MCL 211.78k(6) vesting absolute title in the foreclosing governmental unit limits a court\u2019s ability to modify judgments, I believe the correct, and constitutional, interpretation of the GPTA is that MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>211.78i(10) invalidates any foreclosure proceeding when a foreclosing governmental unit\u2019s failure to provide adequate notice results in the property owner not being \u201caccorded the minimum due process required under the state constitution of 1963 and the constitution of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Thus, it is necessary to determine whether the foreclosure on Perfecting Church\u2019s property met the minimum due process notice requirements. Both the Michigan and United States constitutions guarantee that a person shall not be deprived \u201cof life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; US Const, Am XIV, \u00a7 1. Due process of law entitles a person whose interest is at stake to \u201c \u2018notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dusenbery v United States, </em>534 US 161, 167; 122 S Ct 694; 151 L Ed 2d 597 (2002), quoting <em>United States v James Daniel Good Real Prop, </em>510 US 43, 48; 114 S Ct 492; 126 L Ed 2d 490 (1993). Due process protects a real estate owner\u2019s interest in property. <em>Dow, supra </em>at 204. \u201cPeople must pay their taxes, and the government may hold citizens accountable for tax delinquency by taking their property. But before forcing a citizen to satisfy his debt by forfeiting his property, due process requires the government to provide adequate notice of the impending taking.\u201d <em>Jones v Flowers, </em>547 US 220, 234; 126 S Ct 1708; 164 L Ed 2d 415 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For the first component of due process \u2014 notice of an impending taking \u2014 to be constitutionally adequate, the notice must be \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Mullane v Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co, </em>339 US 306, 314; 70 S Ct 652; 94 L Ed 865 (1950); <em>Smith, supra </em>at 429. This Court previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>held that the notice procedures contained within the GPTA satisfy the notice component of due process. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 428-429. However, in this case, the treasurer failed to follow the notice procedures of the GPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The GPTA requires the foreclosing governmental unit to mail notice to the property owner as identified by the property\u2019s deed filed with the county register of deeds. MCL 211.78i(6). Here, however, the treasurer mailed notice to the <em>previous </em>owner; consequently, Perfecting Church never received the mailed notice to which it was entitled under MCL 211.78i(6). The GPTA also requires the foreclosing governmental unit to post notice at the property in question. MCL 211.78i(3)(d). But here, the treasurer posted the foreclosure notice on a lot <em>neighboring the property in question. </em>Thus, a foreclosure notice was never posted at Perfecting Church\u2019s property. There was an absolute failure to provide notice under the GPTA. Although actual notice is not a requirement of due process, the foreclosing governmental unit must make a reasonable effort to provide notice. <em>Dow, supra </em>at 211. When the government utterly fails to comply with any of the notice procedures provided in a foreclosure statute, the government has not made a reasonable effort to provide notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">For the second component of due process \u2014 an \u201copportunity to be heard\u201d \u2014 to be constitutionally adequate, the hearing must be \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Armstrong v Manzo, </em>380 US 545, 552; 85 S Ct 1187; 14 L Ed 2d 62 (1965); <em>Van Slooten v Larsen, </em>410 Mich 21, 53; 299 NW2d 704 (1980). \u201cA hearing would not be \u2018at a meaningful time\u2019 unless the owner of a significant interest in the property had an opportunity to cure any delinquency deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>mined upon the hearing and avoid foreclosure and the taking of his property by the state.\u201d <em>Dow, supra </em>at 206 n 21. The property owner must be able to contest the government\u2019s right to foreclose. <em>Id. </em>at 210. If the only hearing available to a property owner is a hearing in the Court of Claims for money damages, the property owner is deprived of an opportunity to contest the foreclosure and to defend his or her land. \u201c \u2018The opportunity to defend one\u2019s property before it is finally taken is so basic that it hardly bears repeating.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205 n 20, quoting <em>Arnett v Kennedy, </em>416 US 134, 180; 94 S Ct 1633; 40 L Ed 2d 15 (1974) (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The United States Supreme Court has held that the government does not always have to provide a hearing before the deprivation of a right. <em>Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527, 540-541; 101 S Ct 1908; 68 L Ed 2d 420 (1981). But the situations in which a postdeprivation hearing passes constitutional scrutiny are limited to those in which a predeprivation hearing would be unworkable. <em>Id. </em>at 541. The United States Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause is not implicated when the government negligently causes the loss of property. <em>Daniels v Williams, </em>474 US 327, 328; 106 S Ct 662; 88 L Ed 2d 662 (1986). \u201cHistorically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to <em>deliberate </em>decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. Appellants argue that the treasurer\u2019s negligence in providing notice means that a due process analysis does not apply. But the treasurer <em>deliberately </em>foreclosed on Perfecting Church\u2019s property. Therefore, the negligent-actor rule from <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Daniels </em>does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Appellants also argue that the purpose behind the GPTA should prevail over the Due Process Clause. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>argue that the Legislature\u2019s express intention to streamline the foreclosure process should take precedence over a person\u2019s constitutional right to defend the person\u2019s property against a taking. It is true that, in enacting the GPTA, the Legislature intended to create a faster system in which purchasers of foreclosed property could receive clear title to put the land into productive use. Nevertheless, the United States Constitution requires that a person be provided with notice and a hearing before property can be taken. In <em>Dow, supra </em>at 209, the Court quoted <em>Stanley v Illinois, </em>405 US 645, 656; 92 S Ct 1208; 31 L Ed 2d 551 (1972), in which the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cThe establishment of prompt efficacious procedures to achieve legitimate state ends is a proper state interest worthy of cognizance in constitutional adjudication. But the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency. Indeed, one might fairly say of the Bill of Rights in general, and the Due Process Clause in particular, that they were designed to protect the fragile values of a vulnerable citizenry from the overbearing concern for efficiency and efficacy that may characterize praiseworthy government officials no less, and perhaps more, than mediocre ones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The government \u201cexert[s] extraordinary power against a property owner\u201d when it takes and sells an owner\u2019s property. <em>Jones, supra, </em>547 US at 239. The Due Process Clause is designed to protect citizens against that use of power. The Legislature cannot circumvent the constitutional obligation of due process in order to speed up the foreclosure process and convey clear title to land it acquired through foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">I note that the Legislature amended the GPTA in 2003 by enacting 2003 PA 263, which added a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>subsection, MCL 211.78k(5)(g), describing the finality of the circuit court\u2019s judgment of foreclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> MCL 211.78k(5)(g) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">A judgment entered under this section is a final order with respect to the property affected by the judgment and except as provided in subsection (7) shall not be modified, stayed, or held invalid after the March 31 immediately succeeding the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under this section, or for contested cases 21 days after the entry of a judgment foreclosing the property under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">That subsection effectively prohibits a circuit court from using MCR 2.612(C) to grant relief from the judgment of foreclosure for any reason because it states that the circuit court\u2019s judgment \u201cshall not be modified, stayed, or held invalid . ...\u201d By prohibiting the circuit court from granting relief from judgment, MCL 211.78k(5)(g) leaves a displaced property owner deprived of notice, without the minimum due process accorded under the statute, only with the option of bringing a separate action. This result initiates MCL 211.78l(1), which in turn establishes that the property owner may only bring an action for monetary damages. Despite the fact that the property owner was deprived of property without notice, the owner is precluded from bringing an action to recover the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As such, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>seriously question the constitutionality of MCL 211.78k(5)(g) because it deprives a person of his or her constitutionally protected right to due process before a deprivation of a property interest by the foreclosing government.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Unlike the majority, I am satisfied that the 1999 amendments of the GPTA can be construed so as not to violate the constitutional guarantee of due process when the government fails to provide notice before foreclosing on property. MCL 211.78l does not prohibit the circuit court from using MCR 2.612(C) to grant relief from a judgment of foreclosure. Therefore, a property owner can file a motion for relief from a judgment of foreclosure to defend against an unconstitutional governmental taking of property. A property owner deprived of notice still receives a meaningful opportunity to be heard by bringing a motion pursuant to MCR 2.612(C) for relief from the judgment. By using MCR 2.612(C), the property owner can still defend the property interest inasmuch as the circuit court still has the authority to set aside the foreclosure. In doing so, the circuit court preserves the property owner\u2019s interest in the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The circuit court correctly applied MCR 2.612(C) to grant Perfecting Church\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment of foreclosure. Perfecting Church is not limited to a suit for monetary damages under the 1999 amendments of the GPTA, which were in effect when the treasurer filed the foreclosure petition. Perfecting Church did not receive adequate notice to protect its property from the government\u2019s taking. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1999 amendments did not prohibit the circuit court from modifying its judgment, the circuit court properly retained jurisdiction to modify its judgment of foreclosure pursuant to MCR 2.612(C), thereby affording Perfecting Church the opportunity to defend its ownership interest in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I would hold that under the relevant provisions of MCL 211.78 <em>et seq. </em>in effect at the time the petition for foreclosure was filed in this matter, the circuit court was not deprived of jurisdiction to grant relief to Perfecting Church pursuant to MCR 2.612(C). Perfecting Church was not limited to a recovery of monetary damages because Perfecting Church was completely deprived of adequate notice of the pending foreclosure. Because the absence of notice was a denial of the minimum due process required under both the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, and the United States Constitution, US Const, Am XIV, \u00a7 1, Perfecting Church was entitled to relief from the circuit court\u2019s foreclosure judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">I would affirm the circuit court\u2019s order granting Perfecting Church\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment of foreclosure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> See 1999 PA 123 and 2001 PA 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> MCL 211.78(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> MCL 211.78i(2), now MCL 211.78i(10); MCL 211.78k(6); MCL 211.78l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\"> The two properties commonly known as 17833 Van Dyke (first lot) and 17843 Van Dyke (second lot) were both listed under one deed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> <em>In re Petition by Treasurer of Wayne Co for Foreclosure, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered July 11, 2005 (Docket No. 261074).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\"> <em>In re Petition by Treasurer of Wayne Co for Foreclosure (Wayne Co Treasurer v Perfecting Church), </em>474 Mich 1059 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> Petitioner Wayne County Treasurer asserts that an additional provision is applicable to this case: MCL 211.78k(5)(g), enacted by 2003 PA 263 and effective January 5, 2004.
