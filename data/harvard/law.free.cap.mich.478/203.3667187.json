We hold that under MCL 445.904(1)(a), residential home builders are exempt from the MCPA because the general transaction of residential home building, including contracting to perform such transaction, is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by the Michigan Occupational Code (MOC), MCL 339.101 <em>et seq. </em>Therefore, we overrule any holding to the contrary in <em>Forton </em>and <em>Hartman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In December 2000, plaintiffs, Arthur and Beverly Liss (Lisses) and defendant Lewiston-Richards, Inc. (Lewiston-Richards), entered into a contract for the sale and completion of construction of a residential home. Defendant Jason Lewiston (Lewiston), President of Lewiston-Richards, executed the contract on Lewiston-Richards\u2019s behalf. The Lisses allege that Lewiston-Richards did not complete construction on time and that the construction that was completed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>not done in a workman-like manner. In 2003, the Lisses filed this action alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, and other causes of action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pertinent to this appeal, the Lisses allege that defendants violated the MCPA. Through their counterclaim and answer, defendants asserted that the transaction at issue, residential home building, was exempt from the MCPA. The parties filed cross-motions for summary disposition. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition of the MCPA claim. The court held that it was bound to follow <em>Hartman </em>and hold that defendants were subject to the MCPA. Defendants filed an application in the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal from the order denying their motion and an application in this Court for leave to appeal before a decision by the Court of Appeals. This Court granted defendants\u2019 bypass application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When interpreting a statute, this Court attempts to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent by looking at the statutory text, giving meaning to every word, phrase, and clause in the statute and considering both their plain meaning and their context.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>also reviews a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Under the MCPA, \u201c[u]nfair, unconscionable, or deceptive methods, acts, or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce are unlawful... .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the Legislature included an exemption in MCPA \u00a7 4(1)(a) that, relevant to this case, exempts any \u201ctransaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The party claiming the exemption bears the burden of proving its applicability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">This Court first construed the scope of this particular exemption in <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>the defendant was a licensed real estate broker who advertised and offered loans to homeowners. The Attorney General brought suit alleging violations of the MCPA. The defendant answered, contending that because it was a licensed real estate broker, its activities were exempt under \u00a7 4(1)(a) of the MCPA. This Court disagreed, holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201creal estate broker\u2019s license does not exempt it from the Michigan Consumer Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Act.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The broker\u2019s license authorized the defendant \u201cto engage in the activities of a real estate broker,\u201d but it did not \u201cspecifically authorize the conduct that plaintiff alleges is violative of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, nor transactions that result from that conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ultimately, this Court held that while, \u201cno statute or regulatory agency specifically authorizes misrepresentations or false promises, the exemption will nevertheless apply where a party seeks to attach such labels to \u2018[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because \u201ca real estate broker\u2019s license is not specific authority for all the conduct and transactions of the [defendant\u2019s mortgage writing] business,\u201d the defendant\u2019s conduct and transactions were not exempt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">This Court again considered the application of the MCPA exemption provision in <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins </em>Co.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant insurance company for breach of contract and violation of the MCPA. With regard to the MCPA exemption, this Court ruled that <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>controlled the disposition of the case and held that <em>\u201cDiamond Mortgage </em>instructs that the focus is on whether the transaction at issue, <em>not the alleged misconduct, </em>is \u2018specifically authorized.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Therefore, \u201cthe defendant in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>was not exempt from the MCPA because the transaction at issue, mortgage writing, was not \u2018specifically authorized\u2019 under the defendant\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Analyzing the insurer\u2019s activities in <em>Smith, </em>this Court concluded that \u201c\u00a7 4(1)(a) generally exempts the sale of credit life insurance from the provisions of the MCPA, because such \u2018transaction or conduct\u2019 is \u2018specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> What emerges from <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>and <em>Smith </em>is that the relevant inquiry \u201cis whether the general transaction is specifically authorized by law, regardless of whether the specific misconduct alleged is prohibited.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Court of Appeals has applied this test in other regulated industries. For example, in <em>Kraft v Detroit Entertainment, LLC,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that \u201cthe general conduct involved in th[at] case-the operation of slot machines-is regulated and was specifically authorized by the [Michigan Gaming Control Board].\u201d Thus, the plaintiffs MCPA claim regarding slot machines failed because of the \u00a7 4(1) (a) exemption. Similarly, in <em>Newton v Bank West</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court held that the defendant federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>savings bank\u2019s banking activities were exempt from the MCPA because those activities were authorized by the Michigan Savings Bank Act,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> as well as by numerous federal statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In the area of residential home building, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Forton v </em>Laszar,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that the definition of \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d in the MCPA could be applied to residential home builders.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, as noted by then-Chief Justice CORRIGAN in a statement concurring with this Court\u2019s order denying the builder\u2019s application for leave to appeal, the builder failed to preserve the issue whether \u00a7 4(1)(a) exempts residential home building because that conduct or transaction is subject to licensure and regulation under the MOC.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, <em>Forton </em>never squarely addressed the exemption. However, in <em>Hartman &amp; Eichhorn Bldg Co, Inc v </em>Dailey,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the Court mistakenly opined that the <em>Forton </em>panel held that the exemption did not apply to building residential homes.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The <em>Hartman </em>panel disagreed with the \u201cholding\u201d of <em>Forton </em>and declared a conflict, but the full Court of Appeals declined to convene a conflict panel,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the <em>Hartman </em>panel denied Hartman\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The <em>Hartman </em>panel\u2019s treatment of <em>Forton </em>was erroneous because <em>Forton </em>never addressed the exemption. As noted, <em>Forton </em>merely found that residential home building fell within the MCPA\u2019s definition of \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d Because the builder did not timely raise the MCPA defense, the <em>Forton </em>panel did not have the opportunity to address the exemption. However, we agree with the <em>Hartman </em>panel\u2019s independent application of the exemption to residential home building.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Applying the <em>Smith </em>test, the relevant inquiry \u201cis whether the general transaction is specifically authorized by law, regardless of whether the specific misconduct alleged is prohibited.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This Court has not construed the meaning of \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d under the MCPA. \u201cSpecific\u201d means \u201chaving a special application, bearing, or reference; explicit or definite.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u201cAu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>thorize\u201d means \u201cto give authority or formal permission for; sanction.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus, the exception requires a general transaction that is \u201cexplicitly sanctioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In this case, the general conduct at issue is residential home building. Residential home builders are licensed under the MOC<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and are regulated by the Residential Builders\u2019 and Maintenance and Alteration Contractors\u2019 Board, which oversees licensing and handles complaints filed against residential builders. Moreover, there is a set of administrative rules promulgated to regulate the licensing procedure.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Furthermore, the general transaction at issue in this case, contracting to build a residential home, is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by law. First, the MOC comprehensively defines a \u201cresidential builder\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">a person engaged in the construction of a residential structure or a combination residential and commercial structure who, <em>for a fixed sum, price, fee, percentage, valuable consideration, or other compensation, </em>other than wages for personal labor only, undertakes with another or offers to undertake or purports to have the capacity to undertake with another for the erection, construction, replacement, repair, alteration, or an addition to, subtraction from, improvement, wrecking of, or demolition of, a residential structure or combination residential and commercial structure; a person who manufactures, assembles, constructs, deals in, or distributes a residential or combi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>nation, residential and commercial structure which is prefabricated, preassembled, precut, packaged, or shell housing; or a person who erects a residential structure or combination residential and commercial structure except for the person\u2019s own use and occupancy on the person\u2019s property.<footnotemark>[38]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A residential home builder, by statutory definition, is one who engages in construction activities \u201cfor a fixed sum, price, fee, percentage, valuable consideration, or other compensation ....\u201d Therefore, a residential home builder is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d to contract to build homes.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Additionally, there are only a limited number of instances where a non-licensed builder may \u201cengage in the business of or act in the capacity of a residential builder.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The clear import of the statutory scheme is that there are only a <em>few instances </em>where one can engage in the business of a residential home builder <em>without having a license. </em>Therefore, with limited exceptions, contracting to build a residential home is a transaction \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d under the MOC, subject to the administration of the Residential Builders\u2019 and Maintenance and Alteration Contractors\u2019 Board.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Thus, the MCPA exemption applies to residential home builders who engage in the type of activities that define a residential home builder, which activities are permitted by the MOC to be performed only by licensed residential home builders. This case is unlike <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>where the defendants engaged in activity, mortgage writing, that their real estate broker license simply did not permit them to do. Forming an agreement to build a home is the essence of a residential home builder\u2019s activity that is specifically authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Applying the <em>Smith </em>test, defendants\u2019 \u201cgeneral transaction,\u201d building a residential home, is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d under the MOC and the relevant regulations. Therefore, that transaction is exempt from the MCPA. We reverse the Oakland Circuit Court order to the contrary, as well as overrule any contrary holding in <em>Forton </em>and <em>Hartman, </em>and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Taylor, C.J., and Weaver, Corrigan, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-13\"> MCL 445.901 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> MCL 445.904(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> 460 Mich 446, 465; 597 NW2d 28 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> 266 Mich App 545; 701 NW2d 749 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\"> 239 Mich App 711; 609 NW2d 850 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\"> The Lisses also filed a complaint with the Department of Labor and Economic Growth, Bureau of Commercial Services Enforcement Division.

I concur with the result reached by Justice KELLY in her dissent. While I agree with much of Justice KELLY\u2019s analysis regarding <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603; 327 NW2d 805 (1982), and <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446; 597 NW2d 28 (1999), I do not agree with all the stated rationale in her dissent. I do not believe that the application of <em>Smith </em>should be limited to the insurance industry. Instead, I believe that <em>Smith </em>should be overruled on the basis of the factors set forth in <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000). As explained in my opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in <em>Smith, supra </em>at 479-480, the test adopted in <em>Smith </em>is so broad that it precludes many permissible claims under the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, MCL 445.901 <em>et seq. </em>Moreover, not only was <em>Smith </em>wrongly decided, the <em>Smith </em>decision defies practical workability because it disallows numerous claims that are actually <em>allowed </em>under the relevant statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Further, I do not agree that residential home builders are not specifically authorized to engage in the general conduct of residential home building.

Plaintiffs Arthur and Beverly Liss sued defendants Lewiston-Richards, Inc., and Jason Lewiston, asserting a cause of action under the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), MCL 445.901 <em>et seq. </em>As the basis of their claim, plaintiffs accused defendants of behavior that is arguably prohibited by the Michigan Occupational Code. MCL 339.101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">A majority of this Court finds that the behavior at issue is exempt from the MCPA because it is specifically authorized by the code. In reaching this result, the majority extends the holding of <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to the residential home building industry. Because I believe that the behavior at issue is not exempt from the MCPA and that the holding of <em>Smith </em>should be limited strictly to cases involving the insurance industry, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Plaintiffs, Arthur and Beverly Liss, purchased a house that was being built by defendant LewistonRichards, Inc. Construction was in progress when plaintiffs signed the agreement of sale. It contained provisions regarding the construction of a residential dwelling, Lewiston-Richards\u2019s experience and qualifications, and Lewiston-Richards\u2019s financing agreements. Lewiston-Richards\u2019s principal, defendant Jason Lewiston, signed a personal guaranty in connection with the agreement. Lewiston guaranteed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Lewiston-Richards would perform its obligations under the agreement, including those in the limited warranty. He further agreed that he would assume personal liability if a default occurred that Lewiston-Richards failed to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The home was not completed by the agreed-upon date, and the work was not to plaintiffs\u2019 satisfaction. Plaintiffs filed suit claiming that the defendants engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of the MCPA. They alleged that defendants (1) misrepresented the characteristics, uses, and benefits of the residence; (2) misrepresented the standard, quality, and grade of the residence; (3) failed to complete the construction of the residence; and (4) made material misrepresentations or failed to advise of material information with respect to the transaction reflected in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Defendants moved for summary disposition of the MCPA claim, asserting that the transaction, the building of a residential home, was exempt from the scope of the MCPA. The trial court denied the motion. Defendants then filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals and an application for leave to appeal in this Court before a decision by the Court of Appeals. This Court granted defendants\u2019 application. 474 Mich 1133 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">THE HOLDINGS IN <em>SMITH </em>AND <em>DIAMOND MORTGAGE </em>ARE IN CONFLICT</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The majority\u2019s decision that MCL 445.904(1)(a) exempts licensed residential builders from liability under the MCPA when they are engaged in residential home building is erroneous for two reasons. First, it extends <em>Smith </em>to residential home builders. <em>Smith </em>should be strictly limited to the insurance industry. Second, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>under <em>Smith, </em>the conduct at issue is not exempt from the MCPA because the law does not specifically authorize residential home builders to engage in residential home building.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The key part of the MCPA involved here is the exemption provision, MCL 445.904(1)(a). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">(1) This act does not apply to either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">(a) A transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The burden of proving the exemption is on the person claiming it. MCL 445.904(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">This Court first interpreted the exemption provision in <em>Attorney General v Diamond Mortgage Co, </em>414 Mich 603; 327 NW2d 805 (1982). <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>decided that real estate brokers are not exempt from liability under the MCPA even though their conduct is subject to regulation by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 615-617. In holding that real estate brokers are subject to the MCPA, this Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">We agree with the plaintiff that Diamond\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license does not exempt it from the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. While the license generally authorizes Diamond to engage in the activities of a real estate broker, it does not specifically authorize the conduct that plaintiff alleges is violative of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, nor transactions that result from that conduct. In so concluding, we disagree that the exemption of \u00a7 4(1) becomes meaningless. While defendants are correct in stating that no statute or regulatory agency specifically authorizes misrepresentations or false promises, the exemption will nevertheless apply where a party seeks to attach such labels to \u201c[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 617.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>Diamond Mortgage\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 4(1)(a) was very narrow and followed the plain meaning of the words of the statute: \u201c[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized.\u201d Under <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>only a transaction or conduct that is specifically authorized by a statute can be exempt from the MCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">This Court considered the exemption again in <em>Smith. </em>Without explanation, the majority in <em>Smith </em>concluded that, in drafting \u00a7 4(1)(a), the Legislature intended to exempt \u201cconduct the legality of which is in dispute.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465. The <em>Smith </em>majority went on to create a new test for determining exemptions under \u00a7 4(1)(a). It is whether the \u201cgeneral transaction is specifically authorized by law, regardless of whether the specific misconduct alleged is prohibited.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465. Under this new test, the Court concluded that the entire insurance industry is exempt from the MCPA under \u00a7 4(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It is apparent to me that the decisions in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>and <em>Smith </em>cannot be squared. <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>asked whether the transaction or conduct alleged to be in violation of the MCPA is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by another statute, and it created a narrow exception. <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>414 Mich at 617. <em>Smith </em>asked whether the general transactions of the industry are \u201cspecifically authorized,\u201d and it created a broad exemption exempting the entire insurance industry. <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465. Because the two interpretations are inconsistent, this Court should determine which was intended by the Legislature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>SMITH </em>SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">When interpreting any statutory provision, a court should begin with an examination of the statutory language. MCL 445.904(1)(a) provides that the exemption applies to \u201c[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws administered by a regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.\u201d By the statute\u2019s terms, the exemption applies to \u201c[a] transaction.\u201d This statutory language is in the singular. It follows that the proper inquiry is whether the singular transaction or conduct at issue is specifically authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">However, instead of exempting a singular transaction or conduct, the <em>Smith </em>test classifies the transaction in question in broad terms and exempts all the transactions of the entire industry. <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465. On the other hand, <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>considers the discrete transaction or conduct at issue and concludes that the exemption applies only if that transaction or conduct is specifically authorized by law. <em>Diamond Mortgage, </em>414 Mich at 617. Accordingly, solely on the basis of the common meaning of the <em>language </em>of the exemption, <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>offers the more accurate interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\"><em>Smith </em>is inconsistent with the language of the statute in another regard. It permits illegal behavior to be exempt from the MCPA. In this case, plaintiffs accuse defendants of behavior that is illegal under the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>gan Occupational Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet under <em>Smith, </em>even if plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are true, defendants would be exempt from liability under the MCPA. This is an illogical result. The statute provides that there is an exemption for \u201c[a] transaction or conduct specifically authorized under laws ....\u201d MCL 445.904(1)(a). A transaction or conduct that is actually <em>prohibited </em>by law cannot be deemed to be specifically authorized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 4</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">By contrast, <em>Diamond Mortgage's </em>narrow reading of the exemption is harmonious with the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>exemption and also furthers the purpose of the MCPA. In the 1970s, the MCPA was the crown jewel of an aggressive legislative effort to expand consumers\u2019 rights and remedies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It \u201cwas enacted to provide an enlarged remedy for consumers who are mulcted by deceptive business practices . . . .\u201d <em>Dix v American Bankers Life Assurance Co, </em>429 Mich 410, 417; 415 NW2d 206 (1987). The Legislature created this enlarged remedy by making the MCPA applicable to \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by defining \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d to include virtually all consumer transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In order to accomplish the goal of \u201cproviding] an enlarged remedy for consumers,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> courts should construe the act\u2019s exemption narrowly. <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231, 278; 301 NW2d 285 (1981) (MOODY, J., dissenting). Though no Michigan court has previously explored the purpose of the exemption in \u00a7 4(a)(1), courts in numerous other jurisdictions have considered the purpose of similar provisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>These decisions are helpful in understanding the purpose and scope of our exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In <em>Skinner v </em>Steele,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 10the Tennessee Court of Appeals was called upon to determine the scope of a similarly worded exemption to the Tennessee consumer protection act (TCPA). <em>Id. </em>at 337. The exemption provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to: (a) Acts or transactions required or specifically authorized under the laws administered by or rules and regulations promulgated by, any regulatory bodies or officers acting under the authority of this state or of the United States. [TCA \u00a7 47-18-111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The defendant argued that this provision exempted the entire insurance industry from the TCPA. <em>Skinner, </em>730 SW2d at 337. In deciding that the insurance industry was not exempt, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">The purpose of the exemption is to insure that a business is not subjected to a lawsuit under the Act when it does something required by law, or does something that would otherwise be a violation of the Act, but which is allowed under other statutes or regulations. It is intended to avoid conflict between laws, not to exclude from the Act\u2019s coverage every activity that is authorized or regulated by another statute or agency. Virtually every activity is regulated to some degree. <em>[Id. </em>at 337.]<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>a court must be convinced that \u201ca direct and unavoidable conflict exists between the application of the [CSPA] and application of the other regulatory scheme or schemes. It must be convinced that the other source or sources of regulation deal specifically, concretely, and pervasively with the particular activity, implying a legislative intent not to subject parties to multiple regulations that, as applied, will work at cross-purposes.\u201d <em>[Elder v Fischer, </em>129 Ohio App 3d 209, 219; 717 NE2d 730 (1998), quoting <em>Lemelledo v Beneficial Mgt Corp of America, </em>150 NJ 255, 270; 696 A2d 546 (1997) (interpreting the New Jersey consumer fraud act).]<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Similarly, in considering whether regulated industries were exempt from the Ohio consumer sales practices act (CSPA), the Ohio Court of Appeals has stated that, in order to overcome the presumption that the CSPA applies,</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Another source that sheds light on the purpose of the exemption is the recent article written by Assistant Attorney General Edwin Bladen. The MCPA was authored in large part by Mr. Bladen and, in the article <em>How and why the Consumer Protection Act came to be, </em>he discusses at length the history and intent of the act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Mr. Bladen states that the MCPA exemptions were intended to be given a limited interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Specifically, he says that the intent was to \u201clook to see, not whether the entity is subject to the act, but whether the method, act or practice alleged to violate the act is indeed one addressed and prohibited by the act. To the extent <em>Smith v. Globe Life Insurance. . . </em>arrived at a different view, it is clearly erroneous . ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">From these sources, it emerges that the Legislature included the exemption out of concern that the MCPA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>because of its breadth, might prohibit a transaction or conduct that another act authorizes. A merchant could be put on the horns of a dilemma if the same transaction were specifically authorized by one statute and prohibited by the MCPA. Section 4(1)(a) was designed to avoid that conflict. The <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>holding is in harmony with the purpose of \u00a7 4(1) because it applies the exemption only when there is a direct and unavoidable conflict between the MCPA and another law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Given the language and purpose of the MCPA, I believe that this Court interpreted the exemption correctly in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>and incorrectly in <em>Smith. </em>Even so, because I do not think the compelling interests necessary to overrule a prior decision of this Court are present, I do not advocate overruling <em>Smith. </em>Instead, I would limit the holding of <em>Smith </em>to the insurance industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The <em>Smith </em>Court itself indicated that its opinion has limited application by explicitly stating that it did not address other consumer transactions not before the Court and warning that \u201cinsurance companies are not \u2018[l]ike most businesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465-466 n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>12 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Aside from matters involving the insurance industry, I would apply the standard articulated in <em>Diamond Mortgage. </em>I would hold that the focus of the \u00a7 4(1)(a) inquiry is whether the discrete transaction alleged to be in violation of the MCPA is specifically authorized by some other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">If the test set forth in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>were applied to the facts of this case, the exemption would not apply. Here, plaintiffs allege that defendants misrepresented their experience and qualifications and misrepresented the financing of the construction mortgage. Defendants have failed to point to any authority for the proposition that either of these transactions is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Plaintiffs also allege that defendants (1) misrepresented the characteristics, uses, and benefits of the residence; (2) misrepresented the standard, quality, and grade of the residence; (3) failed to complete the construction of the residence; and (4) made material mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>representations or failed to advise of material information with respect to the transaction reflected in the agreement. These transactions, rather than being authorized, are arguably specifically prohibited by law. See MCL 339.2411(2)(d),(m). Accordingly, because defendants were not specifically authorized to perform the discrete transactions at issue, the exemption does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">EVEN UNDER <em>SMITH, </em>THE EXEMPTION DOES NOT APPLY HERE BECAUSE THE TRANSACTION OR CONDUCT AT ISSUE IS NOT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>this Court interpreted the \u00a7 4(1)(a) exemption to apply if the \u201cgeneral transaction is specifically authorized by law.. . .\u201d <em>Smith, </em>460 Mich at 465. As I explained earlier, <em>Smith </em>should not be extended beyond the facts of that case. However, even under the test in <em>Smith, </em>the exemption should not apply here because there is no law specifically authorizing the general transaction or conduct at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The determinative issue under the <em>Smith </em>test is whether the general conduct or transaction is specifically authorized by law. Accordingly, in order to apply this test, it is first necessary to give meaning to the phrase \u201cspecifically authorized.\u201d In so doing, it is appropriate to consider dictionary definitions. <em>Koontz v Ameritech Services, Inc, </em>466 Mich 304, 312; 645 NW2d 34 (2002). \u201cSpecific\u201d is defined as \u201chaving a special application, bearing, or reference; explicit or definite.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001). \u201cAuthorize\u201d means \u201cto give authority or official power to; empower.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Hence, for the general transaction or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>conduct to be \u201cspecifically authorized,\u201d there must be a law that explicitly gives the power to perform the general transaction or conduct at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The provisions of the Michigan Occupational Code that apply to residential home builders<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are devoid of any specific authorizations of transactions or conduct. There are broad definitions of \u201cresidential builder\u201d and other positions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> MCL 339.2401. There are exemptions from licensure. MCL 339.2403. Minimum licensing qualifications are set forth. MCL 339.2404. Contributions to the Homeowner Construction Lien Recovery Fund<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are made mandatory. MCL 339.2409.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Perhaps the most significant provision is MCL 339.2411, which lays out in detail the conduct of a licensee that will result in discipline and the procedures applicable to certain complaints. The most that can be said of this provision, however, is that it defines prohibited conduct. Nothing in any of these provisions explicitly gives residential home builders the power to engage in residential home building. Because there is no law that specifically authorizes residential home builders to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>engage in any activity, let alone residential home building, defendants cannot claim the protection of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">By erroneously finding that residential home builders are exempt from the MCPA, the majority essentially reads the phrase \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d out of the statute. Rather than requiring specific authorization, the majority concludes that the exemption applies as long as the transaction or conduct is not prohibited. Yet, the majority is aware that every word in a statute should be given meaning, and the Court should avoid a construction that would render any part surplusage or nugatory. <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 60; 631 NW2d 686 (2001). By ruling as it does, the majority has essentially decided that merely being a licensee in a regulated industry qualifies one for the exemption. Nothing indicates that the Legislature intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">This case addresses the scope of the exemption in MCL 445.904(1)(a). The majority finds that the exemption extends to builders when engaged in residential home building. Essentially, it decides that the exemption applies to any business that has a licensing scheme similar to that used by residential home builders. The result may well be that a large number of Michigan businesses will be able to engage in unfair or deceptive practices without running afoul of the MCPA. For this reason, and for the other reasons set forth in this opinion, I must dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> 460 Mich 446; 597 NW2d 28 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The majority claims that <em>Smith </em>and <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>are consistent because in <em>Diamond Mortgage </em>the defendants had \u201cno statutory authorization to engage in mortgage writing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 210 n 23.

The written estimate section of the MVSRA specifically authorizes motor vehicle repair facilities to charge \u201c10 <em>% </em>or $10.00, whichever is lesser\u201d over a written estimate without obtaining \u201cthe written or oral consent of the customer . . . .\u201d MCL 257.1332(1). Charging any amount above a written estimate without obtaining the consent of the consumer arguably could violate several subsections of the MCPA. See, e.g., MCL 445.903(1)(n), (s), (bb), and (cc). Because charging this amount in excess of a written estimate is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d under the MVSRA, however, motor vehicle repair facilities that impose the charge are exempt from suit under the MCPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> There is extraordinary oversight of each credit insurance transaction. The Insurance Code \u201cmanifests an intent to regulate the entire insurance and surety business field, and not to leave any portion of it unregulated.\u201d 19 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Insurance, \u00a7 1, p 13. Credit insurance transactions are regulated by the Credit Insurance Act, MCL 550.602 through 550.624, and 21 rules in the Administrative Code, containing more than 130 subsections. 1999 AC, R 550.201 through R 550.221. Virtually every document used to arrange and sell credit insurance must be submitted for review by the Commissioner of Insurance before being used to sell insurance to consumers. 1999 AC, R 550.209(2). The commissioner also has authority over all rates and premiums charged in credit insurance transactions. Rates are set by rule; credit life insurance rates must conform to 1999 AC, R 550.211, credit accident and health insurance rates must conform to 1999 AC, R 550.212. This comprehensive regulation of each insurance transaction highlights that, indeed, insurance companies are not like most businesses. And, because insurance transactions require a degree and type of statutory authorization equaled by few, if any, other consumer industries, it is logical to limit <em>Smith\u2019s </em>holding to this industry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> Notably, I use <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary\u2019s </em>first definition of the word \u201cauthorize\u201d while the majority opinion uses the second definition of the word. The majority claims that it uses the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>definition because it focuses on the action and not the actor. This is not true. The majority focuses exclusively on the actor because, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, simply being a residential home builder makes defendants exempt from the MCPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> MCL 339.2401 through 339.2412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> The majority relies on the code\u2019s definition of \u201cresidential builder\u201d to find specific authorization for the conduct at issue. I take strong exception to this approach. This definition implicitly allows residential home builders to construct homes, but it does not specifically authorize them to do so. The majority also makes much of the fact that there are only a few instances where one can engage in residential home building without a license. Again, the fact that the law may prohibit nonlicensees from building a home does not amount to specific authorization for residential builders to engage in residential home building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\"> MCL 570.1201.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
