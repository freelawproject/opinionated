The lower courts held that RLUIPA does entitle plaintiff to the rezoning of its property. We conclude that a refusal to rezone does not constitute an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d and, thus, that RLUIPA is inapplicable. Further, even if RLUIPA is applicable, the building of an apartment complex does not constitute a \u201creligious exercise,\u201d and even if it does constitute a \u201creligious exercise,\u201d the city of Jackson\u2019s refusal to rezone plaintiffs property did not substantially burden plaintiffs religious exercise, and even if it did substantially burden plaintiffs religious exercise, the imposition of that burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, it has not been violated. For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Plaintiff wants to build an apartment complex across the street from its church on property that it owns in the city of Jackson. The property consists of eight lots totaling 1.13 acres. The property is zoned single-family residential (R-l). One of the lots contains a single-family residence, and the remaining lots are vacant. There are single-family residences on each side of the property. Plaintiff petitioned the city to change the zoning of the property to multiple-family residential (R-3) so that it could construct an apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The Region 2 Planning Commission recommended denying plaintiffs rezoning petition. After a public hearing, the city planning commission also voted to recommend that the city council deny plaintiffs rezoning petition. Pursuant to these recommendations, and following another public hearing, the city council voted to deny plaintiffs rezoning petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Plaintiff then filed a complaint against defendants, containing two counts: count one directly challenged the city\u2019s zoning decision and count two alleged a violation of RLUIPA. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition with regard to count one, which decision was not appealed. With regard to count two, the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition and granted plaintiffs motion for summary disposition in part. Specifically, the trial court ruled that RLUIPA did apply because the city\u2019s zoning decision constituted an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d and the refusal to rezone plaintiffs property imposed a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the exercise of religion. The trial court then ordered a trial on the issue whether the city had a compelling interest for its refusal to rezone. After a bench trial, the trial court ruled that defendants had failed to demonstrate such an interest. Therefore, it determined that defendants had violated RLUIPA and that plaintiff was entitled to the requested rezoning of its property. The trial court enjoined defendant from interfering in any manner with plaintiffs efforts to construct an apartment complex on its property. After the final order was issued, plaintiff filed a motion for attorney fees and costs, and the trial court awarded plaintiff over $30,000 in attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in all respects. 268 Mich App 673; 708 NW2d 756 (2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Court of Appeals also held that the application of RLUIPA to compel the requested rezoning did not render the statute unconstitutional. We granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 474 Mich 1133 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on a summary disposition motion is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Haynes v Neshewat, 477 </em>Mich 29, 34; 729 NW2d 488 (2007). Questions of statutory interpretation are also questions of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">III. ORIGINS OF RLUIPA</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....\u201d US Const, Am I. The second clause of this amendment is commonly known as the Free Exercise Clause. The protections provided by the First Amendment, including the Free Exercise Clause, have been \u201cincorporated\u201d and extended to the states and to their political subdivisions by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Cantwell v Connecticut, </em>310 US 296, 303; 60 S Ct 900; 84 L Ed 1213 (1940); <em>Santa Fe Independent School Dist v Doe, </em>530 US 290, 301; 120 S Ct 2266; 147 L Ed 2d 295 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; 83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965 (1963), the plaintiff, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church was discharged by her employer because she would not work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith. She was unable to obtain other employment because she would not work on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Saturdays. The South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act, SC Code, Tit 68, \u00a7 68-1 <em>et seq., </em>provided that a claimant was ineligible for benefits if the claimant had failed \u201cwithout good cause\u201d to accept available suitable work. The Employment Security Commission determined that the plaintiffs religious belief against working on Saturdays did not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d The United States Supreme Court held that denying the plaintiff unemployment compensation benefits solely because of her refusal to accept employment in which she would have to work on Saturdays contrary to her religious belief imposed a substantial burden on her exercise of her religion that was not justified by a compelling state interest, and, thus, violated the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In <em>Employment Div, Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Oregon v Smith, </em>494 US 872; 110 S Ct 1595; 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that Oregon\u2019s prohibition of the use of peyote in religious ceremonies, and the denial of unemployment benefits to persons discharged for such use, does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court explained that generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified, under the Free Exercise Clause, by a compelling governmental interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In response to <em>Smith, </em>Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the government from substantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of rebgion, even by means of a generally apphcable, rehgion-neutral law, unless the government could demonstrate that the burden imposed furthers a compelling governmental interest and that it constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">However, in <em>City of Boerne v Flores, </em>521 US 507; 117 S Ct 2157; 138 L Ed 2d 624 (1997), the United States Supreme Court held that Congress, in enacting RFRA, had exceeded its powers under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact legislation enforcing the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because RFRA proscribes state conduct that the First Amendment itself does not proscribe.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 123 The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">Congress\u2019 power under \u00a7 5, however, extends only to \u201cenforcing\u201d the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described this power as \u201cremedial....\u201d The design of the Amendment and the text of \u00a7 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power \u201cto enforce,\u201d not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the \u201cprovisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. <em>[Id. </em>at 519-520.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The Supreme Court then concluded that the substantial costs that RFRA exacted through its \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d test \u201cfar exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in <em>Smith.\u201d Id. </em>at 534. Thus, \u201cthe Court invalidated RFRA as applied to the states, finding it an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 Enforcement Clause powers because Congress had not shown a pattern of religious discrimination meriting such a far-reaching remedy ....\u201d Galvan, <em>Beyond worship: The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 and religious institutions\u2019 auxiliary uses, </em>24 Yale L &amp; Policy R 207, 218 (2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>In response to <em>City of Boerne, </em>Congress enacted RLUIPA. Unlike RFRA, RLUIPA does not attempt to bar all laws that substantially burden religious exercise. Instead, it focuses on land use regulations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 000 and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(a) Substantial burdens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">(1) General rule. No government<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> shall impose or implement a land use regulation<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person, assembly, or institution\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">(A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">(2) Scope of application. This subsection applies in any case in which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">(C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations, under which a government makes, or has in place formal or informal procedures or practices that permit the government to make, individualized assessments of the proposed uses for the property involved. [42 USC 2000cc(a).]* 123****<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u201cReligious exercise\u201d is defined as \u201cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A). RLUIPA specifically provides that \u201c[t]he use, building, or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be religious exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for that purpose.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(B). A plaintiff asserting a RLUIPA violation has the burden of presenting prima facie evidence to support the assertion. 42 USC 2000cc-2(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is, the plaintiff has the burden to prove that RLUIPA is applicable and that the government has implemented a land use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion. <em>Id. </em>Once the plaintiff has proven this, the burden shifts to the government to prove that the imposition of such burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. <em>Id. </em>As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cRLUIPA is [a] congressional effort[] to accord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens, consistent with this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d <em>Cutter v Wilkinson, </em>544 US 709, 714; 125 S Ct 2113; 161 L Ed 2d 1020 (2005). Therefore, it is clearly appropriate to examine the United States Supreme Court\u2019s precedents when analyzing RLUIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">IV ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">A. INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The threshold question is whether RLUIPA is applicable to this dispute. The burden is on plaintiff to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that RLUIPA is applicable. 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA \u201capplies only if one of three jurisdictional tests is first met____\u201d <em>Midrash Sephardi, Inc v Town of Surfside, </em>366 F3d 1214, 1225 (CA 11, 2004); see also <em>Prater v City of Burnside, </em>289 F3d 417, 433 (CA 6, 2002) (\u201c[T]he Church may not rely upon RLUIPA unless it first demonstrates that the facts of the present case trigger one of the bases for jurisdiction provided in that statute\u201d); <em>Shepherd Montessori Ctr Milan v Ann Arbor Charter Twp, </em>259 Mich App 315, 326-327; 627 NW2d 271 (2003) (\u201cIn order to establish a claim under RLUIPA, a party must establish that at least one of these three jurisdictional elements exists [.]\u201d). RLUIPA states that it \u201capplies in any case in which\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">(C) the substantial burden is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation or system of land use regulations, under which a government makes, or has in place formal or informal procedures or practices that permit the government to make, <em>individualized assessments </em>of the proposed uses for the property involved. [42 USC 2000cc(a)(2) (emphasis added).]<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Therefore, the issue is whether a substantial burden has been imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation under which a government is permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>make an individualized assessment of the proposed uses for the property involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">This is not the first time that the phrase \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d has been employed. The United States Supreme Court distinguished its decision in <em>Bowen v Roy, </em>476 US 693; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986), from its decisions in <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas v Review Bd of Indiana Employment Security Div, </em>450 US 707; 101 S Ct 1425; 67 L Ed 2d 624 (1981), on the basis that the latter decisions, unlike <em>Bowen, </em>involved \u201cindividualized assessments.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe statutory conditions at issue in <em>[Sherbert </em>and Thomas] provided that a person was not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, \u2018without good cause,\u2019 he had quit work or refused available work. The \u2018good cause\u2019 standard created a mechanism for individualized exemptions.\u201d <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 708. In <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>the Court held that when the government applies individualized exemptions, but refuses to extend an exemption to an instance of genuine \u201creligious hardship,\u201d the government must demonstrate a compelling reason for denying the requested exemption. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In <em>Smith, supra </em>at 884, the United States Supreme Court again emphasized the distinction between governmental action requiring and not requiring individualized assessments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The <em>Sherbert </em>test, it must be recalled, was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.... [A] distinctive feature of unemployment compensation programs is that their eligibility criteria invite consideration of the particular circumstances behind an applicant\u2019s unemployment. .. . [0]ur decisions in the unemployment cases stand for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of \u201creligious hardship\u201d without compelling reason. <em>[Id., </em>quoting <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 708.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In <em>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc v City of Hialeah, </em>508 US 520, 527; 113 S Ct 2217; 124 L Ed 2d 472 (1993), the United States Supreme Court, against the backdrop of a ritualistic practice of animal sacrifice by practitioners of the Santerian faith, held that a city ordinance that prohibits a person from \u201cunnecessarily... killing] ... an animal\u201d violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">[B]ecause it requires an evaluation of the particular justification for the killing, this ordinance represents a system of \u201cindividualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct....\u201d As we noted in <em>Smith, </em>in circumstances in which individualized exemptions from a general requirement are available, the government \u201cmay not refuse to extend that system to cases of \u2018religious hardship\u2019 without compelling reason.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 537 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u201cIndividualize\u201d is defined as \u201cto.. . consider individually; specify; particularize.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991). Therefore, an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d is an assessment based on one\u2019s particular circumstances. Accordingly, RLUIPA applies when the government makes an assessment based on one\u2019s particular or specific circumstances or has in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>place procedures or practices that would allow the government to make an assessment based on one\u2019s particular or specific circumstances. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently held, \u201cRLUIPA applies when the government may take into account the particular details of an applicant\u2019s proposed use of land when deciding to permit or deny that use.\u201d <em>Guru Nanak Sikh Society of Yuba City v Sutter Co, </em>456 F3d 978, 986 (CA 9, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">In the instant case, the city adopted a zoning ordinance that applied to the entire community, not just to plaintiff. See <em>West v City of Portage, </em>392 Mich 458, 469; 221 NW2d 303 (1974) (\u201c \u2018[Z]oning ordinances... are classified as general policy decisions which apply to the entire community.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Concomitantly, if the city had granted plaintiffs request to rezone the property, such rezoning would also have applied to the entire community, not just plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A decision whether to rezone property does not involve consideration of only a particular or specific user or only a particular or specific project; rather, it involves the enactment of a new rule of general applicability, a new rule that governs all persons and all projects. See <em>Sherrill v Town of Wrightsville Beach, </em>81 NC App 369, 373; 344 SE2d 357 (1986) (\u201c[I]t is the duty of the zoning authority to consider the needs of the entire community when voting on a rezoning, and not just the needs of the individual petitioner.\u201d). Thus, if the city had granted plaintiffs request to rezone the property from single-family residential to multiple-family residential, plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tiff could then have sold the property to any third party and that third party could have sold the property to any other third party and any of these parties could have built an apartment complex or any other conforming building on that property. Therefore, the city\u2019s decision whether to rezone the property would not have been predicated on plaintiffs particular circumstances or plaintiffs particular project.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if the city had affirmatively wanted plaintiff to build an apartment complex on its property, it could not have granted the requested zoning change unless it was also prepared to accommodate all projects falling within the scope of the rezoning. Plaintiffs particular circumstances were simply not determinative of the city\u2019s decision whether to rezone, and, thus, the city\u2019s decision did not constitute an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d within the meaning of that term.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiff has cited no cases in support of its position that a refusal to rezone property constitutes an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Moreover, plaintiff has presented no evidence to suggest that the city has in place procedures or practices that would permit the city to make \u201cindividualized assessments\u201d when determining whether to rezone property.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Because the city\u2019s refusal to rezone the property did not constitute an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d and because there is no evidence that the city has in place procedures or practices that would permit it to make \u201cindividualized assessments\u201d when determining whether to grant requests to rezone property, RLUIPA is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">B. RELIGIOUS EXERCISE</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Assuming that RLUIPA is applicable here, the next question is whether the building of an apartment complex constitutes a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d The burden is on plaintiff to prove that the building of an apartment complex constitutes a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the <em>religious exercise </em>of a person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless .... [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u201cReligious exercise\u201d is defined as \u201cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A). RLUIPA specifically provides that \u201c[t]he use, building, or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be religious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for that purpose.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(B). A \u201creligious exercise\u201d consists of a specific type of exercise, an exercise of <em>religion, </em>and this is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>equivalent of an exercise \u2014 any exercise \u2014 by a religious body. \u201cThe term \u2018religion\u2019 has reference to one\u2019s views of his relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will.\u201d <em>Davis v Beason, </em>133 US 333, 342; 10 S Ct 299; 33 L Ed 637 (1890), overruled on other grounds in <em>Romer v Evans, </em>517 US 620, 634; 116 S Ct 1620; 134 L Ed 2d 855 (1996). The United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he \u201cexercise of religion\u201d often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of... physical acts [such as] assembling with others for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and wine____\u2019 \u201d <em>Cutter, supra </em>at 720, quoting <em>Smith, supra </em>at 877.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has further held that \u201c[although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is \u2018central\u2019 to a prisoner\u2019s religion, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7)(A), the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner\u2019s professed religiosity. Cf. <em>Gillette v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 437, 457, 91 S. Ct. 828, 28 L.

Nor, obviously, does RLUIPA bar inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice constitutes an aspect, central or otherwise, of a person\u2019s religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The question that we must answer is whether plaintiff is seeking to use its property for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>religious exercise.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Obviously, not everything that a religious institution does constitutes a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that its proposed use of the property constitutes a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). In the instant case, the only evidence that plaintiff has presented to establish that its proposed use of the property constitutes a \u201creligious exercise\u201d is an affidavit signed by the bishop of the Greater Bible Way Temple. The affidavit states that plaintiffs mission is set forth in its letterhead as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">The Greater Bible Way Temple stands for truth, the promotion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the Apostolic Doctrine, and an exceptional level of service to the community. This includes housing, employment, consulting and supports as determined appropriate in fulfilling our Mission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The affidavit further states that plaintiff \u201cwishes to further the teachings of Jesus Christ by providing housing and living assistance to the citizens of Jackson.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>No evidence has been presented to establish that the proposed apartment complex would be used for religious worship or for any other religious activity. Instead, it appears that the only connection between the proposed apartment complex and \u201creligious exercise\u201d is the fact that the apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution. Generally, the building of an apartment complex would be considered a commercial exercise, not a religious exercise. The fact that the apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution does not transform the building of an apartment complex into a \u201creligious exercise,\u201d unless the term is to be deprived of all practical meaning. Something does not become a \u201creligious exercise\u201d just because it is performed by a religious institution. Because plaintiff has not shown that the building of the apartment complex constitutes an exercise in religion, the city\u2019s decision not to rezone the property cannot be said to have burdened plaintiffs \u201creligious exercise,\u201d and, thus, RLUIPA has not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">C. SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Assuming, however, that the building of an apartment complex does constitute a \u201creligious exercise,\u201d the next question is whether the city\u2019s refusal to rezone the property to allow the apartment complex constitutes a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on that \u201creligious exercise.\u201d The burden is on plaintiff to prove that the city\u2019s refusal to rezone the property constitutes a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on plaintiffs exercise of religion. 42 USC 2000cc-2(b). RLUIPA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a <em>substantial burden </em>on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless .... [42 USC 2000cc(a)(1) (emphassis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">RLUIPA does not define the phrase \u201csubstantial burden.\u201d However, this is not the first time that the phrase \u201csubstantial burden\u201d has been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Before deciding <em>Smith, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on one\u2019s religious exercise that was not justified by a compelling governmental interest violated the Free Exercise Clause. <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v Bd of Equalization of California, </em>493 US 378, 384-385; 110 S Ct 688; 107 L Ed 2d 796 (1990), quoting <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>490 US 680, 699; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766 (1989) (\u201cOur cases have established that \u2018the free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief or practice and, if so, whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.\u2019 \u201d). The United States Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201csubstantial burden\u201d in its free exercise cases is instructive in determining what Congress understood \u201csubstantial burden\u201d to mean in RLUIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In <em>Sherbert, supra </em>at 404, the United States Supreme Court held that a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d exists when an individual is \u201cforce[d] ... to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion ... on the other hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 717-718, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In <em>Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>485 US 439, 450; 108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988), the United States Supreme Court explained that \u201cincidental effects of government programs, which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs\u201d do not constitute \u201csubstantial burdens.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Several federal circuit courts of appeal have also defined the term \u201csubstantial burden.\u201d Although we are not bound by these decisions, <em>Abela v Gen Motors Corp, </em>469 Mich 603, 606; 677 NW2d 325 (2004), we find them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In <em>Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v Chicago, </em>342 F3d 752 (CA 7, 2003), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that a Chicago zoning ordinance that allows churches as a matter of right in residential zones, but requires them to obtain special use permits in other zones, does not violate RLUIPA. That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">Application of the substantial burden provision to a regulation inhibiting or constraining <em>any </em>religious exercise, including the use of property for religious purposes, would render meaningless the word \u201csubstantial,\u201d because the slightest obstacle to religious exercise incidental to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>regulation of land use \u2014 however minor the burden it were to impose \u2014 could then constitute a burden sufficient to trigger RLUIPA\u2019s requirement that the regulation advance a compelling governmental interest by the least restrictive means. We therefore hold that, in the context of RLUIPA\u2019s broad definition of religious exercise, a land-use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise is one that necessarily bears direct, primary, and fundamental responsibility for rendering religious exercise\u2014 including the use of real property for the purpose thereof within the regulated jurisdiction generally \u2014 effectively impracticable.<footnotemark>[19]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\">While [the ordinance] may contribute to the ordinary difficulties associated with location (by any person or entity, religious or nonreligious) in a large city, [it does] not render impracticable the use of real property in Chicago for religious exercise, much less discourage churches from locating or attempting to locate in Chicago. <em>See, e.g., Love Church v.

The harsh reality of the marketplace sometimes dictates that certain facilities are not available to those who desire them\u201d). ... Otherwise, compliance with RLUIPA would require municipal governments not merely to treat religious land uses on an equal footing with nonreligious land uses, but rather to favor them in the form of an outright exemption from land-use regulations. Unfortunately for Appellants, no such free pass for religious land uses masquerades among the legitimate protections RLUIPA affords to religious exercise. <em>[Id. </em>at 761-762 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In <em>San Jose Christian College v City of Morgan Hill, </em>360 F3d 1024 (CA 9, 2004), the Ninth Circuit Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Appeals held that there was no RLUIPA violation where the city denied the plaintiffs rezoning application.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">A \u201cburden\u201d is \u201csomething that is oppressive.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 190 (7th ed.1999). \u201cSubstantial,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cconsiderable in quantity\u201d or \u201csignificantly great.\u201d MERRIAM-WEBSTER\u2019S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 1170 (10th ed.2002).

That court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">[A] government action or regulation creates a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on a religious exercise if it truly pressures the adherent to significantly modify his religious behavior and significantly violates his religious beliefs.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, however, a government action or regulation does not rise to the level of a substantial burden on religious exercise if it merely prevents the adherent from either enjoying some benefit that is not otherwise generally available or acting in a way that is not otherwise generally allowed. <em>[Id. </em>at 570.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In <em>Spratt v Rhode Island Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>482 F3d 33, 38 (CA 1, 2007), which involved a blanket ban against all preaching activities by prison inmates, the First Circuit Court of Appeals asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">The district court decided that a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d is one that \u201cput[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs,\u201d citing <em>Thomas v.

The city is not forbidding plaintiff from building an apartment complex; it is simply regulating where that apartment complex can be built.

As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">The matter of zoning has received much attention at the hands of commissions and experts, and the results of their investigations have been set forth in comprehensive reports. These reports, which bear every evidence of painstaking consideration, concur in the view that the segregation of residential, business, and industrial buildings will make it easier to provide fire apparatus suitable for the character and intensity of the development in each section; that it will increase the safety and security of home life; greatly tend to prevent street accidents, especially to children, by reducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential sections; decrease noise and other conditions which produce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more favorable environment in which to rear children, etc. With particular reference to apartment houses, it is pointed out that the development of detached house sections is greatly retarded by the coming of apartment houses, which has sometimes resulted in destroying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>entire section for private house purposes; that in such sections very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district. Moreover, the coming of one apartment house is followed by others, interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes, and bringing, as their necessary accompaniments, the disturbing noises incident to increased traffic and business, and the occupation, by means of moving and parked automobiles, of larger portions of the streets, thus detracting from their safety and depriving children of the privilege of quiet and open spaces for play, enjoyed by those in more favored localities \u2014 until, finally, the residential character of the neighborhood and its desirability as a place of detached residences are utterly destroyed. Under these circumstances, apartment houses, which in a different environment would be not only entirely unobjectionable but highly desirable, come very near to being nuisances. <em>[Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co, </em>272 US 365, 394-395; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">See also <em>Kropf v Sterling Hts, </em>391 Mich 139, 159-160; 215 NW2d 179 (1974) (adopting the above analysis in addressing \u201cwhy the local zoning board could reasonably restrict multiple dwellings in a residential area\u201d).

The city decided to deny plaintiffs request to rezone the property. That is, the city decided to maintain the single-family residential zoning. There do not appear to be any less restrictive means of maintaining the single-family residential zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that any burden placed on plaintiffs exercise of religion is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable in the instant case, it has not been violated.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">RLUIPA applies to burdens imposed by governmental bodies on \u201creligious exercises\u201d in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>implementing land use regulations under which \u201cindividualized assessments\u201d may be made of the proposed uses for the land. An \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d is an assessment based on one\u2019s particular or specific circumstances. A decision concerning a request to rezone property does not involve an \u201cindividualized assessment.\u201d Therefore, RLUIPA is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">A \u201creligious exercise\u201d constitutes \u201cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A). However, something does not become a \u201creligious exercise\u201d just because it is carried out by a religious institution. Because the only connection between religion and the construction of the apartment complex in this case is the fact that the apartment complex would be owned by a religious institution, the building of the apartment complex does not constitute a \u201creligious exercise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">A \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on one\u2019s \u201creligious exercise\u201d exists where there is governmental action that coerces one into acting contrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs by way of doing something that one\u2019s religion prohibits or refraining from doing something that one\u2019s religion requires. A mere inconvenience or irritation does not constitute a <em>\u201csubstantial </em>burden\u201d; similarly, something that simply makes it more difficult in some respect to practice one\u2019s religion does not constitute a \u201csubstantial burden.\u201d Because the city has not done anything to coerce plaintiff into acting contrary to its religious beliefs, the city has not substantially burdened plaintiffs religious exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Even if the city did substantially burden plaintiffs religious exercise, imposition of that burden here is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest, namely, the enforcement of local zoning ordinances, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. Therefore, even assuming that RLUIPA is applicable, RLUIPA was not violated. For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-5\">Taylor, C.J.,and Corrigan and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> <em>Smith, supra </em>at 884, held that <em>Sherbert </em>was distinguishable because <em>Sherbert </em>involved an \u201cindividualized governmental assessment\u201d; that is, the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard at issue in <em>Sherbert </em>allowed the government to consider the plaintiffs \u201cparticular circumstances.\u201d See pp 387-388 of this opinion.

The <em>Murphy </em>definition of \u201csubstantial burden\u201d seems inconsistent with RLUIPA because RLUIPA specifically defines \u201creligious exercise\u201d as \u201cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\u201d 42 USC 2000cc-5(7)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> We recognize that some courts have held that a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d exists where there is \u201cdelay, uncertainty, and expense.\u201d See, for example, <em>Sts Constantine &amp; Helen Greek Orthodox Church v City of New Berlin, </em>396 F3d 895, 901 (CA 7, 2005), and <em>Living Water Church of God v Meridian Charter Twp, </em>384 F Supp 2d 1123, 1134 (WD Mich, 2005).

In Smith, the United States Supreme Court held that generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified under the Free Exercise Clause by a compelling governmental interest. However, \u201cwhere the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of \u2018religious hardship\u2019 without compelling reason.\u201d <em>Smith, supra </em>at 884. Proponents of RLUIPA argue that Congress has the authority to enact RLUIPA because it merely codifies <em>Smith. </em>However, the lower courts in the instant case held that, under RLUIPA, a religious institution need not abide by a generally applicable, religion-neutral zoning ordinance unless it is justified by a compelling governmental interest. This seems inconsistent with the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in <em>Smith, </em>which held that a generally applicable, religion-neutral law does not have to be justified by such an interest. Whenever possible, courts should construe statutes in a manner that renders them constitutional. <em>People v Bricker, </em>389 Mich 524, 528; 208 NW2d 172 (1973).
