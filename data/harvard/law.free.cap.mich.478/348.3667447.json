Plaintiffs claim that, because neither ordinance contains a hunting exception, the ordinances conflict with and are preempted by MCL 324.41901, a statute that gives the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) the authority to regulate and prohibit the discharge of firearms and bows under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>However, because plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing that their property is a hunting area \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.41901 <em>et seq., </em>there is no need to determine whether defendants\u2019 ordinances are preempted by the statute. Moreover, the administrative rule promulgated by the DNR to administer part 419, Mich Admin Code, R 299.3048, pertains only to townships, not cities such as defendant city of Saginaw. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, although for different reasons.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Plaintiffs own a 56-acre parcel of property located in the city of Saginaw. Plaintiffs claim that the property has been used for hunting for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In 1999, defendant city of Saginaw enacted Saginaw Ordinances, title IX, \u00a7 130.03(D), which prohibits the discharge of firearms within the city.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>contains four exceptions, but does not provide an exception for hunting. Subsequently, in 2002, defendant enacted Saginaw Ordinances, title IX, \u00a7 130.02, which prohibits the discharge of many types of projectiles, including arrows \u201cby use of any bow ... .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This ordinance contains no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In 2003, plaintiff Michael Czymbor sought a hunting permit from the DNR. However, according to plaintiffs\u2019 affidavit, the DNR denied plaintiff a hunting permit because the DNR \u201cunderstood that hunting was not allowed\u201d on plaintiffs\u2019 property as a result of defendants\u2019 ordinances. The DNR further indicated to plaintiff that it would issue hunting permits in the future if the city ordinances are repealed and \u201chunting is restored to the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Plaintiffs filed an action for a declaratory judgment and a motion for a temporary restraining order, challenging the validity of the two ordinances because neither contained an exception for hunting. Plaintiffs claimed that the ordinances were invalid to the extent that they interfered with lawful hunting activity. Because the DNR was granted the authority to regulate or prohibit the discharge of hunting weapons under MCL 324.41901, plaintiffs argued that the statute preempted the ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Subsequently, defendants filed a motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), contending that the ordinances were enacted as a valid exercise of the city\u2019s police power under the Home Rule City Act, MCL 117.1 <em>et seq. </em>Moreover, defendants claimed that \u00a7 41901 did not preempt the city ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>nances because the regulation of the discharge of weapons was a subject area that was separate and distinct from the regulation of hunting. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition, concluding that the statute did not preempt the local ordinances because the ordinances did not regulate the same area as the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that the city ordinances were not preempted by MCL 324.41901.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panel noted that state law preempts a municipal ordinance where either a direct conflict exists between the enactments, or where the statute completely occupies the field that the ordinance attempts to regulate. Because no direct conflict existed, the panel analyzed the \u201cfield preemption\u201d issue, concluding that the statute did not preempt the ordinances because \u201cfirearm control is a subject distinct from the field of hunting control\u201d and that defendant city had authority as a home rule city to enact measures to assure public peace and safety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Plaintiffs sought leave to appeal in this Court, arguing that the city\u2019s antidischarge ordinances were preempted by state law. This Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequently, after oral argument, we directed the parties and amicus curiae DNR to file supplemental briefs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Resolution of the issue presented in this case involves the interpretation of MCL 324.41901. Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ***8 Moreover, this Court reviews the decision to grant or deny summary disposition de novo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AQW\">A. THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Part 419 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, entitled \u201cHunting Area Control,\u201d consists of five statutory provisions. The statute at issue, MCL 324.41901, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(1) In addition to all of the department powers, in the interest of public safety and the general welfare, <em>the department may regulate and prohibit hunting, and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow, as provided in this part, on those areas established under this part where hunting or the discharge of firearms or bow and arrow may or is likely to kill, </em>injure, or disturb persons who can reasonably be expected to be present in the areas or to destroy or damage buildings or personal property situated or customarily situated in the areas or will impair the general safety and welfare. <em>In addition, the department may determine and define the boundaries of the areas. </em>Areas or parts of areas may be closed throughout the year. The department, in furtherance of safety, may designate areas where hunting is permitted only by prescribed methods and weapons that are not inconsistent with law. When<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ever the governing body of any political subdivision determines that the safety and well-being of persons or property are endangered by hunters or discharge of firearms or bow and arrows, by resolution it may request the department to recommend closure of the area as may be required to reheve the problem. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">The clear language of \u00a7 41901 grants the DNR the authority to \u201cregulate and prohibit\u201d the discharge of firearms and bows and arrows, but that authority is limited to <em>\u201cthose areas established under this </em>part....\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, plaintiffs have made no showing that their property is an area \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419. Because plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing, there is no basis to conclude that the statute is applicable to plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In their supplemental briefs, plaintiffs and the DNR maintain that plaintiffs\u2019 property need not be \u201cestablished\u201d under part 419 because the DNR has the \u201cexclusive authority to regulate the taking of game\u201d under MCL 324.40113a(2), and that hunting on private land is generally permitted everywhere, subject to the permission of the landowner.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the issue before us today is not where hunting is permitted. Rather, the issue before us is the applicability of MCL 324.41901.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The plain language of the statute requires that property be \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419 before the regulatory provisions of \u00a7 41901 apply. In other words, the DNR\u2019s authority to regulate the discharge of weapons on property under \u00a7 41901, and any potential reciprocal limitation on the city of Saginaw\u2019s ability to prohibit the discharge of weapons within its city limits, exists only to the extent that the subject property has been \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419. While the DNR enjoys \u201cthe exclusive authority to regulate the taking of game,\u201d MCL 324.40113a(1), there is no indication that the legislative grant of authority to regulate the taking of game is superior to or supersedes the specific legislative grant of authority at issue <em>here </em>\u2014 the <em>authority to regulate the discharge of weaponry.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In any event, the DNR cannot exceed the authority granted by the Legislature to regulate the discharge of weaponry under MCL 324.41901.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, while the DNR\u2019s interpretation of the statute is given some measure of deference, its construction cannot conflict with the plain language of the statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which requires that property be \u201cestab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>lished under\u201d part 419 before the regulatory provisions of \u00a7 41901 are applicable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">Because plaintiffs have not shown that their property is \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, there is no basis to conclude that the statute is applicable, thus eliminating the need to decide whether defendants\u2019 ordinances are preempted by MCL 324.41901.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">B. THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Additionally, while not discussed by the parties or the DNR, we also note that the current administrative rule promulgated by the DNR to administer part 419 applies to townships but not to cities such as defendant. Thus, even if plaintiffs could show that their property was \u201cestablished under\u201d part 419, which they cannot, the administrative mechanism currently in place would not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Mich Admin Code, R 299.3048 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">(1) The hunter area control committee was created by section 1 of Act No. 159 of the Public Acts of 1967. It is composed of a representative of the department of natural resources, a representative of the department of state police, <em>the township supervisor, </em>and a representative of the sheriffs department of the counties involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">(2) The committee selects a chairman from its members who serves for a year, then alternates with a member from another agency. The department of natural resources performs clerical, operational, and administrative duties of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>committee. Expenses incurred are borne by the member\u2019s department. Costs of surveys and actions outside the committee and the sheriffs department are borne by the department of natural resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">(3) In the interest of public safety and the general welfare, the committee may regulate and prohibit hunting and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow on those areas where hunting or the discharge of firearms or bow and arrow may or is likely to kill, injure, or disturb persons who reasonably can be expected to be present in the areas or to destroy or damage buildings or personal property situated or customarily situated in such areas or will impair the general safety and welfare. The committee may determine and define the boundaries. Areas may be closed throughout the year or parts thereof. The committee, in furtherance of safety, may designate areas where hunting is permitted only by prescribed methods and weapons not inconsistent with law. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">While the administrative rule was originally promulgated to administer the predecessor statute to MCL 324.41901, there is no indication that the current rule does not remain in full effect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Justice Weaver\u2019s dissent claims that reading Rule 299.3048 according to its plain language is contrary to <em>\u201ca </em>plain reading of part 419.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 369. However, nothing in part 419 describes or requires any particular mechanism of implementation. Rather, a \u201cplain reading of part 419\u201d indicates that the mechanism of implementation is left to the discretion of the DNR. Here, it is clear that the DNR has chosen to administer MCL 324.41901 by means of Rule 299.3048.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">The actions of the DNR throughout these proceedings have been, to say the least, contradictory. Initially, the DNR refused to issue hunting permits to Michael Czymbor <em>solely </em>because of the existence of defendants\u2019 discharge ordinances. However, the DNR now claims that these same ordinances are invalid to the extent that they do not provide a hunting exception, because only the DNR may prohibit the discharge of weaponry in hunting areas under MCL 324.41901. Moreover, the department claims that areas need not be established under part 419, despite the clear language of MCL 324.41901, because its \u201cexclusive authority to regulate the taking of game\u201d under \u00a7 40113a(2) obviates the need to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 41901. Additionally, the DNR has failed to acknowledge the existence or effect of Rule 299.3048. Certainly, if the DNR no longer wishes to acquiesce to defendants\u2019 antidischarge ordinance, it is free to take the necessary steps to amend its administrative rules to conform to the view it urges in its briefs. It may not, however, simply ignore the language of MCL 324.41901 or the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Appeals granting summary disposition to defendants is affirmed, although for an alternative rationale.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-5\">Taylor, C.J., and Corrigan and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> In affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, we do not address and take no position on the Court of Appeals preemption analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> The ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">(1) <em>Discharge Prohibited. </em>It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">(2) <em>Exceptions. </em>It shall not be a violation of this section to discharge a firearm under the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">(a) In the protection of life;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">(b) Law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">(c) An established and lawfully permitted educational program properly supervised;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-14\">(d) Military functions, such as parades, funerals, firing blank charges.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> The ordinance provides that \u201c[n]o person shall discharge or propel any arrow, metal ball, pellet or other projectile by use of any bow, long bow, cross bow, slingshot or similar device within the City limits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b441-5\"> <em>Czymbor\u2019s Timber, Inc v City of Saginaw, </em>269 Mich App 551; 711 NW2d 442 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> 475 Mich 909 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> 477 Mich 1277 (2007).

Allowing the city of Saginaw to prohibit the discharge of firearms and other weapons without an exception for the taking of game and without seeking approval from the DNR to close the city of Saginaw to the taking of game usurps the exclusive authority of the DNR to regulate the taking of game throughout the state and makes it impossible for the DNR to fulfill its statutorily mandated duties.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b448-7\">WEAVER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMG\">(dissenting).

The ordinances as enacted do not contain an exception for hunting activities. The Michigan Legislature has mandated that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) shall have the exclusive power to \u201cregulate and prohibit hunting, and the discharge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>firearms and bow and arrow\u201d within the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A governing body of any political subdivision may request that the DNR close an area to hunting for safety or other concerns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, it is ultimately the DNR, not the local government, that regulates hunting, including the imposition of an absolute hunting prohibition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the state reserves exclusive jurisdiction to regulate a field, a municipal corporation cannot regulate the same field if the regulation results in a conflict between state regulations and local regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, the plain language of MCL 324.41901 <em>et seq., </em>hereafter referred to as part 419, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), provides the exclusive method by which the discharge of weapons may be prohibited in hunting areas, and explicitly authorizes the DNR to determine and define the boundaries of hunting areas in Michigan, to which part 419 applies. The majority\u2019s holding that Mich Admin Code, R 299.3048 limits the application of part 419 exclusively to townships contravenes the plain language of part 419 and belies basic rules of interpretation governing administrative regulations.

Part 419 vests the power to \u201cregulate and prohibit hunting, and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow\u201d in the DNR. MCL 324.41901(1). In the event that a local governing body deems that the safety measures in place are inadequate to protect the general welfare, the local governing body can petition the DNR for a resolution closing additional lands to hunting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The DNR must then hold a public hearing, conduct investigations, and submit its findings of facts and recommendations to the governing body of the local governmental unit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">After receiving the DNR\u2019s recommendations, the governing body can either accept the measures recommended by the DNR, or it can do nothing. If the governing body accepts the measures recommended by the DNR, it can incorporate the recommendations into a local ordinance that is identical to the DNR\u2019s recommendations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The DNR retains authority to unilaterally terminate closure of an area to hunting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the governing body chooses to reject the DNR\u2019s recommendations, part 419 mandates that no further action be taken on the matter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, the plain language of part 419 explicitly authorizes the DNR to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>determine and define the boundaries of hunting areas in Michigan. MCL 324.41901 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\">(1) In addition to all of the department powers, in the interest of public safety and the general welfare, the department may regulate and prohibit hunting, and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow, as provided in this part, on those areas established under this part where hunting or the discharge of firearms or bow and arrow may or is likely to kill, injure, or disturb persons who can reasonably be expected to be present in the areas or to destroy or damage buildings or personal property situated or customarily situated in the areas or will impair the general safety and welfare. <em>In addition, the department may determine and define the boundaries of the areas. </em>Areas or parts of areas may he closed throughout the year. The department, in furtherance of safety, may designate areas where hunting is permitted only hy prescribed methods and weapons that are not inconsistent with law. Whenever the <em>governing body of any political subdivision </em>determines that the safety and well-heing of persons or property are endangered by hunters or discharge of firearms or bow and arrows, by resolution it may request the department to recommend closure of the area as may be required to relieve the problem. Upon receipt of a certified resolution, the department shall establish a date for a public hearing in the political subdivision, and the requesting political authority shall arrange for suitable quarters for the hearing. The department shall receive testimony on the nature of the problems resulting from hunting activities and firearms use from all interested parties on the type, extent, and nature of the closure, regulations, or controls desired locally to remedy these problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">(2) Upon completion of the public hearing, the department shall cause such investigations and studies to be made of the area as it considers appropriate and shall then make a statement of the facts of the situation as found at the hearing and as a result of its investigations. The department shall then prescribe regulations as are necessary to alleviate or correct the problems found. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The majority is correct that part 419 only governs hunting weapons regulation of \u201cthose areas established under this part.\u201d However, plaintiffs\u2019 land is subject to part 419 because plaintiffs\u2019 land is a hunting area that the DNR regulates.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The DNR extensively and pervasively regulates hunting in the state of Michigan. In 1996 the people of Michigan, through legislative referendum, vested the DNR with the \u201cexclusive authority to regulate the taking of game\u201d in the state of Michigan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In exercising its exclusive authority to regulate hunting, the DNR may, among other things, issue orders to \u201c[establish lawful methods of taking game,\u201d \u201c[establish geographic areas within the state where certain regulations may apply to the taking of animals,\u201d and \u201c[r]egulate the hours during which animals may be taken.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The orders promulgated by the DNR to regulate hunting are collectively known as the Wildlife Conservation Order (WCO).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chapter XII of the order, titled \u201cManagement Areas Defined,\u201d defines not only the areas in Michigan where hunting is allowed, but what type of animal can be hunted in which area. Saginaw County, in which plaintiffs\u2019 land is located, is mentioned multiple times in the order. WCO 12.73, 12.73a, and 12.73b define the parts of Saginaw County that are subject to DNR regulations with respect to deer hunting \u2014the areas covered include the city of Saginaw. WCO 12.635 defines all of Saginaw County as a hunting area with respect to spring wild turkey management. WCO 12.641 defines all of Saginaw County as a hunting area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>with respect to turkey management. WCO 12.673 defines all of Saginaw County as a hunting area with respect to fall wild turkey management. WCO 12.700 and 12.701 define all of Saginaw County as a hunting area with respect to goose management. And the list continues.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">Clearly, the DNR considers Saginaw County, and the city of Saginaw contained within the county, a hunting area to be managed, properly defined, and established by the DNR. Consequently, because plaintiffs\u2019 land is designated as a hunting area by the DNR, any changes to DNR hunting regulations in the area must follow the procedure outlined in part 419. The DNR has the authority to regulate the discharge of weapons for hunting on plaintiffs\u2019 property under part 419, and the city of Saginaw must follow the procedure outlined in part 419 to enact local ordinances that further restrict hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">B. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE RULES APPLIED TO PART 419</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Given that the DNR has the explicit statutory authority to establish and define hunting areas under part 419, including regulating hunting on plaintiffs\u2019 land, it is now necessary to consider the effect of administrative rules already enacted for the administration of the regulatory provisions of part 419. An administrative agency cannot go beyond the bounds of the statutory authority granted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">MCL 317.332, enacted by 1967 PA 159, was the predecessor statute to MCL 324.41901 (part 419). MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>317.332 was repealed in 1995 by 1995 PA 57, which enacted 324.41901. MCL 317.332 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(1) In the interest of public safety and the general welfare, the committee is empowered to regulate and prohibit hunting, and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow, as herein provided, on those areas established under the provisions of this act where hunting or the discharge of firearms or bow and arrow may or is likely to kill, injure, or disturb persons who can reasonably be expected to be present in such areas or to destroy or damage buildings or personal property situated or customarily situated in the such areas or will impair the general safety and welfare; and the committee is empowered to determine and define the boundaries of such areas. Areas may be closed throughout the year or parts thereof. The committee, in furtherance of safety, may designate areas where hunting is permitted only by prescribed methods and weapons that are not inconsistent with law. Whenever the governing body of any political subdivision determines that the safety and well-being of persons or property are endangered by hunters or discharge of firearms or bow and arrows, by resolution it may request the committee to recommend such area closure as may be required to relieve the problem. Upon receipt of a certified resolution, the committee shall establish a date for a public hearing in the political subdivision, and the requesting political authority shall arrange for suitable quarters for the hearing. The committee shall receive testimony on the nature of the problems resulting from hunting activities and firearms use from all interested parties on the type, extent, and nature of the closure, regulations, or controls desired locally to remedy these problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(2) Upon completion of the public hearing, the committee shall cause such investigations and studies to be made of the area as it deems appropriate and shall then make a statement of the facts of the situation as found at the hearing and as a result of its investigations. The committee shall then prescribe such regulations as are necessary to alleviate or correct the problems found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Although MCL 324.41901 and MCL 317.332 are almost identical, there are several substantive differences between the two. The first distinction is the addition of the phrase \u201c[i]n addition to all of the department powers\u201d to the beginning of subsection 1 of MCL 324.41901. The second distinction is the addition of the phrase \u201c[i]n addition, the department may determine and define the boundaries of the areas\u201d to the middle of subsection 1 of MCL 324.41901. The third distinction is changing \u201cthe committee\u201d to \u201cthe department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">MCL 317.331, also repealed by 1995 PA 57, defined \u201cthe committee\u201d for purposes of MCL 317.332. MCL 317.331 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">(1) A hunting area control committee, composed of a representative of the department of conservation, a representative of the department of state police, <em>the township supervisor, </em>or if he declines to serve, a representative selected by <em>the township board, </em>and a representative of the sheriffs department of the respective counties involved is established and shall perform such duties as are authorized by this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">(2) The representatives of the state agencies shall be selected from the staff of each agency by its chief authority and designated as that agency\u2019s representative. The committee shall select 1 of its members as chairman and the chairmanship shall be alternated between the agencies each year. The department of conservation shall perform clerical, operational, and administrative duties of the committee in accordance with rules, regulations, procedures and policies promulgated and adopted by the committee and the department of conservation as the agency within which the committee operates. Expenses incurred by individual members in carrying out the intent and purpose of this act shall be borne by the member\u2019s department. Costs of surveys and actions requiring services outside the committee and the sheriffs department shall be borne by the department of conservation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Part 419 does not have a section corresponding to MCL 317.331, the only section in the previous statute that explicitly referenced townships. As a result, the existing statutory scheme does not impliedly or explicitly restrict the application of part 419 to townships. Rather, part 419 applies to \u201cthe governing body of any political subdivision,\u201d as explicitly stated in MCL 324.41901.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The majority argues that Rule 299.3048 restricts the application of part 419 exclusively to townships, not cities. Rule 299.3048 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Rule 299.3048 Hunter area control committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Rule 48. (1) The hunter area control committee was created by section 1 of Act No. 159 of the Public Acts of 1967. It is composed of a representative of the department of natural resources, a representative of the department of state police, the township supervisor, and a representative of the sheriffs department of the counties involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(2) The committee selects a chairman from its members who serves for a year, then alternates with a member from another agency. The department of natural resources performs clerical, operational, and administrative duties of the committee. Expenses incurred are borne by the member\u2019s department. Costs of surveys and actions outside the committee and the sheriffs department are borne by the department of natural resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">(3) In the interest of public safety and the general welfare, the committee may regulate and prohibit hunting and the discharge of firearms and bow and arrow on those areas where hunting or the discharge of firearms or bow and arrow may or is likely to kill, injure, or disturb persons who reasonably can be expected to be present in the areas or to destroy or damage buildings or personal property situated or customarily situated in such areas or will impair the general safety and welfare. The committee may determine and define the boundaries. Areas may be closed throughout the year or parts thereof. The committee, in furtherance of safety, may designate areas where hunting is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>permitted only by prescribed methods and weapons not inconsistent with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The majority argues that under the plain language of Rule 299.3048, the DNR has elected to administer part 419 through the \u201ccommittee,\u201d including the duty to designate hunting areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">There are several flaws with such an interpretation. First this interpretation of the effect of Rule 299.3048 does not consider the extensive and detailed regulations promulgated by the DNR covering the what, when, where, and how of hunting in Michigan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, asserting that Rule 299.3048 allows a \u201ccommittee\u201d to restrict DNR hunting regulation to townships ignores the express mandate in MCL 324.41901 that \u201cthe <em>department </em>may determine and define the boundaries of the areas\u201d to be hunted upon, not a committee. This phrase was added to the statute during the 1995 amendment, and it signifies the Legislature\u2019s intent to empower the DNR, as opposed to the committee, to make all decisions regarding the regulation of hunting. To interpret Rule 299.3048 to vest complete authority to designate hunting areas in a \u201ccommittee\u201d ignores the vast body of regulations that the DNR has promulgated to designate and define hunting areas, long after Rule 299.3048 was enacted. Such a reading would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature and a plain reading of part 419. Because the DNR has continued to define and designate hunting areas in Michigan, it is inconsistent to conclude that the DNR has elected to vest the power to designate and define hunting areas in a \u201ccommittee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The majority supports the applicability of Rule 299.3048 to the current statutory scheme by citing MCL 324.105 and MCL 324.41902(3). MCL 324.105 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>When the department or other agency is directed to promulgate rules by this act and rules exist on the date the requirement to promulgate rules takes effect, which rules the department or agency believes <em>adequately cover the </em>matter, the department or agency may determine that new rules are not required or may delay the promulgation of new rules until the department or agency considers it advisable. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">MCL 324.41902(3) provides that \u201call rules\u201d promulgated before 1986 are still in effect \u201cunless rescinded pursuant to the administrative procedures act.\u201d Although Rule 299.3048 has never been rescinded, the majority\u2019s interpretation that Rule 299.3048 restricts DNR hunting-area control to \u201ctownships\u201d and that the \u201ccommittee\u201d controls hunting-area designations belies basic concepts governing the applicability of administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">While an administrative agency may make such rules and regulations as are <em>necessary for the efficient exercise </em>of its powers expressly granted by the Legislature, the administrative agency cannot <em>exceed </em>or <em>restrict </em>the statutory authority granted by the Legislature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rule 299.3048, therefore, is effective only to the extent that it does not exceed or restrict the statutory mandates in part 419. MCL 324.41902(3) keeps Rule 299.3048 effective today, and MCL 324.105 mandates that Rule 299.3048 be read to \u201cadequately cover the matter\u201d discussed in part 419. Neither MCL 324.105 nor MCL 324.41902(3) authorizes the DNR to restrict hunting regulations to townships. Furthermore, part 419 expressly states that DNR authority applies to the governing body of any political subdivision, not just to townships. If Rule 299.3048 is read to mean that the DNR is restricting its control over hunting regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>to townships, the rule would be narrowing the DNR\u2019s authority to designate, define, and control hunting areas, as granted by part 419. Such an interpretation allows an impermissible abridgment of the authority that the Legislature granted to the DNR.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">Rule 299.3048 (adopted in 1975) is an administrative rule purportedly implementing part 419, and the Wildlife Conservation Order (adopted in 1995, and last revised on April 17, 2007) is a set of regulations promulgated by the DNR that also administers the provisions of part 419. To read Rule 299.3048 to apply only to townships contravenes principles of administrative law dealing with the interpretation of coexisting administrative regulations. There is a presumption in favor of finding harmony between two administrative regulations dealing with similar subjects.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Between two incompatible agency statements, the later one controls over the earlier one.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rule 299.3048 must be read in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Order, and when there is a direct conflict between Rule 299.3048 and the Wildlife Conservation Order, the Wildlife Conservation Order should govern because it was adopted after Rule 299.3048. The \u201ccommittee\u201d created in Rule 299.3048 cannot control hunting-area designations because the Wildlife Conservation Order describes in minute detail hunting areas in Michigan, and the order governs if there is a direct conflict between two regulations. Likewise, Rule 299.3048 cannot limit the application of part 419 to townships because the Wildlife Conservation Order explicitly describes hunting in all of Michigan, and contains no limitation to townships only.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The majority\u2019s interpretation that Rule 299.3048 limits the application of part 419 to townships and vests the authority to designate and control hunting areas in a committee contravenes the plain language of part 419 and belies basic rules of interpretation governing administrative regulations. As a result, I remain convinced that the DNR has the exclusive authority to regulate hunting in Michigan, including the discharge of firearms and bows and arrows for hunting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The DNR has the exclusive authority to regulate hunting in Michigan, including the discharge of firearms and bows and arrows for hunting purposes. Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, the plain language of part 419 explicitly authorizes the DNR to determine and define the boundaries of hunting areas in Michigan. As a result, local governments must follow the procedure outlined in part 419 to adopt additional hunting regulations. The majority\u2019s interpretation that Rule 299.3048 limits the application of part 419 to townships and vests the authority to designate and control hunting areas in a committee contravenes the plain language of part 419 and belies basic rules of interpretation governing administrative regulations.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-6\">KELLY, J., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> MCL 324.41901(1); see MCL 324.40113a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> MCL 324.41901(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> MCL 324.41901(1) and (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\"> <em>People v </em>Llewellyn, 401 Mich 314, 322 n 4; 257 NW2d 902 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> MCL 324.41901.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> MCL 324.41902(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\"> MCL 324.41903.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b450-12\"> MCL 324.41902(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> MCL 324.40113a(2), found in part 401 of the NREPA, which concerns wildlife conservation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\"> MCL 324.40107(1)(e), (h), and (k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\"> The Wildlife Conservation Order can be found at &lt;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/Wcao_134367_7.html&gt; (accessed May 2, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> <em>York v Detroit (After Remand), </em>438 Mich 744; 475 NW2d 346 (1991); <em>Coffman v State Bd of Examiners in Optometry, </em>331 Mich 582; 50 NW2d 322 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\"> See the Wildlife Conservation Order, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> <em>York, supra; Coffman, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b459-4\"> <em>Kearfott Guidance &amp; Navigation Corp v Rumsfeld, </em>320 F3d 1369, 1377 (CA Fed, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\"> <em>Timken Co v United States, </em>166 F Supp 2d 608, 619 (Ct of Int\u2019l Trade, 2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
