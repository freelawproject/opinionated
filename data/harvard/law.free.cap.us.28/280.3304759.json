Hart, Plaintiff in Error <em>vs. </em>Elias Lamphire, Defendant in Error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-4\">This court has no authority, on a writ of error from a state court, to declare a state law void on account of its collision with a state constitution ;.it not being a case embraced in the judiciary act, which gives the power of a writ of error to the highest judicial tribunal of the state. [288]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-5\">The plaintiff in error claimed to recover the land in controversy, having derived his title under \u00e1 patent granted by the state of New York to John Cornelius; He insisted that the patent created a contract between the.state and the patentee, his heirs and assigns, that they should enjoy the laijd free from any legislative regulations to be made in violation of the constitution of- the state, and that an act passed by the legislature of New York,\u00a1subsequent to the patent, did violate that contract. Under that act commissioners were appointed to investigate the contending-titles to all the lands held under such patents as that granted to John Cornelius, and by their proceedings, without the aid of a jury, the title of the defendants in error was established against, and defeating the title under a deed made by John Cornelius, the p\u00e1tent\u00e9e, and which deed was executed under the patent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-6\">This is not a case within the clause' of the constitution of the United States, which prohibits a state from passing laws which shall impair the obligation of contracts. The-only contract made by the state is a grant to John Cornelius, his heirs and assigns of the land. The patent contains no covenant to do or. not to do any further act in relation to the land; and the court are not inclined to create a contract by implication.' The act cf the legislature of New York does not attempt to take the land from the patentee, the grant remains'in full effect; and the proceedings of the commissioners under the law, operated upon titles derived Under, and not adversely to the patent. [289]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-7\">It is within the undoubted powers of state legislatures, to pass recording acts by which the elder grantee shall be postponed to a younger, if the prior \"deed is not recorded withi\u00f1. a limited'-time; and the power is the same whether the deed is dated' before or after the recording act. Though the effect of such a deed is to render the prior deed fraudulent and void against a subsequent purchaser, it is not a law violating the obligation of contracts. So too is the power to pass limitation laws. Reasons of sound policy have led to'the general adoption of laws of this description, and their validity cannot be questioned. The time .and manner of their operation, the exceptions to them, and the acts from which the time limited shall begin to run, will generally depend on the sound discretion of the legislature, according to the nature of the titles, the situation of the country, and the emergency which leads to their enactment. Cases may occur, where the provisions of a law on these subjects may be so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of a right, and to call for the interposition of this court.

On the trial of the cause, a bill of exceptions was tendered by the plaintiff, and a writ of error .was prosecuted by him'to the supreme court of errors of the state of New York,, where the judgment of the court below was affirmed; and the plaintiff brought up the case to this court by writ of erlror. The title of the plaintiff, as stated in the bill of exceptions, was derived under letters patent, for the whole tot number thirty-six, issued to John Cornelius, and his heirs and assigns, under the great seal of the state of New York, dated the 17th of July 1790; and a conveyance in fee of the lot from the patentee to.Henry Hart, dated the 17th of January 1784, duly proved and deposited for record, according to the provisions of a statute of the state, on the 25th of April 1795. Evidence was also-given to prove that Henry Hart died some time in the summer of 1788, leaving the lessor of the plaintiff his heir at law, he being then a minor, aged about five years. That about the year 1791, he was taken to Canada by his paternal uncle, and afterwards entered into the employ of the North ,West Company, and continued in the same for upwards of sixteen years, and then returned to-New York ; and has since resided in Albany in that state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\">The title of the defendant was derived from the same patent to John Cornelius, and under a deed, executed by him, dated.

The letters patent, granting the. lot to John Cornelius, created a contract with the grantee, his heirs and assigns, that they should enjoy the same free from any legislative regulations, to be made in violation of the constitution of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-10\">2. -The act. of the legislature Of the state of New York violated the constitution of the state and the United States; and the determination or award of the commissioners under it w\u00e1s a nullity\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-11\">3. It violated that provisi\u00f3n of the constitution of the state which ordains, that \u201c the legislature of this state shall, at ho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>time hereafter, institute any new court or courts, but such as shall proceed according to the course of the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-5\">4.

It was, therefore, as well for these violations of the state constitution as on general principles, a statute which impaired the obligation of contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">6. The Onondaga commission was a court, within the meaning of the' constitution of the state, which did not proceed according to the course of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">7. It was without precedent; and was an arbitrary, ex parte, and summary tribunal, proceeding in violation of all the.securities of property, which the citizens of that state had .confided by their constitution to the protection of their common law courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-9\">Mr Hoffman, for the defendant in error, made the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">1. On a writ of error, to the court oflast resort, in a state; under the circumstances of this case; the only error which can be alleged or regarded is, that the act of the legislature, in pursuance of which the award was made, is repugnant to the constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-11\">2. The act of the legislature of New York, entitled .\u201can act to settle disputes concerning the title to lands in the county of Onondaga,\u201d passed the 24th of March 1797, is not repugnant to the constitution of the United States, nor is the award under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-12\">3. The plaintiff in error contends that, the patent of. the state of New York implies a contract, on the part ofthe state with the grantee, his heirs and assigns, for ever; <em>that 'the legislature of the state should not pass any law affecting the </em>estate, <em>contrary to the state constitution: </em>that the law constituted \u00e1 <em>court </em>which did not proceed by jury, according to the course of the common law, and thus the act impairs the obligation of an implied contract, and violates the constitution of the United States :</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>. Fdb the defendant it is denied, that any such contract can be inferred or implied from the grant, nor any other than such as could have been fairly implied fivm it, if it had been \u2022made by the late colony of New York, or by any. citizen of the state, or of lands lying without the state; and the law will not imply a covenant not to do an act which the state con-? stitution had made impossible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9T\">The act of - March <em>24, </em>1797 is not contrary to the constitution of the statebut has been uniformly declared by the courts of the state, and lately by its highest court of judicature, to be consti tutional $ and their decision is final on'this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">5. The Onondaga commissioners were not a court; and could \u00edi\u00f3t make any judicial sentence respecting these lands: by the proviso to the third section of the. act, where' the par-' ties would agree before them to abide by their determination, this \u00bfward is declared to be final: in all other Cases they acted \u00bfs commissioners to ascertain and report the state of the title to these lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-7\">6. Th\u00e9ir \u00bfward,, assuch, had no effect or force .to divest or impair the estate s and if a party is concluded by it\u00bb it is because-he has consented and agreed thereto, by his neglect to file his dissent, and bring his . .suit within the period prescribed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-8\">The act is a beneficial statute of limitations, which did not- begin to run uritil after, the award was made, andr\u00f3es not impair the obligations of any. con tract;'</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b305-9\">Mr Justice Baldwin</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">delivered, the opinion of.the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Both parties, claim the premises in. question, under John Cornelius, to.whom the state of New York granted.them by patent, dated, the 7th of July, 1790, in consideration of his military services.in the revolutionary war.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. Six years before the dale of the patent, and while the title of Cornelius was \u00a1imperfect, he conveyed , the premises to Henty Hart-, thefathet. of the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, by deed dated January, the 17th, 1784, proved and deposited in the office of theclerk of the cbunty of Albany, according to law, on the 25th of April 1795..</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Henry Hart died in 1788, leaving the plaintiff, his only child, and. heir at law, who was born the 21st of September.. 1784, removed to Canada i\u00f1, 1791, and remained there, till 1807.or 1808, when he returned to Albany, where he , resided till the commencement of this suit of May term 1825: he claims as heir at law. to. his fatliei.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On the 23d. of June 1784,, John. Cornelius conveyed/the same premises to Samuel Broom by deed;, duly proved and; deposited as aforesaid op the. 3$ of April. 1795. The title of Broom, by sundry-, mesne conveyances, became . vested, in William J. 'Yredenbiirgh, who conveyed to the defendant. The premises were vacant till 1808,..when possession was taken under Vredenburgh, who then held .the.title of Broom..</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant.did not question the Original validity Of the deed to Henry Hart,, but rested his defence, on ,an act of assembly of the state of New York, passed the 24th of Match .1797, to settle disputes concerning'titles to . lands in the county of Onondaga, the-provisions of which fire, set forth, in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The defendant offered in evidence an award made by two Of the commissioners appointed:,fey this act, awardingdhe land in controversy to-William J. Vredeftburgh and John Patterson (to whom Broom had conveyed); the /award was dated December-17th; 1799, and no dissent was entered by. the plaintiff. The court admitted the award to be read in evidence; and gave in charge to the jury, that it was'competent and conclusive to defeat the title of the plaintiff. Judgment was rendered for the defendant in the supreme court, and affirmed in the court of errors; and the case comes before fis hy writ of error, under the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The plaintiff contends, that the act of the 24th of March-1797, and fill proceedings under it, are void'; being a violation hoth of that part of the constitution of the United -States which declares, that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, and of the constitution of the state of New York, which declares that the legislature shall at no time institute any new court but such as shall proceed according to the course of the common law 5. and that trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>jury in all cases in which it hath heretofore been used, shall be established, and remain inviolate for ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">This court has no authority, on a writ of error from a state court, to declare a state law-void on account of its collision with a state constitution; it not being a case-embraced in the judiciary act, which alone gives power to issue a writ of error in this case; and will therefore refrain from expressing any opinion on the points made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in relation to the constitution of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The plaintiff insists, that the patent to John Cornelius cremates a- contract with the grantee, his heirs and assigns, that they should enjoy the land therein granted, free from any legislative regulations to be made in violation of the constitution of the state; that the act in question does violate some of its provisions; and therefore impairs the obligation of a contract</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">, The court are not inclined to adopt this reasoning, or to consider this as a case coming fairly within the clause of the constitution of the United States relied t on by the plaintiff. The only contract made by the state is a gr\u00e1nt to John Cornelius, hfe heirs and assigns, of.the land in question: the patent contaihs.no covenant to do or not to do any further act in relation to the .land; and we. do hot, in this case, feel at liberty to create one by implication. The state has not by this act impaired the force oflhe grant; it does not profess or attempt to take the land from the assigns of Cornelius, and give it to-one not claiming under him; neither does . the award produce that effect: the grant remains in full force, the property conveyed is-held by his grantee^and.the state asserts no claims to' it. The question between the parties is, which of the deeds from Cornelius.carries the title. Prer suming that the laws of New York authorized a soldier to convey his bounty land before receiving a patent, and that at the date of the deeds there was no law compelling the grantees to record them, they would take priority from their date. This is the legal result of the, deeds, but there is no contract on the part of the state,, that the priority of title shall depend solely on the principles of \u00bfhe common law, or that the state shall pass no law imposing on. a grantee the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>performance of acts which were not. necessary to the legal operation of his deed at the time it was delivered. . It is within the undoubted power of state legislatures to pass recording acts, by which the elder grantee shall be postponed t\u00f3 a younger, if the prior deed is not recorded within the limited time; and the power is the same whether the deed is dated before.'or after the passage of the recording act. Though the effect of such a law is to render the prior deed fraudulent and void against a subsequent purchaser, it is not a law impairing the obligation cf contracts; such to.o is the power to. pass acts of limitations^ and their effect. Reasons of sound policy have led to the general adoption of laws of both descriptions, and their validity cannot be questioned-The time and manner of their op\u00e9ration, the exceptions to them, and the acts from which the time limited shall begin to run, will generally depend on the sound discretion of the. legislature, according to the nature of the titles,, the situation of the country, and the emergency which leads to their enactment. Cases may occur where the provisions of a law on those subjects may be so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of a right,.and call for the interposition of the court; but the present is. not on\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The state of New York, jn 1794, had felt the necessity of legislating on these military land's. The preamble to the recording act of January 1794, shows very strongly the policy of compelling the deeds for these lands to be recorded; and the known condition of that part of the state,- covered by .military grants, presented equally cogent reasons, in our opinion,-for the passage of the act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As this court is confined to the consideration of only one question growing out of this law, we do not think it necessary to examine its provisions in detail: it. is sufficient to say, that we can see Nothing in them inconsistent with the constitution of . the United States, or the principles of sound legislation. Whether .it is' considered, as an act. of limitations; dr one in the nature of a recording act, or as a law sui generis, called for by the peculiar situation of that part of the state.on which it operates;'we \u00bfre unanimously of-opinion, that-it is not a la'w . which impairs the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of a contract; and that in receiving the award in evidence, and . declaring it to be competent and conclusive on the right of the plaintiff, there was no error in Jhe judgment of the court below. The judgment is therefore affirmed;</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">This.cause came on tobe heard on the transcript of the record from the court for the trial \u2019of impeachments and correction, of errors for the state of New York, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof; it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors for the. statejpf New York in this cause, be, and. the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
