The libellant alleges that while \u201cemployed as a painter and performing seaman\u2019s duties aboard a certain dock which was owned by or under the control of the respondent who was using it in the navigable waters in the harbor of Boston, Massachusetts, in pursuance of navigation\u201d he was injured by falling into the hold because of a defect of the dock. The libel states that the accident was caused by a negligent failure on the part of the respondent to provide the libellant with a safe place t\u00f3 work, to provide him with suitable appliances, and to refrain from other negligent conduct. It is further alleged that the libellant has received from his employer\u2019s insurer no award under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 1927, 44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901 et seq., and has the right to proceed under the general admiralty and maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">The respondent excepted to the libel and moved to dismiss on the ground that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act prescribes the exclusive remedy for the libellant and forecloses <em>his </em>bringing a suit in admiralty or at law. The lower court dismissed the libel and an appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">It is undisputed that the Act provides an exclusive remedy <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the employer for compensation for injuries or death for all \u201cemployees\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>covered. From the plaintiff\u2019s libel it is clear that he is a harbor worker covered by the Act. He is employed on a dock; he is a painter. The allegation that he was performing seaman\u2019s duties does not negative his being a harbor worker. International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 1926, 272 U.S. 50, 47 S.Ct. 19, 71 L.Ed. 157; Carumbo v. Cape Cod S. S. Co., 1 Cir., 1941, 123 F.2d 991. The whole tenor of the libel indicates that the libellant falls within the Act. It is true that masters or members of the crew of a vessel are not covered by the Act. But it does not appear that the libellant is engaged in navigation or is a member of a ship\u2019s company. See South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 1940, 309 U.S. 251, 260, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732. Nor does there appear to be the permanent attachment to a vessel which commonly characterizes a crew. See Norton v. Warner Co., 1944, 321 U.S. 565, 573, 64 S.Ct. 747, 88 L.Ed. 430. The allegation that the libellant was performing seaman\u2019s duties is not a sufficient allegation that he was a member of the crew since seaman is not synonymous with member of a crew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>but includes harbor workers. Carumbo v. Cape Cod S. S. Co., supra. Not only is there no allegation that the libellant was a member of a crew of a vessel or a master but the libel discloses just the opposite. A dock \u2014 even a floating dock \u2014 can Hardly be considered a vessel since docks do not come within the statutory definition of vessel as including \u201cevery description of water craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.\u201d Rev.Stat.1875, \u00a7 3, 1 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3 (1940); cf. Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 1887, 119 U.S. 625, 627, 7 S.Ct. 336, 30 L.Ed. 501; Berton v. Tietjen &amp; Lang Dry Dock Co., D.C.N.J.1915, 219 F. 763, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Section 5 of the Act states that \u201cif an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required * * * an injured employee * * * may elect to claim compensation under this Act, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages.\u201d The libellant contends that whether or not the respondent maintains compensation insurance is a question of fact; that the burden of proving this fact is on the respondent, and that until it is shown that there is compensation insurance the exclusive remedy provided by the Act does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We find it difficult to understand this contention in view of the following statement from the libellant\u2019s brief: \u201cBut your libellant further says that it is clear from paragraph 5 of his libel that the libellee does in fact have compensation insurance, and in paragraph 5 it has been alleged that \u2018The libellant has received from his employer\u2019s insurer no award under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harborworkers\u2019 Compensation Act or under any other Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u2019 \u201d And later the libellant states: \u201c * * * it is apparent that the libellant could not mean that he has received no \u2018payment\u2019 and the use of the word \u2018award\u2019 would further seem to imply that he had in fact received some payment of compensation. * * * \u201d Since the libellant himself admits his libel makes it clear that the respondent in fact has compensation insurance, we cannot agree with the contention now raised that the remedy under the Act is not here exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Libellant also maintains that his libel can be construed as a libel against a third party and not as against his employer. If this were so, of course the Act would not preclude the action. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 1946, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099. But we fail to see how libellant can successfully maintain this claim. The libel speaks in terms of the \u201cemployer\u2019s insurer\u201d, and the libellant states that this shows the respondent had insurance. Furthermore, the libellant not only did not urge in the district court that his libel could be construed as stating a cause of action against a third party, but on the contrary admitted that it was intended as stating an action against his employer. Also libellant\u2019s assignment of errors is silent on this point. On these facts, the contention that this can be construed as an action against a third party is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The order dismissing the libel is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-12\"> Section 5 states: \u201cThe liability of an employer prescribed in section 4 shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee * * * and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this Act, an injured employee, or his legal representative in ease death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under this Act, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-17\"> Section 2(8) states: \u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
