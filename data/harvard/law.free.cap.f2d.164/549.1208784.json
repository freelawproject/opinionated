PIAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b605-23\">Zigainitsky appeals from an order denying his petition for naturalization, and the case turns upon the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 331, 332 and 347(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts are as follows. He filed a \u201cdeclaration of intention\u201d on July IS, 1938, very shortly after his admission to permanent residence; but, since he was caught in Shanghai when war broke out between Japan and ourselves, he was not able to file a petition for naturalization until October 23, 1946, more than eight years after he had filed the declaration. In 1938, although the statute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required no more than that the alien should file his declaration \u201ctwo years at least prior to his admission,\u201d it prescribed that his petition should be filed \u201cnot less than two years nor more than seven years after he has made such declaration.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Nationality Act amended the \u201cdeclaration section\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so that the declaration had to be filed \u201cnot less than two nor more than seven years at least\u201d before the petition; it also amended the \u201cpetition section\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so as to allow the petition to be filed \u201cnot less than two nor more than ten years after\u201d the declaration. This strange anomaly apparently arose as follows. The President had appointed a committee to revise the nationality laws, which recommended to the House that the time within which the petition might be filed after the declaration, should be extended from seven to ten years. This change the committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>put in the \u201cpetition section\u201d; but it left the \u201cdeclaration section\u201d untouched. The House 'did not accede to the change; it wished the interval to remain at seven years; and to accomplish this it amended the \u201cdeclaration section\u201d as we have said\u2014 incidentally leaving the words, \u201cat least,\u201d which then became meaningless. However, it failed to make any corresponding change in the \u201cpetition section,\u201d and it passed both sections in that form, nobody noticing the conflict. When the bill reached the Senate, it too passed both sections as they stood, again without observing that they clashed; and so the statute has stood ever since, in spite of a later effort to harmonize the sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Thus, if Zigalnitsky\u2019s declaration had been filed after the Nationality Act of 1940 went into effect \u2014 January 13, 1941 \u2014 and seven years had elapsed before the petition was filed, we should have been faced with a troublesome question of statutory construction, one which, however, as it turns out, we need not decide, for the following reason. Since the declaration was filed in 1938, the time had not expired on January 13, 1941, within which it would support a petition for naturalization under both the \u201cdeclaration section,\u201d and the \u201cpetition section,\u201d either as they had stood, or as the new act had amended them. The question before us may therefore be narrowed to whether the \u201cdeclaration section,\u201d as amended, put an end to the declaration seven years after it was filed: i.e. on July 15, 1945; and we will assume arguendo that it would have done so except for the \u201cSaving clauses\u201d section of the Nationality Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That section provided that a number of sections of the act \u2014 the \u201cdeclaration section\u201d among them \u2014 should not be \u201cconstrued to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate of naturalization or of citizenship, or other document or proceeding which shall be valid\u201d when the act went into effect. Therefore, since the declaration of July 15, 1938, was on January 13, 1941 still \u201cvalid\u201d to support a petition, the result turns upon what was comprehended in its preserved \u201cvalidity.\u201d None of the old sections had expressly limited the \u201cvalidity\u201d of a declaration; but the \u201cpetition section\u201d had impliedly done so, by setting a term to the period within which a petition must be filed. That implied limitation was extended to ten years by the new act; so that there could be no doubt that the declaration was \u201cvalid\u201d to support it, had there been no change in the \u201cdeclaration section.\u201d Since the new act <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provided that this section should not \u201caffect\u201d any \u201cdeclaration of intention,\u201d the situation is precisely the same, pro hac vice, as though the \u201cdeclaration section\u201d had never been amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Order reversed; petition granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-14\"> \u00a7\u00a7 731, 732 and 747(a), Title 8 U.S. C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-16\"> Act March 4, 1929, \u00a7 1, 45 Stat. 1545.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-24\"> Act June 29, 1906, \u00a7 4, subd. 2, 34 Stat. 597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-26\"> \u00a7 731, Title 8 U.S.O.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b605-27\"> \u00a7 732, Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b606-17\"> \u00a7 747(a), Title S U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b606-18\"> \u00a7 747(a), Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
