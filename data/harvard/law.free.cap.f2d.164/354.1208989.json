Having been indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California on a charge of violating Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 148\u2014Dres-sed Hogs and Wholesale Pork Cuts, Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 169\u2014 Beef and Veal Carcasses and Wholesale Cuts, Revised Maximum Price Regulation No. 239\u2014Lamb and Mutton Carcasses and Wholesale Cuts, Maximum Price Regulation No. 389\u2014Ceiling Prices for Certain Sausage Items at Wholesale, and Maximum Price Regulation No. 398\u2014Variety Meats and Edible By-Products at Wholesale, he obtained leave from that court to file the present complaint under Section 204(e) of the Emergency Price Control Act, 50 U.S. C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 924(e). The complainant seeks to have the five regulations and all amendments thereto to June 30, 1946, declared invalid ab initio. The sole ground of invalidity relied upon is that the regulations dealt with agricultural commodities but did not receive the prior written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture as required by Section 3(e) of the Emergency Price Control Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 903(e). The respondent has moved to dismiss the complaint. The motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">The regulations here under attack did not deal with live animals but solely with the meat and other edible by-products derived from their slaughter. In Superior Packing Co. v. Earl W. Clark, Director, Division of Liquidation, Department of Commerce, 164 F.2d 343, an attack was made by the complainant upon RMPR 169 and MPR 398 identical with that made by the complainant in the present case. In the Superior Packing Company case we have held that although a live steer is an \u201cagricultural commodity\u201d within the meaning of the Emergency Price Control Act, the carcass which is obtained upon its slaughter, as well as the wholesale cuts, retail cuts, brains, kidney, heart, liver and other edible by-products obtained therefrom, are not \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>but within the meaning of the Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 903(c), are commodities \u201cprocessed or manufactured in whole or substantial part\u201d from an agricultural commodity, the live steer. The reasons for our ruling are fully stated in our opinion in the Superior Packing Company case and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that upon the authority of that case we are compelled to reject the contention of the complainant in the present case that the regulations which he attacks were void because they constituted action taken by the Administrator with respect to \u201cagricultural commodities\u201d without the prior approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, in violation of Section 3(e) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
