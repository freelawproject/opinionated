It was further ordered that on said day a master would be appointed to state and settle the accounts between plaintiffs and defendants arising out of and connected with their dealings and transactions, said accounting to include the issues of fraud tendered as to this stock deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">We cannot agree with the district judge that the matter of the stock deal and the sales contract and the dealings of the defendants with which the pleadings deal can be separated into such water tight compartments as to authorize a decree of specific performance without a hearing on the whole case and a determination on the facts as developed on the trial as to whether in justice and equity defendants are entitled to such a decree. Specific performance is not grantable as a matter of right, but only as a matter of equity, and in the exercise of a sound and informed discretion upon a knowledge of the whole facts. Wherever, therefore, the truth of the matters bruited may lie, whether there is a real fire beneath, and accounting for, the smoke of the accusations is not a matter which ought to, or may be, determined on pleadings and without a trial of the facts. Without then determining whether the specific performance defendants prayed for should or should not be ordered upon the whole facts, we think it quite clear that it ought not to have been ordered on the pleadings but that the case should have been tried out upon all the matters tendered, for the purpose of determining whether, first, defendants have a valid contract of purchase, and, second, if they have, whether equity will specifically enforce it or leave defendants to their remedies at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The district judge, in turning his decision as he did, upon the established principle that the \u201cclean hands\u201d maxim<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not intended to, and does not, operate punitively, and that its applicability depends upon the connection between the complainants\u2019 iniquitous acts and the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>fendants\u2019 conduct, which the complainants \u25a0rely upon as establishing their cause of action, looked too closely on the limitations, not closely enough on the scope, of the maxim. But more than that, he seemed to overlook the fact that the remedy of specific performance which \u2022 defendants \u25a0sought, is not accorded as a matter of right to every suitor but only upon equitable considerations <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to those who can make out an .equitable case for it. It is not meant by this to say that if plaintiffs prove what they have alleged, the court must deny specific \u25a0performance. It is meant only to say that defendants are not entitled to a decree for specific performance on the pleadings. 'Whether the case is one for specific performance must wait upon a hearing and determination as to the facts and the deci\u2022sion by the chancellor upon them in the exercise of a sound and informed discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not incon\u25a0sistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-22\"> This long drawn out pleading controversy running through 233 printed pages was begun by the filing on April 24, 1945, of a bill of complaint against the appellees, narrating the transactions and dealings which appellant Tchitcherine, as the owner of substantially all the stock of the Deauville Corp., had had with appellees, and characterizing them as attended on defendants\u2019 part with fraud and wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-23\">These included the execution of a sales contract between Deauville Corp., as seller, and Winkel and Lasser, as buyers, the later \u201cabandonment of the sale of said property and the merger\u201d of all of the agreements for its sale, and all transactions ^connected with them, into a stock deal by which the defendants Lasser and Winkel became the owners of 51 percent of the capital stock of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-24\">There was an offer to do equity and a prayer for \u201crescission of all transactions and dealings\u201d between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-26\">On June 8, 1945, an amended complaint was filed, followed on Sept. 24, 1948, by a second amended complaint in which the other appellants, Wm. M. F. Magraw and Ivy Blount, as trustee, joined with the original plaintiff. This complaint, going in much greater detail into the transactions and occurrences with which the original complaint dealt, charging that the conduct of the defendants had been characterized by fraud and overreaching and misdealing throughout, and offering to do equity, sought an examination of all the facts connected with the stock deal and its rescission and cancellation for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-27\">On November 4, 1946, the defendants filed their answer and their cross-complaint for specific performance of the Deauville Corp. sales contract. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>pleadings they denied all charges of fraud and overreaching and, offering to surrender their ownership of 51 percent of the capital stock of the corporation, they urged that the sales contract be specifically enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">On November 25, 1946, plaintiffs filed their answer to the cross-complaint. In it they denied that the sales contract was a valid one, re-alleged all the matters set out in their second amended complaint and alleged that the contract was void for want of mutuality and that, because of the fraudulent acts and conduct of defendants set out in the answer and in their former pleadings in connection with the subject matter of the sales contract and the subsequent stock deal, the order ought not to be enforced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-15\"> 19 Am.Jur., \u201cEquity\u201d, Secs. 469, 473-4-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-20\"> 49 Am.Jur., \u201cSpecific Performance\u201d, Secs. 6 to 9, ind.; Cf.
