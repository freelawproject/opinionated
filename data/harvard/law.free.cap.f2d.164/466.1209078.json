HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">The trustees in reorganization of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, appeal from an order dismissing a petition in which they asked leave to pay off loans made by the Reconstruction Finance 'Corporation \u2014 which we shall call the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d \u2014 to the railroad with interest at four per cent, instead of at five per cent at which the road had borrowed the money. When the reorganization proceeding was begun on October 23, 1935, the road had already borrowed of the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d more than $7,000,000 upon notes bearing interest at five per cent, for which it had put up as collateral an assorted group of securities of the \u201cNew Haven System.\u201d From November 1, 1933, until shortly after the proceeding began, the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d had accepted four per cent instead of five, but it thereafter demanded five per cent as stipulated. The trustees in reorganization tried unsuccessfully a number of times to induce it to go back to the lower rate, and finally on December 21, 1938, Jesse Jones, Esq., chairman of the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d wrote them the letter which wTe quote in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This the trustees never answered, nor did they ever promise to pay the notes, or tender payment. However, the interest upon the collateral proved large enough, not only to meet the interest in full but to make substantial inroads upon the principal; and large parts of the collateral were also sold and applied in further reduction. Over six years after the letter of December 21, 1938, that is on January 29, 1945, the trustees wrote to the \u201cR.F.C.,\u201d asking the reduction in the rate from five to four per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cent, \u201cretroactive\u201d to the beginning of the proceeding, and stating as their reason that nearly one half of the principal had by then been paid, and that \u201cinterest at the foregoing rates has been paid currently.\u201d They did indeed mention the letter of December 21, 1938, only to say that the situation had much improved since it was written. The \u201cR.F.C.\u201d replied on February 14, refusing to make the \u201cretroactive\u201d reduction, but consenting to the reduction effective January 1, 1943, and from then on this was the agreement; this controversy is over one per cent from October 23, 1935, or thereabouts, to January 1, 1945. Twice more \u2014 on July 10, 1945 and on June 18, 1946 \u2014 the trustees asked the same \u201cretroactive\u201d reduction, offering to pledge, as additional collateral, securities which they had redeemed from other loans; and both times the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d again refused. Shortly after the last of these requests had been denied\u2014 on July 12, 1946 \u2014 the trustees filed the petition now at bar, basing their claim upon Mr. Jones\u2019s letter. Their position is double: they allege (1) that they had let pass opportunities to refinance the notes at a lower rate than five per cent, acting in reliance upon the letter; and they allege (2). that it was a unilateral offer to reduce the interest, if they speeded up realization on the collateral, which they did. The only testimony offered to prove that they had in fact let pass any opportunities to refinance the notes in reliance upon the promise, was that of the road\u2019s vice-president and comptroller, who, when asked whether the trustees would have tried to refinance the notes, answered: \u201cI think that letter certainly had a very large bearing, and we had all interpreted it that if the loans were paid off in the reorganization proceedings that (sic) the <em>4% </em>interest rate would be made retroactive to the date of the proceedings.\u201d The judge held that they had not acted in reliance upon the promise; and that it was, to say the most, exceedingly doubtful whether they could have refinanced the notes for 4% or better.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We addressed ourselves first to a point which appears only in the trustees\u2019 reply brief on this appeal in answer to an argument in the \u201cR.F.C.\u2019s\u201d brief that the law of New York does not recognize the doctrine of \u201cpromissory estoppel,\u201d on which the trustees rely. They invoke an amendment to \u00a7 33, subd. 2 of the New York Personal Property Law, Consol. Laws, c. 41, made in 1936, under which \u201can agreement * * * to discharge in whole or in part, any contract * * * shall not be invalid because of the absence of consideration,\u201d if it is in writing and signed by the party. They argue that since the notes were made in New York and were payable there, the validity of the promise to discharge a part of the interest must be judged by the law of that state, and that Mr. Jones\u2019s letter satisfied the conditions prescribed in the section, although the promise was not made in New York. We refuse to decide this question, for, although it is true that we may affirm a judgment upon grounds not urged in the lower court, we may not reverse one upon such a ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is particularly apposite in the case of an argument raised for the first time after the appellee has filed its brief, which it has had no chance to answer. Whether the point will be open in the district court after this appeal, we do not say; nor do we indicate any opinion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Coming then to the questions open to us, we start with the finding \u2014 for we deem it one\u2014 that \u201cthe failure of the Trustees to refinance the R.F.C. loan may more reasonably be attributed to the shape of the plan and to their reluctance to introduce an additional complication into cumbersome proceedings than to the inducement of Mr. Jones\u2019 promise.\u201d Certainly there was enough support for this in the evidence to prevent our holding that it was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d We need not decide whether any alternative refinancing would have been possible; but we do de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u2022cicle that those difficulties which Judge Hincks points out in his opinion, were serious enough to make it incumbent upon the trustees to show in more detail than they did that they could have surmounted them. Moreover, that aside, their three later efforts to induce the \u201cR.FJC.\u201d to reduce the interest \u201cretroactively\u201d were inconsistent with their present position. It is enough to consider only the last of these, that in June, 1946. If during the past seven and a half years they had, in reliance upon the letter, let pass available opportunities for refinancing, we cannot imagine what could have led them to use this language: \u201c* * * we renew our request for a rate of 4% for the whole period of the proceedings with the understanding if you are agreeable that we will petition the Court for an order providing for the pledge of the former Railroad Credit Corporation collateral with your Corporation in consideration of the reduction.\u201d Surely, if they then believed that they had a valid right to the reduction, or even if they were putting forward an argument which, though not legally binding, rested in any degree whatever upon the equity of their position, that was the occasion to say that they had been relying all along upon the promise, and that the \u201cR.F.C.\u201d was, in honor at least, bound to perform it. Instead of which we find them offering as a reason, not what they <em>had </em>done, but what they proposed to do. Finally, what could be more equivocal and less convincing than the testimony we have quoted \u2014 the only testimony which they produced at all? Clearly; the whole notion of a \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d is an afterthought, after their precatory approaches were finally seen to be fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Nor is their second ground any stronger: i.e. that the letter was a unilateral offer in consideration of their bestirring them-SL'lves \u201cto speed up the payment\u201d of the notes, which they accepted by repeatedly asking and getting leave of the court to sell the collateral, by virtue of which they made \u201cvarious sums (aggregating nearly two million dollars) available.\u201d The letter admits of no such interpretation, even though the condition was also a consideration; it did not ask for efforts by the trustees; it required that the loans should be \u201cfully paid.\u201d It is impossible to torture those words into an effort to do the best one could, when one could.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-12\"> \u201cRECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION WASHINGTON</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Jesse H.
