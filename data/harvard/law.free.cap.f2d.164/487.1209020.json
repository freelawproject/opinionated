Equally unfortunate for him is the fact that in Martin v. U. S., 10 Cir., 100 F.2d 490, the points he makes against the Federal statute, and his conviction under it, have all been correctly decided against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
