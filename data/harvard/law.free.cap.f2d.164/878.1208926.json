In a brief reviewing the evidence and citing cases in support of his views appellant almost, but not quite, makes out his case. The evidence of the government was brief, and it was circumstantial, but taken in connection with the defendant\u2019s denials, it cannot be said of it that it was not of that cogency required in a circumstantial evidence case. To set the evidence out will serve no useful purpose. It is sufficient to say of it that it supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
