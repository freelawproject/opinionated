This, the appellants contend, necessitates a judgment in the appellants\u2019 favor under Schad v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, 3 Cir., 136 F.2d 991. Out of an abundance of caution we have reexamined our previous ruling in the light of the entire record and find it to be correct. We are of the opinion now, as we were of the opinion then, that the principles of Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 225, 227, 59 S.Ct. 467, ,83 L.Ed. 610, rule the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-12\">The appellants assert also that the injunction entered by the court below was too wide in scope. The sweep of the injunction is broad but in view of all the circumstances we cannot say that the learned trial judge abused his legal discretion in entering the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">We find also, contrary to the assertions of the appellants, that the evidence offered was competent and sufficient to prove the appellee\u2019s damages under Bigelow v. R.K.O. Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 LEd. 652. Cf. the earlier decisions in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Material Co., 273 U.S. 359, 379, 47 S.Ct. 400, 71 L.Ed. 684, and Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 563, 51 S.Ct. 248, 75 L.Ed. 544. This phase of the case at bar is most competently analyzed, as are its other aspects, in the opinion of the court below. See William Goldman Theatres, Inc. v. Loew\u2019s Inc., D.C., 69 F.Supp. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-15\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
