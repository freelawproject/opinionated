N.L.R.B., 308 U.S. 401, 60 S.Ct. 300, 84 L.Ed. 347, such order is not a final order within the meaning of Section 10(f), of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(f), a principle applied by us in Inland Container Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 6 Cir., 137 F.2d 642; and it being also our view that neither Section 2 of the recently enacted Administrative Procedure Act, nor Section 10 thereof, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1009, extends our power of review to such orders as do not, merely by reason of their promulgation, adversely affect or aggrieve the complaining petitioner; and it being further the view of the court that it will be time enough to consider the validity of the order when a case arises upon a complaint of the Board and a determination by it that an unfair labor practice has been committed, and the controversy now being presented to the court by reason of a motion by the respondent to dismiss the petition for review, it is ordered that the petition be and it is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
