In her amended complaint plaintiff charged the defendant with negligence (1) in failing to keep the passage-way in a reasonably safe condition, (2) in failing to light the storeroom where plaintiff fell, and (3) in failing to warn plaintiff of the presence of the box. In its answer defendant denied that it was negligent, denied that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by or resulted from any negligence on the part of defendant, and denied that plaintiff was invited to use the rear exit of the store. Defendant asserted that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the result of her own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The issues raised by the pleadings were tried to a jury. At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that \u201cThe evidence shows that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.\u201d The case was submitted to the jury. Tt returned a verdict for plaintiff, upon which was entered the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The defendant asserts that the court erred in not directing a verdict in its favor. It also asserts that the trial was unfair, because the court denied the defendant the right to adequately cross-examine the plaintiff, and because of improper remarks of counsel for the plaintiff made during the trial and in his argument to the jury, to which objection was taken by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\"> The denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict merely constituted a ruling that, under the evidence, the issue of plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence was not a question of law for the court. The ruling was not erroneous. According to plaintiff\u2019s evidence, she was using the passage-way to the back door at the invitation of an employee of the defendant. She was not required to anticipate that there was any obstruction in or dangerously near \u2022the passage-way. Compare, Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Miller, 8 Cir., 84 F.2d 148, 154, 155; E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Frechette, 8 Cir., 161 F.2d 318, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The plaintiff was apparently the only person who knew where she fell or what caused her fall. The case therefore turned upon the jury\u2019s appraisal of her credibility and the weight of her testimony. In her original complaint she had alleged that at the rear exit there was \u201ca screen door to which was attached an extremely heavy spring for the closing of said door when not held or propped open; that the threshold of said door was worn and cracked and sagged when stepped upon; that there was a drop of twenty inches or more from said threshold * * * to the ground with no step intervening * * *She also alleged that in attempting to leave the store by the rear door she came in contact with a box of merchandise in the passageway, and \u201cwas thereby caused to stumble or to trip and fall out of the door of defendant\u2019s store and onto the ground; that in falling plaintiff was struck by the screen door aforesaid, which door was pulled by a heavy spring as aforesaid, and as a result of falling and being so struck, plaintiff was injured * * *She then alleged in her original complaint that the defendant was negligent in failing to keep the passage-way in a reasonably safe condition and in permitting the box to be in or near the passage-way. The next paragraph of the original complaint stated: \u201cThat by reason of defendant\u2019s negligent acts, as aforesaid, plaintiff was caused to stumble, or to trip and fall out of the door of said defendant\u2019s store and was struck by the door as stated aforesaid, and that as a result of plaintiff\u2019s fall and being struck as stated aforesaid * * *,\u201d she suffered the injuries of which she complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">In the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint she made no reference to \u201can extremely heavy spring\u201d on a screen door or to a worn, cracked or sagging threshold. She alleged in that complaint \u201cthat as a result of coming in contact with said box of merchandise which obstructed the aisle leading to said exit door, the plaintiff was caused to stumble and fall toward said door, and that, while in the act of falling over the threshold, the employe who was holding said screen door open, released it and said door struck plaintiff, and as a result of falling through said door onto the ground below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>plaintiff was injured as herein set out,</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">At the trial the plaintiff, on direct examination, testified that as she walked through the rear room of the store \u201cbetween the piles of feed and boxes going to the rear door,\u201d she stumbled over an orange crate and fell; that she had reached the steps leading from the rear room to the exit door when she struck the crate; that she had started to go up the steps; that Miss House, the clerk, who plaintiff testified had preceded her, was standing holding the screen door open; that she (plaintiff) did not fall completely out of the door, but that the upper part of her body was past the threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that the crate was piled up right by the door of the rear room; that the crate was on the floor, not on the steps; that she does not know whether she was going up the steps or walking across the floor when her foot hit the crate; that when she stated she had started to go up the steps she misunderstood her counsel; that she stumbled over the box before she reached the steps; that she does not know how far before; that she does not know just where the orange crate was; that she fell forward and partly out of the door; that her head and shoulders were outside; that the orange crate \u201cwas just laying there by the steps\u201d; that she does not know whether the room was lighted or not; that the door did not hit her at any time; that she told Judge Swink (counsel who signed her original complaint) that there was a screen door to which was attached an extremely heavy spring; that the spring on the door had nothing to do with her falling; that she knew the spring was heavy because she saw it. Counsel for the defendant then asked this question: \u201cDid you tell Judge Swink that the threshold of that door was worn and cracked and sagged when you stepped on it?\u201d Counsel for plaintiff made the following objection: \u201cYour Honor, I object to that. There is no complaint being made here that the threshold had a thing to do with it; as counsel well knows. How a petition is prepared \u2014 \u201d The court sustained the objection. Counsel for defendant stated that plaintiff\u2019s original complaint charged that the threshold caused her to fall, and that he had a right to show she had changed her case. After a colloquy between counsel and the court relative to the right of defendant to question plaintiff with respect to a change in her account of the happening of the accident, counsel for defendant again asked, \u201cDid you tell Judge Swink that the threshold of the door was worn and sagged when you stepped on it?\u201d Counsel for plaintiff objected \u201cto that as a collateral matter. What she told him has nothing to do with it.\u201d The court sustained the objection. Counsel for defendant then asked the plaintiff if she knew whether the threshold of that door was worn and sagged and cracked when she stepped on it. That was obj ected to and the court said: \u201cSustained. Any objection will be sustained along that line in the examination, to save time.\u201d After another objection was sustained to a question about the threshold, counsel for defendant said to the court: \u201cDoes Your Honor mean I cannot show that the accident happened some other way than she now claims, that she claimed something else?\u201d The response of the court was: \u201cNo, I do not mean that at all. I do mean that the cross examination will not be permitted. You can show it by some other witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">On further interrogation by counsel for defendant, the plaintiff testified that there was no step outside the door, and that she fell across the door. She was then asked this question: \u201cWhen you first\u2014 when you talked to Judge Swink about this case, and when you first filed this suit, did you claim you fell out the door?\u201d The court sustained an objection to that question. After some discussion between the court and counsel for defendant, relating to further interrogation of the plaintiff about her original complaint, counsel said, \u201cMay the record show that the Court will not permit me to ask the question, either outside or in the hearing of the jury?\u201d The court\u2019s response was, \u201cThe record will so show.\u201d On redirect examination, counsel for plaintiff asked the witness the question: \u201cCounsel has interrogated you as to what has been said in the petition [original complaint]. Did you ever read or write ?\u201d Her answer was, \u201cNo\u201d. On recross examination, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>\u25a0\u25a0answer to the question, \u201cYou know whether you fell out of the door or inside of the door?\u201d, she testified, \u201cI fell out of the door.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s original complaint was received in evidence and read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In his opening argument to the jury, counsel for plaintiff said: \u201cAll the Kroger people had to do was to keep that aisle free of boxes. If they are going to permit people to go out there, not alone tell them to go out through there, I say to you under the law it is the duty of the Kroger Company to keep that aisle way clear, and then, having directed some unfortunate person to pursue that way to get out of the store, and you render that person a hopeless cripple, have that company in a court of justice have some lawyer come before you who has tried everything except the facts \u2014 \u201d Counsel for defendant interposed and said, \u201cI object to that argument and statement- and ask that the jury be discharged and the costs of the case taxed against Mr. Dearing. It is an absolutely unwarranted statement.\u201d The court overruled the obj ection. Counsel for defendant then asked that the jury be instructed to disregard the statement \u201cthat some lawyer came here to try everything but the facts.\u201d The court overruled that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We think enough has been said about the trial of this case to demonstrate its unfairness. Unfortunately, the trial at times deteriorated into a sort of brawl between opposing counsel, distracting to the court and no doubt equally distracting to the jury. Under the circumstances, it seems more probable that the jury\u2019s verdict represents its appraisal of the relative merits of the attorneys than a considered judgment of the merits of the case based upon the evidence and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Counsel for the defendant had the right to cross-examine the plaintiff with respect to apparent discrepancies between the allegations of her pleadings and her \"testimony at the trial, and to show, if he \u25a0could, that she had changed her story as \u25a0to how and where she fell and as to what \u25a0caused or contributed to the injuries she .received. If the court had limited defendant\u2019s cross-examination only with respect to the threshold, we would have no criticism of that action, but the court went further than that and cut off inquiry on other subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">\u201cIt is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even .though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them.\u201d Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 692, 51 S.Ct. 218, 219, 75 L.Ed. 624. To cut off all inquiry on a subject with respect to which the defense was entitled to make reasonable inquiry is an abuse of discretion and prejudicial error. A trial court is under no obligation to protect a witness from being discredited on cross-examination, \u201cshort of an attempted invasion of his constitutional protection from self incrimination, properly invoked.\u201d Id., at page 694 of 282 U.S., at page 220 of 51 S.Ct., 75 L.Ed. 624. Moreover, a greater latitude is allowable in the cross-examination of a party who takes the witness stand than with respect to other witnesses. Rea v. Missouri, 17 Wall 532, 542, 84 U.S. 532, 542, 21 L.Ed. 707. See, also, and compare, Toplitz v. Hedden, 146 U.S. 252, 254, 13 S.Ct. 70, 36 L.Ed. 961; Kunglig Jarnvagsstyrelsen v. Dexter &amp; Carpenter, 2 Cir., 32 F.2d 195, 197, 198; Stolte v. Larkin, 8 Cir., 110 F.2d 226, 231, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">With respect to the alleged misconduct of counsel for plaintiff in his argument to the jury, his insinuation that opposing counsel had \u201ctried everything except the facts\u201d had nothing whatever to do with the merits of the controversy between the parties. The remark was improper and offensive and the refusal of the court to direct the jury to disregard it was error. The attitude of this Court and of other federal appellate courts toward the interjection of irrelevant personalities and appeals to prejudice or passion in final argument, has been so clearly stated in many cases as to call for no further discussion. New York Central R. Co. v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 310, 317-319, 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>S.Ct. 300, 73 L.Ed. 706; Union Pacific R. Co. v. Field, 8 Cir., 137 F. 14; Brown v. Walter, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 798; F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Wilson, 5 Cir., 74 F.2d 439, 442, 443, 98 A.L.R. 681; Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Kelly, 8 Cir., 74 F.2d 31, 36, 37, Id., 8 Cir., 84 F.2d 569, 573-576; London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co. v. Woelfle, 8 Cir., 83 F.2d 325, 338-344; Palmer v. Miller, 8 Cir., 145 F.2d 926, 932; Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. Green, 8 Cir., 164 F.2d 55, 64. This Court, in the interest of an orderly administration of justice, will continue to do all that reasonably may be done to assure litigants that a trial in a District Court of the United States shall be so conducted that the verdict of the jury fairly may be assumed to be based upon an impartial consideration of the evidence and the* applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Other matters of which the defendant complains are unlikely to recur upon a new trial and need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
