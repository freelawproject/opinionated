They obtained service on defendants, citizens of Oklahoma, by serving their agent and general manager in Texas in charge of the oil field operations in respect of which plaintiffs were employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-24\">The appellees, by motion to strike, pleaded that on its face the suit was barred by the two year statute of limitations in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-25\">Appellants, replying \u201cThat the defendants, though within the state when the cause of action herein sued on arose, have thereafter absented themselves so that they have not resided or been within the state for as much as two years between the commencing of the cause of action and the filing of this suit,\u201d and by uncontradicted testimony proving the facts they alleged, invoked Art. 5537, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants filed no counter plea, offered no rebutting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>The district judge, in an opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> erroneously assuming that the defendants had by pleading and proof made the issue, held that since, in conformity with Art. 2033b, Texas Civil Statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defendants had an agent in Texas upon whom service of process could be and was made, Art. 5537, invoked by plaintiffs, was without effect to toll the statutes, the causes of action sued on were barred, and defendants\u2019 motion to strike should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Appellant, urging that the order and opinion are contrary to, indeed in the face of, all the applicable Texas authorities, are here insisting that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">We agree with appellants. The invoked statute enacted in 1841 was early construed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a statute enacted to protect domestic creditors \u201cfrom the inconvenience and loss they would be exposed to by the absence of their debtors and consequent immunity of the latter from process and judgment.\u201d It has been and is consistently held that it should be given a construction to effect that dominant purpose and that it should be applied as written without addition to or substraction from it. This construction, that it is the absence of the debtor from the state that determines the effect of Art. 5537, has been maintained against efforts to limit application of the statute to suits and claims against persons who are citizens and residents of Texas, the courts holding that the statute was equally applicable to a defendant, though a non-resident, who was actually in the state at the time the obligation sued on was incurred or had its inception.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It has been equally maintained, as applicable <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against claims of the kind asserted and allowed to prevail here that the fact that service could be obtained by attachment and by substituted process upon an agent or tenant rendered the statute inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">In Huff v. Crawford, appellants contended that as they had possessed the land in controversy the required length of time by tenant, their absence from the state was immaterial. The Supreme Court in effect approved appellees\u2019 reply, \u201cBut the statute in question makes no exception to an absentee from the state who has a tenant or an agent in the state and where the legislature has made no exception to the statutes of limitation, the court can make none\u201d. And in Wilson &amp; Co. v. Daggett, 88 Tex. 375, 31 S.W. 618, 53 Am.St.Rep. 766, the holding was vigorously reaffirmed against an attack upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Appellees cite no cases to the contrary from Texas; there are none. The cases it cites from other jurisdictions, construing the statutes of those states, are not even persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The motion to strike should have been denied. The judgment is reversed and the \u25a0cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-15\"> \u201cArt. 5537, Temporary absence.
