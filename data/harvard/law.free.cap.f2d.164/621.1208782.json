An extended list of such sulfides is given and aryl sulfides, especially phenol sulfides, and specifically dicresyl sulfide are indicated as suitable. An accelerator and an oxidizing material may also be used if desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Claims 1, 3, 5, and 6 are the broad claims. Of these, claim 1 is illustrative. It reads: \u201c1. The method of plasticizing vulcanized rubber scrap which comprises mechanically working the material under oxidizing conditions with small amounts of admixed acid material and a non-accelerating plasticizing sulfide at a temperature below about 180\u00b0 F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The specific or narrow claims 2, 4, 7, and 8 are illustrated by claim 2, which reads: \u201c2. The method of plasticizing vulcanized rubber scrap which comprises mechanically working the material under oxidizing conditions with small amounts of admixed acid material and a phenol sulfide at a temperature below about 180\u00b0F.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">It will be observed that illustrative claim 1 calls for \u201ca non-accelerating plasticizing sulfide\u201d of which many kinds are named in the specification, and that claim 2 specifies \u201ca phenol sulfide.\u201d This limitation is present in claims 4 and 7. Claim 8 specifies \u201ca dicresyl sulfide,\u201d which elsewhere in the record is said to be \u201ca sulfide of a particular phenol, cresylic acid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">All eight of the claims were rejected by the examiner as lacking invention over anyone of three patents, viz.: Seaman 1,996,001 Mar. 26, 1935; Williams et al. 2,191,266 Feb. 20, 1940; Castello 2,211,592 Aug. 13, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">He further rejected claims 1 to 5, inclusive, as being \u201ctoo broad and inclusive,\u201d and claims 1, 3, and 5 as being \u201ctoo broad and indefinite.\u201d All the foregoing grounds were affirmed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">An additional ground of rejection of claims 6, 7, and 8, which are claims of the \u201cMarkush\u201d type, was applied by the examiner ; to wit, \u201cas being superfluous and unnecessary,\u201d but the board expressly overruled this additional ground, and it is not before us for consideration. So, it appears that claims 6, 7, and 8 stand rejected on the one ground of lack of invention over the prior art cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">As has been indicated, the holding below is to the effect that all eight of the claims are rejectable on any one of the three references. In other words, there is no combination of references but each of the patents was regarded by the examiner and the board as being of itself a complete anticipation, or, at least, it was held that appellant presents nothing patentable over any one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">The examiner analyzed and applied each of the references. The board devoted most attention to the Castello patent, one or two phases of Seaman\u2019s disclosure being referred to also. The only reference to Williams et al. is found in a statement reading: \u201cThe patents to Seaman and Williams [et al.] arc to an extent cumulative to the Castello patent and also deny patentability in the claims as pointed out in the statement of the Primary Examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">This, of course, constitutes blanket approval of the rejection on Seaman and Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>liams et al., but for reasons appearing from the presentation of the case before us we think more attention may properly be given to the disclosure of Williams et al. which lists some SO or more sulfides asserted to be suitable for use in plasticizing rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The fact is that appellant in his brief and in his oral argument before us practically conceded that all the broad claims, that is 1, 3, 5, and 6 read on Williams et al., his brief saying: \u201cThe term \u2018non-accelerating plasticizing sulfide\u2019 used in the broader claims on appeal is broad enough to comprehend the acid sulfides of the Williams patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The term quoted is used in haec verba in claim 2; in claim S the term is \u201ca plasticizing sulfide\u201d; and in claim 6 \u201can aryl sulfide\u201d is mentioned. As has been stated, claim 6 is of the \u201cMarkush\u201d type.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Williams et al. patent, as is pointed out in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, \u201csuggests operation at room temperature or at temperatures \u2018above about 50\u00b0C. [122\u00b0F.]\u2019,\u201d which meets the requirement of all the appealed claims for temperatures \u201cbelow about 180 \u00b0F.\u201d The patent also states, in effect, that the working of the material being processed takes place in the presence of oxygen which, as said by the solicitor, \u201cwould suggest the addition of an oxidizing agent if the atmospheric oxygen were found to be insufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The Williams et al. patent, however, appears to be for the treatment of crude rubber (although rubber is frequently referred to broadly in the specification), while the specification and claims of appellant\u2019s application are limited to plasticizing vulcanized rubber scrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The examiner held, in substance (and the board did not, expressly or impliedly, reverse the holding), that there was no invention in applying to vulcanized rubber scrap in order to reclaim it, the process applied to crude rubber \u201cto produce,\u201d as stated by Williams et al., \u201ca more plastic product.\u201d Fie held that there would be no invention because the peptizing (that is, the plasticizing) action of the sulfides would be the same in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Appellant challenges the correctness of the holding, and in the brief filed on his behalf asserts: \u201cIn this holding the Examiner assumed an equivalence between the plasticizing or softening of crude rubber and the plasticizing or reclaiming of vulcanized rubber which has no basis in the prior art, and, therefore, affords an unsound premise for the Examiner\u2019s action. There is in this record nothing to indicate that anyone had ever thought that any material useful for softening crude rubber could or would be useful for plasticizing or reclaiming rubber scrap, prior to the suggestion in the present application that non-accelerating organic sulfides generally are useful for reclaiming rubber scrap, the Williams patent having previously suggested certain sulfides as useful for plasticizing crude rubber. This is another instance in which the Patent Office has in effect used appellant\u2019s teaching as a reference against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Before passing upon the issue relating te the Williams et al. patent, we deem it proper to look to the Castello patent which, like the application of appellant, is limited to the treatment of vulcanized rubber, such as worn rubber tires, inner tubes, mechanical goods, etc., for the purpose of reclaiming the rubber and putting it into a plastic condition suitable for use in the manufacture of new rubber articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Appellant\u2019s brief says of the Castello patent (page reference omitted) :</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">\u201cThis patent * * * describes the reclaiming of vulcanized scrap rubber by working it in the presence of a small quantity of a vulcanization accelerator, that is, one of the materials (of which a large number are known) commonly incorporated in rubber stocks to be vulcanized to promote the speed of the vulcanization or reduce the temperature required. The patent describes the use of temperatures below 180\u00b0F. for the working, and also describes the use of various materials in addition to the vulcanization accelerator, including rosin, stearic acid, and other materials, <em>some of which may be regarded, as acids within the scope of the claims of the present application. </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">* * * * Jjt sfc</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">\u201cThe distinction between what is described in this patent, and the subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ter broadly claimed in the present application, lies in the use of a non-accelerating sulfide in the process of the application and the use of a vulcanization accelerator, which in some instances may be a sulfide, but not a non-accelerating sulfide, in the process of the patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The board compared the patent with the application, pointing out that the mastication process of the patent is performed in the air, and, therefore, under oxidizing conditions; that rosin, one of the ingredients named by applicant, which in the patent is admixed with the rubber scrap, is an acid material; that an alternative for rosin disclosed in Example III of the paten! is a higher fatty acid (specifically stearic acid) which meets the \u201crosin\u201d and \u201chigher fatty acid\u201d disclosures of the application; and that the patent suggests the use of various sulfides.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The board then said: \u201cThe methods recited in the claims on appeal, therefore, differ from the method disclosed in the Castello patent only in two respects, one being that the sulfide used is \u2018a non-accelerating plasticizing sulfide\u2019; \u2018a phenol sulfide\u2019; \u2018a plasticizing sulfide\u2019; \u2018an aryl sulfide\u2019 or \u2018a dicresyl sulfide\u2019 and the other being that \u2018an accelerator or vulcanization\u2019 is specified as an additional ingredient of the mixture according to claims 3 and 4. We do not find that these differences confer patentability on the claims. The prior art, as exemplified by the Castello patent for example, discloses the use of sulfides as plasticizers in the process claimed and the selection as plasticizers of .sulfides which are \u2018non-accelerating\u2019 does not amount to invention. The application on appeal discloses an exceeding extensive list of sulfides which may be used and this emphasizes the lack of invention in the substitution of any one of them for the sulfide used in the prior art process. We are not impressed with the allegation that a \u2018non-accelerating\u2019 sulfide should be selected since applicant states that in addition to excluding sulfides which contribute accelerating properties, an accelerator of vulcanization may also be added.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">So far as appellant\u2019s use of a- vulcanization accelerator (specified only in claims 3 and 4) is concerned, the examiner stated: \u201c * * * it is comon to add sulfur accelerator, etc. to reclaimed rubber,\u201d and this statement of the examiner does not appear to be challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Both the Williams et al. and the Castello patents, as of course, were applied by the tribunals of the Patent Office to both the broad and narrow claims of appellant. Reserving the narrow claims for later discussion infra, we state at this point that we share the view of the tribunals of the Patent Office, in regard to the broad claims, but it seems to us that' the applicability of the Williams et al. patent to those claims is clearer than is the applicability of the Castello patent. Hence, we have given the former patent more notice than the board gave it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">We are not unmindful of the contention on behalf of appellant to the effect that no art has been cited showing that any one prior to appellant ever suggested that a process useful in plasticizing crude rubber would also be useful in plasticizing vulcanized rubber scrap, but it seems to us that the two substances \u2014 rubber and rubber scrap \u2014 are so clearly related in nature that there could be nothing inventive in applying the Williams et al. process, defined broadly in the specification as a process of \u201ctreating rubber,\u201d to the treatment of rubber scrap. Aside from this it may not be overlooked that the Castello process like that of appellant is limited to rubber scrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Appellant\u2019s brief states: \u201cThe fact is, and -it is comon knowledge, that crude rubber has been plasticized or softened in rubber factories to permit the incorporation in it of the ingredients used to make rubber articles and has then been vulcanized, and that rubber scrap has been treated to produce a reclaimed product, and that these two operations have gone on on an enormous scale practically side by side for decades.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">We doubt if judicial notice properly may be taken of the condition so described, but, even if it may, it may be pointed out that there is no showing in the record as to just what processes have been applied to the respective substances in the operations which have gone on \u201cside by side for decades.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">It is true that there are expressions in appellant\u2019s specification which may be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>strucd to support the statement in appellant\u2019s *brief that \u201creclaiming processes heretofore widely used for rubber scrap have been either the heater process or the digest-er process,\u201d but so far as we can determine from the record there is nothing to show that those processes might not be employed in the treatment of crude rubber. However, if it were shown that those particular heater and digester processes might not successfully be so used, it is not thought that this would demonstrate that the process of the Williams et al. patent would not work as effectively in the treatment of rubber scrap as it does in the treatment of crude rubber.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The board rendered two decisions in the case, the second being in response to a request for reconsideration limited to the specific claims 2, 4, 7, and 8, the first three of which are limited to the use of phenol sulfide and the last to the use of dicresyl sulfide, which latter is itself said to be related to phenol.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">It should be borne in mind that, as stated earlier in this decision in a quotation from the brief for appellant, appellant\u2019s contention with respect to the difference between his claimed invention and the Castello patent lies in his use (1) of a non-accelerating sulfide and (2) of a vulcanization accelerator, the latter of which already has been passed upon, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">As to the former, if we correctly understand appellant\u2019s position, it is that the sulfides disclosed by Castello are all accelerating sulfides. So far as the broad claims 1, 3, 5, and 6 are concerned, he docs not make this contention with respect to the Williams et al. patent, but he docs make it as to the narrow or specific claims 2, 4, 7, and 8, because phenol sulfides and dicresyl sulfides are not non-accelerating sulfides and Williams et al. do not name either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The broad claims, we think, have been sufficiently discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">So far as the applicability of the prior art is concerned neither the examiner nor the board, in its first decision, separated the narrow claims from the broad claims for general discussion, but in its second decision the narrow claims were discussed at considerable length.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">It will be borne in mind that appellant\u2019s contention as to the broad claims reading on the Williams et al. patent did not apply to the narrow claims 2, 4, 7, and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">We deem it unnecessary to set forth the board\u2019s discussion in full. Notwithstanding the fact that neither phenol sulfide nor dicresyl sulfide is designated eo nomine in any one of the reference patents, the board held, in substance, that because of the broad disclosure by the prior art of the use of organic sulfides including sulfides and disulfides, so many of which are named in the different references \u201cthere would be no invention in selecting phenol sulfide or dicresyl sulfide\u201d for use in the Castello process for plasticizing vulcanized rubber. The board said further:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">\u201cThere is nothing in the application on appeal to indicate any remarkable or critical action by the selection of phenol sulfide or dicresyl sulfide, which are included within the broad disclosure of the prior art, instead of one of the numerous sulfides specifically mentioned therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">\u201cThe Primary Examiner has indicated in his statement that the \u2018non-accelerating\u2019 function of phenol sulfide or dicresyl sulfide, in connection with vulcanizing unvulcanized rubber, is a function not related to its function as a plasticizing ingredient for vulcanized rubber and we find no error in such a position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">Appellant\u2019s arguments have been carefully considered but we are not convinced that the board erred in its conclusion based upon the applicability of the prior art cited, and in view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to pass upon the rejection based upon breadth, and indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
