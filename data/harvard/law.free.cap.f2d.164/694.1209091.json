Moynihan, Esq., and entered a plea of guilty to the charge in the indictment. On May 19, 1946, petitioner was arrested by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a charge of violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 408, and was taken before a United States Commissioner at Montrose, Colorado. The Commissioner issued a mittimus \u2022 committing him to the Montrose County Jail. Petitioner was transferred to the County Jail of El Paso County, Colorado, at Colorado Springs, Colorado. While so confined, he attempted to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-24\">On May 7, 1947, petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ground for discharge, he alleged that at the time he attempted to escape he had neither been bound over by a United States Commissioner nor indicted by a grand jury on a charge of felony and, therefore, was not being held on a charge of felony at the time he attempted to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 753h, in part, provides: \u25a0\u201cAny person * * * who is in custody by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or commissioner, or who is in custody \u25a0of an officer of the United States pursuant to lawful arrest, who escapes or attempts to escape from such custody * * * \u2022shall be guilty of an offense. If the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest \u2022on a charge of felony, * * * the offense of escaping or attempting to escape therefrom shall constitute a felony and any person convicted thereof shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or by a fine of not more than $5,000, or both; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The evidence established that petitioner had been arrested and had been committed by the United States Commissioner on a charge of violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 408. The offense defined in \u00a7 408, supra, is a felony. Moreover, the indictment charged that petitioner attempted to escape \u201cwhile in lawful custody by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony,\u201d and his plea of guilty admitted the facts charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">It follows that petitioner was not entitled to discharge on habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-25\"> Hereinafter referred to as petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> Lindsay v.
