The Tax Court so held in the light of the facts of the taxpayer\u2019s case. Since the compensation received by the taxpayer in 1941 was less than 75% of the total so determined the court decided that he was not entitled to the benefit of Section 107. The question as to what constituted the \u201ctotal compensation\u201d of the taxpayer was one of ultimate fact which it was peculiarly within the competence of the Tax Court to decide. Compare John Kelley Co. v. Commissioner, 326 U.S. 521, 66 S.Ct. 299, 90 L.Ed. 278. We are, therefore, not at liberty to review its decision of the question. Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">The decision will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
