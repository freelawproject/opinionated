HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">This is an appeal from a judgment, dismissing the complaint in a patent infringement action because of the invalidity of the patent \u2014 No. 2,318,152. The primary object of the invention is to disclose \u201ca cosmetic holder, all parts of which are wholly composed of plastic material\u201d; and the mechanism disclosed was, in general, concededly old: that is to say: \u201ca cosmetic holder in which the carrier for the cosmetic is advanced by the relative rotation of two slotted members.\u201d However, no such holder had theretofore been made wholly of plastic; and hence the claims. It would serve no purpose verbally to describe the disclosure in detail, or that of Patent No. 2,104,902, issued to Morrison, on January 11, 1938, upon which the judge particularly relied to invalidate the patent in suit. The parallelism between the two cannot be satisfactorily shown without the figures; and we are obliged to assume a familiarity with these in our discussion. We shall consider the issue of validity in two aspects: (1) whether it was an invention to change from metal to plastic; (2) whether, if not, Gelardin\u2019s modifications of Morrison\u2019s disclosure can support his patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">It has at times been said that a change in material can never of itself be invention; but, if that be taken as an absolute, it is not true. Invention is the act of putting together elements \u2014 all usually old \u2014which gives them an added value; and the combination must be one for which exceptional imaginative talent is necessary. How exceptional this must be is another matter; but it would be as absurd to maintain that the substitution of a new material can never require originality, as that it could never make a profitable advance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall therefore assume that the change from metal to plastic might support the patent. The difficulty is that in the case at bar there is no reason to suspect that it did. Although metal had been always used in making such holders before the last war, by the end of 1940 it became plain that it would soon become unavailable. In the words of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses: \"We eventually would completely lose metal.\u201d Under the spur of this Gelardin set about finding a substitute, and began experimenting in plastics, in which he had been already a worker as he had been in metals. He testified that he completed his invention in about three months, and he filed his application during the following summer. The holder went into very wide sales, about 22,500,000 in five years; although that is not as significant as at first blush might appear, for 150,000,000 are sold every year. Furthermore, this success was limited to the war years and the year following; for the uncontradicted testimony was that by the autumn of 1946 the art had \u201call gone back to the metal case, to the extreme limit of the possibilities of securing them.\u201d (sic) Let us then sum up the facts. The need had hardly arisen before it was supplied; there had been no history of earlier unsuccessful efforts; the art repudiated the change as soon as metal returned. Moreover, although there had never been an all plastic holder, there had been at least one partly made of plastic; and that material was already in use for kindred purposes. (Gelardin himself had been making flashlights of metal and plastic, apparently interchangeably.) There seems to us in all' of this not the least basis for inferring that plastic would not have occurred to any competent person, who was looking for a substitute for metal in such a holder. If the disclosure was patentable at all, it was because of the structural changes devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>There had been a long prior art in such holders with various approaches in detail to Gelardin\u2019s disclosure, but we shall disregard it, because Morrison, the last and closest, left nothing to be done which was not involved in, or readily deducible from, the substitution of plastic for metal. The only significant structural differences between that patent and Gelardin are two. (1) Gelardin made the \u201cintermediate sleeve, 23\u201d in which was mounted the \u201ccarrier, 15,\u201d unitary with the \u201cdisc-like bottom, 8.\u201d Instead of this, Morrison fastened'the \u201cguide tube, 4\u201d to the \u201coperating head, 5\u201d by making the inside of the head \u201ccup-shaped,\u201d and the lower end of the \u201cguide tube\u201d flare outwardly. As the \u201cguide tube\u201d was pushed down into the \u201chead,\u201d the sides of the \u201chead\u201d caused the end to be bent outwardly and to look under an undercut, or \u201cannular bearing,\u201d running along the inside of the \u201chead.\u201d This action would be promoted, if the lower edge of the \u201cguide tube\u201d was cut into teeth. In either event the two members were united functionally. (2) Gelardin put the \u201chelical groove, 21\u201d on the inside surface of a \u201csleeve, 23,\u201d which was required to be \u201crelatively thick-walled.\u201d Morrison divided this member into two parts, one of which was an \u201cexterior casing, 12\u201d which was turned inwardly at the top, and had a \u201cbead, 12b,\u201d at the bottom, with vertical \u201cslots, 12c.\u201d Within this \u201ccasing\u201d he inserted the \u201cpropelling sleeve, 8,\u201d containing a \u201chelical slot, 9.\u201d This \u201csleeve\u201d was made out of a flat piece, rolled \u201cinto the sleeve.\u201d It was of such width that \u201cwhen it is rolled into the sleeve the edges do not meet, but leave the vertical end-to-end slot, 10.\u201d The \u201ccasing\u201d and \u201csleeve\u201d were locked against mutual rotation by \u201can indentation, 13,\u201d which protruded inwardly from the \u201ccasing\u201d into the \u201cslot, 10.\u201d They were kept from longitudinal separation by the upper \u201cflange, 12a,\u201d and were functionally a single member. The \u201ccasing\u201d was held against separating from the \u201coperating head, 5,\u201d by the in-turned \u201cbead, 5d\u201d on the \u201chead\u201d which engaged the \u201cbead, 12b,\u201d on the \u201ccasing.\u201d The \u201cslots, 12c\u201d allowed the \u201ccasing\u201d to be pressed into the \u201chead\u201d until the beads engaged. Unlike Gelardin the two rotating members could be disengaged. We can see no other differences that are not too trivial to demand discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The second of these was a mere convenience in manufacture. It was much easier, when working in metal, to fabricate a flat sheet with a diagonal slot, and roll it into a cylinder to be inserted into a cylindrical outer casing, than to make a \u201crelatively thick-walled outer sleeve\u201d with \u201can internal helical groove.\u201d When working in plastic, there are no manufacturing difficulties in moulding the helical groove on the inside of the \u201csleeve,\u201d provided that be made thick enough. As to the first difference, we assume that we must take it that it would have been impossible, when working in plastic, to lock Morrison\u2019s \u201cguide tube, 4\u201d to his \u201coperating head, 5\u201d by turning up 'its lower edge within the \u201chead,\u201d as Morrison disclosed. There is no contradiction of Hammer\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe chances are that they\u201d (the teeth) \u201cwould all break off.\u201d Be it so, it does not seem to us possible that, if a worker in plastic found this to' be true when he followed Morrison\u2019s disclosure, he would have been checked by his inability by some other means to lock together the \u201cguide post, 4\u201d and the \u201coperating head, 5.\u201d The very fact that he was dealing in plastic would suggest to him that the two members could' be moulded as one. The testimony upon this is uncontradicted. Gelardin himself conceded that it had been' known for \u201ca good many years\u201d that a moulder in plastic \u201ccould make in one piece what in metal required two pieces to be joined together.\u201d And Brunhaber, Gelardin\u2019s plastic fabricator, testified that if he were faced with a metal article \u201cmade in several pieces\u201d which was to be reproduced in plastic, he would try to make it into \u201cone piece, if it is possible\u201d; for that was \u201cone of the advantages of using plastic.\u201d A priori, we cannot therefore regard the first of the two changes as demanding more than the common knowledge of the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Thus it appears that, once metal became scarce, resort to plastic was almost inevitable; and that once resort was had to plastic, the art needed nothing more to guide it than Morrison. Even so, a vast success might make plausible the case for invention; but here there was not any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>success. On this record the success, which even in its day was no more than sizable, was ephemeral' \u2014 a flash in the pan \u2014 extinguished as soon as the transitory occasion for its emergence disappeared. The examiner had steadily refused to allow any claims in the face of Morrison, until two were added which emphasized the thickness of the walls of the outer sleeve; and he then yielded only after one of those personal interviews which are so often successful. What arguments were used we cannot know; but it is easy to understand how the obsessive persistence of a skillful solicitor might overcome the examiner\u2019s doubts. After all, he might have reasoned, it was not unfair to yield, if he was in genuine doubt. At least that gave the applicant his only chance, and the public would have the protection of an equally interested opponent to present the other side. We agree with the judge that the patent is invalid for lack of invention over Morrison; indeed, more plainly so than any other that has come before us for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-10\"> Smith v.
