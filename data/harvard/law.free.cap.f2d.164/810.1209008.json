They are brought under \u00a7 24(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******of the Public Utility Holding Company Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to modify two orders of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the Commission. Since the two petitions raise the same legal point they were briefed together in this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In brief, what is sought by the petitioner is that the Court modify the order in which the Commission (1) directs that the existence of the Delaware Company be terminated and (2) orders further proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 11 (b) (2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The theory upon which these petitions for modification are based will be discussed below. But, first, a summary of prior steps with regard to the Delaware Company and its related corporations is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The Delaware Company, a holding company pure and simple, owns all the shares \u25a0of the Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota corporation, which will be referred to as the Minnesota Company hereafter.\" The Minnesota Company is an operating public utility company which, however, also owns shares in other companies which are themselves holding companies. The nature and extent of that ownership is not relevant here. The Delaware Company was organized to hold the stock of the Minnesota Company because Minnesota law, at the time, imposed a liability on shareholders in corporations which, it was thought, would interfere with the marketing of the securities of the Minnesota Company. Subsequently, the Minnesota law was changed and the reason for the Delaware Company\u2019s existence terminated with that change. This statement of fact is not a matter of dispute between the parties and it is conceded by all the participants in this litigation that the Delaware Company\u2019s life must come to an end. So far as it is concerned, the question here involved is not \u201cwhat\u201d but \"how.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The Delaware Company, on June 3, 1942, inaugurated voluntary proceedings for its termination by filing a plan for liquidation and dissolution under \u00a7 11(e)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Two days later, June 5, 1942, the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>started proceedings under \u00a7 11 (b) (2)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and two other Sections not relevant here. The \u00a7 11 (b) (2) proceedings and the \u00a7 11 (e) proceedings were consolidated by Commission order.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Hearings were had and the plan submitted by the Delaware Company, as amended pursuant to Commission recommendations, met with an order approving the plan by the Commission dated October 31, 1945.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This plan was taken to the District Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota on the Commission\u2019s application pursuant to \u00a7 11 (e) for judicial enforcement. Certain objections developed. The post-war situation had made definite that which had been a subject of prophecy while the war was on and the financial situation both as to earnings and taxes had changed during the three year period between the filing of the plan and the enforcement proceeding. The Commission, therefore, vacated its order of approval and the matter was reopened for further hearings which were duly had.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">On November 6, 1946, the Delaware Company filed with the Commission what is called its second amended plan, for liquidation and dissolution under \u00a7 11 (e) of the Act. On November 8, 1946, the Commission entered the first order complained of under \u00a7 11 (b) (2), one of the terms of which ordered the termination of the existence of the Delaware Company and the filing by it of a plan for its liquidation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This portion of the order was opposed by the Delaware Company before the Commission and upon its defeat before that body it raises the question of the legality of the Commission\u2019s action in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">The above recital of facts shows that the question before this Court is a very narrow one. No one is seeking to prolong the life of the doomed Delaware corporation. Nor has this Court before it the merits of a plan for distributing its effects after its corporate death. The sole question is whether exhaustion of the \u00a7 11 (e) proceedings is a condition precedent to a commencement of proceedings under \u00a7 H (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">Delaware Company\u2019s contention is that it has been acting in good\u2019faith and that it is entitled, both according to the statute and court decisions thereunder, to have the proceedings for liquidation and dissolution carried on through consideration of its voluntary proceedings under \u00a7 11(e). It says that the procedure under \u00a7 11 (b) (2) is much more risky to it than the vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>untary proceedings under \u00a7 11 (e). It points out that the time in which to comply is limited to one year unless the Commission for cause shown extends the time another year.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It likewise points out that upon the failure to suggest a plan which the Commission will approve, it may lose control of its corporate enterprise. We think the Commission has stated the petitioner\u2019s position correctly when it says that the latter argues that \u00a7\u00a7 11 (b)- (2) and 11 (e) provide mutually exclusive methods of compliance with the Act and that therefore proceedings under \u00a7 11 (b) (2) must be held back until voluntary efforts under \u00a7 11 (e) have been exhausted without having produced a successful plan. We add to that that we think the petitioner\u2019s position would require the Commission to hold back its \u00a7 11 (b) (2) proceedings indefinitely so long as a company submitting a plan cannot be found to have been acting in bad faith under \u00a7 11 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Petitioner does not say that he has been, up to this time, hurt by the Commission\u2019s orders. The Commission has not refused to consider the second amended plan; indeed, the Court was advised that at the time the briefs were filed, the plan was soon to have a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not know whether this hearing has' been held or not. The petitioner\u2019s point, therefore, comes to the proposition that he is entitled, under the law, to have his \u00a7 11 (e) plans considered without reference to \u00a7 11 (b) (2) proceedings until the efforts result in an approved plan or demonstrated failure of effort to provide one. If the law provides such rigid order of procedure, of course, petitioner is entitled to such benefit as he may derive from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">We do not think that petitioner\u2019s legal point is well taken. Section 11(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the statute imposes upon the Commission a duty stated in broad terms to examine holding company structures with a view to simplification, distribution of voting power, and the establishment of an integrated public utility system. In accomplishing that result it has been pointed out by this Court that the companies, themselves, have a broad area of discretion in determining how to bring their systems within the required standards. It was pointed out that orders entered under \u00a7 11 (b) are \u201cfundamentally directions that the companies involved achieve a stated result * * * \u201d and that \u201cCongress intended that the Commission might leave open for later consideration the detailed means by which the result directed should be accomplished.\u201d Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 3 Cir., 1943, 134 F.2d 747, 751. That is just what the Commission did here when it ordered the Delaware Company to \u201cproceed with due diligence to submit to this Commission a plan or plans for prompt liquidation and dissolution of Northern States Power Company (Delaware) * * That simply constituted an opportunity for the Company to submit a plan or plans and there is no compulsion, at this stage of the proceedings, for the Delaware Company to accept any plan devised by the Commission or anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Both sides have cited to us the Supreme Court decision in American Power &amp; Light Co. v. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, 1946, 329 U.S. 90, 67 S.Ct. 133. This decision was also considered by the Commission when it made the orders appealed from. We do not find in the Court\u2019s opinion aid and comfort for the position taken by the petitioner. The Supreme Court pointed out that the filing of plans under \u00a7 11 (e) did not oust the Commission of jurisdiction to enter its orders under \u00a7 11 (b) (2). It said, further, \u201cIt does not necessarily give such plans the effect of staying proceedings under \u00a7 11 (b) (2) where such proceedings are initiated prior to the filing of the plans.\u201d 329 U.S. page 119, 67 S-Ct. page 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The quoted language has been the subject of controversy in the argument before us. It is appropriate to point out that the immediate subject of the litigation in the American Power case was a dissolution order under \u00a7 11 (b) (2). That necessarily was the focal point of arguments of counsel and consideration by the Court. The Court further stated, \u201cWe assume that the Commission will give due consideration to any plans that are filed under \u00a7 11 (e) before it enters a \u00a7 11 (b) (2) order.\u201d That assumption is also applicable here. We assume that, of course, the Commission will consider the merits of the new \u00a7 11 (e) plan before it substitutes its own idea for that of the Company.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We think, furthermore, it is an intelligent proposition to mold the procedure in such way that plans submitted by persons who are entitled to be heard can be considered on their merits. This the orders complained of make possible. Plans of others than the Company involved in dissolution may be considered, under the Commission\u2019s practice, under \u00a7 11 (b) (2) proceedings. Until that order issues only Company plans are considered, although counter suggestions of others interested may be heard when they are relevant to the consideration of a \u00a7 11 (e) plan. If the matter is one of discretion, therefore, the procedure adopted by the Commission commends itself to the judgment of good sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"> We think the only way that petitioner\u2019s point can prevail is to hold that the statute precludes \u00a7 11 (b) (2) proceedings so long as anything under \u00a7 11 (e) is pending. We find no warrant in the language of the statute nor the decisions applying it which lead us to that conclusion. The exclusiveness of proceedings under \u00a7 11 (e) existed only until January 1, 1938; there is no other provision in \u00a7 11 (b) (2) which prevents the use of that section after the date previously mentioned. We should be reluctant to reach .any other conclusion for it would establish an unfortunate restriction on the procedure of a body whose procedure should remain elastic so far as it does not violate due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">An order will be entered affirming the orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\"> \u201cAny person * * * aggrieved by an order issued by tbe Commission under tbis title may obtain a review of such order in the circuit court of appeals of the United States within any circuit wherein such person resides * * * by filing in such court, within sixty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part. * * * Such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part * * 49 Stat. 834, Act Aug. 26, 1935, 15 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 79x(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-30\">Section 11(b) (2), the section under which the order complained of was issued, provides: \u201cAny order made under this subsection shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 24.\u201d 49 Stat. 821, Act Aug. 26, 1935, 15 U.
