Eight months after the date of her will and twenty-four days before her death, she signed the following writing; \u201c To Hunter F. Bright, Ashland, Pa. I have bequeathed to my son, Hunter F. Bright, the house I now live in for the sum of one thousand dollars, as expressed in my will written by Judge Marr.\u201d Eighteen months after the will was proved, the register admitted this writing to probate as a codicil. This appeal is from the order of tbe orphans\u2019 court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>reversing his decision. All technical objections to the proceedings were withdrawn, and it was agreed that the matter should be decided by the orphans\u2019 court on its merits. The court had before it only the will and the unattached writing, and held (1) that there was nothing to identify the will proved as the will referred 'to in the writing; (2) that there was nothing to identify the \u201c dwelling house, lot and appurtenances \u201d named in the will as the dwelling house, named in the writing; (3) that the declaration in the writing was as to a past act and not of a present intention to make a disposition of the property to take effect after death. We concur in the conclusion reversing the decision of the register, and the order of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
