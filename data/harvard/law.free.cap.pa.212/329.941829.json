A short distance from the end of the platform there was a switch and siding to enable the cars to pass at that point. As the inward bound car approached the switch, another car coming in the opposite direction from the city entered the switch and passed over the turnout towards the platform. Instead of stopping on the turnout the latter car ran on towards the second switch which it reached just as the inbound ear was crossing. The outbound ear struck the inbound one about the middle of the side. The deceased was caught between the cars and killed. There was testimony that the deceased was standing on the running board of the inbound car, but two witnesses testified that he was standing on the track next to the car. <em>Held, </em>that the court could not say as a matter of law that the deceased was guilty erf contributory negligence even if standing on the track, inasmuch as there was no reason why he should have apprehended that the outbound car would continue to run out from the siding and over the switch, and would strike with its front end the side of the inbound car.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-9\">Where , a street railway company anticipating a great crowd on a particular evening at a park owned by it provides in addition to its trolley cars a steam railroad train for visitors to the park, a visitor cannot be charged with contributory negligence in taking passage on a crowded trolley car rather than on the train.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-10\">\n<em>Negligence\u2014Damages\u2014Husband and wife\u2014-Death of husband\u2014Divorce.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-11\">In an action by a wife to recover damages for the death of her husband caused by the negligence of another, the fact that plaintiff had consulted counsel as to her right to obtain a divorce, does not affect her right of action, and proof as to such matter is irrelevant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-12\">In such a case there is no error in permitting the defendant to show on cross-examination that the father of the deceased contributed to the support of the plaintiff, particularly where the direct examination showed that the earning capacity of the deceased was very small.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-13\">\n<em>Negligence\u2014Street railways\u2014Collision\u2014Evidence.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b359-14\">In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband killed in a collision, evidence as to the effect of the collision upon other passengers is immaterial and irrelevant to show the extent and character of the injuries to the deceased.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Argued March 6, 1905.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB3\">Appeal, No. 157, Jan.

The present action has been brought to recover damages for the loss thus sustained on the theory that it was occasioned by the negligence of the defendant. [I do not think there is any evidence that would justify you in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the injury complained of was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence. But even if the fact were otherwise it is clear that the negligence of the deceased contributed to the injury.] [1] The only eyewitnesses of the accident were two women, friends of the deceased, who stood near him at the time, both of whom testify that when he was struck he was standing on the track over which the offending car was moving. There is no evidence that he was forced into this position or that it was not his own voluntary selection. True, these women were defendant\u2019s witnesses. It is also true that one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that a very short time, if not immediately before the accident, the deceased was standing on the running board of a crowded car pointed in a different direction from the offending ear, but this witness did not see the accident, and frankly admitted that he did not know where the deceased was standing when it occurred. [This leaves wholly uncontradicted the testimony of the two women, which, if believed, and no reason has been assigned why it should not be-believed, clearly establishes contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">[But this is by no means the only evidence bearing upon the question of contributory negligence. The accident happened at a station erected by the defendant company near a\" pleasure resort known as Bushkill Park. On the opposite side of the park, and also near to it, the D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. had a branch road leading, as did the defendant\u2019s road, to Easton, the home of the deceased. The defendant, anticipating a great crowd beyond the capacity of its ears, hired a train of cars from the D., L. &amp; W. Co., to ply between the park and Easton on the day in question, and also constructed a well defined path, lighted at night by electricity,.leading through the park to the D., L. &amp; W. trains. The fare on both roads was the same. The defendant also employed L. P. Meyers, familiarly known for his stentorian voice, to announce,, from time to time the existence and movements of these trains, and this was done at the defendant\u2019s station and in the park during the evening. Moreover, Mr. Hay, the president of the defendant company, met the deceased, whom he had known from childhood, a very short time before the accident, and advised him to take the train for safety, and walked with him\u2019 a short distance in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>direction, the deceased being somewhat under the influence of liquor. None of these facts are disputed, and it is not pretended that either the train or the path to it was unsafe, or that the train was unduly inaccessible. A clearer case of contributory negligence than is thus presented it would be difficult to conceive of: Smith v. City o\u00a3 New Castle, 178 Pa. 298; Musselman v. Hatfield Boro., 202 Pa. 489, and many other cases.

Justice Potteb,</author>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">This action was brought to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, caused, as is alleged, by the negligence of the defendant company. After nine o\u2019clock in the evening of September 1, 1902, a trolley car crowded with passengers started from the platform at Bushkill park on the return trip to Easton. A short distance from the end of the platform there was a switch and siding to enable the cars to pass at that point. As the inward bound car approached the switch, another car coming in the opposite direction from Easton entered the switch and passed over the turnout towards the platform. Instead of stopping on the turnout, the latter car ran on towards the second switch which it reached just as the inbound car was crossing it, and the result was a collision, by which several persons were injured. The outbound car struck the inbound one about the middle of the side, and the husband of tke plaintiff was caught between the two cars and crushed so badly that he died in a few hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The motorman of the colliding car testified that as he approached the switch so many persons jumped on the car and platform and crowded around him, that he could not move and could not control the car. If it had not been for the crowd he could have averted the accident. It was so dense that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>not move his arms so as to put on the brake. This, he said, was the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">On behalf of the plaintiff, Harry Petty testified that at the time of the accident he was on the returning car, which was crowded, the seats being all filled and also the running boards at the sides. He says he \u201c saw the deceased who was standing on the running board just before he was hit.\u201d That he \u201chad bis arihs around the standard.\u201d And that \u201c the blow kind of turned him around.\u201d On cross-examination, the witness said that while he saw the deceased on the running board just before he was hit, he could not tell whether he was on the running board or on the ground when he was hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Floyd Stem testified that he saw the car hit a person who was standing on the running board, but it turned his face so that he could not recognize him, and he was unable to say whether he was plaintiff\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">This was all the evidence offered by the plaintiff to show where her husband was standing when struck and injured. But it was sufficient, we think, to justify its submission to the jury. If the decedent was unable to find room upon the car, elsewhere than upon the running board, and if the defendant company accepted him as a passenger in that position, and was undertaking to carry him, he was entitled to protection. If he was thus struck and injured by the other car, the burden of showing that the accident was not caused by the negligence of the motorman of the colliding car, was certainly upon the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In Madara v. Electric Ry. Co., 192 Pa. 542, Justice Dean said (p. 547) : \u201c If the accident had been apparently caused by the act of a stranger while the plaintiff was a passenger, as in Railway Co. v. Gibson, 96 Pa. 83 (a collision with a hay wagon), the burden would have been on her to show negligence on the part of the defendant. But when it arose from a collision between defendant\u2019s cars, operated on its own rails, the presumption of negligence arises and the burden is on the defendant to rebut it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In Thane v. Traction Co., 191 Pa. 249, the present Chief Justice said (p. 253) : \u201c Cases where the car is crowded and no seat is available rest upon a different basis. There the traveler, if he is to get on at all, must stand on the platform, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>with its rods, etc., to hold by, or inside with a strap -for that purpose. He is presented with a choice of evils, \u00e1nd his action must be judged by the jury, while on. the other hand the carrier by receiving him, undertakes and gives him assurance that it will take care of him and guard him against accident as far as the circumstances will permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In Bumbear v. Traction Co., 198 Pa. 198, where the plaintiff was injured while riding on the side step of a crowded open summer car, Justice Fell said (p. 200): \u201c When the passenger by invitation of the conductor or with his knowledge and assent, and from necessity because of the want of sitting or standing room within the car, rides on the side step, he is entitled to the same degree of diligence to protect him from dangers which are known and may readily be guarded against, as are other passengers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Hence, if, in the present case, the deceased was upon the car when the collision occurred, 'the presumption of negligence arose and the case was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">On the part of the defendant two witnesses were called, Catharine Nuttall and Sarah Thatcher, both of whom testified that the deceased was standing on the track alongside the car when he was struck, and was not upon the running board.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The trial judge instructed the jurjr that the uncontradicted testimony of the two women, if believed, clearly established contributory negligence. In this statement we think there was error. Even if the decedent was standing upon the ground at the side of the car, this is not a place which the court could say as a matter of law was intrinsically dangerous. There was no reason as we see it, why the decedent should have apprehended that the outbound car would continue to run out from the siding and over the switch, and would strike with its front end, the side of the inbound ear. In any event it was not for the court to say as a matter of law that the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence in assuming the position in which he was when struck by the ear. Whether or not his conduct in this respect was negligent under the circumstances was for the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Nor should the court-have said that the failure of the deceased to patronize the steam railroad on the night of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>accident,\u2019 rather than the trolley, was contributory negligence. Both methods of conveyance were open to the public and the deceased liad a perfect right to exercise his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">It would be strange indeed if the defendant company could \u2022charge any of its patrons with contributory negligence in using the facilities which it was offering to the public. We sustain the first, second, third and fourth specifications. We consider the testimony irrelevant, which was admitted with reference to providing transportation on the steam railroad, and against the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, as set forth in the fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth specifications of error, and these assignments are therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The fact that plaintiff had consulted counsel as to her right to obtain a divorce, did not affect her right of action in this case, and proof as to that matter was also irrelevant. The eleventh assignment is sustained. We see no error in permitting defendant to show on cross-examination that the father of deceased contributed to the support of the plaintiff. The direct examination had 'shown' that the earning capacity of deceased was very small. Nor do we see that the effect of the collision upon other passengers was material or relevant in showing the extent and character of the injuries.to the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The twelfth and thirteenth specifications are, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The judgment is reversed with a venire facias de novo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
