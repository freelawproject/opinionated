It is entirely within the bounds of legitimate journalism for newspapers to publish as current news all such matters as involve open violation of law or public misconduct of such-character as justifies police interference, even though the doing so may reflect upon the actors and thus tend to bring them into public disgrace or contempt, and if the jury finds that the publications complained of in this suit were published as current news of such matters as involve open violation of law or public misconduct of such character as justifies police interference, the verdict must be for the defendant, even though such publications may reflect upon the plaintiff. <em>Answer : </em>Affirmed if the jury believe the publications were true or that the defendant had probable cause to believe them to be true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

It was submitted with the instruction that the publication charging a public officer with the commission of crimes was libelous, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover unless it appeared from the evidence that it was substantially true in every material respect or that the defendant had reasonable grounds for belief in its truth, supported by facts and circumstances. The stress of the appellant\u2019s argument is that, since justification had been pleaded, the defendant was not entitled to show that it made the publication in good faith, on reasonable cause and without malice. The pleas were \u201cnot guilty \u201d and \u201c justification.\u201d These pleas although apparently repugnant, may under modem practice be pleaded together: Peters v. Ulmer, 74 Pa. 402; Drown v. Allen, 91 Pa. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
