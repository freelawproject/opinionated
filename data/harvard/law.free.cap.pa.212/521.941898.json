C. Clialfant died on April 21, 1902. At the trial there was a verdict for plaintiff subject to the question of law reserved, whether the article of agreement between Linn and Chalfant was executory or executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-6\">The court subsequently entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-8\"><em>W. J. </em>Sturgis, with him <em>George D. Howell, </em>for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ2H\">The rule requiring the word \u201c heirs \u201d to convey land in fee, is purely technical, and the reasons which supported the rule no longer exist: Defraunce v. Brooks, 8 W. &amp; S. 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-9\">The fact that the contract contemplated that Chalfant would mine out and totally destroy the corpus of the thing contracted about, is of itself a circumstance, sufficient to settle the construction to be given this informal instrument: Kenrick v. Smick, 7 W. &amp; S. 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b552-10\">The parties intended their contract to be what they called it, an \u201carticle of agreement,\u201d and not an executed deed: Sheaffer v.

Though called by the parties a sale the vendee is \u201c not to sell any coal only what he hauls himself or have hauled,\u201d and he is also restricted from selling the \u201c said three acres of coal to any person or persons but Jas. M. Linn (the vendor) his heirs or assigns.\u201d The words of the grant are in present\u00ed, the description of the land complete, and the -receipt is of the consideration money in full. There is no indication of any further instrument being in contemplation, and the restrictions in this one are incompatible with a conveyance in fee, but \"entirely in harmony with a personal license.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">But even if considered as a conveyance there are no words of inheritance and on the death of the grantee nothing passed to his heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
