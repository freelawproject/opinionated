The facts alleged in support of the averment of abandonment do not strengthen it. But there is a distinct averment of an actual abandonment of any intention to use the land for any public purpose. This we think was a sufficiently well pleaded abandonment to put the city to a defense. The order sustaining the demurrer and entering judgment for the defendant is reversed with leave to the defendant to answer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
