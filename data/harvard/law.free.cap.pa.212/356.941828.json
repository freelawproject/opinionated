Mr. Kratzer, did this dog attack you or attempt to attack you at any time ? A. No, sir, he did not; not outside of the fence. He many a time jumped up at the fence that I passed, and barked loud, but not outside; that is, he never took hold of me. Q. Was Mr. Kettering there at the time? A. Been in the yard different times ; yes, sir. Q. When the dog growled at you and jumped at you ? A. Yes, sir. That is, understand, not at me; he was inside of the fence, and I was out.\"\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">Cross-examination by Mr. Capp : \u201c Q. Tell us in your own way what the dog did when you went by the place. A. Oh, well, he jumped up at the fence, you know, and reached outside of the fence and barked, you know, as though he was in the act of getting hold of me; but he never did, understand; I was outside and he was in. Q. He was a young dog, wasn\u2019t he ? A. I don\u2019t know how old he was. He was grown out, I think, because he was a dog very near as high as these boxes here. I judged him to be grown' out, and probably two or three or four years old. Q. He did not jump up against the fence in such a way as to make an effort to break through ? A. I would rather say it was. I think if the fence had been frail, and it would not have stood the jumping against, I think he would have come out and got at me; I think he would. Q. How often did this occur ? A. I don\u2019t know. It occurred repeatedly. I passed there often. I would not say how often it occurred. Q. Where was Mr. Kettering ? A. Sometimes he was in the yard; he ain\u2019t always there. Q. Relate to us an occurrence that Mr. Kettering was in the yard. Relate to us one occurrence that Mr. Kettering was there. A. I could not just tell you the time, you know, but I know that he had often been in his yard ; probably sitting on the back porch or standing in the yard that the dog jumped up against the fence when I passed ; I could not exactly tell wh\u00e9n. Q. Relate to us one occurrence that Mr. Kettering was there, and tell us what the dog did at that time. A. I know at one time that he was sitting on the back porch, the dog was laying in the yard close by the fence, probably three feet near the fence, and the dog jumped up at the fence ; of course, I walked on ; he did not hurt me. Q. How high was this fence ? A. Oh, well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>probably four feet high. Q. What kind of a fence was it? A. An iron fence. Q. What is the size of the dog ? A. Well, the dog may measure\u2014 Q. An ordinary shepherd dog, isn\u2019t it? A. Well, I think he was a little larger than the ordinary shepherd dog; he may measure probably two feet and a half ; I don\u2019t know; I never measured him ; but he is larger than the ordinary shepherd dog. Q. That is the only occurrence that' you say Mr. Kettering was on the porch? A. Yes. Q. When was that, Mr. Kratzer ? A. I didn\u2019t keep a date. Q. Which one of these occurrences were prior to the time that Deitrich was bitten, if any? A. I could not tell you that. Q. Then you could not tell whether this occurred before or after the accident to Deitrich ? A. I could not; no, sir.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">Redirect examination by Mr. Ulrich : \u201c Q. Don\u2019t jtou know whether this occurred before or after Mr. Deitrich\u2019s accident ? A. No, sir ; I don\u2019t know. I am not positive whether it was before or afterwards. Q. This accident occurred this last July a year ago, that was 1901 ? A. Yes ; I remember the time the accident occurred, but I would not say; I didn\u2019t keep a note, you know, whether this was before or afterwards.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Mr. Capp : I move to strike out this' testimony as not conforming to the offer, in this that the witness cannot state whether these occurrences were before or after Deitrich complains of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">The Court: We will permit this testimony to stand for the present.

The only assignment of error is to the order of the court striking out testimony which was admitted under a specific offer to prove that the dog attacked the witness before the plaintiff was bitten, and that of this the defendant had notice. The witness was unable to fix the time of the occurrence, and the testimony did not come up to the offer under which it was admitted. To the argument now made that the testimony was admissible to show the general behavior of the dog, it is a sufficient answer that it was not offered for that purpose. \u201c A party cannot offer evidence for a specific purpose and complain when it is rejected that it was legitimate for another and distinct purpose : \u201d Young v. Edwards, 72 Pa. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
