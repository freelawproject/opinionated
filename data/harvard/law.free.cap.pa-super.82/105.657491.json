Levine was a tenant in possession under a lease for years. The question presented is, can a tenant in possession be convicted of setting fire to the leased premises? The Act of June 10,1881, P. L. 117, provides: \u201cSection 1, Be it enacted, etc., that no principle or policy of law shall, because the defendant shall have been in possession as tenant or otherwise at the time of the commission of the offense, exempt any person from conviction and punishment, who shall wilfully and maliciously burn or cause to be burned, or cause or attempt to set fire to, any building, but such person shall be liable to conviction and punishment, in the same manner and to the same extent as if not in possession.\u201d If this act be valid, there is an end to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The defendant contends that the act is unconstitutional. The first reason assigned is that it amends section 137 of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 415, and contravenes article III, section 6, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which reads: \u201cNo law shall be revived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>amended or the provisions thereof extended or conferred by reference to its title only, but so much thereof as is revived, amended or extended or conferred shall be reenacted and published at length.\u201d The 137th section of the above act punishes inter alia the burning of the dwelling house of another and as stated, before, that is the charge in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">It will be observed that the act we are considering contains no reference to the Act of 1860, either by allusion to its title or by quoting the portion of the former act to be amended or reenacted. The Act of 1881, supra, in effect states that possession as tenant of the property shall not relieve from liability the person who has maliciously burned it. At common law, a tenant in possession could not be convicted of arson for burning the leased premises: 4 Bl. Com. 211; 1 Hale P. C. 568; 1 Hawk P. C. 106. It was to change this rule that this act was passed. We do not regard the act as changing the provisions of section 137 above referred to. The Act of 1881 has relation to the status of a tenant in regard to the crime of the malicious burning of buildings. The new statute was not enacted to change the Act of 1860, that remains exactly as heretofore, but its purpose was to get rid of the decisions of the courts, which held the tenant immune, because he was regarded as the owner, although some one else had the fee. As stated above, the tenant in possession was not exempt from criminal liability by reason of anything in the Act of 1860, but was made so by the common law. The Act of 1881 is complete in itself and needs no reference to any other act, nor does it change the provisions of any act.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">If, however, we take the view that the Act of 1881 does change the Act of 1860 in that it makes it apply to a class of persons which theretofore were not covered by it, we repeat what was stated by the learned trial judge, that such operation of an act complete in itself does not render it invalid. The constitutional provision has reference to express amendments only. The Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>does not make the obviously impracticable requirement that every act shall recite all other acts that its operation may incidentally affect, either by way of repeal, modification, extension, or supply: Searight\u2019s Est., Stuart\u2019s App., 163 Pa. 210; Greenfield Avenue, 191 Pa. 290. To use an illustration: under the common law dogs were not the subjects of larceny and the act making them personal'property and the subjects of larceny was attacked on constitutional grounds, but it never occurred to any one to raise the question that such act should recite the portion of the criminal code defining the offense of larceny, although it did in effect extend its provisions to persons who before were not embraced in its provisions, namely dog thieves: Com. v. Depuy, 148 Pa. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">The second objection to the statute is that the act is an exercise of judicial power, which power, under article V, section 1, is solely vested in the courts. The answer to that is that the courts have repeatedly sanctioned changes of the rules of law by legislation and laws doing away with long established principles are frequently passed. It was held in Dilworth v. Schuylkill Improvement Land Company of Philadelphia, 219 Pa. 527, that the legislature did not exercise judicial functions when it declared the effect of the words \u201cdie without issue,\u201d etc. As was stated in the opinion of the lower court in that case, which opinion was adopted by the Supreme Court, the legislation was not an attempt to exercise judicial function, \u201cbut was an attempt to change a rule of common law which the legislation has the power to do.\u201d We think this is exactly what was done in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Although the above is decisive of the case, we are constrained to say briefly that even if there were no legislation on this subject, we would not be inclined to recognize the rule of the common law. In Holmes Case, 3 Croke 376, it was held that as the burning of the house of another was a felony under the old authorities, a tenant in possession being an owner could not be convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of burning tbe leased bouse. Tbe judges who decided tbe case were not unanimous. It seems to have been a case of avoiding tbe imposition of capital punishment on tbe defendant for a felony and although be escaped tbe gallows, be was fined, imprisoned, and placed in pillory for tbe trespass. In tbe Harris Case, Foster 113, 349, tbe Holmes case was commented on in this wise: \u201ctbe judgment in Holmes case, to say no more of it, was a very merciful judgment. Tbe bouse might with strict legal propriety have been considered as tbe bouse of tbe landlord. Both landlord and tenant have a property, one temporary and limited, tbe other absolute and perpetual; like tbe person to whom goods are delivered and tbe absolute owner thereof, in tbe case of larceny.\u201d It were better, in view of tbe gradual departure from tbe fine distinctions which many years ago tbe judges drew in order to avoid depriving defendants of their lives, to accept tbe general and ordinary idea of ownership and hold that tbe tenant when be burns tbe leased bouse, does not destroy bis own property, but that of another and is guilty of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">Tbe judgment of tbe lower court is affirmed and tbe record remitted to tbe court below and it is ordered that tbe defendant appear in tbe court below at such time as be may be there called and that be be by that court committed, until he has complied with tbe sentence or any part of it which bad not been performed when tbe appeal in this case was made a supersedeas.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
