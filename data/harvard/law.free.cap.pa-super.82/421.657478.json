He appealed to the common pleas, where the judgment was reversed on the ground that the ordinance was illegal. The borough then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The ordinance was approved May 1, 1922, and provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cSection 1. That no person shall solicit tourists, travelers or other persons to patronize or to do business with any hotel, boarding house, lodging house, garage, or other place for the entertainment of tourists and travelers, upon any of the streets, highways, and other public places within the Borough of Chambersburg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cSection 2. Any person violating the provisions of this ordinance shall forfeit and pay a penalty of not less than one dollar nor more than ten dollars for each of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>fense, the same to Tbe collected as fines and penalties are now by law collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">Tbe defendant offered no testimony before tbe magistrate. In the common pleas, by agreement, tbe case was beard on tbe facts stated in tbe transcript of tbe magistrate. Tbe record contains no dispute of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Tbe single question here is whether tbe ordinance is legal. Reasonably understood, it provides that persons on tbe streets of tbe borough shall not there be required to attend to parties soliciting patronage for tbe occupations specified; it is a regulation of tbe use of tbe cart-way of tbe street. With tbe present, general use of tbe automobile, it is an obvious interference with travel, and not without attendant danger, to require tbe driver of an automobile, \u2014 perhaps in one of a long line of them,\u2014 to have bis attention diverted by some one stopping him, or attempting to do so, or boarding bis car for tbe purposes prohibited by tbe ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In this State, boroughs may enact such regulatory ordinances under the police power: Sayre Boro. v. Phillips, 148 Pa. 482, 488; North Wales Boro. v. Brownback, 10 Pa. Superior Ct. 227, 229; and, by the General Borough Act, are specifically empowered, inter alia, \u201cto make such other regulations as may be necessary for ......convenience, comfort and safety of tbe borough\u201d: Act of May 14,1915, P. L. 312, 333, chap. 5, art. 1, sec. 2, cl. xvii. The borough therefore, bad the power to enact the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Considering such power, this court, speaking by Judge Orlady, in Wilkes-Barre v. Garabed, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 355, 368, said: \u201cThe only limitation of this power is that it must be exercised in a reasonable, lawful and constitutional manner. If these limitations are not transgressed, courts cannot interfere with the ordinances of the municipality, for to the mayor and council must be left a reasonable discretion, and for the proper and wholesome exercise thereof they are accountable, not to the courts, but to the people whom they represent: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>O\u2019Maley v. Freeport, 96 Pa. 24. When the municipal legislature has authority to act, it must be governed, not by our, but by its own, discretion; and we will not be hasty in convicting them of being unreasonable in the exercise of it: Fisher v. Harrisburg, 2 Grant. 291. Nothing but a clear violation of the Constitution, \u2014 a clear usurpation of power prohibited \u2014 will justify the judicial department in pronouncing an act of the legislative department unconstitutional and void: R. R. Co. v. Riblet, 66 Pa. 164.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">The application of that standard, requires us to differ from the conclusion reached by the learned court below. The trial judge said \u201chow the regulation complained of could affect......the convenience, comfort or safety of the borough we cannot understand.\u201d The convenience, comfort and safety of the traveler on the highway undoubtedly are affected, if, as he travels along, as already suggested, in an automobile, he must suddenly give his attention to some solicitor darting from, or hailing him from, the footway, \u2014 perhaps jumping on his car \u2014 for the purpose of inviting his patronage. As it has been held to be for the convenience and comfort of travelers by rail to protect them from annoyance by the importunities of solicitors for hotels, etc., (Williams v. Arkansas, 217 U. S. 79), it is certainly so for travelers by automobile on public streets as now used, and equally for the safety of all having occasion to use the streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The learned court below also suggested that the classification of vocations in the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonably discriminatory, saying: \u201cIt is arbitrary in this, that it prohibits the owner of a garage whose place of business is not situated on a principal street to bring his business to the attention of the public.\u201d But the prohibition of the ordinance applies to all garage owners, whether on one street or another; none may \u201cbring his business to the attention of the public\u201d in the manner prohibited. We do not understand, by way of illustration, that the ordinance prohibits the advertisement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>lawfully erected signs that a man conducts a hotel, hoarding house, or garage at a specified place.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">The ordinance was intended to be, and must be, reasonably interpreted. Its obvious purpose was to reduce interference with orderly street travel, in a respect deemed desirable by the local legislative authorities who, in the first instance, were entrusted with that responsibility ; there is nothing in the evidence showing that they acted unreasonably; nor has it been shown that the classification by the occupations specified is unreasonable or arbitrary in view of the purpose of the ordinance to regulate travel on the streets: Williams v. State of Arkansas, supra; North Wales Boro. v. Brownback, supra; Phila. v. Brabender, 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 331; 201 Pa. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The order appealed from is reversed and the record is remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Orlady, P. J., and Henderson and Gawthrop, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
