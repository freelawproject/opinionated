This appeal is from a judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s employee was driving the truck southwardly on Eising Sun Avenue, Philadelphia. The traveled roadbed was about wide enough for three trucks to pass each other at the same time. On each side of the traveled way was a trolley track. The rails were T rails about four and a half inches high and set upon ties like railroad tracks with no ballast between the rails. The top of the inside rails was flush with the surface of the highway. The truck driver turned off of the traveled roadbed on his left, putting his left front and rear wheels between the rails of the trolley track in order to pass another truck which was standing in .the middle of the road. He continued to travel at a speed of about fifteen miles an hour, bumping over the ties, and then tried to turn back into the roadway. When his front left wheel came into contact with the rail, the truck turned over and the damage sued for followed. The right of plaintiff to recover depends upon the construction of the rider which was attached to the policy of insurance. It read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u201cIn consideration of $2,329 premium and subject to all its other terms, conditions, limitations and agreements, the policy to which this endorsement is attached is hereby extended to cover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">\u201cAgainst loss and or damage to the automobile described herein, including its operating equipment if caused solely by accidental collision with another object, either moving or stationery, excluding, however, all loss and or damage by fire arising from any cause whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The question is whether the damage was the result of accidental collision with another object. Conceding that it is the rule to construe the language of an insurance contract liberally in favor of the insured so as not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to defeat, without clear necessity, his claim to indemnity which it was his object to secure, still the language must be construed in its plain, ordinary, popular sense. What is the plain, ordinary meaning and popular sense in which the words \u201caccidental collision with another object\u201d were used? It would be a work of supererogation to discuss the question if the words \u201ccollision with another object\u201d were not modified by the word \u201caccidental.\u201d This court held in Wetherill v. Williamsburgh Insurance Co., 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 37, that the words \u201ccollision with another object\u201d covered the case of one who backed an automobile into the open area of an elevator shaft and the car was damaged by falling to the ground floor below. But in that case the hazard insured against was \u201ccollision\u201d and not \u201caccidental collision.\u201d In our opinion that fact distinguishes that case from the case at bar. The definitions of an accident as given in the Century Dictionary are, among others, as follows: (1) \u201cIn general anything that happens or begins to be without design, or as an unforeseen event.\u201d (2) \u201cSpecifically, an undesirable and unfortunate happening; an undesigned harm or injury; a casualty or mishap.\u201d In Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, accident is defined as \u201can event which, under the circumstances, is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens. The happening of an event without the concurrence of the will of the person by whose agency it was caused; or the happening of an event without any human agency.\u201d These definitions were quoted with approval by our Supreme Court in Hey v. Guarantors\u2019 Liability, etc., Co., 181 Pa. 220. In the Standard Dictionary, the word \u201caccidental\u201d is defined as something \u201chappening or coming by chance or without design.\u201d Some authorities hold that the word \u201caccidental\u201d means the happening of an event without fault or negligence on the part of anyone. This is a narrow and restricted meaning. In its ordinary, popular sense, it expresses the thought of an event occurring without design or purpose, or unintentionally on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>assured. Given the latter meaning, it does not negative the idea of negligence on the part of one whose physical act the occurrence follows. But it does not include the result of wilful design. If accident and negligence be not opposites, accident and design are: McCarty v. The New York and Erie Railroad Company, 30 Pa. 247; 1 Corpus Juris 392. Can it be said that the collision of plaintiff\u2019s truck with the track was accidental? The driver found that he was off the roadway and could not turn back upon it without striking the rail. He decided that he would try to drive over the rail and, in so doing, the truck upset. The collision with the rail was not accidental but by design. Plaintiff\u2019s truck was not in-' sured against accident, but against accidental collision with other objects. If the driver, in trying to pass another car, had struck the car, or a telegraph pole or curb on the side of the road, the collision might be the result of negligence merely and could be comprehended by the word\u00ae \u201caccidental collision,\u201d because it was not by design. But, if the driver had deliberately, driven the truck into the rear of another car because it was in his way, it would hardly be contended that the collision was accidental, although the result was what is popularly known as an accident. That would be a clear case of collision resulting from intention and design rather than accident. If the driver had found a telegraph pole lying across the road and, in trying to drive around it, struck it, the collision might be accidental. But if he intentionally undertook to drive the truck over the pole, the collision with the pole would not be accidental but intentional. The case at bar is not different from the last example. While the question what is and what is not an accidental collision is often for the jury, it is a matter of law for the court when the facts are admitted or free from doubt. We feel that fairly interpreted the policy in suit does not cover the collision which caused the damages sought to be recovered. It follows that plaintiff is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>entitled to recover. It is unnecessary to pass on the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">The first assignment of error is sustained, the judgment is reversed and the record remitted to the court below with instruction to enter judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
