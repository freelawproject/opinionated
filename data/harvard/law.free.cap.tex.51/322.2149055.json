That the bond was made without the authority of law to bind the defendant or to make him liable as surety for E. L. Stone as cashier in the office of collector of customs, no such office being created or recognized by the laws of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">2. That the duties of such pretended officer, to wit, cashier in the office of the collector of customs, are not set forth in said bond or in said petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\">3. That the condition of said bond is uncertain, indefinite, and undefined in all and every feature of said condition relied on by plaintiff for recovery in said action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-11\">The exceptions were overruled, which was assigned as error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-12\">The defendant also filed a general denial, and pleaded specially, that Shields obtained and extorted the bond from Stone and Dignan by his representation that the bond was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>made in pursuance of the requirements of law, and that he would remove him from the position he then held as deputy collector of customs if he did not assume the duties required of him and designated in the bond, and that the duties so required were more onerous and responsible than his duties as deputy collector and disbursing agent required of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">4. That Shields, as collector of customs and disbursing agent of the government, was charged by the laws of Congress and the regulations of the Treasury Department solely and personally with the custody of the public moneys collected in his district, together with such other depositaries as might be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and that Shields had no authority to make or appoint a deputy to perform the duties required of him personally; that Stone was not appointed by law, and his appointment by Shields was wrong, and therefore he could not recover against appellant. There were other matters pleaded, not necessary to notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">Without detailing the evidence, it may be remarked that the defalcation seems to have been clearly established, without regard to the' apparent admissions of Stone, which were admitted over objection. Jury waived and judgment for plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-6\"><em>Waul Walker, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADj\">At the date of the bond Stone held the position of deputy collector, from which he could only be removed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the manner of which removal is pointed out in Customs Regulations, arts. 1040-1043.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">Afterwards, in pursuance of law and under the requirements of the Secretary of the Treasury, he received the additional appointments of special deputy collector and special deputy disbursing agent. .While holding these positions, and without any pretended additional compensation whatever, and without any consideration, he was required, by the arbitrary will of the collector, to take upon himself all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>duties and responsibilities of the office of collector, whether the collector was present or absent, sick or well. Assuredly, some authority should be shown for such an exercise of power; some law of Congress; some approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; otherwise the collectors might farm out their offices, give no personal care or supervision, simply looking to the strength of a bond presumed to be good enough at common law to protect the- collector in his violation of law. It is, however, contended by plaintiff, as averred in his petition, that he had the right to control, suspend, or remove Stone from his position as collector.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">Our position is, that the collector has not the power to remove a deputy, a clerk, an inspector, or any subordinate. This power is vested, by the Constitution of the United States and the laws' of Congress, in the Secretary alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">The deputy collector is a recognized \u201cofficer of customs\u201d; his tenure of office is not dependent upon the will of his principal, nor does his office terminate with his death. (Rev. Stats., sec. 2625.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\">[Counsel argued at length, citing, in support of their positions, Cust. Reg., arts. 1034, 1165; Rev.

S., art. 2, sec. 2; 4 Opinions of Att\u2019ys-Genl., pp. 162, 164; <em>ex parte </em>Hennen, 13 Peters, 259; United States <em>v. </em>Hartwell, 6 Wall., 385; 2 Benedict, 357; United States <em>v. </em>Gaussen, 2 Woods, 97; United States <em>v. </em>Tingey, 5 Peters, 125; 1 Curtis, 136; Churchill <em>v. </em>Perkins, 5 Mass., 541.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-9\">The case in 1 Curtis, 136, and all other cases to which we have been referred, whether the sureties have been held or not, clearly lay down the principle, that if a public officer has used his official authority to induce a subordinate, or one under his power, to enter into an obligation not required by law, it is not binding. And Sewell, J., in Churchill <em>v. </em>Perkins, 5 Mass., 541, states: \u201cWhen the plaintiff\" demands the fruit of an. obligation <em>colore officii, </em>it must be shown that the demand is justified by some authority of the officer; other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>wise it is against sound policy, and is void by the principles of the common law.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-4\"><em>Price $ Wilson, Willie Cleaveland, </em>and <em>J.

The custody and control of money belonging to the United States may be delegated by the collector to a sub-agent or cashier, the collector being responsible for his acts. (Stats. at Large, arts. 2619, 2630, 3639; Reg. Treas. Dept., arts. 1004, 1065; United States <em>v. </em>Barton, Gilp., 439; Schmaire <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 3 Blatchf., 408; Falleck <em>v. </em>Barney, 5 Blatchf., 38.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\">TTT. Admitting that Shields had no authority to delegate such a trust, Stone and his surety are still liable to Shields for Stone\u2019s defalcation. (Story on Agency, secs. 15, 201, 217a; City of Marshall <em>v. </em>Bailey, 27 Tex., 686.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\">IV. The bond was a voluntary one, given for a sufficient consideration to the interested party, to secure the faithful discharge of a trust, and was good at common law. (City of Marshall <em>v. </em>Bailey, 27 Tex., 686; Johnson <em>v. </em>Erskine, 9 Tex., 1; Bish. on Contracts, sec. 584; Rowlet <em>v. </em>Eubank, 1 Bush, (Ky.,) 477; Pay <em>v. </em>Shanks, 56 Ind., 554.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-10\">V. Shields, upon appointing Stone to an office under him, for the faithful performance of which Shields alone was liable to the government, had a right, for his own protection, to require of such appointee an indemnity bond. And such bond being between parties able and willing to contract, upon a sufficient consideration, for a lawful purpose, and not forbidden by statute, is good at common law. (City of Marshall <em>v. </em>Bailey, 27 Tex., 686; Johnson <em>v. </em>Erskine, 9 Tex., 1; Rev. Stats., sec. 2630; Pay <em>v. </em>Shanks, 56 Ind., 554; Griffiths <em>v. </em>Hardenbergh, 41 N. Y., 469; Burrall <em>v. </em>Acker, 23 Wend., 606; Decker <em>v. </em>Judson, 16 N. Y., 442.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AZn\">The position of cashier in the office of collector of customs is not unknown to the law, as appears by the customs regulations adduced in evidence. (Gust. Reg., arts. 1004,1165.) For aught that appears to the contrary, it was competent for the collector at Galveston to delegate to his deputy the duty of receiving and keeping customs moneys, as cashier in his office, without violating the regulation prohibiting customs officers from performing their duties by substitutes. (Gust. Reg., art. 1152. See also Gust. Reg., art. 566, where the right of the collector to designate a deputy for certain other duties is recognized.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Without such special designation, the deputy collector may, in case of absence, disability, or death of his principal, perform the duty of receiving and keeping customs moneys, as well as any other duty of the collector. (Rev. Stats., sec. 2630; Cust. Reg., arts. 1033, 1060.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">For these acts of his deputy the collector is responsible, and, even when performed after his death, his estate continues responsible. (Rev. Stats., sec. 2625; Gust. Reg., art. 1061.) The law prescribes no bond for the deputy collector, but it does not forbid the collector from protecting himself by such bond. In requiring from his deputy, whether before or after his appointment, indemnity against loss through the defalcation of the latter, the collector but exercised a legitimate precaution. See the Revised Statutes, sec. 3148, for a statutory recognition, in the corresponding case of a deputy collector of internal revenue, of the right of the collector to revoke such appointment, and to require and accept bonds or other security from his deputies. The bond in the present instance appears to have been voluntarily given, and, as a valid common-law bond, was rightly enforced. (City of Marshall <em>v. </em>Bailey, 27 Tex., 686; Griffiths <em>v. </em>Hardenbergh, 41 N. Y., <em>469; </em>United States <em>v. </em>Tingey, 5 Pet., 115; Hawes <em>v. </em>Marchant, 1 Curtis, 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It is immaterial whether the declarations of Stone were correctly admitted or not. The fact of Stone's defalcation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>was sufficiently established by other testimony, and the case was tried by the court without a jury. (Smith <em>v. </em>Hughes, 23 Tex., 248; Melton <em>v. </em>Cobb, 21 Tex., 539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The j udgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Addibmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Opinion March 25, 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Motion for rehearing was taken to the Austin Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">On Motion dob Reheabing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b336-9\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Azs\">The questions in this case turn largely upon the regulations and usages of the Treasury-Department of the United States, and these have but rarely been the subject of investigation in the courts of this State. Feeling our want of familiarity with that complex system of statutes, regulations, and usages, we have had sufficient distrust in the correctness of our conclusions to induce a ready and careful consideration of the elaborate written argument of counsel in support of his application for a rehearing. The result, however, is, that our views have undergone no change.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">One of the positions taken by counsel is, that a deputy collector is an officer of customs whose tenure of office is not dependent on the will of his principal, but who is removable only by the Secretary of tho Treasury. Another is, that the collector of customs can only act by deputy in certain contingencies, and that\u2014except where there are cashiers regularly designated by the Secretary of the Treasury\u2014the collector must be himself, personally, the recipient and custodian of customs moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">If neither of these positions be correct, the argument based upon them must fall to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"Afe\">1st. Whilst deputy collectors are \u201cconstituted and appointed\u201d by the collector with the approval of the Secretary of tho Treasury\u2019, it is our opinion that their tenure of office is <em>defacto </em>at the will of the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Speaking of the deputy collector, Mr. Berrien, in an official opinion as Attorney-General of the United States, said: \u201c The deputy\u2014as his name imports and as it is expressly laid down by law writers\u2014exorcises his office in right of another. He is, as they express it, the shadow of his principal, having no authority distinct from him, nor to act otherwise than in his name, nor to perform any other duties but such as the collector himself may perform.\u201d (2 Opinions of Att\u2019ys-Genl., p. 413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In the very opinion of Mr. Legar\u00e9 cited by counsel, holding that the appointment of inspector and other permanent officers of the United States is the act of the Secretary and not of the collector, he distinguishes between such permanent officers, on the one hand, and \u201c occasional deputies, employ\u00e9s, or agents of the collectors,\u201d on the other. (4 Opinions of Att\u2019ys-Genl., p. 163.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">In another official communication of the same date, upholding the power of removal in the Secretary in case of permanent inspectors, he says, even of these permanent officers, that the collector has uniformly been consulted, and that it is too late for the Secretary to act on the mere <em>summum jus </em>and eject an officer without the consent of a collector, <em>\u201c </em>except in a strong case.\u201d We cannot doubt that, practically, deputy collectors, like other deputies, hold their office at the will of the collector, who is responsible for their acts. They are for many purposes officers of the United States, hut are not believed to be of the class of \u201cinferior officers\u201d contemplated by the Constitution, nor of the class of \u201csubordinate officers\u201d whose removal is controlled by customs regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">It is to be remarked, that the law fixes a limit to the emoluments of the collector, and that the enforcement of that limit requires that both the number and compensation of the deputies and clerks allowed the collector should he fixed. (United States <em>v. </em>Morse, 3 Story, 90, 91; 4 Opinions of Att\u2019ys-Genl., p. 280; 7 Opinions of Att\u2019ys-Genl., p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">2d. Whilst the regulations forbid a collector from residing out of his district, farming out his office and performing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>duties by substitutes, we are unable to see that he is forbidden to act by his deputy in the receipt and custody of customs moneys, or in the performance of other official duties. In the absence of a regularly designated cashier, or other officer specially designated, the collector is personally responsible as the recipient of such moneys, whether they be actually received in person or by deputy; but we cannot believe that the regulation forbids him from assigning that special duty to a deputy. It may be that when so assigned the deputy becomes an officer specially designated for that custom-house, within the meaning of the regulation. If so, the collector is still responsible for the proper performance of this and any other official duty intrusted to a deputy. Such deputy is merely designated for the discharge of the duties of cashier in the collector\u2019s office, and does not hold a separate office as cashier. If the collector, for his own protection, requires of him a bond for the faithful performance of those particular duties instead of his duty generally as deputy, instead of being more onerous, the bond would seem to be less so than the bond which it is admitted might be required of every deputy. In requiring such a bond, the collector cannot be said-to impose on his deputy additional or greater duties than were prescribed by law; nor can it be maintained that the bond is invalid because illegally exacted <em>colore officii.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The bond sued on was not a statutory bond, but was, we' think, a valid bond at common law, protecting the collector in case of the failure of his deputy to account for customs' moneys received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Motion overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Opinion May 9, 1879.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
