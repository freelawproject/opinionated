It is unquestionably a fundamental canon of construction, that such interpretation shall be given to acts of the Legislature as will effectuate the intent and purpose of the law-makers in their enactments,, when the intent of the law is plain and obvious, rather than to follow its literal import or mere grammatical construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Evidently, the cases within the legislative mind, when enacting the second section of the act here in question, were suits brought by or against executors, administrators, or guardians, and not actions revived by or against them, and when, as here, the deposition of the party by whom the action was brought had been taken in his own behalf and introduced in evidence by his representative. In such case, if the executor insists on putting the deposition of his testator in evidence, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>does not violate, but accords with, the reason and spirit of the law, and its proper construction, to .permit the other party to the suit to also give his version of the matters between himself and the deceased referred to in such deposition; and this seems to be the interpretation given elsewhere to similar statutes.
