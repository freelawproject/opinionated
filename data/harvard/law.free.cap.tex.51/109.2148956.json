The court erred in overruling plaintiffs\u2019 exception to the introduction of evidence by defendants to prove that no partnership existed. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1442; Drew <em>v. </em>Harrison, 12 Tex., 279; Persons <em>v. </em>Frost &amp; Co., 25 Tex.

It was apparent from the evidence that the goods had been received by one of these defendants, and had not been paid for. The verdict was contrary to this evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">2d. The court, in the second instruction to the jury, led them to believe that if the proof did not establish a partnership between the defendants, no debt or liability was created on the part of either of them by the purchase and receipt of the goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">3d. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition contained a prayer for general relief, which entitled plaintiffs to a new trial, that they might correct the errors in their pleadings, in misjoinder of parties, and the court should have granted a new trial, when it was apparent that an injustice had been done, or granted such relief as the equities of the case required. (Hipp <em>v. </em>Hutchett, 4 Tex., 24; Hardy <em>v. </em>De Leon, 5 Tex., 211; McDaniel <em>v. </em>Mann, 25 Tex., 102; Trammell <em>v. </em>Watson, 25 Tex.

The statute only requires a denial of partnership under oath, where the defendants deny the partnership of plaintiffs, or where the suit is founded upon a written contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">In this case the defendants denied that they were partners only. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 1442, 1443.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">II. The petition must state the cause of action correctly, and when the evidence differs from the allegations in the petition, the variance is fatal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-12\">The appellants sued II. W. Monroe &amp; Co. The statement of facts shows that no such firm existed at the time of the alleged sale.

(Parker <em>v. </em>Beavers, 19 Tex., 410; Roseborough <em>v. </em>Gorman, 6 Tex., 314.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AF-\">Appellants, in their petition, alleged that H. W. Monroe and John Monroe composed the firm of H. W. Monroe &amp; Co.; alleged a sale of goods to the firm, and, after praying for citation to defendants, prayed for judgment for their debt and for equity and general relief. The defendants filed separate answers, not verified by affidavit, denying the existence of the firm and denying the alleged indebtedness. Evidence was admitted, over the objection of appellants, establishing that there was no such firm as H. W. Monroe &amp; Co., but that H. W. Monroe carried on business in his own .name. It appeared, also, that the goods were received by him, and that he admitted the debt. The charge of the court instructed the jury, that unless there was such a firm as H. W. Monroe &amp; Co., composed of H. W. Monroe and John Monroe, to find for defendants; and accordingly there were verdict and judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Appellants\u2019 first proposition is, that \u201c the court erred in admitting the testimony to prove no partnership, because the answer of defendants was not verified by affidavit of one or both of defendants.\u201d The response to this proposition is, that the petition was not founded on any written instrument charged to have been executed by the firm, and that the partnership of defendants \u201cwas put in issue by the pleadings, without being sworn to.\u201d (Cushing <em>v. </em>Smith, 43 Tex., 261; Fowler <em>v. </em>Davenport, 21 Tex., 634.) But the charge of the court prohibited the jury from finding against either of the defendants, unless their liability as a firm had been established. This charge, however correct, if tested by \u201cthe rigid system of the common law as to forms of action,\u201d asserts a rule of pleading and practice which this court has declared to be \u201c contrary to the whole current of our practice and decisions.\u201d (Willis <em>v. </em>Morrison, 44 Tex., 33.) The question came up directly in that case, and was decided contrary to the position taken in the charge under consideration. On the authority of Willis <em>v. </em>Morrison, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
