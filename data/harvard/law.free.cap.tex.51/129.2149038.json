Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-13\">The evidence showed that on September 24,1873, Thomas McGreal placed four Hew York drafts, amounting to $5,350, with Rinker &amp; Jockusch, bankers, at Galveston, for collection, they at the time giving a receipt describing the drafts, and stating that when collected they should be subject to the call of McGreal at par. Rinker &amp; Jockusch sent the drafts on for collection to Baltzer &amp; Taaks, at Hew York, with instructions to collect and place proceeds to the credit of appellants. They were collected October 1, 1873, and the money credited to appellants, who were owing Baltzer &amp; Taaks about $20,000. September 24, 1873, when the drafts were handed appellants, they were doing a banking and commission business in Galveston. September 27, 1873, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>suspended, and never resumed business or payment again. On September 27 and 29, McGreal called on appellants and requested them to telegraph and stop payment of the drafts, or to allow him to do so. They objected, assuring him that the drafts were for collection, and he would be protected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">November 7, 1873, appellants paid McGreal $2,500 of the amount collected, for which he executed his receipt, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">Galveston, <em>November </em>7,1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">\u201c Received of Messrs.

(Signed) Thomas McGreal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-9\">Afterwards, November 21 and 22, 1873, McGreal transferred and assigned his interest in balance due him by appellants to Josephine E. Towsey, one of the appellees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-10\">December 23, 1873, appellants filed their petition in voluntary bankruptcy. The claim was proved up against the estate, but was afterwards disallowed by the court, and nothing further was ever paid thereon. Appellants were discharged in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-11\">The charge of the court sufficiently appears in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-12\"><em>Labatt \u00bf- Noble, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnF\">A general deposit of money in a bank, or with bankers, or drafts for collection, proceeds to be subject to call of depositor when reported collected, does not create a fiduciary relation on the part of the banker toward the depositor, but the relation subsisting between the parties is that of ordinary creditor and debtor, and the debt- or, in such case, is discharged from the debt by his certificate of discharge in bankruptcy, thereafter obtained and properly pleaded and shown.

A debt created by a bank while acting in a fiduciary capacity, is not discharged by proceedings in bankruptcy, though it may have been proved up in the bankruptcy proceedings.

As a general rule, after the collection is made the bank becomes a simple contract debtor for the amount, less any commissions which may be charged. If the party for whom the collection was made was a regular depositor, the sum would be placed to his credit upon his regular deposit account, unless some peculiar usage or special instruction should demand a different course of dealing. If the party has no deposit account, the bank simply owes him the amount on demand. ( Morse on Banks and Banking, p. 322; Planters\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Union Bank, 16 Wall., 501; <em>in re </em>Bank of Madison, 9 Nat. Bank. Reg., 184; Duncan <em>v. </em>Magette, 25 Tex., 248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">We are of opinion, both on principle and authority, that after a bank has suspended, it thereby ceases to have the general power and authority which it previously had to col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>lect paper which, before its suspension, had been deposited with it for this purpose, so as to make it a general creditor of the depositor, but that this subsequent collection must-be held by it as agent in trust for the owner. (German American Bank <em>v. </em>Third National Bank of Missouri, 2 Tex. Law Jour., 150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">How far this principle might apply in this case, where the defendant bank, before its suspension, had parted with its control over the \"paper, by indorsing it to their correspondents, Baltzer &amp; Taaks, in the city of New York, with instructions'to collect and apply proceeds to an indebtedness due to them by the defendants, we feel difficulty in deciding, and particularly in view of the subsequent act of Thomas McGreal, by whom the original deposit was made, in receiving from defendants $2,500 on account of this collection so made and applied, and in agreeing to accept their promise to pay balance from their settlement with preferred creditors, as shown by his written receipt and agreement, in evidence. McGreal, at this time, had not assigned the claim to the plaintiff's, and, so far as shown by the record, had full authority to adjust and settle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">The charge of the court assumed, as a question of law, that if the defendants received the drafts for collection, and collected the same, this constituted such a fiduciary relation that their subsequent discharge in bankruptcy did not release them from liability. This charge was excepted to at the time, and is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We think the assignment well taken. As shown from the above authorities, whether the defendants occupied the relation of ordinary debtors or the fiduciary relation of agents or trustees, was a question of law to be deduced from the facts of the case, and was the main issue presented by the pleadings. The facts and circumstances in regard to the receipt of the drafts and their subsequent collection, the suspension of the defendants as bankers and their subsequent transaction and agreement with McGreal, were questions necessary to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>determined by the jury, under appropriate instructions, in order that the law arising thereupon should be applied. For the error in not submitting them to the jury, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
