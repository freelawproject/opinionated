An obligation for money to a guardian of several minors, for the sale of property belonging to the estate of all of said minors, cannot be lawfully sued and recovered on for the use of a single one of said minors, not having been distributed or set apart to said single minor by the court, and without indorsement to him, and against the pleas and objections of the debtors. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 10; McFadin v. MacGreal, 25 Tex., 79; Price v. Wiley, 19 Tex., 144; Heard v. Lockett, 20 Tex., 162; Merlin v. Manning, 2 Tex., 351; Ross v. Smith, 19 Tex., 171; Whithed v.

(Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 6969, 6970, 6982; act of 1876, secs. 135, 136, 147; Pelham <em>v. </em>Moore, 21 Tex., 755; Cook <em>v. </em>Thornhill, 13 Tex., 293; 16 Tex., 177; March v.

Its value and the meaning of \u201cdollars in specie\u201d are tixed by law. (Van Alstyne <em>v. </em>Sorley, 32 Tex., 532; Bouv.

The petition showed that Pannell had a right to sue on the draft for the use of Frank Noland. (Thompson <em>v. </em>Cartwright, 1 Tex., 87; Gayle <em>v. </em>Ennis, 1 Tex., 184; McMillan <em>v. </em>Croft, 2 Tex., 397; Lipscomb <em>v. </em>Ward, 2 Tex., 277; Andrews <em>v. </em>Hoxie, 5 Tex., 172; Butler <em>v. </em>Robertson, 11 Tex., 142; Claiborne <em>v. </em>Yoeman, 15 Tex., 45; Nelson <em>v. </em>Bagby, 25 Tex. Supp., 307.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-9\">III. The introduction in evidence by the plaintiff of the draft and protest proved all the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s petition, and authorized the judgment that was rendered. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 232; Bailey <em>v. </em>Heald, 14 Tex., 226.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-10\">IV. The amended answer, so far as it set up that other persons not parties to the suit were interested in the draft, and that Pannell had no right to sue on it 'in his own name for the use of Frank Noland, was insufficient, and set up no legal or valid defense to plaintiff\u2019s; and so far as it set up that the plaintiff was a lunatic and <em>non compos mentis, </em>and asked the suit to be stayed, it set up no defense, and was properly struck out, the court having no jurisdiction to inquire into plaintiff\u2019s mental status in this proceeding. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1; Taylor <em>v. </em>Hall, 20 Tex., 215; Cook <em>v. </em>Thornhill, 13 Tex., 297; Tinnin <em>v. </em>Weatherford, Dallam, 590-592; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Wolfe <em>v. </em>Stephens, Dallam, 607, 608; 1 Chitty\u2019s Plead., 480-483; Mit. Ch. Plead., 268.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-5\">Gould, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">Pannell, as the payee and legal holder of the draft sued on, was authorized to maintain an action thereon in his own name, whoever may have been the equitable owner. Unless there was some defense as against the other alleged equitable owners or beneficiaries of the draft, the answer denying Frank Noland\u2019s ownership presented an immaterial issue. (Lipscomb <em>v. </em>Ward, 2 Tex., 277; McMillan <em>v. </em>Croft, 2 Tex., 399, and other cases cited in the brief of appellees.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ahe\">Notwithstanding the suit was brought by or in the name of Pannell for the use of Frank Noland, there is no presumption in favor of defendants that this was done without Pannell\u2019s assent and authority. In case of a suit in the name of an assignor for the use of his assignee, the nominal plaintiff is not presumed to be present in court, cognizant of the proceedings in the case, so as to subject him without further notice to a judgment in reconvention. (McFadin <em>v. </em>MacGreal, 25 Tex., 78.) Whether even in such cases there was at common law an unqualified right to use the name of the holder of the legal title, admits of some question. (1 Chit. Pl., <em>9a; </em>3 Chit. Prac., 127; Spicer <em>v. </em>Todd, 2 Tyrw., 172; Chambers <em>v. </em>Donaldson, 9 East, 471; Moseley <em>v. </em>Boush, 4 Rand., 392.) It appears from these authorities that in some cases, at least, the holder of the legal title might require to be indemnified against costs. But, at all events, no authority has been adduced justifying the assumption in favor of the defendants, for the purpose of defeating the recovery, that this suit was not brought, as it is purported to be, with the assent and by the authority of Pannell. If Pannell\u2019s name was used without authority, the defendants might, as in other cases of the institution of suits without authority, by showing cause therefor, at the proper time and in the proper manner, have obtained protection. (Campbell <em>v. </em>Galbreath, 5 Watts, 423.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The production of the draft was sufficient evidence to authorize the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The plea that Pannell had become <em>non compos mentis </em>was in the nature of a plea in abatement, and not being sworn to, was bad on general exception. (Cook <em>v. </em>Thornhill, 13 Tex., 297; Mitf. Ch. Pl., 268.) By the mere filing of such a plea on the day set for trial, the further progress of the case cannot be stopped until the question of the plaintiff\u2019s sanity be investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Without deeming it necessary to pass in detail on other questions, our opinion is, that there is no error in the judgment, and it is accordingly ordered that it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
