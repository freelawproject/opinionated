The Board denied service connection, finding insufficient evidence to establish a nexus between his disease and his service. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed. Kakuk appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">This court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule pending the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 publication in the Federal Register of a final rule regarding presumptions of service connection based upon exposure to herbicides. Recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs published a final rule affording a presumption of service connection for Parkinson\u2019s Disease based upon exposure to herbicides. The Secretary now argues that the final rule \u201cmay provide Mr. Kakuk with the nexus currently lacking between his disability and his military service and may eliminate the need for this Court to address his arguments regarding prejudicial error and the adequacy of the medical exam.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The motion is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
