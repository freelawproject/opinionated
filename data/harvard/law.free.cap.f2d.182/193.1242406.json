Appellee denies, however, that \u201cNescafe\u201d has attained a secondary meaning as designating opposer\u2019s goods, that \u201cHycafe\u201d so closely resembles \u201cNescafe\u201d as to cause confusion o'r mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers into believing that his goods are associated with appellant. Appellee also alleges that the only similarity between the marks of the respective parties resides in the use of the descriptive word \u201ccafe,\u201d which is disclaimed in appellee\u2019s application, and that the word \u201ccafe\u201d is now and has for many years prior to the alleged date of adoption of the trade-mark \u201cNescafe,\u201d meant to the trade and the purchasing public generally a coffee product, and has been used by the trade generally in combination with distinctive designation to define a concentrated coffee product.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">Both parties filed briefs and were present at the oral argument. Appellant alone took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">The sole issue presented by the record is whether or not the marks are confusingly similar within the meaning of the TradeMark Act of 1905.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The examiner conceded that \u201ccafe\u201d is the French equivalent of \u201ccoffee\u201d and would thus have, when applied to coffee products, a descriptive significance to persons familiar with the French language, but considered that purchasers not so informed would regard-'the term as distinctive when applied to such products. Considering the terms \u201cNescafe\u201d and \u201cHycafe\u201d in their entireties, he held that despite the difference between the prefixes \u201cNes\u201d and \u201cHy,\u201d the marks so resemble each other as to be likely to cause confusion in trade. Thus, he sustained the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The commissioner thought that \u201ccafe\u201d though of French derivation had become an accepted word of the English language designating either coffee or an establishment for serving refreshments, and quoted Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201c1. Coffee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c2. A coffeehouse; a room for coffee and light refreshments; a restaurant; formerly, in the United States a barroom.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, 1934 (1949 reprint), however, indicates<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that \u201ccafe\u201d is a French word meaning \u201ccoffee,\u201d and when used not as a foreign word (not italicized) means \u201cA coffeehouse, etc.\u201d That dual nature of the word, as a French term for coffee, or as an English term for restaurant or coffeehouse, is corroborated by the Oxford \u201cA New English Dictionary,\u201d Vol. II, 1893,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is not changed hy the supplemental volume with new and additional meanings of words, published in 1933. Funk &amp; Wagnalls \u201cNew Standard Dictionary,\u201d 1942, identifies <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the word \u201ccafe\u201d as a foreign word (French) whose most common and important meaning is \u201cA coffee-house, refreshment-room, or restaurant\u201d with a less common meaning as \u201ccoffee.\u201d Words and Phrases states,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe word \u2018cafe\u2019 as ordinarily and popularly used means a restaurant or house for refreshments. Proprietors\u2019 Realty Co. v. Wohltmann, 95 N.J.L. 303, 112 A. 410.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">We must disagree with the commissioner\u2019s statement that \u201ccafe\u201d has become an accepted word of the English language designating coffee. The dictionaries make it manifest that only as a foreign language term (French) does <em>cafe </em>mean coffee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>That, however, does not invalidate the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that \u201ccafe\u201d has descriptive significance relating to coffee. Foreign language words, not adopted into the English language, which are descriptive of a product, are so considered in registration proceedings despite the 'fact that the words may be meaningless to the public generally. In re Northern Paper Mills, 64 F.2d 998, 20 C.C.P.A. Patents 1109, and cases cited; Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Manufacturing Co., 74 F.2d 127, 22 C.C.P.A. Patents 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Appellant\u2019s label, Exhibit 3, appears to bear out the descriptive nature of \u201ccafe\u201d in the statement there set forth, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201cA cup of Nescafe, made according to directions, is a cup of full-flavored, full strength coffee with added carbohydrates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT8\">\u201cThe carbohydrates (dextrins, maltose and dextrose) are added for the sole purpose of protecting the natural flavor of the freshly-roasted, freshly-brewed coffee. They are not a coffee substitute, no'r do they diminish the coffee\u2019s flavor, strength or stimulation. In Nescafe you get all the flavor, all the \u2018lift\u2019 of really fine coffee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Further showing that appellant recognizes \u201ccafe\u201d as meaning \u201ccoffee\u201d is appellant\u2019s Exhibit 8, used in its advertising, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">\u201c \u2018Nescafe certainly makes a grand cup of coffee\u2019 * * * <em>makes it every time. You\u2019ll want a second cup and can have it so-o easily. </em>(Italics quoted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">* # * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\u201cA quick cup of Full Flavored Coffee\u2014 that\u2019s Nescafe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">It must be recognized that both marks, \u201cNescafe\u201d and \u201cHycafe,\u201d consist of a foreign term, admittedly descriptive of the product to which the marks are applied, coupled with a prefix. The registrations to appellant, 364,017 and 379,117, are for the entire trade-mark \u201cNescafe.\u201d In appellee\u2019s application for registration of \u201cHycafe,\u201d \u201ccafe\u201d is disclaimed apart from the combination shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">The likelihood of confusion in the mind of the public as to origin of the goods it purchases because of the similarity of the marks is, of course, the test applied by this court in opposition proceedings, Standard Laboratories, Inc., v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., 167 F.2d 1022, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents 1146, as well as by other courts in trade-mark infringement and unfair competition actions, Best &amp; Co. v. Miller, 2 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 374, 376. The marks considered \u00bfn their entireties must be considered, Yeasties Products, Inc., v. General Mills, 77 F.2d 523: 22 C.C.P.A. Patents 1215, Miles Laboratories v. Foley &amp; Co., 144 F.2d 888, 32 C.C.P.A. Patents 714; Apollo Shirt Co. v. Enro Shirt Co., Inc., 165 F.2d 469, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents 849. In considering contested marks in their entireties, the court may notice the descriptive as well as disclaimed portions despite the rule that the validity of registered marks which are merely descriptive is not to be challenged in opposition proceedings, West Disinfecting Co. v. Lan-O-Sheen Co., 163 F.2d 566, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents 706. A descriptive word, having little trade-mark significance, will not be regarded as the dominant part of a mark, Atlantic Seafood Packers v. Florida Fruit Canners, Inc., 166 F.2d 586, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents 985; National NuGrape v. Judge &amp; Dolph Ltd., 154 F.2d 521, 33 C.C.P.A. Patents 1032; Miles Laboratories, Inc., v. Foley &amp; Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">In the instant case, we consider \u201ccafe\u201d to be a descriptive term as applied to a coffee product. The balance of the marks, \u201cNes,\u201d and \u201cHy,\u201d are suggestive of the Nestle\u2019s Milk Products Company and the Hygrade Food Products Corporation (the parent company of appellee herein), respectively, producers of the products to which the contested marks are applied. They are not similar, and, considering the marks \u201cNescafe\u201d and \u201cHycafe\u201d in their entireties, we do not find grounds for disagreeing with the commissioner\u2019s decision that their concurrent use would not be likely to cause confusion in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">.

Those registrations were for use on coffee, coffee extracts, decaffeinated coffee preparations, and the like. Appellee\u2019s application for the registration of \u201cHycafe\u201d was filed June 30, 1945, alleging continuous prior use thereof for coffee extract since June 18, 1945. That use was for a period of twelve days.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The decision of the majority holds that considering the marks \u201cNescafe\u201d and \u201cHycafe\u201d in their entireties they are not similar and their concurrent use would not be likely to cause confusion. It is impossible to accept that conclusion. \u201cNescafe\u201d and \u201cHycafe\u201d consist of but one word, each having three short syllables, two of which are not only similar but identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">It is not the word \u201ccafe\u201d that makes appellee\u2019s mark objectionable. It is the lack of distinctiveness by which the diminutive \u201cHy\u201d obscures any difference at all between the contested marks. In fact, it would seem that so far as appellee is concerned, whatever difference there is between appellee\u2019s mark and that of appellant was wholly unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The owner of appellee\u2019s mark is the Baker Company and not the Hygrade Company whose name is printed on the mark. In thus assembling \u201cHycafe\u201d as a trade-mark for use on its goods, appellee, the junior party, has introduced a feature of duplicity whereby confusion is likely to result as to just which of the two companies named in the mark \u201cHycafe\u201d is the actual vendor of the merchandise to which the mark is attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The mark \u201cHycafe\u201d also bears the identical notation on its face that was previously and continuously used on labels and in the widely circulated advertising of appellant to the effect that the involved product was a powdered coffee extract with added dextrins, maltose, and dextrose.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">\u201cHygrade\u201d is a phonetic spelling of the descriptive adjective \u201chigh-grade,\u201d which means of a grade rated as superior. It is also noted that \u201cHy\u201d is susceptible to interpretation as an abbreviation for the hydrates with which the cafe is blended. In either event, \u201cHycafe\u201d is merely descriptive of the character and quality of the goods to which the mark is attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Appellant took testimony for the purpose of showing that prior to appellee\u2019s entry into the field in 1945, appellant had already spent approximately $1,250,000 in advertising its product through radio and other mediums of attracting the purchasing public, including numerous national magazines, such as Life, Look, Ladies Home Journal, McCall and such newspapers as the New York Daily News and the Philadelphia Enquirer; and that as a result of such advertising and the quality of its product, appellant built up good will in its trade-mark \u201cNescafe\u201d having an enormous value on a national scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The record also discloses that in 1945 when the temporary period ended during which the Armed Forces had taken all of the product made by appellant, appellant launched another widely-circulated advertising campaign among grocers to revive its business by announcing to them with large and striking display that \u201cNescafe Is Here Again.\u201d About that time appellee likewise launched its entry into the field with the use of the mark \u201cHycafe.\u201d Appellee has submitted no testimony to the effect that it has spent anything in the marketing of its product.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The Circuit Court of Appeals has noted that at one time courts were remarkably generous in extending bpundaries of the monopolies created by registered marks but today the tendency is to be somewhat less generous. Eastern Wine Corporation v. Winslow-Warren, Ltd., Inc., 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 955. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has uniformly treated each case as subject to determination in accordance with the particular facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">The history of this court discloses, however, that a newcomer seeking to register a mark of doubtful qualification, upon which no investment whatever has been shown in connection with its prior use, has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>afforded a refuge fo'r piracy here through registration as against the owner of a mark who has spent over a million dollars in its promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The decision of the majority, in effect, 'has applied the rule of caveat emptor \u2014 let the buyer beware \u2014 to the sale of an every day household article. The fallacy of the decision is that \u201ccafe\u201d is descriptive and every one is free to use the term as a trademark without the necessity of also selecting an additional and differentiating term that will clearly distinguish the owner\u2019s product from that of the appellant. Lactona, Inc., v. Lever Brothers Co., 144 F.2d 891, 32 C.C.P.A. Patents 704, 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The late Judge Hatfield in the case of Atlantic Seafood Packers v. Florida Fruit Canners, Inc., 166 F.2d 586, 589, 35 C.C.P.A. Patents 985, quoted the following generally accepted doctrine which is here applicable to the point in question: \u201cA vast field of wo'rds, phrases, and symbols is open to one who wishes to select a trade-mark to distinguish his product from that of another. Unquestionably in our ever-increasing complex business life, the trend of modern judicial decisions in trade-mark matters is to show little patience with the newcomer who in adopting a mark gets into the border-line zone between an open field and one legally appropriated to another. As between a newcomer and one who by honest dealing has won favor with the public, doubts are always resolved against the former.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The decision of the majority represents a departure from the application of the doctrine hereinbefore described. Suyely, the court by its decision does not intend to set up a new tower of Babel in the field of trade-mark law. However, the decision is susceptible to that interpretation and is bound to be hailed with delight throughout all hucksterdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Appellant has been a pioneer in the introduction and use of the mark \u201cNescafe\u201d in the sale of powdered coffee or cafe, instantly soluble in a cup of hot water, which has proved a godsend to the maddening throngs who have to punch a time clock. The name has significance 'as a symbol of the product and not as \u00e1 family name.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Upon the record, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that appellee\u2019s adoption and peculiar use of \u201cHycafe\u201d as a trade-mark was to serve the purpose of simulation and to draw to itself the reputation and good will of the appellant corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In view of that conclusion, and in view of the doubt created by the sound and honest conviction expressed in the decision of the Examiner of Interferences holding that the involved marks are confusingly similar, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
