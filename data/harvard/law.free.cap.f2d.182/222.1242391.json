The cases were here submitted on two separate records but were briefed and argued together. Accordingly, we shall dispose of the two appeals in one decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-25\">The goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties and the only question for consideration is whether \u201cMercirex\u201d so nearly resembles appellant\u2019s group of marks containing the word \u201crex\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-26\">One appeal was taken from the decision of the commissioner reversing a decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining appellant\u2019s opposition, No. 24,159, to the registration of \u201cMercirex\u201d for medicated cream or ointment for use in the treatment of diseases of the skin and scalp. In its notice of opposition, appellant pleaded ownership of a number of prior registrations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>such as \u201cRex,\u201d \u201cRexall,\u201d etc., for use on a variety of medicinal, pharmaceutical and toilet preparations.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u201cAlco-rex,\u201d \u201cFungi-rex,\u201d \u201cRex-Salvine\u201d and \u201cRex-Menthol\u201d were selected by the examiner as bearing the closest resemblance to appellee\u2019s mark \u201cMercirex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Examiner of Interferences held that appellee\u2019s mark consisted of the arbitrary syllable \u201crex\u201d in association with the term \u201cMerei,\u201d suggestive of one of the ingredients shown on the label of appellee\u2019s product, namely, mercury; that appellant\u2019s marks also consisted of the same syllable in association with words respectively indicating one of the ingredients or their purposes. For that reason, the examiner held, persons acquainted with the marks of appellant would be likely to assume that the product to which appellee applied its mark originated with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In a companion opposition, No. 24,043, litigated between the same parties relative to the same marks, the examiner held that appellee\u2019s mark, \u201cMercirex\u201d for soap, was not so similar to appellant\u2019s marks as to mislead purchasers as to the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The parties have agreed that the above holdings of the examiner are inconsistent and that the same ruling should be applied in each of the respective cases. The Commissioner of Patents agreed with the ruling of the examiner in which he held the marks to be dissimilar in opposition, No. 24,043, and disagreed with the examiner and reversed his ruling that the marks were confusingly similar in opposition, No. 24,-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The commissioner properly considered that \u201cRex\u201d and \u201cRexall\u201d were appellant\u2019s basic marks against which the question of confusing similarity should be tested. Neither side took testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The conflicting decisions of the examiner resulted from his side-by-side comparison of appellee\u2019s mark as applied in one case to the ointment and in the other to the soap. Careful scrutiny discloses that in the fine print on the label attached to the ointment, it is stated that the product contains certain mercury derivatives whereas the labels attached to appellee\u2019s soap contain no such notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Commissioner of Patents directed attention to the fallacy of the examiner\u2019s conclusion by pointing out that any customer who might be so careful as to scrutinize appellee\u2019s label as to the ingredients of the ointment, would certainly be informed thereby as to the source of the product. From the language of the examiner\u2019s decision in opposition No. 24,159, his conclusion appears to have been derived solely from his irregular method of procedure. Magitex Co., Inc. v. John Hudson Moore, Inc., 154 F.2d 177, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 956; Seven Up Co. v. Cheer Up Sales Co. of St. Louis, 8 Cir., 148 F.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">The word \u201crex\u201d which is the factor common to both marks is primarily defined as a king. On oral argument the suggestion was offered that \u201cRexall\u201d as applied to appellant\u2019s goods was laudatory or symbolic of the fact that appellant\u2019s respective products to which the mark was attached were king of all the products in that particular class of goods. \u201cRex\u201d is a commonly used word, however, registered widely as a trade-mark for use by numerous owners and otherwise commonly used for numerous kinds of goods to signify that the involved goods are superior to other goods of the same class.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">Other than the similarities between the contested marks hereinbefore noted, there is no suggestion that appellee in the adoption and use of its mark \u201cMercirex\u201d has not acted from the outset in good faith. There are specific differences between the goods of the parties, as well as certain pronounced differences between their contested marks. The issue as to their confusing similarity has been sharply and vigorously contested and many arguments and authorities have been cited by counsel for the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">The contentions of the parties have-been given careful consideration. Bearing in mind the admonition expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Schlitz Brewing Co. v. Houston Ice &amp; Brewing Co., 250 U.S. 28, 29, 39 S.Ct. 401, 63 L.Ed. 822, that \u201cIt is a fallacy to break the fagot stick by-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>stick,\u201d and bearing in mind the impression which results from a comparison of the respective marks in their entireties, we conclude that their concurrent use on the involved goods would not be likely to cause confusion in trade or to deceive purchasers. In other words, we agree with the views expressed in the following succinct expression taken from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents: \u201cIt is true that the word \u2018rex\u2019 which opposer uses as a valid and technical trade-mark does form one syllable of applicant\u2019s mark. It is not, however, set out separately or emphasized and, as presented by the drawing and specimens, would not, in my opinion, be recognized or connected with opposer\u2019s mark even by persons familiar with it. While a known mark cannot be appropriated and rights cannot be acquired by mere addition of words, syllables, or other features which leave the known mark recognizable as a prominent feature of the new mark, comparison of the marks does not give that impression in this case. In my opinion the inclusion of that syllable in applicant\u2019s mark cannot be considered an appropriation of opposer\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Subsequent to the filing of the record' in this court appellee filed a motion suggesting a diminution of the record by the addition thereto of certain parts of the record filed in the Patent Office. The motion was granted subject to an order of the court that the costs of printing the additional matter requested by appellee should be taxed on final decision. The additional matter consisted of numerous registrations to third parties of marks containing the term \u201crex.\u201d We are of opinion therefore that the additional matter so certified to the court was not reasonably necessary to a proper decision of the issues in this case. Under the facts thus presented, the costs of printing the additional matter will be taxed against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
