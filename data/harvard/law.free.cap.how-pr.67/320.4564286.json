The justices, in pursuance of the authority thus conferred, appointed a crier whose annual salary was fixed by the board of supervisors at $2,500. The plaintiff was duly appointed to fill a vacancy thereafter occurring in said office, and has since continued to discharge its duties. By the consolidation act <em>(chap. </em>410, <em>Laws of </em>1882) the act of 1865 is re-enacted, the board of estimate and apportionment being substituted for the board of supervisors <em>(Sec. </em>1116, <em>Consolidation Act). </em>In December, 1883, the board of estimate and apportionment reduced and fixed the annual salary of said crier at $1,500, and the comptroller of the city has, since J anuary, 1884, refused to pay the plaintiff at any other rate. -He is a public officer, and was appointed before the adoption of the consolidation act, which is clearly local in its character, and should be construed in harmony with article 3, section 18 of the Constitution of 1815, which prohibits legislative enactments in a private or local bill <em>\u201c </em>creating, increasing or decreasing fees, per centages or allowances of public officers during the term for which said officers are elected or appointed.\u201d Under the ruling in <em>The People ex rel. Gass </em>agt. <em>Lee </em>(28 <em>Hun, </em>469), and <em>Kerrigan </em>agt. <em>Force </em>(68 <em>N. Y., </em>381), the harmony of construction is preserved which limits the consolidation act to future appointments made under its provisions, without disturbing, any rights which had vested prior to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Daly, C.
