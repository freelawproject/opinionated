That thereupon, the defendant, his agents, servants and employes commenced to discharge the said cargo of coal from the said canal boat into the said defendant\u2019s yard.\u201d That on the 16th of February, 1882, while unloading said cargo, the coal bucket, by means of which the coal was being removed, fell violently upon the plaintiff\u2019s boat, doing the damage claimed. . The plaintiff then charges that the bucket fell through the negligence of the defendant and his employes, and not by or through any fault on the part of the plaintiff or his employes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-14\">The answer is, in substance, a denial of each and every allegation in the complaint contained, excepting that the cargo of coal was received by the defendant and that he proceeded to unload the same into his yard. The action was tried. Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>her 9, 1882, before Hr. justice HcAdam and a jury. It appeared by the evidence that the defendant employed a person by the name of Scott to assist the plaintiff\u2019s servants in unloading the boat and that defendant was to pay Scott for such services <em>\u201c </em>so much a ton.\u201d Scott proceeded to assist the plaintiff\u2019s servants, and during the progress of the unloading Scott left a horse which he had been previously driving in the unloading, and went to the water closet and was absent about ten or fifteen minutes; and after Scott left and while he was absent n .strange man, who was not known to any of the parties -or witnesses and who was not working there, came and took hold of the horse and, under orders from the plaintiff\u2019s servant, started the horse and thereafter lifted a spring and .caused the tub to fall which produced the injury. At the conclusion of the trial the justice-dismissed the complaint, writing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">McAdam, J. The person guilty of the negligent act which injured the plaintiff\u2019s boat was not the servant of the defendant, but a volunteer, who, without the defendant\u2019s knowledge, undertook to take charge of the horse during the servant\u2019s temporary absence. If the volunteer had merely assumed charge of the horse no damage would have ensued. But the volunteer went further; he drove the horse and touched the spring which caused the damage. The defendant not having selected the volunteer, is not answerable for his competency or misconduct. In <em>Booth </em>agt. <em>Mister </em>(7 <em>Car. &amp; P., </em>66) the defendant\u2019s servant allowed a stranger to drive the korse, and the court said: \u201c As the defendant\u2019s servant was in the cart, I think that the reins being held by another man makes no difference. It was the same as if the servant held them himself.\u201d In <em>Althorf </em>agt. <em>Wolfe </em>(22 <em>N. Y., </em>352) the servant and volunteer were both present when the damage was done, and the court, following the case last cited, held that the master was liable. In <em>Simons </em>agt. <em>Miller </em>(29 <em>Barb., </em>420) the servant was employed to do a specific act, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>master was held liable for the negligence of the servant\u2019s son, who acted by the servant\u2019s direction in performing it. The court was careful, however, not to extend the rule further than the necessities of that case required, and said: <em>\u201c </em>The case would have stood entirely different had the son been employed by the father to do the work generally, which it was the duty of the father, as the defendant\u2019s servant, to perform, and had he while so employed, of his own volition, and without the knowledge or direction of the father, set the fire in question. The son, under such circumstances, being the servant of the father, and not of the defendant, his act would have been chargeable upon the father as master,' and not upon the defendant. The negligent act in that case would have been the act and negligence of the son, and in no sense that of the father, except by mere legal relation; and as the defendant never selected him, nor authorized any one to do so on his behalf, and never intrusted any business to his management or discretion, there could be no ground on which to. charge the defendant with his negligent acts. The court: assigns as a reason for this, that \u201cthe legal relation- upon, which the master\u2019s liability rests would in such case be entirely wanting.\u201d It is noticeably wanting in this case.. The master selected his servant and intrusted the work to-him presumably on account of his experience. The volunteer who took charge of the horse during the servant\u2019s temporary absence undertook to experiment with him, and'' made the mistake which the servant\u2019s experience would undoubtedly have prevented had he been present. The plaintiff\u2019s servant assisted in the experiment and is culpable, to a limited extent at least. The evidence failed to show that the defendant did anything which, under, the circumstances, he ought not to have done, or omitted any precaution which a prudent and careful man would or ought to have taken, observed or performed. There was no solid legal ground for holding the defendant liable, and the complaint was properly dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">From the judgment entered upon this dismissal the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>tiff </em>appealed to the general term of that court, which, on May 22, 1883, affirmed the judgment; and from the judgment entered on that affirmance the plaintiff appealed to the general term of the court of common pleas for the city and county of blew York.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>J. A. Hyland, </em>for plaintiff and appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">I. Defendant is liable for the damages occasioned by the happening of the accident (<em>Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, sec. </em>308; <em>Suydam </em>agt. Moore, 8 <em>Barb., </em>358; <em>Simons </em>agt. <em>Monier, </em>29 <em>Barb., </em>419; <em>Booth </em>agt.

There was a duty imposed upon the defendant which rendered it imperative that he properly discharge the plaintiff\u2019s boat. Where by contract or by statute the master is bound to do certain things, if he intrusts that duty to^ another he becomes absolutely responsible for the manner in which the duty is performed, and that without any reference to the question whether the servant was authorized to do the particular act ( <em>Wood on Master and Servant, sec. </em>321).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-8\">III. It was error to refuse to allow the case to go to the jury. The accident raised a presumption of negligence on the part of the defendant, for which he is liable (57 <em>N. Y., </em>567; 11 <em>Hun, </em>46; <em>Sherman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, sec. </em>71). In determining the propriety of a nonsuit, the court is legally bound to assume, the truth of the fact which the testimony of the plaintiff legitimately conduces to prove, although their correctness may be controverted by the defendant\u2019s witnesses (64 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>126).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-9\"><em>James Wiley, </em>for defendant and respondent; <em>Amour C. Anderson, </em>of counsel:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-10\">I. The plaintiff and defendant were both absent at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of the accident. In order to establish a liability against the defendant, it therefore became necessary for the plaintiff to make it appear, 1st. That some <em>employe </em>of the defendant committed the negligent act. 2d. That the plaintiff\u2019s employe, who assisted in the act, was entirely free from fault. The same rule of law which makes the defendant responsible for the acts of his employe, applies with equal force to plaintiff in respect to his employers <em>(Wharton on Negligence, secs. </em>157, 158).</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">II. The rule which makes one person responsible for the acts of another is founded on the maxim <em>qui facit per alium, facit per se, </em>and is based on the theory of agency, but neither the principle of the rule nor the rule\" itself, can apply to a case where the party sought to be charged does not stand in the character of employer to the party by whose negligent act the injury has been occasioned (<em>Wharton on Negligence, sec. </em>157, <em>and cases cited). </em>In cases like the present one the <em>onus propandi </em>is on the plaintiff to make out his case by clear, clean, affirmative evidence. His case is not to be presumed, but must be proved <em>(Baulec </em>agt. <em>The N. Y. and H. R. R. Co., </em>59 <em>N. Y., </em>366; <em>Fleming </em>agt. <em>Northampton Nat. Bank, </em>62 <em>How., </em>178; <em>Paine </em>agt. <em>Forty-second Street R. R. Co., </em>40 <em>N. Y. Supr. Ct.

The rule is, that where the circumstances admit of two inferences, either of which is equally probable, one in favor of plaintiff and the other in favor of the defendant, plaintiff should be non-suited <em>(Cordell </em>agt. <em>N. Y. C. and H. R. R. R. Co., </em>75 <em>N. Y., </em>330-332; <em>Kenny </em>agt. <em>N. Y., M. B. R. R. Co., </em>13 <em>Week. Dig., </em>61; <em>Claflin et al. </em>agt. <em>Meyer, </em>75 <em>N.

Y. and H. R. R. Co., </em>59 <em>N. Y., </em>366). The cases cited and relied upon by the appellants <em>(Suydam </em>agt. <em>Moore et al., </em>8 <em>Barb., </em>359; <em>Simons </em>agt. Monier, 29 <em>Barb., </em>419; <em>Booth </em>agt. <em>Mister, </em>9 <em>Car. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Payne, </em>66; <em>Althorf </em>agt. <em>Wolfe, </em>22 <em>N. Y., </em>355; <em>Gleason </em>agt. <em>Amsdell, </em>9 Daly 393) are not parallel cases and do not help the appellant. If, as judge McAdam says, Scott and the strange hand had both been present, one assisting the other, the defendant might have been held, because the principal in that event would have had the benefit of his agent\u2019s skill and care. But where, as in this case, the agent or servant was absent, he could not delegate his authority by 'substituting a new agent in his place and stead <em>(Story on Agency, secs. </em>13, 14; <em>Ewell\u2019s </em>Evans\u2019 <em>Agency, </em>51). The maxim is <em>delegata protestas non potest delegari. </em>Scott was an <em>\u201c </em>independent contractor;\" and the employment being a lawful one, which might have been performed without injury to others, the person employing the contractor is not responsible for the acts of the latter, nor for those acting under his orders <em>(See Wood on Master and Servant, sec. </em>314, <em>and notes; Kelly </em>agt. <em>The Mayor et al., </em>11 <em>N. Y., </em>432; <em>After new trial, </em>4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>291; <em>McCafferty </em>agt. <em>The S. D. and P. M. R. R. Co., </em>61 <em>N. Y., </em>178; <em>Burgmeister </em>agt. <em>The N.

Y., </em>211; <em>Scanlon </em>agt. <em>Carroll, </em>1 <em>City Court R., </em>351).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-6\">Beach, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">\u2014 The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s case, causing a dismissal of his complaint by the learned justice of the city court presiding at tidal term, did not arise from weakness in legal position, but for want of sufficient evidence to make a <em>prima facie </em>case upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The plaintiff was bound to produce proof authorizing the jury to find that the person in charge of the defendant\u2019s hoisting apparatus sustained a relation to the defendant which would not make the defendant responsible for his negligence. If he failed in this there could be no question for the jury. The evidence upon this point was given by the witness Bray and is brief enough for quotation. He says: \u201c The regular driver went away to the water closet and left a strange hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>at it; the strange man let it go before he was told, and the tub fell and it came right down on the boat.\u201d On cross-examination he testifies: <em>\u201c </em>He (the defendant\u2019s driver) left it (the horse) and then a strange man took hold.\u201d Again: \u201c Q. And while he was gone this strange man came and took hold, of the horse and lifted the spring and started it and then the tub came down? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The testimony does not show the stranger assumed control with the knowledge, or assent of the defendant\u2019s servant. One part would' support such a conclusion, another is equally strong in favor of the defendant\u2019s servants having been ignorant of the stranger\u2019s act. In the one case the defendant would have been liable for the stranger\u2019s negligence, he having .been left in charge by defendant\u2019s servant <em>(Simons </em>agt. <em>Monier, </em>29 <em>Barb., </em>419; <em>Althorf </em>agt. <em>Wolf, </em>22 <em>N. Y., </em>385; <em>Gleason </em>agt. <em>Amsdell, </em>9 <em>Daly, </em>393). If the servant, within the scope of his duty, enabled another by his assent to injure a third party, the master is liable. In the other view, <em>i. e., </em>that the stranger took control of the hoisting apparatus without the knowledge or assent of the regular driver, the defendant would not be liable, the stranger being an intruder or volunteer. This distinction, in my opinion, is clearly deducible from the authorities cited. The plaintiff failed to give evidence authorizing a finding that the strange man took charge with the driver\u2019s knowledge. The proof was quite as potent in support of the driver\u2019s ignorance. For this reason it was right to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Daly, C. J., and Larremore, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
