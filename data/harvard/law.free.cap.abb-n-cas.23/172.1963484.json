Branscom, and also Theodore, James W. and Wm. F. Conrow, who were partners under the name of Conrow Brothers ; to recover moneys which Branscom had obtained from plaintiff,, deposited with the bank, and checked out to Conrow Brothers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-13\">The plaintiff delivered its check drawn on October 29, 1884, for the sum of $4,500 to A. C. Branscom, who-represented himself to be the manager of the publishing department of the New Orleans Exposition. The check was drawn upon the Nassau Bank; and was received by Branscom as part payment upon a note of $5,500, dated August 19, 1884. This note was made in the name of the Mississippi Mills, and had the name of William M. Oliver,. \u201c secretary \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>treasurer,\u201d subscribed to it. The plaintiff was a manufacturer and dealer in paper, a large quantity of which was contracted for, and to be delivered to Branscom. The difference of $1,000 between the amount of the note and the check was to be retained by the plaintiff as security for the fulfillment of his agreement. The check was deposited, on the day of its date, with the National Shoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>.and Leather Bank ; and by the account it appears to have been the last deposit made by Branscom with the bank. His account was afterwards reduced by checks, drawn against \u25a0 it to the sum of about $2,915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">On November 8 he drew a check for that amount in favor of the defendants Conrow Brothers, for which they received this sum of money. Another check was drawn by him for the sum of $16.17, which practically closed his account with the bank. It was to recover the sum of money paid upon the check given by Branscom to Conrow Brothers, that this action was instituted. It proceeded upon the affirmation that the plaintiff had been induced to make \u25a0and deliver its check\" to Branscom not only by means of false and fraudulent representations, but upon the note made in the name of the Mississippi Mills and indorsed with the name of the president of the exposition, which in fact was a forgery. When this state of facts, which was abundantly maintained by the evidence, came to the knowledge of the plaintiff, company, it served a notice on Branscom, dated on November 6th, 1884, disaffirming and rescinding the agreement with him, and requiring a return from him of $4,500 loaned and advanced by the plaintiff\u2019s check of October 29th. Notice was also given \"to the bank itself by the plaintiff, claiming the money on deposit as the money of the plaintiff. This notice was objected to upon the trial as insufficient, for \u2022the reason that it only claimed that \u201c a certain sum of money lately deposited with you by Alexander C. Branscom, as manager or otherwise, and which sum, or some part thereof, remains on deposit with you to the credit of said Branscom, is the property of the undersigned, Peter Adams \u2022Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">The notice then proceeded to state that the money had been obtained by fraud by Branscom, and notified the bank not to pay it to him, or to his order, or to any other person, but to pay or hold it subject to the order of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">The complaint in the action stated the contract and fraud by which plaintiff\u2019s check was obtained and asked judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>rescinding the contract and requiring the Bank and Conrow Brothers to pay the sum paid out on Branscom\u2019s check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">On the trial Branscom did not appear. At the close of the evidence the court required plaintiff to elect whether it would hold the bank or Conrow Brothers.

The whole of the money which \u2022defendant Branscom obtained from the plaintiffs by their check he held as a trustee for their use solely, and acquired no other right, title or interest therein.

A bank, like any other person, is bound by such notice (See Overseers, etc. <em>v. </em>Bank of Va. 2 Grattan, 544; Merrill <em>v. </em>Bank of N., 19 <em>Pick. </em>32).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">V. Had the defendant bank seen fit to relieve itself of all responsibility in the matter, it could have simply retained the money, and required the plaintiff and the defendantsBranscom and Conrow Brothers to determine the title by an appropriate action in the nature of an interpleader (Dows <em>v. </em>Kidder, 84 <em>N. Y. </em>121, 134; Coates <em>v. </em>First Nat\u2019l. Bank,. 91 <em>Id. </em>20).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-7\"><em>George G. Lay, </em>for the Nat.

The notice served upon the bank was vague,, indefinite, uncertain and wholly insufficient to warrant the bank in refusing payment of the checks of its depositors. The relation of debtor and creditor, created between the-bank and its depositor, cannot be disturbed by a stranger unless upon a clear, positive notice to the bank that the-title to specific money is not in the depositor. A notice, to-have any force or efficacy, should be definitely and clearly expressed, so as to leave no doubt as to the amount claimed by the stranger. It conveys no information as to amounts or dates. A diligent examination of the books of the bank, would not aid in fixing what deposit, among the many, is referred to by the plaintiff. Upon the strength of this-notice the plaintiff claims that a trust was impressed upon the balance then existing in the bank, and that they might, fold their hands, take no steps to enforce their rights by summons or injunction, and claim that they have the right in equity to require payment of this money, whenever they get ready to sue for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>II. The bank owed a duty to its depositor, and was not bound to recognize another claimant for the money, unless that claimant promptly followed up a clear specific notice and demand by a suit to establish his right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">III. The balance of $2,915 in the bank was not impressed with any trust. The bank took the money in the regular course of business, and in the absence of clear and distinct notice that such balance was the money of the plaintiff, was bound to honor the check of its depositor. (\u00c6tna Bank <em>v. </em>Fourth National Bank, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>82; Justh <em>v. </em>Nat. Bank of Commonwealth, 56 <em>Id. </em>478).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-6\"><em>Henry </em>Parsons, for the respondents Conrow.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWJ\">I. The facts shown on the trial were not sufficient to sustain a joint action against the defendants, or any two of them, or to entitle the plaintiff to a joint judgment. If the plaintiffs were entitled to any judgment, it could be against one only of the defendants, and it was proper that they be compelled to say against which they claimed to have made out the strongest case, and then leave the court to decide whether they had made out a case against the one so elected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\">The taking by the defendant Bran scorn had been wrongful in the beginning, and an action to recover the property, or for damages for its detention, would lie against him without any demand. But not so as to the other defendants. (Talcott <em>v. </em>Belding, 46 <em>How. </em>419, and cases there cited; <em>Wait's Actions and </em>Defenses, vol. 5, p. 480, sees. 9 and 10.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">Having been permitted to proceed with the trial against all the defendants, without objection from either, and having all their proofs in, it was apparent that if the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment at all, it could not be a joint judgment, but must be against only one of the defendants, or none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-9\">II. Without any reference to the election made by plaintiffs on the trial, the evidence was not sufficient to hold the defendants Conrow, and the complaint as to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>should have been dismissed. (\u00c6tna National Bank <em>v. </em>Fourth National Bank, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>82; in appeal of Hopkins 8 <em>Cent. Rep. </em>860; <em>N. Y. Daily Reg., </em>Oct. 8, 1887, p. 668.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-5\">The defendant, Oonrow, received the money in the usual course of business for valuable consideration in good faith, and thereby acquired a good title. (Justh <em>v. </em>Nat. Bank of the Commonwealth, 56 <em>N. </em>Y. 478; Stephens <em>v. </em>Board of Education, 79 <em>Id. </em>183).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-14\"> For other cases, see Hooley <em>v. </em>Grieve, 9 <em>Abb.

[after stating the facts.]</author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">The notice was incomplete, for it did not trace the money to the check, which had been delivered by the plaintiff to Branscom, on the Nassau Bank. But its deficiency in this respect did not operate to the prejudice of the plaintiff, for it appeared by the conversation which, on November 6, took place between the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Henry H- Bowman and Mr. Crane, the president of the bank, that it was understood by him that the notice did not refer to this money still standing to the credit of Branscom in his account, and which had in fact been obtained from the Nassau Bank on the check by this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">This conversation was induced by a letter written by the president, dated the same day, stating that they had no funds under their control which were deposited by Alexander C. Branscom, as manager or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The president of the bank, in the interview between himself and Mr. Bowman, explained this statement as having proceeded upon the circumstance that an attachment had been issued in favor of the Conrows against Branscom, under which the money owing to him by the bank had been attached and the interview which then took place proceeded throughout upon the practical concession that the president of the bank understood the written notice to refer to the plaintiff\u2019s check and its proceeds, \u25a0which had been collected by it and placed to the credit of Branscom.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">It further appeared that the attachment proceedings were discontinued November 8, before the check in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>-of Conrow Brothers for this sum of money had been paid over to them hy the bank, and that the payment was followed by a consultation with the counsel, who advised that \u25a0such payment might safely be made. From this evidence the fact, very clearly appears that the president did understand that the written notice, as well as that contained in the verbal conversation, was intended to relate to the money paid out on this check, and that it was so paid to Con-row Brothers, in disregard of the notice which had been given informing the bank of the rights of the plaintiff, and having made the payment in that manner the bank cannot legally claim to be shielded from the consequences of its unauthorized act.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The cases of \u00c6tna Bank <em>v. </em>Fourth National Bank (46 N. Y. 82) and Justh <em>v. </em>National Bank of Com. (56 <em>Id. </em>478) do not protect the bank in making this payment of the money. In the first of these cases no question bearing any relation to this disposition of the money arose. It is no more than a decision concerning the effect of certifying a \u25a0check, while in the latter case the money was paid out in good faith, which protected the bank on account of that circumstance not appearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Neither did the attachment proceeding afford the bank \u2022any legal reason for paying out this money after it had been advised of the claim or right of the plaintiff. For as that was issued against Branscom alone, no more could be \u25a0seized under it than his right or interest in the money in \u25a0controversy, and that was subordinate to the legal right of the plaintiff to reclaim it upon the discovery of the fraud \u2022.and forgery and the election to rescind their agreement with Branscom. But it was not pretended and could not have been, that the attachment afforded any protection to the bank, for it had in fact been withdrawn as well as the levy under it, and the money was paid over in compliance with the check of Branscom, who had in this manner fraudulently received the. plaintiff\u2019s check, and that in this state of the facts it had the right to disaffirm its transactions with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Brauscom and follow the money and reclaim it, so far as its-identity could be traced, has been reasonably well settled by the cases of Newton <em>v. </em>Porter, 69 <em>N. Y. </em>133, and Dows <em>v. </em>Kidder, 84 <em>Id. </em>121.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">That this was the identical money produced \"by the plaintiff\u2019s check, is established by the fact that it was the last deposit in Branscom\u2019s account, and this balance of it remained unpaid to him. The checks or drafts, previously made by him upon his account were, as a matter of legal presumption, first paid out of the preceding deposits, and the residue only not so paid, were then paid from so much of the last deposit as became necessary to meet their amounts.'</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">This presumption applies where no intervening circum.stance is made to appear justifying its exclusion, and there is no such circumstance in this case, for the account was kept generally as a debtor and creditor account in favor of Branscom, placing to his credit his deposits and charging against them the checks drawn by him in the order in which they were so drawn. And when that is the case, the presumption already mentioned applies\u2014that the checks are-paid in the order in which they are drawn, out of the earlier, instead of the later deposits of money. Pennell <em>v. </em>Deffell, 4 <em>De Gex, M. &amp; G. </em>372, 384, following the rule in Clayton\u2019s case, 1 <em>Merrivale, </em>572, 608, and this has been farther sanctioned by the case of Knatchbull <em>v. </em>Hallett,. <em>Law Rep. </em>13 <em>Ch. Div. </em>696, and Dowes <em>v. </em>Kidder <em>(supra) </em>may not improperly be said to support the application of the same principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The bank, however, may still escape liability if the-fund parted with in this manner shall be recovered from the other defendants. For the object of the action is to follow and recover the fund as the equitable property of the plaintiff. The defendants Conrow received it in a manner charging them with notice of the plaintiff\u2019s right to the money. If that had not been the fact, then under the authority of Stephens v. Board of Education (79 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>183,) the plaintiff would have no remedy over against them, for receiving such money in good faith upon a precedent indebtedness, will entitle the party receiving it to hold it. But before it was in this manner received, notice was given to Henry Parsons, who was the attorney and counsel for the Conrows, that the plaintiff claimed to be entitled to this money, as the proceeds of the check obtained from, them in the manner already stated. Before this conversation took place, they had employed Parsons to prosecute their demand against Branscom, and he had issued an attachment under which the seizure of the deposit was made. For that attachment was issued on November \u20223rd, and on the fifth of the same month, Mr. Bowman testified that he stated to Parsons that the money in the bank was the plaintiff\u2019s money, obtained through fraud, and claimed .that neither Mr. Conrow nor Branscom, nor any one else, had title to it. After this conversation, as well as the preceding conversation between Bowman and one of the defendants, it can not very well be assumed to be the fact that these defendants received the money in good faith. The evidence is adverse to that presumption, leading directly to the conclusion that when they received it on November 8th, it was subject to this notice given to their attorney and counsel, that it was the money of the plaintiff and not of Branscom, and that the notice is entitled to have that weight and effect in the case, seems to be sustained by what was held in Village of Port Jervis v. First National Bank, 96 <em>N. Y. </em>550, 558, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">At the close of the proof, an application was made by the counsel for the Conrow Brothers, for a direction that the plaintiff should elect which of the defendants it would claim to hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">This was objected to by the plaintiff, but the court nevertheless required the election to be made, and to that ruling the plaintiff excepted, and under it the election was made to proceed against the bank, and the complaint was dismissed as to the Conrow Brothers. There was no founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tion for such an application. The case proceeded upon a. single cause of action, and that was the alleged right of the plaintiff to follow and recover this money from the possession of the party to which it would be traced, and to entitle-it to recover in this action, it was necessary that these-different defendants should be brought before the court,, and the plaintiff had the right to present its case with all of them present in the action, and to be secured such relief against either or both as under the circumstances it might be legally entitled to demand. If \u00bfhat relief could not be-obtained from the Oonrow Brothers, it probably might be against the bank, for paying over this money to them after-receiving information of the plaintiff\u2019s right to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">It had the right also, to claim that the\u00e9e defendants were-primarily liable to it, and the bank liable only \u25a0 in case satisfaction could not be obtained from them, and for the-complete and effectual disposition of the controversy these-persons were all necessary parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The case was erroneously disposed of, and the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to-abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Van Beunt, P. J., and Beady, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Note.\u2014The complaint, omitting formal parts, is inserted here as a useful precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">I. [The incorporation and the partnership were alleged in the usual form.]</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">II. That heretofore, and on or about October 14, 1884, the-plaintiff entered into a contract with defendant Branscom, whereby the plaintiff agreed to sell to said defendant certain merchandise, and also to advance to him the sum of \u00a74,500 upon the faith, of a. certain paper, purporting to be a promissory note, [stating its tenor, ] \u25a0which said note purported to be signed by William Oliver, as Secretary and Treasurer of said Mississippi Mills, a corporation organized in the-State of Mississippi, and which note also purported to be indorsed by the payee named therein, and made payable thereby to the order of the-defendant Branscom; and that on or about the said October 14, 1884, a paper purporting to be the promissory note as above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>described, was duly delivered to the plaintiff by the defendant Branscom, and the plaintiff accepted the same upon the express representation of the said defendant Branscom, that the said paper was a good and valid promissory note, in all respects duly made by or on behalf of the Mississippi Mills, a corporation as aforesaid; that the signature thereto was genuine, and duly authorized by said corporation by its proper officer, and also duly indorsed by the payee named therein; and that the indorsements in writing thereon, purporting to be made by Colonel Ed. Richardson,\" the payee named in the said note, were duly made by the payee so named.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">III. That thereafter, and on or about October 29, 1884, at the request of the said defendant Branscom, and in pursuance of the aforesaid contract, the plaintiff, relying upon the genuineness and validity of the said alleged promissory note, and the indorsements thereon, advanced and delivered <em>to the </em>defendant Brans com, the sum of \u00a74,500, which the defendant Banscom received in pursuance of the said agreement, and solely upon the faith of the validity of the said alleged note, and the genuineness of the signature and indorsements thereon, and not otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">IY. That, as plaintiff is informed and believes, the defendant Branscom deposited the same sum of $4,500 with the defendant, \u00a1National Shoe and Leather Bank, and that said bank received the same money from the said Branscom, and placed it to his credit in an account kept therein with said Branscom under the name of \u201c A. 0. Branscom, Manager,\u201d and that, as plaintiff is further informed and believes, of the said sum of money so deposited, a large portion, and about the sum of $2,925, so remained deposited in the said bank to the credit of the defendant Branscom until \u00a1November 8, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Y. The plaintiff further alleges, upon information and belief, that the above described paper purporting to be a promissory note, with the indorsements thereon, was nota valid promissory note, in that the signature thereto was not the genuine signature .of an officer of the Company styled \u201cMississippi Mills,\u201d nor made by any officer or agent of said company having authority to sign the said note, and that the said note was never issued or delivered by the alleged maker thereof or by any officer or agent thereof, duly authorized for that purpose ; and also that the said paper was never duly endorsed by Col.
