The complaint does not state facts \u25a0sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is not shown to have matured. The parties have agreed distinctly that the possession of funds, and not the possibility of raising funds, should constitute the condition precedent to recovery; and the complaint shows that the defendant has not yet had possession of the funds. There is nothing in the contract obligating the defendant to \u201c avail itself of its resources to procure, receive and collect money,\u201d and to carry on to any extent its corporate objects. To sustain the complaint, however, it is necessary to hold such an \u25a0obligation implied by a contract which is not ambiguous, but which distinctly and positively declares, that before the plaintiff can claim payment of more than ten dollars per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>week, the company must have actual possession of <em>money. </em>not dioses in action. It will be borne in mind that he is not. suing for the weekly stipend, but for the percentage which, under the contract, he would be entitled to when the company had' the funds in its treasury, etc. The courts have-frequently recognized the binding force of tllese conditional1 promises (Scouton <em>v. </em>Eislord, <em>7 Johns. </em>36; Wakeman <em>v. </em>Sherman, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>85, 90; Thompson <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 <em>Den.. </em>327; Wilson <em>v. </em>Gould, 21 <em>Hun, </em>446).</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-5\">II. There was error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion, for non-suit, and in granting the motion to direct a verdict, and the exceptions to those rulings were well taken. There was no evidence to show that the defendant had in its-treasury, or could \u201c raise \u201d funds to meet the plaintiff\u2019s claim,, even if the contract in suit could be so construed as to impose on the defendant any obligation to \u201c avail itself of its resources,\u201d etc.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-7\"><em>Howard R. Bayne, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arq\">I. The uncontradicted evidence of the plaintiff showed the defendant had money more than sufficient to pay the balance due-plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-8\">II. The final clause in the contract, \u201c it being left to-our judgment to say when that time is,\u201d if it had any operation at all, applied only to the Bridge Tunnel Company and to the time between the date of the contract and the-\u25a0consolidation (La<em>ws </em>1869, Chap. 917, \u00a7 1; 1 <em>Morawetz on Priv. Corps. </em>\u00a7 939; R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Georgia, 98 <em>U. S. </em>359. See also Shields <em>v. </em>Ohio, 95 U. <em>S. </em>319).</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">III. But if the clause in question had <em>a, </em>wider application, it is in any event vain and idle. For if the company had the money to pay plaintiff, the executive committee-were bound to say so. And it would be an idle ceremony for the plaintiff to have them say so. The plaintiff\u2019s rights could not depend upon the willful or negligent ignorance-of the committee, nor upon their mis-statement of the fact-Equity considers that as done which ought to be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>IV. The plaintiff having shown the defendant to be in ample fnnds to pay the balance due, and if the committee had any judgment at all in the premises, which is denied, it having to be exercised in accordance with the fact, a good; cause of action was established, the law intending every form and otherwise dispensing with an idle ceremony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">V. But plaintiff having shown complete performance on his part, and proved facts which in law excused proof of possession of money by defendant sufficient to pay his claim, thereby established an independent cause of action wherein the judgment of the executive committee had no possible operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">VI. Where the fulfillment of a condition precedent has been prevented by the act of the defendant he is estopped from insisting upon proof by plaintiff of such fulfillment. Proof of such prevention of the fulfillment will excuse the omission to establish the fact, and the acts of excuse will be deemed equivalent to fulfillment (3 <em>Add. on Contracts (Amer. L. </em>S.] 798; Gallagher <em>v. </em>Nichols, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>438 ; Risley <em>v. </em>Smith, 64 <em>Id. </em>576, 582; Kingsley <em>v. </em>City of Brooklyn, 78 <em>Id. </em>200; Peck <em>v. </em>U. S., 102 <em>U. S. </em>64; Williams <em>v. </em>Bank of U. S., 2 <em>Pet. </em>96).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">VII. Whatever was in the contemplation of the original1 parties to the contract, to be done by the defendant, wa&amp; adopted and confirmed by the defendant at the consolidation, on assuming the contracts and its benefits (See <em>laws-of </em>1869, chap. 917, \u00a7 5).</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-8\">VIII. If in any respect the complaint, because of the-plaintiff\u2019s ignorance of the facts, was at variance with the proof, it was competent to conform the pleading to the proof. But there being no objection on- this score at the-trial, when it might have been obviated, the judgment, should not be reversed on this account now (Peck <em>v. </em>Goodberlett, 109 <em>N. Y. </em>180).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">IX. The objections to evidence were properly overruled,, as the evidence objected to tended to establish the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tions of the complaint, and bore directly upon issues involved.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"> See note at end of next case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-5\">Van Brunt, P.

Yah Pelt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">\u201c <em>JEmeouime GommitteeP</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">that thereafter the plantiff in pursuance of the agreement obtained consents in writing of property owners of a total assessed value of $224,300 ; that thereafter the Bridge Tunnel Co. was duly consolidated with the South Ferry and South Side Direct Transit Co. and the Tunnel Extension Company, corporations then existing and duly organized under the laws of the State of Hew York, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>defendant then and there became vested with all the privileges, rights and franchises, and assumed and agreed to pay in consideration thereof all the debts and liabilities of said several companies ; that although the plaintiff had performed the contract between himself and the Bridge Tunnel Company, the said company has failed, neglected and refused to avail itself of its resources to receive and collect money due and papable to it, whereby it has resulted that said company has not had money in its treasury to pay in full the money due to plaintiff; that said defendant having under \u25a0the agreement of consolidation acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities was under the same obligation as the said Tunnel Company to the plaintiff, and for the same reasons the defendant has not had in its treasury the amount due to plaintiff for said consents, and the plaintiff demanded judgment for the amount remaining unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The answer of the defendants admits the agreement, the \u2022consolidation, and that it has not got the money, but denies that there has been any neglect either on its part or on the part of the Tunnel Company, or any refusal to avail itself of its resources to receive and collect money due and payable to it, and then alleges that it was expressly stipulated and agreed that whatever might become due to the plaintiff \u25a0should not be paid until the said company actually had the money applicable to such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Upon the trial, the evidence showed that nothing was done by these companies after their consolidation because \u25a0of the failure to obtain the consent of the board of aider-men of Brooklyn, which was necessary for them to prosecute their work. There was also introduced in evidence the articles of incorporation of these companies attached to which was an affidavit in reference to the Bridge Tunnel Company that a certain amount of stock had been subscribed and ten per cent, paid thereon, and the same affidavit in reference to the Tunnel Extension Company and also to the South Ferry ;and South Side and Direct Transit Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">There was no evidence whatever that the defendant ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>had any money in its treasury applicable to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and it is clear from the nature of the complaint and the admissions of the answer that such was the fact, and that such was the understanding of the plaintiff at the time of the commencement of his action, and that his cause of action is because of neglect in not collecting claims which he alleges to have been due to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Under these circumstances the plaintiff cannot avail himself of a condition of affairs which contradicts the admissions-contained in the pleadings. The defendant has a right to-rely upon these admissions and to meet the cause of action only which is alleged in the pleadings. The court cannot make the pleadings conform to the evidence where by so-doing it takes out of the pleadings an allegation which has been made and which has been admitted. The defendant is entitled to that allegation and to the effect of the admission, thereof, and he cannot be deprived of it under the guise of' making the pleadings conform to the proof. Therefore, in, the making out of a cause of action not properly raised by the pleadings, the plaintiff cannot avail himself of the right of the General Term to make the pleadings conform to the-proof in the face of express admissions contained in the-pleadings to the contrary of such conformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The only question therefore is whether a cause of action, of neglect or refusal has been made out. We think the proof totally fails to establish any such cause of action. It appears that the corporation ran against an obstacle early in its career. The officers of the corporation were not bound to go on and continue the business of the corporation after they had met with these difficulties. The plaintiff had made a contract that he would only call for his pay when the corporation had the money, evidently meaning the money applicable to the payment of his claim. He chose to contract in that form. It was the evident understanding of the parties that his claim depended upon the corporation being in funds. There was no obligation on their part to go on with, the objects for which the corporation was organized after it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>had been developed that they were impracticable. The plaintiff, in the making of this contract in the form in which he did, ran this risk; and having ran this risk and the current of events having turned against him, he cannot claim how that although the corporation has not the money, and that it would be a fraud upon its stockholders for the corporation to attempt to continue its work with the certainty \u2022of absolute failure, yet it was bound to do so in order that it might be put in funds out of which he might possibly collect 'his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The citation of authorities to sustain the proposition that where the fulfillment of a condition precedent has been prevented by the act of the defendant, the plaintiff is relieved \u25a0from the necessity of proving such fulfillment in no way \u25a0applies to the case at bar. He took the risk of this corporation having the money, and if for any reason short of an actual intent to defraud it has not got the money, the plaintiff cannot recover by the very terms of his contract. It is possible that the contract was made in view of this anticipated condition of affairs that the corporation might not be able to go on with its enterprise because of its failure to \u2022obtain the consents necessary for its success, and in that \u25a0event it was probably anticipated that.it would not be in funds and consequently could not pay the plaintiff. He took the risk of this and he must abide by his bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Bartlett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
