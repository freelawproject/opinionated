A voluntary association sued by its treasurer \u2022can only verify by the treasurer, and if its pleading is verified by another officer, it must be so done as agent or attorney. \u2022Only domestic corporations can verify by any officer without \u25a0stating reasons why the verification is so made <em>(Code Civ.
