The answer and the finding of fact in the action of Mugent against the present defendant was not competent evidence; the exceptions, to their admission should, therefore, be sustained, and as without this evidence it is conceded that the motion to dismiss should have been granted, the exception to the denial of such motion should likewise be sustained. A findings which is a statement of a fact in a judgment, is deemed to be irrelevant (save in certain admiralty cases) as between a party and a stranger <em>(Stephens' Dig.

There can be no claim or pretense that the defendant here is estopped by her declaration in the former suit, The present plaintiffs\u2019 right had fully matured before that declaration was made, and they have not in any way been affected or prejudiced thereby (Booth <em>v. </em>Powers, 56 <em>N. Y. </em>22). The ground upon which admissions (whether on pleadings in other actions or elsewhere) are admitted in evidence has been lucidly stated by Judge Eakl. \u201c They are received in evidence, because of the great' probability that a person would not\" admit or state anything against himself, or against his own interest, unless it were true \u201d (Cook <em>v. </em>Carr, 44 <em>N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9T\">This action was brought to recover a sum due upon a contract made between the plaintiffs and a co-partnership alleged to have been composed of James T. Keenan, the defendant\u2019s testator, and one Thomas Nugent. The defendant by her answer having denied the co-partner\u2022ship, it became necessary for the plaintiff to prove the same, and the only evidence which was offered to substantiate this allegation of the complaint was a portion of the answer of the present defendant as executrix in an action begun .against her by Nugent, in which she alleged on information and belief that the said Nugent and Keenan were jointly interested in a contract with the department of street -cleaning of the city of New York ; and also a finding by the referee in said action in substantial accord with the allegation in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">This proof was duly objected to ; the objection was overruled, and upon this evidence alone was based the direction \u25a0of the court that the allegation of partnership contained in the complaint in this action was made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In this we think there was error. It is true that admissions in pleadings, in an action between other and different parties, have been received in evidence by the courts. The ground upon which these admissions have been received has been because they were admissions against the interest of. the party making them, and because of the great probability that a party would not admit or state anything against himself or against his own interest unless it was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">And, furthermore, these admissions have been confined to those cases where the admissions contained the assertion of facts which, from the nature of the case if true, must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>been within the knowledge of the party making the admission, and the pleading is verified by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">These rules are laid down in. the case of Cook <em>v. </em>Barr (44 <em>N. </em>Y. 156) and their application is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Therefore an admission contained in pleadings between \u25a0other parties, simply founded upon information and belief, where there is no presumption that the facts alleged or \u2022denied must have been within the knowledge of the party making the allegation or denial, and where the allegation or \u2022denial is not against the interest and the party making the \u25a0same, cannot be i\u2019eceived in evidence as establishing any fact. In the case at bar the alleged admission was not \u00a1against the interest of the defendant, who was asserting a right in respect to a fact as to which there is no presumption that she had any personal knowledge whatever. Therefore the two elements which are necessary to exist in \u25a0order to justify the admission of this allegation of the pleadings are conspicuously absent, and under no rule of evidence \u2022could it be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The admission gains no force from the fact that subsequently the referee in the case ill which the admission was made found the statement to be correct. Neither would it lose any force by the fact of a finding in that action that the \u2022admission or statement was not correct. It is entirely immaterial as to its admissibility in evidence what has become of the action in which the admission has been made. 'Therefore the finding of the referee in the action in which \u25a0the admission was made was entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">It did not conclude the plaintiff in this action and therefore it could not conclude the defendant, because estoppels \u2022must be mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">There seems, therefore, to have been error committed in the receipt of this admission, and also in the receipt of the finding of the referee in the action in which that admiss\\ n was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Notwithstanding the authorities cited upon the part of the plaintiff to sustain the admission of the finding, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>think that, as the parties were different, and as the finding could not have been offered in evidence in favor of the defendant, it may not be used against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered,, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Daniels and Beady, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">NOTE ON ADMISSIONS IN PLEADING.</p>\n<p id=\"AZa\"><em>Two different effects of admissions.] </em>The case in the text,, in connection with the one preceding it, illustrates a distinction\u2014often overlooked by attorneys on the trial of causes, but of much practical importance\u2014between admissions in pleadings considered as defining the issues to be tried, and on the other hand, as evidence competent to go to the jury. In the first of these aspects, an admission in pleading, of a material allegation (cases 18, 19 below), is absolutely conclusive (cases, 1-17, 26) so long as it stands upon the record, and is untraversed (case 20); but may be entirely got rid of by amendment (case 28). In the other aspect, considered as evidence, it is never conclusive, but cannot be got rid of by amendment <em>(AM. Trial Brief, Civil Jury, </em>65).</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">In the first of these aspects, the question whether there is-an admission, and the question of its effect, are always questions for the court; and it is error for the court to give the pleadings to the jury for the purpose of enabling them to-define the issue upon which they are to pass (cases 23, 24).</p>\n<p id=\"A34\">In the second aspect, when the pleading is offered as evidence, its effect as an admission is wholly a question for the-jury, as would be the case with any other writing proved to-have come from the same party, and put in evidence as his: admission ; and after it has been read in evidence the court may, under the rules applicable to giving documents to the-jury, let the jury take out the pleading and give to the admission such weight and effect as they deem it entitled to <em>(AM. Trial Brief, Civil Jury, </em>165).</p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">It follows from these distinctions that, for the first mentioned purpose of defining the- issues, the pleadings are before the court as a part of its own record without offering them in- evidence; and that, for the second purpose, they are not before the jury, nor proper to be considered by them, unless formally offered in evidence like any other documents, and received as evidence by the court. <em>Inconsistent defences]. </em>The rule that matter in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>defence must stand upon its own sufficiency, unaffected by the matter in any other defence, is a sound general principle-even in cases of inconsistency, so called at common law. The common law principle\u2014adopted out of consideration of the inaptitude of a jury for complex issues\u2014which required that so far as possible, pleading should end in a single issue, resulted in the requirement that the matter in avoidance should always be coupled, in legal effect, with a confessionj and hence, at common law, if new matter in defence was consistent with the truth of the declaration, it was regarded as inconsistent with a denial of it; and defendant must choose between interposing a traverse, or a confession and avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"AuU\">But the injustice of this rule was soon apparent under the new procedure; and in this State by express provision of the-Code, and in other States by construction (except in a few where the language of their statute is deemed to prevent it), a defendant may plead inconsistent defences, and may in one defence deny for the purposes of that defence what at the same time he admits in another defence for the purposes of that other (case <em>25). </em>The main object of amending the statute so as expressly to allow inconsistent defences, was to abolish the old rule that an avoidance was not consistent with a denial. The-courts have not, and I do not suppose that they ever will, construe that statute as allowing allegations or allegations and denials absolutely inconsistent, such that if the pleading be verified, one or the other must necessarily constitute perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\"><em>Admissions in separate </em>defences.] For the purposes of\u2019 what is here said, it will be convenient to use the word defence in its most general sense, as including general denials, and counterclaims, as well as new matter in avoidance; for the principle governing the effect of an admission in any one of these separate parts of an answer on matter contained in another separate part, are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"A4M\">It is a familiar rule, that each defence must be complete-in itself. The pleader who desires to dispense with the necessity of reiterating, at length, in a subsequent defence, allegations or denials which he has already made in a previous one, may do so, by expressly saying in the subsequent one, that he refers to and adopts as a part thereof the specified matter in the previous one. But he must put himself on record as doing this. He cannot do it merely by word of mouth. For obvious reasons of convenience, the court will not go oof of one defence in search of matter in some other defence, not referred to in the former, and will not do this at instance of either-party. Hence follows the now settled rule, that the issue raised by one defence, is not modified, either to the help or to-the hurt of the pleader, by an admission or denial contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>in another defence ; that is to say, for instance, if the suffi-eiency of new matter pleaded as a defence necessarily requires a denial of some particular allegation of the complaint, that denial must be contained in that defence, either at length or by express reference ; and if it be omitted there and the allegation be consequently tacitly admitted, in that defence, it does not aid the defence that such a denial is contained in some other defence in the same answer, nor even that there is \u2022a separate general denial in the answer (cases <em>26, </em>27).</p>\n<p id=\"AYU\">If there is an inconsistency in fact and objection is made \u00a1at the trial, the party may elect which fact he will stand upon .and be allowed to withdraw his allegation and admission of the other (case 28).</p>\n<p id=\"A_qN\"><em>Waiver of an admission by going into </em>evidence.] The \u25a0rule above stated as to the conclusive effect of an admission in pleading, as defining the issue to\"be tried, is subject to an important qualification, which supersedes the rule in some eases where the party who might avail himself of an admission refrains from relying upon it. and goes into evidence on the \u00a1subject, as if the admission did not exist. There has been \u25a0considerable difference of opinion upon this subject, but I believe the rule is now well settled, that a party whose allegation is admitted by his adversary\u2019s pleading does not, as matter of law, necessarily exonerate the adversary from the conclusive effect of the admission, either by adducing evidence himself to the contrary of it, or by allowing the adversary to adduce evidence in support of the admitted allegation. Notwithstanding such unresisted reception of evidence, the court may and ordinarily should hold the parties to the trial of the issues which they have presented in the pleadings, and treat \u2022the admission as conclusive ; and may find the fact, or may \u25a0direct a non-suit or a verdict, in accordance with the admission, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the evidence which has been given in the attempt to establish the fact admitted, \u2022or the cogency of the evidence which has been received contrary to the admission (case 29).</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">The most that can be said in support of the idea that going into evidence is a waiver of an admission, is, that in the <em>\u00a1trial court </em>the judge has discretionary power to treat the admission as waived, and to find, or to give his directions to the jury, according to the evidence; and that, if this be done, and the case is afterwards carried up by appeal, it is in the -discretion of the <em>appellate court, </em>in furtherance of justice, to treat the cause as counsel treated it upon the trial and refuse to reverse, because the admission was, by consent, as it were, ignored (case 30).</p>\n<p id=\"AEff\">Of course, where the trial court allows amendment, retract<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ing the admission before the reception of the evidence on that point, and the trial proceeds under the amended pleadings, there is no longer any question of admission in the case. The case of Zimmer against the Brooklyn Sub-railway Company, in the text, admonishes us that an application to conform the pleadings to the proof, by striking out an admission after the evidence has been received, stands upon a different footing from an application to amend before going into evidence, for ordinarily an order conforming the pleadings to the proof, is allowable only as a formality, to make the record represent <em>what has been </em>tried, while amendment before the proof, is a substantial change, intended to mark out the lines of the issue which is to be tried. Hence, as a general rule, a direction to conform the pleadings to the proof by a change in the issue, is not to be given where a substantial admission is thereby retracted, except upon the same terms of allowing the other party to amend or have an adjournment for further preparation, or both, which usually is a condition of allowing amendment before proof.</p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">\n<em>Notes of Gases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACaG\">1.

And a defendant cannot raise an issue which he has closed by admissions in his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"AQh\">2. Conner v. Keese, 105 <em>N. Y. </em>643. Where an answer admits the essential allegations of the complaint, and sets up new matter in avoidance thereof, the affirmative of the issue is with the defendant to sustain his defence; and if he fails to do so, the allegation of the complaint, stands admitted without proof on the part of the plaintiff. (Action by a sheriff on the official bond of one of his deputies. The defence rested solely upon the claim that, a false return, which plaintiff alleged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>deputy had made had not been proved. The allegation of false return 'having been admitted by the answer, judgment reversed.)</p>\n<p id=\"AN9P\">3. Hall v. U. S. Reflector Co., 30 <em>Hun, </em>375 (action to- recover for moneys loaned). The rule is reiterated, that to avoid the possibility of surprise the law requires that each party shall be apprised substantially \u25a0of the ground intended to be relied upon by his adversary in the -course of the trial, when that may take place. And when the pleadings fail to do that, the party chargeable with the failure can derive no advantage from evidence appearing upon the trial, tending to establish the existence of a cause of action or defense not included in his pleadings. [Citing McKyring <em>v. </em>Bull, 10 <em>N. Y. </em>297 ; Laraway v. Perkins, 10 <em>Id. </em>371; Brazill <em>v. </em>Isham, 12 <em>ld. </em>9; Rubber Co. v.

A city in an action to compel specific performance by a purchaser of its contract to-sell lands acquired by it for park purposes, alleged that plaintiff, under the provisions of the statutes, became and still is the owner in fee and possessed of the property in question, and that by an act of the legislature authorizing it, a sale of such lands was made to the defendant.\u2014 <em>Held, </em>that an answer which only denied that the legislative acts therein mentioned were' competent to vest in said city the ownership in fee of the lands therein described, admitted a compliance with the requirements of the statutes by the city, and only raised an issue as to the quantum of the estate which it thus obtained. Judgment affirmed. ,</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">16. Wallach <em>v. </em>Commercial Fire Ins. Co. of N. Y., 12 <em>Daly, </em>387. The answer to a complaint upon a policy of fire insurance, which admits the issue of a policy to the plaintiff, but denies that its terms and provisions are in the complaint \u201c correctly and fully\u201d stated, is-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>neither a general nor a specific denial of the material allegations of the complaint as required by Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 500, but admits the issue-of the policy set forth in the complaint. Exceptions to the omission to-prove the policy are therefore unavailing. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Am3\">17. Millville Manuf. Co. v. Salter, 15 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>305 ; s. c., as Melville Manuf. Co. <em>v. </em>Salter, 21 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>355. In an action-brought to enforce the liability of defendant as the acceptor of a draft or bill of exchange drawn upon him, when the answer, without generally or specifically denying the acceptance of the draft, admits the acceptance of a draft similar to the one set forth in the complaint, but alleges that it was without consideration, such acceptance need not be proved by plaintiff. Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">18. The express admission of an irrelevant fact does not alone let in evidence of it. Crane v. Mayor, etc. of N. Y., 13 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>342.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">19. And the tacit admission of a fact which, though material in the sense of being relevant, is not material in the sense of being essential, does not preclude evidence, as for instance in case of an allegation of partnership, where the pleader can stand equally well on the joint contract without partnership. Oechs v. Cook, 3 <em>Duer, </em>161.</p>\n<p id=\"AdBh\">20. Hurd <em>v. </em>Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph R. R. Co., 18 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>239. The defendant, by his answer, having denied the truthfulness of a concession in the complaint, cannot afterwards avail himself of such concession as an admission. <em>So </em>held, affirming judgment in an action for the price of certain elevators, built by plaintiff under agreement with defendant, which the latter was to accept after completion and pay therefor the value, less the receipts of such elevators ; and the complaint alleged the receipts to have been a certain amount which the answer denied and the proof subsequently showed the receipts to have been less than alleged. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AKt\">21. Plaintiff sued for board furnished to defendant, and defendant denied and set up a counterclaim for board furnished to plaintiff, to-which the latter replied with a denial; and plaintiff furnished a bill of\" particulars containing a charge against defendant for board, and a credit. allowed him for similar service of a less amount. <em>Held, </em>the credit is. not conclusive evidence of legal liability to that amount; for a plaintiff' is not bound to furnish a statement of payments voluntarily credited ;. and it is not the office of a bill of particulars to furnish a defendant -. with facts whereon to found ah affirmative defense in hi\u00a7 behalf.. Hence the admission was amendable, therefore attention should have \u25a0 been called to it at the trial. Case <em>v. </em>Pharis, 106 <em>N. Y. </em>114; s. c., 12: <em>N. East. </em>431; 7 <em>Cent. </em>779.</p>\n<p id=\"AIH\">22. But it is not error to disregard an implied or tacit admission inj <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the pleadings, if the attention of the court was not called to it. Williams <em>v. </em>Hayes, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>58 (see cases below).</p>\n<p id=\"AIg\">4. <em>Duty of the court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ArH\">23. A party has a right to have the jury instructed what are the issues upon the pleadings, and what is admitted therein, so far as necessary for their guidance. McKinney <em>v. </em>Hartman, 4 <em>Iowa, </em>154 (holding it error to refuse, and disapproving the stating to them of a mere general rule of pleading that what is' not denied is admitted, and leaving it to them to apply it).</p>\n<p id=\"AQH\">24. It is for the judge, and not for the jury to ascertain and define fihe issues to be tried. Porter v. Knight, 63 <em>Iowa, </em>365; s. c., 19 <em>Northw. Rep. </em>282; Bryan v. Chicago, etc. Ry. Co., 63 <em>Iowa, </em>365; s. c., 19 <em>Northw. Rep. </em>295 (holding it error to give the jury the pleadings, for \u00a1this purpose, at least without clear instructions as to what the issues \u2019\u00a1were).</p>\n<p id=\"A4a\">5 <em>Inconsistent defences and incomplete defences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANG\">\u202225. A denial of wrongful detention and refusal is not waived, .-and demand and refusal thus admitted, by a separate defence alleging \u2022\u00bftitle in defendant; for a defendant may now plead inconsistent defences. \u25a0 Goodwin <em>v. </em>Wertheimer, 99 <em>N. Y. </em>149.</p>\n<p id=\"AWR\">So it is not inconsistent for \u2019defendant, while resisting the cause of \u00a1action by denying that legal liability can arise under the relations of \u00a1the parties, to interpose a counterclaim of the same nature, in order \u00a1that, if the plaintiff\u2019s claim is allowed, he may, on the principle allowing it, be allowed a reduction- or offset. Case v. Pharis, 106 <em>N. Y. </em>114, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"AFn\">26. Under Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 522, providing that <em>\u201c </em>each material allegation of the complaint not controverted by the answer must for the\u2019 purpose of the action be taken as true,\u201d\u2014if the complaint states a cause of action, and the defendant omits to controvert by answer the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, such omission has the force of a formal admission; nor is the defendant thereafter at liberty on the trial either to deny the existence of the facts constituting the cause of action, or to prove any state of facts inconsistent with such admission. [Citing Tell <em>v. </em>Beyer, 38 N. Y. 161; West v. Am. Exch. B\u2019k, 44 Barb. 175; Marston <em>v. </em>Swett, 66 N. Y. 206, 210; s. c., 23 Am. Rep. 43; Paige <em>v. </em>Willets, 38 N. Y. 28.] Hence the failure of a defendant sued upon a note to deny allegations in the complaint stating an adequate consideration precludes him from availing himself of a defense set up in his answer that the note was usurious. Fleischman <em>v. </em>Stern, 90 <em>N. Y. </em>110; affi\u2019g 24 <em>Hun, </em>265.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>27. The application of this rule, made in the above case to defeat the -defence of usury, because it did not contain a denial of the contract as alleged by plaintiff, has been thought by some inconsistent with the previous case of Newell v. Doty, 33 <em>N. Y. </em>83, 92, where a plea of usury was sustained without any denial; but the decisions seem to be consistent and both correct, when it is noticed that in Newell v. Doty, 'there appears to have been in plaintiff\u2019s complaint no other allegation of consideration than the general one of value received, implied in pleading \u25a0a promissory note; and defendant did not controvert the receiving of value, but alleged that such value was usurious. While in Fleischman v. Stern, plaintiffs specifically alleged a consideration adequate in \u2022amount, and the defence of usury required a denial of consideration in that amount. The rule in Newell v. Doty, is recognized so recently as Lewis v. Barton, 106 <em>N. Y. </em>70.</p>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">28. A party who has pleaded inconsistent causes of action or \u2022defences has a right to elect at the trial which to stand upon, and to amend by striking out the other.</p>\n<p id=\"AZc\">If this be done, the only right which the inconsistency gives the \u2022 adversary is to prove it as evidence of an admission. Breunich <em>v. </em>Weselman, 100 N. <em>Y. </em>609; affi\u2019g 49 <em>Super. Ct. (J. &amp;S.) </em>31 (holding that therefore defendant might elect between them at the trial); s. p., Conway <em>v. </em>Mayor, etc. of N. Y., 8 <em>Daly, </em>306.</p>\n<p id=\"A4R\">29. Potter <em>v. </em>Smith, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>299. In an action of trespass upon lands, the complaint alleged possession and ownership of the locus in quo in plaintiff. The answer alleged in substance that defendant was the owner of lands adjoining the lands of the plaintiff, mentioned and described in the complaint, that he had a right of way across the \u2022said lands of the plaintiff, and that he entered to remove obstructions unlawfully placed thereon. The answer concluded by denying the allegation of the complaint, \u201c except as hereinbefore answered.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the ownership and possession in the plaintiff of the locus in quo were admitted by the pleadings; and that although plaintiff unnecessarily attempted to show possession in fact at the time of the alleged trespass, but failed, and the proof showed title and possession in his wife, yet it was no error for the court to allow him to repose \u25a0upon the admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"AVf\">30. If no objection is made to evidence offered by a party to the contrary of an allegation of his adversary which he has admitted, and the evidence is received, the finding may be according to the evidence irrespective of the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"AY-\">Bryan <em>v. </em>Baldwin, 52 N. <em>Y. </em>232, 234, Grover, J., says: \u201cHad the objection then been made, the plaintiff could have moved to amend his complaint so as to conform to the facts ; but there was no necessity for him to do this so long as no objection was made to the proof.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
