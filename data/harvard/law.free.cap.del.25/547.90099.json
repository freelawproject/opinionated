The court has frequently urged that the cause or causes for divorce, relied upon, be averred in the petition in the exact language of the statute. And that the conditions as to residence as provided by <em>section </em>9 of the act be averred so as to meet fully the requirements of said section. These are vital matters, and there should be no uncertainty in the language employed. There will be none if the <em>cause </em>for divorce and the conditions of <em>residence </em>are alleged in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We regret to say that the averments in this petition are very defective and the petition should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">At this point counsel for the plaintiff asked leave to amend the petition.</p>\n<author id=\"b560-10\">Boyce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGn\">continuing:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Leave will not be granted to amend petitions in divorce cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The petition is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
