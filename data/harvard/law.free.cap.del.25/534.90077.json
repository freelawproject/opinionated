Thus several trespasses \u2014 as assault and battery, false imprisonment and trespasses upon property \u2014 may all be joined. And several trespasses on the case, <em>ex delicto </em>\u2014 as slander, trover, malicious prosecution etc., \u2014 may all be joined. This is so, although they should not all require the same general issue, the test being that they must require the same forms or species of action and have the same judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">A count in trespass for an assault and battery or false imprisonment cannot be joined with trespass on the case, <em>ex </em>delicto\u2014 as malicious prosecution, or any other wrong unaccompanied by force \u2014 notwithstanding these several causes of action require the same general issue; for the reason that they require, at common law, different judgments. <em>Gould\u2019s Pleading, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 79, 82, 83, 84, 87 and 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Counts which might be made the subjects of an action on the case, <em>ex delicto, </em>may be joined with a count in trespass for assault and battery \u2014 as, for instance, a count for the battery or seduction of a servant <em>per quod servitium amisit, </em>if the latter should be stated to have been committed <em>vi et armis. </em>With certain exceptions, as indicated, counts in one species of action cannot be joined with counts in another of distinct natures, requiring different judgments. 1 <em>Chitty, Plead. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 199, 200, 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">The seventh and eighth counts in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00e1re laid in slander and are improperly joined with the other counts in the declaration. The declaration is, therefore, bad for misjoinder. The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Upon the election of the plaintiff under the statute judgment <em>respondeat ouster </em>was entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
