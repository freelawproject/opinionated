P., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>(decided by this court in 1904) 5 <em>Penn. </em>66, 62 <em>Atl. </em>906, the law governing the giving of warning was laid down in the following language: \u201cIt is the duty of a railroad company to give timely and sufficient warning by bell, whistle or otherwise, of the approach of trains, and to run its trains at a rate of speed proper and reasonable under the circumstances, and if the defendant failed to make use of such usual and appropriate means to warn the deceased at the time and place of the accident, it would be negligence on its part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
