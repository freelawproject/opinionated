The defendant below was found guilty by the justice of the charge of \u201chaving in his possession, on January 3, 1911, after the same had been killed, six quail and five rabbits,\u201d and fined fifty-five dollars and costs.

There is variance between the transcript of the suit below and the information filed in this court in that the style of th\u00e9 prosecution in the court below was <em>State v. Alfred L. Ainscow, </em>while the style of the prosecution in the information is <em>\u201cState of Delaware v. Alfred L. Ainscow.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-13\">2. That the act under which the information was filed, <em>Section </em>1, <em>Chapter </em>507, <em>Volume </em>17, <em>Laws of Delaware (Rev. Code </em>(1893) 457) had been repealed by <em>Chapter </em>192, <em>Vol. </em>20, <em>Laws of Delaware, p. </em>241.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-14\">Boyce, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Bz\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">It seems to us that <em>Chaper </em>192, <em>Vol. </em>20, <em>Laws of Delaware </em>(1895), is a complete substitution for <em>Section </em>1, <em>Chapter </em>507, <em>Vol. </em>17 <em>(Rev. Code </em>1893, <em>p. </em>457), down to the words \u201cor any reed-bird,\u201d etc., in said section. By the substitutional act it is provided that \u201cfrom and after the thirty-first day of December, A. D. 1895, it shall be unlawful to hunt, kill, take, or destroy, sell or expose for sale, after the same has been killed any partridge, quail, pheasant or rabbit,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The words \u201cor have in his or her possession,\u201d contained in the former act, between the words \u201csale\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d above, are omitted. Whether the omission was intentional or inadvertent, we express no opinion. It is enough to find this omission. It is our opinion that from and after the last-mentioned date, it has not been and is not now, under said substitutional act, unlawful to have in one\u2019s possession any partridge, quail, pheasant or rabbit after the same has been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The information is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
