It was objected that each is ambiguous and uncertain in that it is impossible to determine from anything therein, whether the plaintiff seeks to recover for direct or consequential injuries; that each charges two separate and distinct causes of action; that none is drawn with sufficient particularity; and that each is insufficient in that mere conclusions of law are stated without sufficient facts to support them.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Av6\"><bracketnum>[1-4]</bracketnum> The first two counts are not open to the objections urged, and the demurrer as to them is overruled.
