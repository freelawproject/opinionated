The respondent filed an answer which ivas, in legal effect, a general demurrer to the relator\u2019s application. So the question before the court was simply a construction of the constitution.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Azj\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Frank N.

And shall not be invested or loaned except on United States or state securities, or registered county bonds of this state; and such funds, with the interest and income thereof, are hereby solemnly pledged for the purposes for which they are granted and set apart, and shall not be transferred to any other fund for other uses.\u201d The respondent, in his answer, denied that the foregoing provision, or any other constitutional or statutory provision, authorizes the investment ordered by the board, and relied upon the construction that the words \u201cstate securities,\u201d as used in the section, included only securities of this state. It seems to us that the phraseology of the section quoted clearly requires a broader construction. By the use of the words, \u201ccounty bonds of this state,\u201d the framers of the constitution clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>expressed themselves as excluding county bonds of any other state, and had they intended the same restriction to apply to the state bonds or securities of other states, it seems clear that they would have similarly , so indicated. The application of the restrictive clause, to one class of securities and its absence from the other appears to be so significant as to leave no room for any other construction. Aside from the phraseology of the section, its purpose and policy would seem to strengthen this conclusion. The exclusion of county bonds of other states from the category of permissible investments for the permanent school fund was, doubtless, inspired by the experience of other investors with securities of that class which, in too many cases, have proved unsafe. The same can not -be said of state bonds where the credit of the entire commonwealth i\u00bb pledged for their redemption, and there is nothing to indicate that the members of the convention had reason to suppose that the state bonds, or securities of other states, would be a less desirable form of investment, as a whole, than those of this state. The language and object of the provision, therefore, indicate that it was not the intention of the constitution\u2019s framers to forbid such investment in the bonds of other states. But if the question were a doubtful one, we would be inclined to resort to the argument <em>\u201cab inconvenienti.\u201d </em>This argument seems to have been given much weight in the case of <em>In re State Warrants, </em>25 Nebr., 659. In that decision the provision that1 the state shall make good any loss to the fund was held to make the state a guarantor, under the constitution, of any warrant that might be purchased., so that the credit of the state was constitutionally pledged, in any event, and there could be no doubt that a warrant of this state, when purchased, would be a \u201cstate security.\u201d We are by no means clear that a mere evidence of indebtedness, such as a state warrant of another state, would be such a \u201cstate security\u201d as the constitution contemplates, but have no doubt that a state bond, which in due form and by its lawful execution, pledges the credit of the commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>is a \u201cstate security.\u201d From information furnished by the state treasurer, we learn that the amount of the permanent school fund is now $5,246,182.46, and the indications are that this amount will increase rather than diminish. On the other hand, the state securities or bonds of this state, because of the limitation imposed by section 1 of article 12 of the constitution, can never exceed, under ordinary circumstances, the sum of $100,000. It is plain that this would afford a very limited outlet for investment of the fund. It could hardly have been intended by the framers of the constitution, who prepared and adopted both of these provisions, that investment in the securities of other states should not be within this limit. In reaching this conclusion, we do not pass upon the advisability of the investment ordered by the board. Over that question we have, of course, no jurisdiction at least in this case. The responsibility of that rests with the board. We have intended simply to express our opinion that the action taken was not forbidden by the state constitution, and that the treasurer is not warranted in refusing to comply with the order on that ground. It. is therefore recommended that the writ be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">C. S. Lobingier,</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">J. S. Kirkpatrick,</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">W. G.
