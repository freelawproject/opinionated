A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the motor vehicle exclusion in the governing policy differs from that in <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 242 (1986) <em>(Marnell), </em>and relieves the insurer of indemnity liability in the present circumstances. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>For purposes of summary judgment the parties stipulated to the following. Patrick Bernier and Julien Caron are owners of property located at 378 Haverhill Street, Lawrence, and \u201cinsureds\u201d under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association (MPIUA). On June 28, 2005, while the policy was in effect, Bernier and Caron negligently served, supplied, or permitted David DiFrancesco, a nonresident minor, to consume alcohol and become intoxicated at the insured premises. While under the influence of that alcohol, DiFrancesco negligently operated a motor vehicle<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that struck another vehicle operated by Malcolm Berry, who sustained serious personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Berry sued Bernier and Caron for his injuries. MPIUA provided Bernier and Caron a defense to Berry\u2019s action, subject to a reservation of its rights under the homeowner\u2019s policy. MPIUA, Berry, Bernier, and Caron then entered into a settlement agreement wherein Berry released Bernier and Caron from further liability and MPIUA agreed to pay Berry differing amounts dependent upon whether it had a duty to indemnify under the homeowner\u2019s policy. MPIUA instituted this action seeking a declaration that it had no such duty to indemnify under that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On cross motions for summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that the motor vehicle exclusion applied and relieved MPIUA of any duty to indemnify the insureds for liability to Berry as social hosts. The judge entered a declaration and judgment in favor of MPIUA, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We begin by noting that the question before us is not whether Bernier and Caron are liable to Berry as social hosts for the personal injuries he sustained as a result of their intoxicated guest\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle. See <em>McGuiggan </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>398 Mass. 152, 162 (1986); <em>Dube </em>v. <em>Lanphear, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 389 (2007). Such liability is conceded for purposes of this case. Rather, the question is whether Bernier\u2019s and Caron\u2019s home<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>owner\u2019s insurance policy requires their insurer, MPIUA, to indemnify them from liability to Berry as social hosts for his personal injuries arising out of DiFrancesco\u2019s subsequent operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Ordinarily, resolution of MPIUA\u2019s duty to indemnify its insureds would depend on whether (1) the facts and circumstances involved a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and (2) a policy \u201cexclusion\u201d relieves it of that liability. In this case, we need not ponder the question of \u201ccoverage.\u201d The parties agree that the insureds\u2019 service of alcohol to DiFrancesco, combined with DiFrancesco\u2019s subsequent operation of his motor vehicle under the influence of that alcohol so as to cause personal injury to Berry, is a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Accordingly, the insureds have satisfied their burden of proving policy coverage. See <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox Inc., </em>424 Mass. 226, 230 (1997). See also <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. at 244-246 (negligent supervision claim that relates only to activities within the home is separate and distinct theory of recovery from use or operation of motor vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The question that remains is whether MPIUA satisfied its burden of proving the applicability of an exclusion negating coverage. See <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox Inc., supra </em>at 231. MPIUA contends that because Berry\u2019s personal injuries \u201carise out of\u201d DiFrancesco\u2019s use of a motor vehicle, the motor vehicle exclusion relieves it of the indemnity liability that it otherwise would have. MPIUA maintains that the motion judge correctly distinguished <em>Marnell, supra, </em>as not controlling in this case. In <em>Marnell, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court considered whether the motor vehicle exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy relieved the insurer of a duty to defend<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a social host liability claim against the named insureds, Richard and Ellen Marnell. <em>Id. </em>at 241. The claim alleged that they negligently supervised a party held in their home during which their underage son Michael, an unnamed insured, became intoxicated and subsequently drove his motor vehicle negligently, striking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>killing a third party. <em>Ibid. </em>The motor vehicle exclusion in the Marnells\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy provided that \u201c[liability coverages] do not apply to bodily injury or property damage: . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of ... a motor vehicle owned or operated by or rented or loaned <em>to any </em>insuredl<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 242. At the same time, a \u201cseverability of insurance\u201d clause in the policy stated that \u201cThis insurance applies separately <em>to each </em>insured\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Interpreting the motor vehicle exclusion in light of the sever-ability of insurance clause, the court concluded that the insurer owed Richard and Ellen Mamell a duty to defend because the severability of insurance clause \u201capplies separately to each insured,\u201d and the term \u201cinsured\u201d as used in the motor vehicle exclusion referred only to the person claiming coverage under the policy. See <em>id. </em>at 244. Accordingly, since neither of them owned or operated the motor vehicle that struck the deceased, \u201cthe provision excluding coverage for bodily injury arising out of the insured\u2019s ownership or use of a motor vehicle does not preclude Richard and Ellen Mamell from obtaining coverage\u201d in connection with the social host liability tort claim. <em>Id. </em>at 244-245. Significantly, <em>Mamell </em>noted that, \u201cWe agree that without the severability provision a literal reading of the motor vehicle exclusion by itself precludes the Marnells from coverage under the policy because Michael Marnell, an insured, owned and operated the motor vehicle involved in the fatal accident. But the severability of insurance clause makes coverage available to Richard and Ellen Mamell nonetheless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">MPIUA maintains that unlike the motor vehicle exclusion in Marnell, which, read in conjunction with the policy\u2019s \u201csever-ability of insurance\u201d provision, excluded coverage only for an automobile driven by \u201can insured,\u201d the exclusion of the present policy applies to <em>\u201cany </em>person\u201d who operates or uses the motor vehicle. In effect, and as modified by the insurer in light of <em>Marnell, </em>the motor vehicle exclusion establishes a type of personal injury for which homeowner\u2019s insurance policy coverage is categorically excluded: <em>that arising out of the use of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>motor vehicled </em>If the bodily injury in the covered occurrence \u201carises out of\u201d the use of a motor vehicle, the motor vehicle exclusion relieves MPIUA of indemnity liability regardless of whether other covered causes may have contributed to the injury, and the severability of insurance clause on which <em>Mamell </em>turned has no applicability. In the circumstances before us, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The language of the motor vehicle exclusion in this case is different from that in <em>Marnell </em>and its progeny in which the exclusion precluded coverage only when the injury arose out of the ownership or use of a motor vehicle owned or operated by the <em>insured. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 242; <em>Shamban </em>v. <em>Worcester Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 15 (1999) (\u201cUnder <em>Marnell </em>it makes a difference whether the insured who is sued . . . did or did not own the vehicle involved in the accident\u201d); <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Churchwell, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 615 (2003) (result reached in prior cases not based on theory advanced but on fact that vehicle involved not owned or operated by insureds and existence of severability clause). Here, the exclusion relieves the insurer from coverage for injuries arising out of the use of a motor vehicle by <em>any person, </em>rendering irrelevant any severability of insurance clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We discern no ambiguity in the language of the exclusion. As pertinent here, \u201cSection II - Exclusions,\u201d part A of the policy specifically excludes \u201cMotor Vehicle Liability\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>in broad terms.\u00ae Berry\u2019s contention that ambiguity arises from the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>words \u201csuch vehicle\u201d and \u201cany person\u201d in the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle liability\u201d amounts to little more than \u201ca strained attempt to create ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 269 (1996). \u201cSuch vehicle\u201d is not susceptible of ambiguity because the policy makes clear that for purposes of the definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle liability,\u201d the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is defined as a \u201cself-propelled land or amphibious vehicle\u201d without reference to whether it is owned by the insured or anyone else. Likewise, the words \u201cany person\u201d unambiguously extend to \u201cany person,\u201d not merely to a named insured. To conclude otherwise would render the policy definition of \u201cinsured\u201d superfluous, and the various explicit policy references to \u201cinsured(s),\u201d as opposed to others, meaningless. Under the plain, broad, and unambiguous terms of the motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>vehicle exclusion there is no bodily injury liability coverage because Berry\u2019s injuries arise out of the use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We reject Berry\u2019s contention that <em>Jussim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 24, 29-30 (1993), commands a different result. There, the court concluded that a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy covered damages incurred when home heating oil migrated onto the plaintiff homeowners\u2019 property after the oil was negligently spilled at a neighbor\u2019s house notwithstanding a policy exclusion for \u201closs . . . <em>caused by .. . </em>release, discharge or dispersal of contaminants or pollutants\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 26. Unlike <em>Jussim, </em>this is not a first-party liability insurance case where a policy holder seeks recovery for loss to his property arising from a \u201cchain of causation,\u201d and where the policy expressly covers losses caused by the negligence of a third party but excludes events that are not the cause of the loss. See <em>id. </em>at 30 (\u201cwhere the excluded event is not the cause of the loss, but rather the <em>result </em>of a covered risk, the insured may recover\u201d). Rather, at issue here is third-party coverage under Bernier\u2019s and Caron\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy for their liability to Berry as social hosts arising out of DiFrancesco\u2019s subsequent use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The underpinning of <em>Jussim </em>and its application of \u201cchain of causation\u201d analysis is usually confined to first-party insurance cases where causation is at issue and not to third-party policy coverages. See <em>id. </em>at 27-29. See also <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hall Equip., Inc., </em>73 F. Supp. 2d 83, 92 (D. Mass. 1999), citing <em>United States Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>49 F.3d 786 (1st Cir. 1995). The distinction is especially important when, as here, the question whether Berry\u2019s loss was \u201ccaused by\u201d the service of alcohol to DiFrancesco, by DiFrancesco\u2019s negligent operation of a motor vehicle, or both in combination is irrelevant for purposes of policy interpretation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the terms of the exclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the operative question is whether Berry\u2019s injuries \u201carise out of\u201d the use of a motor vehicle. See <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 457 (1999) (\u201cphrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 must be read expansively, incorporating a greater range of causation than that encompassed by proximate cause under tort law\u201d). The exclusion for personal injuries \u201carising out of\u201d the use of a motor vehicle eliminates the significance of other causal elements and renders irrelevant the \u201cchain of causation\u201d analysis. See <em>ibid.; American Home Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>First Specialty Ins. Co., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6 (2008) (\u201cThat other causes for an injury also may exist does not preclude a determination that the injury arises out of activities excluded from coverage under the policy\u201d). Berry\u2019s injuries arise out of the use of a motor vehicle such that the motor vehicle exclusion relieves MPIUA of a duty to indemnify the insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> Although as discussed <em>infra, </em>the applicability of the motor vehicle exclusion no longer turns on whether an insured owns or operates the vehicle, neither Bernier nor Caron owned or controlled the motor vehicle operated by DiFrancesco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Although the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, see <em>Siebe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Louis M. Gerson Co., </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 544, 553 (2009), our decision does not turn on that distinction. As noted, MPIUA defended the insureds against Berry\u2019s claim for personal injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">3It was undisputed in <em>Marnell </em>that Michael owned and operated the motor vehicle involved in the fatal accident. See <em>Marnell, supra </em>at 242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Indeed, in argument before us, MPIUA conceded that were DiFrancesco to have struck Berry and caused him injury while operating a bicycle rather than a motor vehicle, it would be required to indemnify the insureds. The motor vehicle exclusion would be inapplicable because Berry\u2019s injuries would have arisen out of DiFrancesco\u2019s use of a bicycle rather than an excluded motor vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In pertinent part, the policy defines \u201cMotor Vehicle Liability\u201d as \u201cLiability for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 <em>arising out of' </em>the operation or use of a motor vehicle \u201cby any person\u201d (emphasis supplied).
