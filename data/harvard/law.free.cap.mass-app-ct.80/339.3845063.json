The truck, owned by the defendant, sustained severe front-end damage. Officers responding to the crash located the defendant about one-half mile from the scene of the accident. The defendant smelled of alcohol, was staggering, and was bleeding from his head and elbow. Criminal charges ensued. Following a four-day jury trial in Superior Court, where the defendant disputed that he was the driver of the vehicle, he was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI) in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), and leaving the scene after an accident in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(2)(o).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He now appeals, claiming that the admission of certain testimony involving deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing violated his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He also challenges the denials of his motions to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test and statements he made to police officers prior to his arrest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\"><em>Discussion. A. Confrontation clause. </em>The testimony of a police officer and a chemist employed by the State police crime laboratory (lab) established that samples taken from the defendant\u2019s truck for testing by the lab\u2019s DNA unit included the following: a cutting from a blood-stained area of the deployed driver\u2019s-side airbag; cotton swabs of other areas of the airbag; a swab of blood from the driver\u2019s-side interior door panel; and a swab of an area of blood, hair, and skin found on the interior side of the windshield. Later at trial, Brian Cunningham, a supervisor in the lab\u2019s DNA unit, testified as an expert witness for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cunningham explained the science behind DNA analysis, and how he used the results of lab tests performed on the DNA samples by Elizabeth Lewandowski, a nontestifying analyst,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to conduct his own statistical analysis. He testified that the windshield swab and airbag cutting contained DNA from a single individual having a DNA profile that matched the defendant\u2019s profile (which was derived from a known saliva sample). Cunningham indicated that on the swabs of other areas of the airbag and of the door panel, there was a mixture of DNA from more than one individual source, but the \u201cmajor\u201d DNA profile<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *found in these samples matched the defendant\u2019s. Cunningham offered his expert opinion about the extremely low mathematical likelihood that DNA from someone other than the defendant would match this DNA profile.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Cunningham testified as to the numerical details of the laboratory analysis, these details and others from Lewandowski\u2019s lab report were also presented to the jury in the form of charts.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The defendant argues that in light of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), and <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011), the introduction of the DNA test results through a lab supervisor, rather than the analyst who performed the tests, violated his confrontation clause rights. Cunningham\u2019s expert testimony and the DNA charts require distinct legal treatment, and thus are discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>1. <em>Cunningham\u2019s expert testimony. </em>In <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2531-2532, the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits the introduction at trial of a forensic laboratory report (there, certificates of drug analysis) that was created specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding and is unaccompanied by an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the report. In <em>Bullcoming, </em>addressing \u201csurrogate\u201d testimony as to a test of a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level, the Court elaborated further that the confrontation clause did not permit \u201cthe prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification \u2014 made for the purpose of proving a particular fact \u2014 through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification. . . . The accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.\u201d 131 S. Ct. at 2710. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 2716 (\u201c[T]he State [did not] assert that [the testifying scientist] had any \u2018independent opinion\u2019 concerning [the defendant\u2019s] blood alcohol level\u201d). What <em>Bullcoming </em>did not present was \u201ca case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part). That issue, not addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Bullcoming, </em>is precisely the question presented by the defendant here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That issue has been addressed by the Supreme Judicial Court in cases that have developed rules governing testimony by an expert witness based on that expert\u2019s review of factual findings generated by another, nontestifying analyst. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 780-793 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011) (DNA evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. 207, 235-239 (2010), petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>for cert. filed (U.S. Jan. 28, 2011) (No. 10-8835) (DNA evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. 461, 482-484 (2010) (DNA evidence). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 759-763 (2009) (autopsy report); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taskey, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 792-797 (2011) (DNA evidence). Those cases are controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">An expert may give opinion testimony based on hearsay when the particular hearsay would be independently admissible if presented by the \u201cright witness\u201d or with a proper foundation, and if it is the type of evidence on which experts customarily rely as a basis for opinion testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 784-785; <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 236. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 337 (2002), quoting from <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986). Expert testimony by a laboratory supervisor concerning the statistical probability that another individual\u2019s DNA would match the DNA profile in question does not violate the confrontation clause, even when the opinion is based on test data not properly admitted in evidence. See <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 236. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 387-391 (2008). Such testimony does not violate the Sixth Amendment, in part because the expert witness is subject to cross-examination about his opinion as well as \u201cthe risk of evidence being mishandled or mislabeled, or of data being fabricated or manipulated, and as to whether the expert\u2019s opinion is vulnerable to these risks.\u201d <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">At trial, Cunningham expressed his own expert opinion based on an independent analysis of the data presented to him. This opinion was independently admissible evidence. Although relying on the analysis conducted by another, he was \u201cnot merely act[ing] as a conduit for the opinions of others.\u201d <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 236. See <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. at 760, 763. In addition, defense counsel engaged in a detailed cross-examination of Cunningham, eventually placing significant weight on Cunningham\u2019s expert testimony in his closing argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banville, </em>457 Mass. 530, 541 (2010); <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Taking into consideration precedent and the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine the witness, we conclude that the admission of Cunningham\u2019s expert opinion testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">2. <em>DNA charts. </em>During Cunningham\u2019s direct examination, the Commonwealth displayed for the jury and marked for identification several charts detailing specific DNA test results (generated from an analysis performed by nontestifying analyst Elizabeth Lewandowski that was based on the samples taken from both the motor vehicle and the defendant<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>). In his testimony, Cunningham referenced the charts (which were never admitted into evidence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) and specific numerical figures on the charts assigned by the nontestifying analyst. The Commonwealth concedes correctly that these details were entered in evidence in error and that the admission constitutes a violation of the defendant\u2019s State and Federal constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him. See <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 785 (\u201cOnly the defendant can open the door on cross-examination to testimony regarding the [facts or data forming] the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Because the defendant did not object to the admission of the data on the charts as hearsay at trial, we review the matter under the standard of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. at 394; <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 236.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In examining whether an unpreserved error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>totality of evidence admitted at trial. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 792. The erroneous admission of the evidence did not result in such a risk. The DNA charts and numerical data had little probative value independent of the correctly admitted expert opinion testimony concerning the statistical likelihood of the apparent match. See <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 789 (\u201cEvidence of a match based on currently used testing processes is meaningless without evidence indicating the significance of the match\u201d), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994). See also <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. at 792; <em>McCowen, </em>458 Mass. at 484. In addition, the balance of the admissible evidence overwhelmingly proves the defendant\u2019s operation of the motor vehicle, including Cunningham\u2019s properly admitted opinion testimony, the testimony of multiple officers and several eyewitnesses to the accident, and the defendant\u2019s own statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">It is relevant to note that the defendant relied on the details of the erroneously admitted DNA test data in bolstering the defense that it was possible that another individual operated the car at the time of the crash, based on the multiple DNA profiles recovered from the driver\u2019s side airbag.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. at 238-239. See also <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. at 395-396 (admission of nontestifying medical examiner\u2019s findings during opinion testimony of pathologist was unpreserved error, but evidence was \u201cequally, if not more, important to the defense\u201d and did not create substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice). As such, the erroneous admission of the data does not constitute a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">B. <em>Motions to suppress. </em>The defendant argues that the motion judges erred in denying his two pretrial motions to suppress evidence. \u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact and will not disturb them absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 250 (2009). We make an \u201cindependent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 509 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">1. <em>Statements to police. </em>In his first motion to suppress, the defendant argued that his statements to police officers at the scene of the crash and at the hospital should have been excluded from evidence because they were given while in custody and without the benefit of a Miranda rights warning. An interrogation is custodial, and therefore requires a Miranda warning, when an individual is \u201cdeprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966). In determining whether an individual is in custody, courts must assess how a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have understood the situation, taking into consideration whether the interrogation took place in a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaFleur, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 546, 549 (2003), quoting from <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 445. See generally Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6.18 (3d ed. 2007 &amp; Supp. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The police interrogation of the defendant, both at the scene of the accident and in the hospital, was in accordance with a general fact-finding process. See <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 477. While at the hospital, the defendant was in an unsecured area, surrounded by the general public and various medical professionals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A reasonable person would have understood that he was being held at the hospital by medical personnel for medical purposes, in light of the potential severity of his injuries following the crash. See <em>LaFleur, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. at 550-551. Accordingly, the motion judge\u2019s finding that any questioning was noncustodial was well supported, and the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In addition, the defendant\u2019s remarks and actions on the night of the crash indicate that his statements were voluntary, despite any possible disorientation, injuries, or intoxication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koney, </em>421 Mass. 295, 305 (1995) (defendant\u2019s statements to the police after motor vehicle accident were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>voluntary despite intoxication and alleged shock, because \u201chis mind was rational and his faculties were under control\u201d), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>417 Mass. 60, 65 (1994). Generally, the defendant\u2019s statements following the accident amounted to denials of culpability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus we conclude that the statements were properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">2. <em>Blood test. </em>The defendant also argues that the drawing of a blood sample by Dr. Bridget Lee, an emergency department physician at the hospital to which the defendant was taken following the accident, constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Consequently, he contends, the results of the blood alcohol test on the sample should have been excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution applies only to searches and seizures conducted by or at the direction of the State.\u201d <em>District Attorney for the Plymouth Dist. </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>386 Mass. 218, 220-221 (1982) (neither Fourth Amendment nor art. 14 implicated when the State not involved in private search, \u201ceven when the evidence is subsequently given to the police\u201d). See generally Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 3-3 (2011-2012 ed.). As supportably found by the motion judge, the test here was conducted by Dr. Lee solely for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient, not for law enforcement purposes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the motion judge properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the fifth offense portion of the OUI indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Cunningham testified that his role as a supervisor and chemist involves analyzing forensic evidence processed by the DNA unit, generating DNA reports, overseeing a team of five DNA analysts, assigning casework, assisting his team in resolving problems, testifying in court, and responding to crime scenes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">As her lab supervisor, Cunningham reviewed the procedure and results of the underlying analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Cunningham explained that a \u201cmajor\u201d DNA profile \u201ccomes across [in the testing] consistently at much higher levels than the rest of [the] mixture.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Cunningham testified that the DNA from the airbag cutting matched the defendant\u2019s DNA profile and that the probability of a randomly selected, unrelated individual having a DNA profile also matching was approximately \u201cone in 70.47 quadrillion in the Caucasian population, one in 105.6 quadrillion of the African American population, and one in 11.97 quadrillion of the Hispanic population.\u201d Cunningham indicated that identical probabilities applied with respect to the windshield sample and the \u201cmajor\u201d DNA profile found on the airbag swabs and the door panel swab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We note that on June 28, 2011, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>238 Ill. 2d 125 (2010), cert. granted, 131 S.

According to the Supreme Court\u2019s docket, the question presented in <em>Williams </em>is \u201c[w]hether a state rule of evidence allowing an expert witness to testify about the results of DNA testing performed by non-testifying analysts, where the defendant has no opportunity to confront the actual analysts, violates the Confrontation Clause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The defense cross-examined Cunningham and elicited nearly eleven transcript pages of testimony.
