L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. He appeals, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">The facts are not in dispute. On July 17, 2009, a young woman whom we shall call Ms. Jones<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was employed as a nanny by a Brookline family. That morning, she was walking down Beacon Street in Brookline, pushing a sixteen month old child in a stroller on her way to a coffee shop and then to a nearby park. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>As she neared the coffee shop, two men, one of whom was the defendant, approached her from the opposite direction. As the defendant passed Jones within arm\u2019s reach, he said, \u201cHi, nanny,\u201d grabbed his camouflage trousers, and moved his \u201cprivate area up and down\u201d in a \u201c[v]ery obvious\u201d movement that \u201creflected masturbation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Disturbed by the incident, Jones continued on to the coffee shop and then to the park. The encounter, though, was \u201cnagging\u201d her for the rest of the morning, so when she returned to the Brookline home, she described it to her employer. At the employer\u2019s suggestion, Jones called the police, who came to the house. Upon hearing her account of the incident, they undertook a search for the perpetrator. Aided by Jones\u2019s description of the camouflage pants the perpetrator had been wearing, the police soon found the defendant, whom Jones identified. Arrest, conviction, and this appeal soon followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On appeal, the defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction has two prongs, both of which spring from the language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. In relevant part, that statute, as appearing in St. 2009, c. 27, \u00a7 98, provides that \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex . . . [shall] be punished.\u201d The first prong of the defendant\u2019s argument is that his activity was neither offensive nor disorderly. The second prong rests on his assertion that the evidence only reveals a single act, but given the statutory prohibition of \u201cacts\u201d that accost or annoy, conviction requires proof of at least two. Neither contention is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">As to the first prong of the argument, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct at issue was \u201coffensive and disorderly to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>446 Mass. 778, 781 (2006). An \u201coffensive\u201d act is one that causes \u201cdispleasure, anger or resentment; esp. [one that is] repugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1113 (8th ed. 2004). \u201cDisorderly\u201d acts include those that involve \u201cthreatening . . . behavior.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 232 (2001). The threat need not involve physical contact, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePore, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 548-549 (1996) (voyeurism), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and \u201c[s]exually explicit language, when directed at particular individuals in settings in which such communications are inappropriate and likely to cause severe distress, may be inherently threatening.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, supra </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Given those well-established guidelines, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct was offensive and disorderly. Within reaching distance of Jones, the defendant drew attention to himself by saying, \u201cHi, nanny,\u201d while grabbing the genital area of his pants and moving his hand up and down, mimicking masturbation. Surely a fact finder could conclude that conduct of that sort is \u201crepugnant to the prevailing sense of what is decent or moral.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cahill, supra. </em>Moreover, the conduct fairly bristled with menace. A stranger\u2019s unbidden suggestion of sexual activity is inherently menacing, for it invades a very private zone. The defendant delivered his suggestion in person and at close quarters. He did so in the company of another man, also a stranger to Jones. And a fact finder would be entirely warranted in concluding that Jones\u2019s sense of vulnerability was enhanced by the presence of her young charge in the stroller she was pushing. There was, in sum, ample evidence to support a finding that the defendant had engaged in threatening behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The defendant\u2019s second argument is that the evidence shows only a single act, and conviction requires proof of \u201coffensive and disorderly <em>acts </em>or language.\u201d He supports his contention not only by pointing to the statutory language but also by relying on the District Court\u2019s model jury instruction, which states that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that the defendant committed two or more disorderly acts.\u201d Instruction 6.600, Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We acknowledge the thoughtful statutory analysis typically underlying the model instructions, but in the end, we come at the interpretive process afresh. See, e.g., <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>456 Mass. 463, 467 (2010). In so doing, we start with the words of the statute, for they are the best indication of its meaning and purpose. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Marlene, </em>443 Mass. 494, 497-498 (2005). In construing those words, accepted canons of construction play an important role.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Many such canons are codified in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1967, c. 867, \u00a7 1, a statute that requires their use unless to do so \u201cwould involve a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the law-making body or repugnant to the context of the same statute.\u201d Of most relevance here is G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Fourth, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 170, the pertinent portion of which says that \u201c[w]ords importing the singular number may extend and be applied to several persons or things, [and] words importing the plural number may include the singular.\u201d The statutory canon has been applied in civil and criminal contexts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tsouprakakis, </em>267 Mass. 496, 501 (1929); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 49 (1975); <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 561-563 (2001). Applying that canon to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, provides an ample basis for applying the statute to a single act.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Comparison of the manner in which the Legislature has handled a similar subject in other statutes also is instructive. See, e.g., <em>Lavecchia </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>441 Mass. 240, 245-246 (2004). The word \u201cacts\u201d appears in several criminal statutes. See, e.g., G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4C (sexual abuse of minors); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13L (wanton or reckless behavior creating risk of injury to a child); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (aggravated rape); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22B (aggravated rape of a child); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 45 (community parole supervision for certain criminal offenses); G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 2 (corrupt gifts); G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 26 (resorting to restaurants or taverns for immoral purposes). When the Legislature intended application of the word only in its plural form, however, it has used modifiers to drive the point home. See, e.g., G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43, as appearing in St. 2010, c. 92, \u00a7 9 (\u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d required for crime of stalking); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, as appearing in St. 2010, c. 92, \u00a7 10 (\u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d required for crime of harassment); G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 62 (proof of \u201cthree or more distinct acts\u201d required to prove crime of being common receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of stolen goods). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 547-548 (1994) (construing criminal stalking statute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Welch, 444 Mass. 80, 89-90 (2005) (construing criminal harassment statute). The absence of modifiers in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, therefore, suggests that the Legislature did not intend to restrict the statute\u2019s coverage to situations where a defendant engaged in more than one act.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">To the extent doubt remains, we may look to \u201cthe cause of [the statute\u2019s] enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Above all, we must apply the statute in a manner that avoids absurd results. See <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. at 233, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the statute\u2019s primary purpose was to \u201ccriminalize offensive and disorderly conduct or language that has a personal and private, rather than a necessarily public, impact.\u201d Limiting the statute\u2019s application to multiple acts of disorderly conduct bears no conceivable relation to that purpose. Moreover, such a limitation would lead to absurd results. The statute prohibits offensive \u201cacts or language.\u201d Reading it to require proof of multiple acts would mean that one who by a single hand gesture clearly pantomimed an offensive suggestion would be immune from prosecution but a person who verbalized precisely the same suggestion could be prosecuted for doing so. We cannot assume that the Legislature intended any such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Finally, there is legislative history. As noted in the commentary to the District Court\u2019s model jury instruction, the word \u201cacts\u201d was inserted in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, by an amendment adopted in 1983. See St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1. Before the amendment, the singular form of the word had been in place for nearly seventy years following its first appearance in 1914. See St. 1914, c. 743. We do not think that the change was one of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">We reach that conclusion because, except for changing the word \u201cact\u201d to \u201cacts,\u201d the 1983 amendment focused entirely on the subject of prostitution. It added to \u00a7 53 the status crime of being a \u201ccommon street walker\u201d and removed from the statute the word \u201cprostitutes.\u201d In addition, a 1983 amendment added a new statute, i.e., G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, criminalizing the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>accepting or paying money for sexual conduct, or offering to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Substitution of \u201cacts\u201d for \u201cact\u201d had nothing to do with prostitution. Instead, it focused on syntax. Before the amendment, the pertinent language read \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly act or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex . . . .\u201d St. 1959, c. 304, \u00a7 1. The phrase was awkward and would have flowed more naturally had it read \u201cpersons who with an offensive and disorderly act or offensive and disorderly language.\u201d We think that in 1983 the Legislature simply chose a more succinct way to achieve harmonious syntax by changing the word \u201cact\u201d to \u201cacts\u201d so that the phrase read, as it reads today, \u201cpersons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex . . . .\u201d So viewed, the change had no impact on the statute\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">There was, then, sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was offensive and disorderly. The statute applies to the commission of a single act.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-15\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The defendant wisely makes no claim that, as applied to his behavior, the statute is unconstitutionally vague, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 920 (2003), nor does he claim that the statute\u2019s application to his conduct violates his rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 599 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
