L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, in accordance with G.

On appeal, he claims the motions should have been granted, as his due process rights were violated when the appearance of his attorney was struck from each trial. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Background. </em>The relevant facts are as follows. In January, 2009, the department commenced a petition alleging that Rory was in need of care and protection. Later that same year, a petition was commenced as to Rory\u2019s younger brother, Sam. On March 31, 2010, a trial was held as to Rory, at which the father was not present, although his attorney appeared on his behalf. At the beginning of the proceedings, the father\u2019s attorney requested a continuance because her \u201cclient was unable to be here today.\u201d When asked by the judge whether the father was aware of the proceedings, his attorney confirmed that he was. The department\u2019s attorney then stated, \u201cYour honor, I would respectfully move that the appearance of [the father\u2019s attorney] be stricken from this matter. Her client has chosen not to be here.\u201d The judge granted the department\u2019s motion over the attorney\u2019s objection, noting that the father \u201chas chosen not to appear, and we have no idea why, and that seems like an abandonment of the proceedings.\u201d The father\u2019s attorney then added, \u201cfor the record,\u201d that the father had directed her to advocate that his mother (grandmother) be considered as a placement resource for the child. The judge responded that consideration of the grandmother could have been guaranteed if the father had been present in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Shortly thereafter, on April 12, 2010, trial was held as to Sam. The father did not appear in court, but his attorney again appeared on his behalf, requesting a short continuance because the father was aware of the court date and was \u201cin the area.\u201d The department objected and moved to strike the attorney\u2019s appearance due to the father\u2019s absence. The judge allowed the motion and struck the attorney\u2019s appearance over her objection, stating that the attorney had been \u201cplaced in a difficult spot, because it appears that your client has abandoned these proceedings, and perhaps even abandoned the child, and in so doing, having voted with his feet, it is unnecessary for you to be here to contest this matter on his behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">During each trial, the department entered several exhibits, including the affidavit of department social worker Allison Buckley and the court investigator\u2019s report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Buckley also testified at each trial. At the end of the proceedings, the father\u2019s parental rights were terminated as to each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On September 24, 2010, through a new attorney (hearing attorney), the father filed Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motions for relief from the decrees and for new trials as to both children. A consolidated hearing on the motions was held on September 30, 2010, at which the father\u2019s trial attorney, Buckley, and the father testified. The father\u2019s trial attorney testified that, in the weeks leading up to the trials, she was in communication with the father and received specific instructions from him about how to proceed at the trial in regard to Rory. In fact, she received a communication from him on March 30, 2010, the day before the first trial. She also confirmed that during her representation she and the father had discussed his case involving Sam. On cross-examination, the attorney acknowledged that some of her communications with the father were through text messages, including the March 30 communication. She also noted that she did not have any further direct communication with the father during the time between the trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The father testified that the reason he did not appear at the two trial dates was because there were warrants out for his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>related to an incident that had occurred with the children\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Buckley stated in her testimony and in an affidavit entered into evidence that, before the March 30 trial, she informed the father by telephone that his rights could be terminated if he did not come to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In his ruling on the father\u2019s motions for relief from judgment, the judge reaffirmed his conclusion that the father had abandoned each of the proceedings \u201cby voluntarily refusing, without justification, to appear at trial (due to his desire to avoid apprehension).\u201d The judge supported his conclusion with the observation that instead of appearing in court, the father \u201cattempted to manipulate the trial process by instructing his attorney to propose the sole strategy of seeking third-party custody of one child.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge further noted that the father\u2019s use of text messaging as a means of communication with his attorney did not constitute participation in the trial and was insufficient to overcome the conclusion that he had abandoned the proceedings. The judge lastly added that were the defendant to prevail, he lacked a meritorious claim or defense and that such a result would negatively affect the substantial rights of the children. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The father claims that his motions for relief from judgment should have been granted pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), as he was denied the right to an attorney at each trial, thus rendering the underlying decrees in each case void. Although we generally review the denial of a rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>377 Mass. 217, 227 (1979), \u201can important exception exists to the principle that a motion for relief from judgment is addressed to the judge\u2019s discretion. If a judgment is void for lack of subject matter or personal jurisdiction, or for failure to conform to the requirements of due process of law, the judge must vacate it. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. 392, 395 (1987); <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>J.A.L., Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 455 (1991).\u201d <em>Wang </em>v. <em>Niakaros, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 166, 169 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cParents have a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining custody of their children, which is protected by the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 Mass. 567, 570 (2005). \u201cState action terminating a parent-child relationship must comport with due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Adoption of Zev, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905 (2009). \u201c [Fundamental fairness, as well as due process concerns, requires that a parent be given the opportunity to rebut adverse allegations concerning his or her child rearing capabilities.\u201d <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>Hampden Div. of the Probate &amp; Family Ct. Dept., </em>457 Mass. 172, 185 (2010), quoting from <em>Duro </em>v. <em>Duro, </em>392 Mass. 574, 580 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Although deprivation of the right to an attorney has not previously been recognized as grounds for granting a motion under mle 60(b)(4), we conclude, based on the facts of this case, that a judgment may be void on that basis. Our courts have repeatedly recognized that an indigent parent is constitutionally entitled to a court-appointed attorney in proceedings that terminate parental rights. See <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>J.K.B., </em>379 Mass. 1, 4 (1979) (\u201c[a]n indigent parent facing the possible loss of a child cannot be said to have a meaningful right to be heard in a contested proceeding without the assistance of counsel. This is particularly so where the State, her adversary, is not only represented by counsel but also has vastly superior resources for investigation and presentation of its case\u201d); <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986); <em>Adoption of Olivia, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 670, 674 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The right to an attorney, however, is not absolute. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Care &amp; Protection of Marina, </em>424 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1997) <em>(Marina), </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that there was no abuse of discretion or error in striking the appearance of the attorney where a parent had failed to appear for numerous sessions, including those regarding dispensing with the parental consent to adoption, and had failed to communicate with either the department or his attorney during that time. In short, the court concluded that no waiver of the right to an attorney need be shown due to \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s apparent absolute abandonment of participation in any remaining termination of parental rights or care and protection proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003. Likewise here, the father\u2019s attorney\u2019s appearance was struck based on the judge\u2019s finding that the father had abandoned the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>We conclude that the circumstances of this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Marina. </em>Here, the father did not absolutely abandon his participation in the trials. As noted by the trial attorney at the hearing on the rule 60(b) motions, the father directly communicated with his attorney via text message the day before the March 31, 2010, trial. Although, as the judge observed, that particular message was limited and brief, we disagree that it did not constitute participation in the trial. Rather, it effectively and directly communicated an instruction from the father to his attorney about how to proceed. Furthermore, the father and his attorney had engaged in regular communications about both children \u201cthe entire time the case was open up until March 31.\u201d Also, unlike in <em>Marina, </em>the father here appeared in court seven times prior to trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Because the father did not abandon the proceedings, his due process rights were violated when the appearance of his attorney was struck from both the March 31, 2010, and April 12, 2010, trials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The underlying decrees were accordingly void under rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The denials of the motions for relief from judgment are reversed, and the decrees terminating the father\u2019s parental rights are vacated. The cases are remanded to the Juvenile Court for new trials consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The mother stipulated to the termination of her parental rights as to both children and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We look to rule 60(b) by analogy and as a cogent standard because the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to proceedings to dispense with consent to adoption. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zelda, </em>26 Mass.
