P\u00e1rente appeals from a Superior Court judgment that upheld the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) that (1) her annual allowance for expenses, (2) her travel per diem allowance, and (3) the taxable value of her State house parking space were properly excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>from her retirement calculations and do not constitute \u201cregular compensation\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts are not in dispute. P\u00e1rente was a member of the Massachusetts General Court, serving as a Massachusetts State representative from February, 1981, through December, 2006. During her service, she was a member of the Massachusetts State employees\u2019 retirement system. P\u00e1rente retired on January 7, 2007. In November, 2006, she applied for her pension benefits with the State retirement board (board). In a letter dated December 4, 2006, P\u00e1rente requested that her \u201ctravel income\u201d be considered \u201cregular compensation\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, and therefore included in her calculation for retirement benefits. Parente\u2019s \u201ctravel income\u201d included (1) an annual allowance for expenses pursuant to G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B (annual allowance); (2) a travel per diem allowance pursuant to G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B (travel per diem allowance); and (3) the taxable value of the parking space provided to her through the bureau of state office buildings. On February 22, 2007, the board met and voted to deny Parente\u2019s request to include the above as regular compensation for retirement purposes. P\u00e1rente timely appealed the board\u2019s decision to CRAB, and CRAB referred the matter to the division of administrative law appeals (DALA) for a hearing. On June 27, 2008, DALA affirmed the board\u2019s decision, and on November 3, 2009, CRAB issued a decision adopting DALA\u2019s conclusion and affirming the board\u2019s decision. Challenging CRAB\u2019s decision, P\u00e1rente filed an action in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. After a hearing, the judge denied Parente\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and affirmed CRAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">On appeal, P\u00e1rente raises three claims: (1) the judge erred in deferring to CRAB\u2019s interpretation of \u201cregular compensation\u201d; (2) \u201cregular compensation\u201d should include Parente\u2019s annual allowance, her travel per diem allowance, and the fair market value of the parking space she was provided; and (3) the judge\u2019s reliance on certain case law and 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03 (2006) was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">2. <em>G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B. </em>In addition to an annual salary, each member of the General Court receives a $7,200 annual allowance for expenses pursuant to G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B, which is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u201cMember\u2019s allowances for expenses, travel, meals and lodging.\u201d The statute states that \u201ceach member shall be entitled to receive $600 on the first day of each session and the first day of each month thereafter until said sum of $7,200 shall have been paid.\u201d G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B, as appearing in St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Section 9B also states that, depending on where a General Court member resides, each member shall be paid a per diem allowance for \u201cmileage, meals and lodging.\u201d <em>Id., </em>as appearing in St. 1979, c. 686, \u00a7 2. The amount of the travel per diem allowance, which is paid in addition to the $7,200 annual allowance, is based on how many miles the member must travel to Boston. For example, a State representative living in the town of Belmont may receive a travel per diem allowance of $10 per day, while someone living in Milford (where P\u00e1rente resided during the period in question) may receive an allowance of $26 per day. A General Court member is eligible for this allowance regardless of whether the General Court is in session, as long as it is \u201cin the performance of his official duties\u201d and \u201cupon certification to the state treasurer that he was present at the state house.\u201d G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B, inserted by St. 1979, c. 686, \u00a7 2. Unlike the $7,200 annual allowance, the travel per diem allowance is not automatically received by a member. In order to receive this allowance, a State member must complete a \u201cPer Diem Request Form\u201d and attest, under pains and penalties of perjury, that the request is in compliance with G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Each State representative is also provided a space in which to park while they are working in the State house. P\u00e1rente was given such a space. Her parking space was given an estimated annual fair market value of $1,560.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>P\u00e1rente claims that the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, is broad enough to encompass the annual allowance, the travel per diem allowance, and the taxable value of her parking space at the State house. The board, DALA, CRAB, and the judge concluded that it is not. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, we are required to give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency [CRAB], as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d We \u201cwill reverse only if [CRAB\u2019s] decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>was based on an erroneous interpretation of law or is unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 455 (2010), citing <em>Foresta </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>453 Mass. 669, 676 (2009). P\u00e1rente argues that the judge erred in giving deference to CRAB\u2019s statutory interpretation, because that interpretation was incorrect. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\u201cWhere an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable, the court should not supplant it with its own judgment.\u201d <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>441 Mass. 78, 82 (2004). Upon review, there is nothing in the record or case law to indicate that CRAB\u2019s interpretation of \u201cregular compensation\u201d is unreasonable. For the reasons discussed in the sections below, the judge properly gave deference, not abdication as P\u00e1rente suggests, to CRAB\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">a. <em>\u201cRegular </em>compensation.\u201d Section 1 of G. L. c. 32, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 681, defines, in relevant part, \u201cregular compensation,\u201d for any period subsequent to December 31, 1945,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as \u201cthe salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form, lawfully determined <em>for the individual service of the employee by the employing authority, </em>not including bonus, overtime, severance pay for any and all unused sick leave, early retirement incentives, or any other payments made as a result of giving notice of retirement\u201d (emphasis supplied). By regulation, the public employee retirement administration commission, which promulgated regulations regarding the State retirement system, has further defined \u201cregular compensation\u201d as a payment that must \u201cbe made as remuneration for services actually rendered.\u201d 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03(l)(a)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">(i) <em>$7,200 annual allowance under G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B. </em>Section 9B of G. L. c. 3 permits each member of the General Court to receive $7,200 annually for \u201cexpenses.\u201d P\u00e1rente claims that in light of the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>447 Mass. 651 (2006), this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>annual allowance must be considered part of her \u201cregular compensation\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, and therefore must be included in her retirement calculation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In <em>Bulger, </em>the plaintiff was a university president who received a monthly housing allowance as part of his compensation package.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. \u201cBulger received his housing allowance as part of his regular paycheck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. The Supreme Judicial Court rejected CRAB\u2019s refusal to include that monthly allowance in Bulger\u2019s retirement calculations. <em>Id. </em>at 658-660. In so holding, the court found it compelling that the payments were \u201crecurrent,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201cordinary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658. P\u00e1rente focuses her argument on these factors, but our analysis is not so confined. In <em>Bulger, </em>the court also found compelling that the university\u2019s board of trustees, and Bulger himself, knew that these monthly allowances were not being used, nor were they really intended to be used, for housing expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 658-659. In fact, the trustees knew Bulger would continue to reside at his house in the South Boston section of Boston, and \u201cfelt at that time that Bulger had done an outstanding job as university president and considered Bulger\u2019s acceptance of a housing allowance as an important enhancement of his compensation package that would motivate his interest in the presidency for an additional five-year term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658-659.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">P\u00e1rente argues that the $7,200 annual allowance, split into monthly payments, makes this allowance \u201crecurrent,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d and therefore makes it \u201cregular compensation.\u201d Although we do not disagree that the annual allowance may be recurrent, regular, and ordinary, these reasons alone do not require us to deem it \u201cregular compensation\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. While the fact that a payment is recurrent, regular, and ordinary is important in determining whether it qualifies as regular compensation, the analysis does not end there. The payment in question not only must meet these requirements, but also must \u201ccomport with the other requirements of \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658. Even though \u00a7 1 does state \u201cother compensation in whatever form,\u201d the statute further qualifies that the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>must be for \u201cindividual <em>service </em>of the employee by the employing authority\u201d (emphasis supplied). In fact, G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B, as appearing in St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 10, specifically states that \u201c[e]ach member of the general court shall receive $7,200 annually for <em>expenses </em>to be paid as follows\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">P\u00e1rente claims that the annual allowance is not required to be used for the stated reasons, i.e., expenses. In order to be considered regular compensation, however, the annual allowance would need to have been given in exchange for the service P\u00e1rente provided during her time as a State representative. While P\u00e1rente was not required to turn in receipts or proof of expenses to receive the annual allowance, this does not mean there was no requirement that the allowance be used for the stated reasons. The annual allowance was implemented because of the recognition that General Court members often have more expenses than those in private industry (due to the fact they often live outside the city of Boston). The annual allowance was developed so that members did not have to pay for those expenses out of their salary. Simply because P\u00e1rente did not have to prove that she had any expenses in order to receive the annual allowance does not then mean it was intended to be additional compensation for her services. As CRAB reasonably concluded, this simply could mean that the members of the General Court were placed on an \u201chonor system\u201d when it came to this annual allowance. Here, unlike in <em>Bulger, </em>there is nothing in the record that indicates the \u00a7 9B allowance was not intended to be used for expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Unlike the <em>Bulger </em>housing allowance, we conclude that the annual allowance is more closely analogous to the personal use of a city-provided automobile as in <em>Pelonzi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Beverly, </em>451 Mass. 475 (2008), and the \u201cuniform allowance\u201d given to State correction officers in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (2010). In <em>Pelonzi, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Beverly\u2019s former commissioner of public safety requested the value of his personal use from a city-provided automobile be included as regular compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. <em>Pelonzi, supra </em>at 476. Pelonzi\u2019s \u201cemployment agreement with the city expressly required that he be \u2018on-call\u2019 for emergency response at all times . . . [and] it appears that the city contemplated the automobile as a tool, or piece of equipment, that would enable [Pelonzi] to perform his job more effectively. Although the characterization in an employment agreement does not determine, as matter of law, whether a job benefit falls within the scope of \u2018regular compensation,\u2019 the language of a particular employment agreement may be relevant ... to demonstrate mutual expectations of an employer and employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On appeal, Pelonzi, like P\u00e1rente does here, likened his circumstances to those in <em>Bulger, </em>in support of an expanded definition of \u201cregular compensation.\u201d To this, the Supreme Judicial Court reiterated that \u201cthe housing allowance payments [in Bulger] were never intended to be used for housing,\u201d whereas the employment agreement between the city and Pelonzi seemed to indicate that the automobile was provided so that Pelonzi could be on call for work at all times. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">While there is no employment agreement in this case, we do have a statute that clearly states each member shall receive $7,200 annually for \u201cexpenses.\u201d \u201cIf a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 431 </em>Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000). To conclude that the Legislature intended the $7,200 annual allowance to be for anything other than what it states (i.e., expenses) would be to ignore the plain and unambiguous language of G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B. \u201cAs always, we interpret the statutory language \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assoc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 719-720 (2002), quoting from <em>O \u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 487-488 (1984). Here, it is plain that the Legislature intended the $7,200 to be for General Court members\u2019 expenses, not additional compensation or wages, even in the broad category of \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>we determined that a correction officer\u2019s annual \u201cuniform allowance\u201d did not constitute \u201cregular compensation\u201d for purposes of determining retirement calculations. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 903, citing <em>Pelonzi, supra </em>at 480. We held that \u201c[a] uniform allowance is not a form of payment, or \u2018other compensation,\u2019 for the services rendered by the employee; rather, it is a benefit offered by the public employer as a matter of convenience so that its employees will be attired in standard and identifiable clothing on the job . . . . The uniform is a \u2018tool\u2019 required to be used by the employees in [that public employer\u2019s] office.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 903. See 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.03(l)(a)(2). The uniform allowance, therefore, was not intended to compensate O\u2019Brien for his \u201cservice\u201d but was given to him to use \u201cin connection with his official duties and job title.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In similar fashion, P\u00e1rente, as a State representative, was not given the $7,200 allowance in exchange for her service in the General Court, but it was provided to assist her in serving the Commonwealth by providing a means to pay for the expenses associated with working as a representative. General Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>members are required to attend sessions in Boston, just as correction officers are required to wear a standard uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">(ii) <em>Per diem payments. </em>In addition to the $7,200 annual allowance, G. L. c. 3, \u00a7 9B, provides for a per diem allowance to each member of the General Court for \u201cmileage, meals and lodging.\u201d Unlike the annual allowance of $7,200, which is uniformly given to all members, the travel per diem allowance is based on where a member resides. Members must fill out a form and sign, under penalties of perjury, that they were at the State house on the day of the requested allowance. For many of the same reasons stated above, this travel per diem allowance is also not \u201cregular compensation\u201d because it is not \u201cfor the individual service of the employee by the employing authority.\u201d G! L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. Nor does <em>Bulger </em>transform the travel per diem allowances into regular compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Section \u00a7 9B states that \u201ca member of the general court who lives in the city or town of . . . Milford . . . shall receive a per diem allowance for mileage, meals and lodging of $26 per day.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9B, as amended through St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 10. To be considered \u201cregular compensation,\u201d the payments must be for the \u201cindividual service\u201d of a member. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. It cannot be gainsaid that travel per diem payments were not made in exchange for the individual services of the members. A General Court member living in Belmont presumably provides similar services as a member living in Amherst. The reason for the differential is the difference in the distance each must travel to Boston, not in the services provided once there.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The combination of the plain language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9B, stating the purpose of the payments, the legislative history, and the fact that members received different travel per diem payments based on their residence (not years of service or any other service-based criteria), take these payments out of the realm of <em>Bulger </em>and into the purview of <em>O\u2019Brien. </em>Unlike Bulger, <em>there </em>is no indication that the intent of the Legislature was anything other than stated. In the report dated April 4, 1974, to the Massachusetts General Court from the advisory board on legislative and constitutional officers\u2019 compensation, it specifically states: \u201c[A] member who lives in the western part of the state carries an undue burden of expense for his personal travel to attend sessions unless there is some reimbursement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the state; and if reimbursement is to be allowed for those members, it would be unfair to other members living closer to the State House if they were not to be compensated at all for their travel.\u201d House Bill No. 5625 (filed Apr. 4, 1974). That report further recommended that a member be given the travel per diem allowance only when actual travel expenses were incurred. Thus, the purpose of the travel per diem payments under \u00a7 9B was to reimburse a member for actual expenses incurred. We do not consider it a persuasive contrary fact that receipts did not need to be submitted in order to receive the travel per diem allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">(iii) <em>The parking space. </em>P\u00e1rente, as well as other members of the General Court, was given access to a parking space to use while working at the State house. P\u00e1rente claims that the fair market value of the parking space should be considered \u201cregular compensation\u201d for purposes of her retirement calculation. The value of the parking space is approximately $1,560 per year. We decline to include this value in the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. As the Supreme Judicial Court recognized in <em>Pelonzi, </em>\u201cregular compensation\u201d is not created when an employer supplies an employee \u201cwith other non-cash job related accessories and benefits (e.g., cellular telephones, personal computers, facsimile machines, <em>parking spaces) </em>to enable their employees to perform their jobs more efficiently, and may authorize the personal use of these benefits as a matter of convenience\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Pelonzi, </em>451 Mass. at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In June, 2009, the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d was amended. See St. 2009, c. 21, \u00a7 2. The new definition, which became effective July 1, 2009, but not applicable here, states that regular compensation \u201cshall be compensation received exclusively as wages by an employee for services performed in the course of employment for his employer.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 2009, c. 21, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In addition, Bulger argued unsuccessfully that monthly payments made by the university to an annuity fund in his name also qualified as \u201cregular compensation,\u201d but that argument has little impact with regard to P\u00e1rente\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In 1953, the special commission established to perform an investigation and study relative to travel and expense allowances for members of the General Court submitted a report recognizing that members of the General Court \u201care subjected to expenses above and beyond the demands made upon the man in private industry, which must come out of their salary. To meet these additional demands and assure the public that its interests are properly represented [the commission] . . . recommended an annual payment of four hundred dollars.\u201d House Bill No. 2491 (filed Mar. 31, 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Parente\u2019s reliance on <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 544 (1997), is misplaced. There, the plaintiffs negotiated agreements for annual \u201clongevity\u201d payments that were to be included in their \u201cregular compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547-548. Here, however, as detailed above, the annual allowance was not for services rendered. P\u00e1rente also incorrectly finds support in <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 429 (2007), where a stipend paid to a group of teachers was treated as \u201cregular compensation\u201d as part of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 430. After the first year, the stipend was to \u201cincrease at the rate of the general salary increase of that year and to continue whether or not the teacher remained in a city-offered [health] plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. Here, however, the $7,200 annual allowance, the per diem travel allowance, and the value of the parking space are not similar to the bargained-for stipend increase in <em>Olsen. </em>As we held in <em>Olsen, </em>the stipend could be compared to the housing allowance in <em>Bulger, </em>because \u201cthe school committee could well have thought that in order to retain teachers who were losing certain benefits, the committee had to provide a more generous compensation package.\u201d <em>Olsen, supra </em>at 435. In the circumstances presented here, the allowances were simply not given to State representatives to provide them greater compensation or to prevent them from leaving their positions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
