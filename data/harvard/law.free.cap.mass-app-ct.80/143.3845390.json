The bone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>contention was Hanratty\u2019s through-the-wall air conditioner, which projected into a yard area to which Newman held an exclusive easement. Over time, Newman repeatedly complained to Hanratty that his air conditioner intruded into her yard and emitted excessive noise, hot air, and vibrations. Hanratty was not receptive to Newman\u2019s complaints, and their interactions became increasingly testy. Eventually, Newman resorted to self-help by sealing the air conditioner with duct tape to make it unusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Hanratty responded by going to court. On June 18, 2007, he filed a pro se complaint against Newman in Superior Court, seeking to restrain her from interfering with his air conditioner and requiring her to stay ten yards away from him and his family. Newman rejoined with a counterclaim demanding damages on theories of nuisance, trespass (on account of the intruding air conditioner), \u201cwilful trespass\u201d (on account of Hanratty\u2019s alleged entry into Newman\u2019s yard without permission in order to take photographs of the air conditioner), and defamation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to damages, Newman also sought an order requiring that the air conditioner be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Hanratty forwarded the counterclaim to his homeowner\u2019s insurer, Citation Insurance Company (Citation), which agreed to provide him with a defense, subject to a reservation of rights. In view of the reservation of rights, Hanratty selected his own counsel, Attorney Michael Fee, to represent him at Citation\u2019s expense;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, Citation was unwilling to pay Attorney Fee\u2019s usual $260 hourly rate. After some back-and-forth, it was agreed that Attorney Fee would bill at the rate of $260, Citation would pay $130 per hour, and Hanratty would retain the right to seek the difference from Citation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In May, 2008, while the underlying action remained pending, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Citation filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Han-ratty and Newman, seeking a determination that its policy did not provide insurance coverage for the claims asserted in Newman\u2019s counterclaim, and, hence, it had no ongoing duty to defend. Hanratty counterclaimed, alleging that Citation was in breach of the insurance contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to pay the full value of his attorney\u2019s services and by failing to defend and indemnify him, and that Citation had violated G. L. cc. 93A and 176D in arriving at its coverage position and in the handling of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">By the fall of 2008, Hanratty and Newman were able to reach an accord in the underlying case. Hanratty removed the offending air conditioner (according to Newman\u2019s brief, he installed central air conditioning), and he and Newman entered into a settlement agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, they exchanged mutual releases, and Hanratty assigned his counterclaim against Citation to Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The declaratory judgment action continued between Citation and Newman, individually and as the assignee of Hanratty\u2019s counterclaim. In June, 2009, a judge of the Superior Court ruled, on cross motions for summary judgment filed by Newman and Citation, that the insurer was not obligated to defend Hanratty. Subsequently, in November, 2009, a second judge of the Superior Court dismissed the Hanratty counterclaim on Citation\u2019s motion and ordered that final judgment enter for Citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Before us is Newman\u2019s appeal from that judgment. She contends that Citation had a duty to defend Hanratty and that she therefore is entitled to certain attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by her and Hanratty in the coverage litigation. She also contends that the Hanratty counterclaim assigned to her should not have been dismissed. We conclude that summary judgment should not have entered for Citation, but that additional issues remain to be decided before the question of its duty to defend can be determined. We also conclude that, because Citation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>not entitled to summary judgment, and the validity of its coverage position remains a live issue, dismissal of the counterclaim was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the judge\u2019s summary judgment rulings de novo, see <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fontneau, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 553, 556 (2007). In performing our review, we are guided by well-established principles governing the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u201c[T]he question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). \u201cThe process is not one of looking at the legal theory enunciated by the pleader but of \u2018envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 7, 12-13 (1989), quoting from <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 147 (1984). Furthermore, in analyzing the potential scope of the complaint, consideration must be given to extrinsic facts known or readily knowable by the insurer, which place liability within the coverage of the policy. See <em>Desrosiers </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>393 Mass. 37, 40 (1984); <em>Boston Symphony Orchestra, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra </em>at 10-11; <em>Dilbert </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 330-331 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In arguing that Citation had a duty to defend Hanratty, Newman relies on only two of the four counts of her counterclaim: the count alleging trespass resulting from the intrusion of the air conditioner into her yard, and the count alleging nuisance resulting from the air conditioner\u2019s operation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The relevant allegations of those counts are that, pursuant to the condominium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>master deed, Newman\u2019s unit comes with an exclusive easement and right to use the yard; the air conditioner trespasses into the yard; and, when the air conditioner is operating, it is \u201cunreasonably noisy,\u201d \u201ccauses vibrations which can be felt on [Newman\u2019s] deck,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cprojects a blast of hot air over [Newman\u2019s] yard area,\u201d and \u201ccreates a substantial and unreasonable interference with [Newman\u2019s] use and enjoyment of her property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADU6\">The Citation policy is a standard form condominium unit owner\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy. The insuring agreement for Section II \u2014 Liability Coverages, provides, in relevant part, that the insurer will defend and indemnify claims \u201cbrought against an \u2018insured\u2019 for damages because of . . . \u2018property damage\u2019 caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 to which this coverage applies.\u201d It is undisputed that this is the only grant of coverage potentially applicable here,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that it is subject to an exclusion for property damage \u201c[w]hich is expected or intended by the \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkA\">The policy defines the term \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in . . . \u2018[property damage.\u2019 \u201d In addition, this particular policy defines \u201c[pjroperty damage\u201d to mean \u201cphysical injury to, destruction of <em>or </em>loss of use of tangible property\u201d (emphasis added). While liability policies can be written so that \u201closs of use\u201d does not, by itself, constitute property damage, it is manifest from the use of the disjunctive that Citation\u2019s policy uses the more typical approach of defining property damage to include the loss of use of physically uninjured tangible property. See generally Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11.1 &amp; n.2 (5th ed. 2007). Citation\u2019s efforts to argue otherwise are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"ACV\">Even though each of the above-quoted policy provisions has potential relevance to the question of coverage, for present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>purposes, the focus is a narrow one. At this juncture, Citation relies upon only one argument \u2014 that Newman\u2019s claims do not allege \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined by the policy. Citation does not waive the other coverage defenses it has asserted in its declaratory judgment complaint, i.e., the absence of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and the applicability of the \u201cexpected or intended\u201d exclusion, but it acknowledges that those defenses are fact-sensitive and not readily resolved on the summary judgment record presented below. More particularly, Citation argues that any possible physical damage or loss of use suffered by Newman affected only an easement. According to Citation, an easement is merely an \u201cintangible\u201d interest in the property of another and, therefore, does not constitute \u201ctangible property\u201d as required by the policy definition of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Although this argument persuaded the motion judge, we reach a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">For purposes of liability insurance coverage, the distinction between tangible and intangible property has been aptly summarized as follows. \u201cTangible property is property that can be touched, or property capable of being possessed. Intangible property is property that does not have intrinsic value, but rather is merely representative or evidence of value, such as a stock certificate or a liquor license\u201d (footnotes omitted). Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11.1, at 11-3-4. There can be no doubt that real property, such as a yard, is tangible property. See <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. at 147 (John Hancock tower deemed \u201ctangible property\u201d). See also <em>A.B.C. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 745, 748 (1995) (real property alleged to have been damaged by insured\u2019s encroachment deemed \u201ctangible property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The question remains whether the nature of Newman\u2019s interest in the yard makes any difference to the analysis. We conclude that it does not. An easement is an interest in real property, albeit one that is nonpossessory. The salient difference between an easement and an estate is only that the holder of an easement does not <em>possess </em>the realty as does an estate owner; rather, the holder may <em>use </em>the land burdened by the easement to the extent defined by its terms. That said, this difference does not mean that an easement is merely an \u201cintangible\u201d interest. As explained in a leading treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cThis distinction [between right of use and right of possession] caused many early courts and commentators to categorize easements as \u2018incorporeal hereditaments,\u2019 that is, nonphysical inheritable rights. See Restatement of Property \u00a7 450 cmt. c. The \u2018incorporeal\u2019 label is ill-advised in that it implies a greater difference between easements and estates in land than in fact exists. <em>As noted, the distinction is nonpossessory/possessory, not nonphysical/physical. All estates, interests, and rights in property are without material substance; each is an abstract concept recognized in the law. It is only the property itself that physically exists.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Bruce &amp; Ely, The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land \u00a7 1.1 n.6 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Viewed in this light, for purposes of deciding whether there has been injury to or loss of use of tangible property, it makes no meaningful difference which abstract legal concept has given rise to the claimant\u2019s rights in real property. Whether the claimant owns, rents, or holds an easement to it, the real property in question remains tangible property. Indeed, the absence of any meaningful distinction is especially evident in this case, where the easement is exclusive and, for functional purposes, essentially indistinguishable from a fee. Because, no less than an estate, Newman\u2019s easement confers rights in property that physically exists, her allegations of injury to or loss of use of the yard are allegations of injury to or loss of use of tangible property as required by the definition of property damage contained in Citation\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Furthermore, there is an additional independent reason for imposing upon Citation a duty to defend Newman\u2019s counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>against Hanratty. At least when viewed in conjunction with extrinsic facts of which Citation was on notice, the counterclaim reasonably should have been understood to encompass a claim by Newman for the loss of use not only of the yard but also of the interior space in her condominium unit. At the inception of the underlying case, Newman filed an affidavit, dated June 21, 2007, in opposition to Hanratty\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. In the course of investigating the claim, as it was obligated to do, Citation knew or reasonably should have known of this affidavit long before filing its declaratory judgment action, and even before it issued its first reservation of rights letter. Among other things, Newman averred: \u201cWhen the air conditioner is operating, I can hear it in my unit. I can feel its vibrations through the floor when I\u2019m on my balcony. When it\u2019s running, it interferes with conversations in my living room, especially if I leave my outside door open for cross-ventilation purposes. In fact, it\u2019s so noisy that I can\u2019t leave my windows and door open (as I would otherwise prefer), and I can hear it over the television.\u201d These elaborations showed that, even apart from her concerns about the yard, Newman\u2019s counterclaim was seeking damages for loss of use of tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Citation\u2019s motion for summary judgment should not have been allowed. That is not to say that the duty to defend issue was required to be resolved against Citation, as Newman urges us to decide. There remain other grounds, not waived by Citation, which remain to be considered before a determination can be made as to its duty to defend. We do agree with Newman, however, that where the erroneous allowance of Citation\u2019s motion for summary judgment supplied the impetus for dismissing the Hanratty counterclaims assigned to her, those counterclaims must be reinstated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The judgment is vacated. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Although the motion judge apparently was under the impression that the trespass claim sought only equitable relief, the prayer in Newman\u2019s counterclaim indicates she also sought damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">It was Hanratty\u2019s option to do so. See <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 406-407 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The insurer\u2019s obligation is to pay the reasonable charges of the insured\u2019s retained counsel. <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut.

In a recent decision of this court, it has been clarified that reasonable charges are to be assessed with reference to market rates; an insurer may not insist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>on paying only the discounted rate it has been able to negotiate with its panel of attorneys. See <em>Northern Sec. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>R.H. Realty Trust, </em>78 Mass.

Here, on the other hand, Newman alleged injury to and loss of use of an existing express easement. Regardless of this distinction, however, to the extent that <em>Kazi </em>turned on the notion that an easement is merely an \u201cintangible\u201d interest, we decline to follow it for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In view of our decision, we need not consider an additional procedural argument made by Newman relating to the service, withdrawal, and reservice of Citation\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
