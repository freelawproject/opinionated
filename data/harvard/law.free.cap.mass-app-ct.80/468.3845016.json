L. c. 79, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as applied to the land taking in question, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the plaintiff, Central Water District Associates (CWDA), with just and reasonable compensation as mandated by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon a motion for summary judgment by the defendant, Cedar Meadow Lake Watershed District (district),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a Superior Court judge determined that CWDA did not meet its initial burden of showing that the statutory interest rate is so low as to render it unconstitutional, and therefore, the judge utilized the statutory interest rate to calculate the interest on CWDA\u2019s jury award. The judge also concluded that CWDA was not entitled to compound interest and ordered that the judgment be entered with simple interest. We affirm the judgment in all respects except in its denial of CWDA\u2019s request for compound interest. On this issue, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts contained in the summary judgment record. On May 30, 1997, the district took by eminent domain approximately 144 acres of land (property) owned by CWDA, located in the towns of Leicester and Spencer. The property encompasses a body of water known as Cedar Meadow Lake. Dissatisfied with the district\u2019s pro tanto payment of $87,200, CWDA brought this action under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 14, for an assessment of damages. As a result of numerous continuances (filed and assented to by both parties), the case remained pending in Superior Court for over a decade. Twelve years after the original complaint was filed (and two weeks before the scheduled trial date), CWDA moved to amend its complaint to add a claim challenging the statutory rate of interest on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Specifically, the amended complaint sought a higher rate of interest than that provided by the statute and requested that the interest be compounded. The motion to amend was allowed over the district\u2019s opposition, which had asserted that the amendment was untimely and prejudicial in that the district was not prepared to present evidence rebutting CWDA\u2019s claim. To avoid any prejudice to the district as a result of the short notice, the judge bifurcated the trial and proceeded first with a jury trial on the issue of damages to be followed, if necessary, with a determination of the proper rate of interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On September 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict that assessed damages for the taking at $1,157,635. Thereafter, in accordance with a predetermined schedule, CWDA submitted a trial memorandum outlining the basis for its claim that the statutory rate of interest set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, when applied to a taking that occurred in 1997 with no payment until 2009, is significantly and unreasonably lower than that which a prudent investor would have earned, and that no \u201cprudent investor\u201d would fail to secure compound interest on a multi-year investment. CWDA also submitted a report prepared by an expert economist, Craig L. Moore, who compared the rates earned on a one-year constant-yield United States Treasury bill (the measure of interest utilized by the statute) with those earned by investing in a portfolio of Moody\u2019s AAA-rated corporate bonds (described in the report as a \u201cvery conservative secure investment vehicle\u201d) during the years 1997 through 2008.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The report showed that during each of the twelve years at issue, the returns earned on the corporate bonds were higher than the rates earned on one-year Treasury bills. Depending on the year, the difference in rates varied between 0.63 percent and 4.39 percent. The report also set forth Moore\u2019s opinion that compound interest, rather than simple interest, would be the appropriate method for calculating damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Against this backdrop, the district filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a judicial determination that the statutory rate was constitutionally sufficient and, therefore, that rate should be applied to the jury award. The motion, which was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>supported by an affidavit from an investment professional, asserted that the district was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because CWDA was unable to satisfy its burden of showing that the statutory interest rate was unreasonable. CWDA opposed the motion, relying on the findings of its expert summarized above. As noted, the judge entered judgment for the district.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the allowance of motions for summary judgment de novo and, in so doing, view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, when a governmental entity \u201ctakes\u201d private property for public use, it must pay \u201cjust\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d compensation for that property. <em>Liberty Square Dev. Trust </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>441 Mass. 605, 611 (2004). Where, as in this case, there is a lapse between the time of the taking and the time of compensation, \u201cthe owner is entitled to interest thereon sufficient to ensure that he is placed in as good a position pecuniarily as he would have occupied if the payment had coincided with the appropriation.\u201d <em>Kirby Forest Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>467 U.S. 1, 10 (1984) (citations omitted). \u201cBecause [interest] is a component of the compensation mandated as a matter of constitutional law, the ultimate determination as to what interest rate will provide adequate compensation for delay in payment is a judicial [rather than a legislative] function.\u201d <em>Liberty Square, supra </em>at 611-612, citing <em>Verrochi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>394 Mass. 633, 638 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Legislature, however, is free to establish a prima facie measure of the proper interest rate to be applied on damage awards in eminent domain cases. <em>Liberty Square, supra. </em>Where the Legislature has done so (as ours has in G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37), the rate it sets is presumptively reasonable. <em>Ibid, </em>(\u201cany rate set by statute enjoys a rebuttable presumption that it is a reasonable rate that would satisfy constitutional requirements\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>according to our case law, a landowner who seeks a higher rate of interest than that provided by statute must clear two separate hurdles. First, the landowner must rebut the presumption of reasonableness by showing that the statutory rate is \u201csignificantly or substantially\u201d below the standard of constitutional reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 612. \u201cIf (and only if)\u201d this threshold burden is met will the question of \u201cwhat rate will represent just and reasonable compensation for the delay in payment\u201d arise. <em>Id. </em>at 613 (delineating a distinct two-step analysis).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Applying these principles (de novo) to the summary judgment record, we arrive at the same conclusion as the judge, that is, CWDA has failed to establish that the rate of interest set by G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 37, fell significantly or substantially below the standard of constitutional reasonableness. Therefore, CWDA failed to rebut the presumption that the statutory rate meets the constitutional requirements. CWDA\u2019s primary argument is that the disparity between the statutory rate and the AAA-rated corporate bond rate cited by their expert demonstrates that the \u201cstatutory rate is so low that it fails to meet the constitutional standard of reasonableness. \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Liberty </em>Square, <em>supra </em>at 612. However, \u201c[tjhe concept of a \u2018reasonable\u2019 interest rate to compensate for delay in payment connotes a range of figures, not one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>precise figure.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>By offering only a single comparator, rather than a range or composite of interest rates based on different types of low-risk securities available (for example, thirty-year Treasury bonds, five-year Treasury notes, six-month bankers\u2019 acceptances, or the prime rate), CWDA has failed to adequately identify what constitutes a constitutionally reasonable rate. Consequently, it has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the statute falls \u201csignificantly or substantially\u201d below that standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because CWDA failed to establish the first prong of the test, we need not determine what rate would \u201crepresent just and reasonable compensation for the delay in payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">We now turn to CWDA\u2019s assertion that it has been denied just and reasonable compensation because the statute does not provide for the compounding of interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The question \u201cwhether the constitutional requirement of just and reasonable compensation mandates the compounding of interest in eminent domain cases\u201d was specifically left open by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Liberty Square. Id. </em>at 611 n.9. Noting the lack of conclusive authority, the judge ultimately rejected CWDA\u2019s argument (asserted largely through its expert) that an award of only simple interest will always be unreasonable because no pmdent investor would choose to let interest income remain \u201cidle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We are persuaded that, given the extended delay between the time of the taking and the time of payment, the compounding of interest is necessary in this case to place CWDA \u201cin as good a position pecuniarily as [it] would have occupied if the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>had coincided with the appropriation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Kirby Forest, </em>467 U.S. at 10. In so holding, we align ourselves with those courts who have recognized in factually similar cases that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201c[t]he economic reality is simply that if the full value of just compensation had been deposited with the Court contemporaneously with the filing of the declaration of taking, the landowner would have been able to earn compound interest. Thus, prohibiting the landowner from recovering compound interest on the deficiency acts to retroactively reduce the value of just compensation at the time of the taking by undervaluing its present worth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>United. States </em>v. <em>319.46 Acres of Land, </em>508 F. Supp. 288, 291 (W.D. Okla. 1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The district\u2019s arguments in favor of simple interest are unavailing. The district contends that using compound interest will \u201cencourag[e] dilatory acts by claimants\u201d and complicate interest adjudications by raising the issue of responsibility for delays. We reject these arguments. First, unexcused delays should not be tolerated by the opposing party or the court. Second, we are confident that our judges have the ability to sort out any \u201ccomplications.\u201d The undeniable fact is that since May 30, 1997, CWDA has been deprived of the opportunity to invest a considerable sum of money over a lengthy period of time. In these circumstances, an award of simple interest is unreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed insofar as it determined the interest on the damages awarded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>plaintiff. A new judgment is to enter with compound interest on the award. The remainder of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-16\">General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 37, provides in relevant part: \u201cWhere the period for which prejudgment interest is owed is more than one year, such interest for the first year shall be calculated in accordance with the preceding sentence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>such interest for each additional year shall be calculated on the principal amount due at an annual rate equal to the weekly average one-year constant maturity treasury yield, as published by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the beginning of each additional year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Under the Fifth Amendment the owner of land taken by the government is entitled to \u201cjust compensation.\u201d Under art. 10, an owner is entitled to \u201creasonable compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The district is a body politic and corporate created by special act of the Massachusetts Legislature on December 1, 1993.

Nor did the complaint include a request for compound interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">It appears that the parties agreed to this procedure, and in any event, because the district did not file a cross appeal, the issue whether the judge erred in allowing CWDA to amend the complaint is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The report is part of the record on summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">At the hearing on its motion for summary judgment, however, the district focused on the judge\u2019s ruling allowing the complaint to be amended and requested that the judge reconsider that decision.

Compare <em>Liberty Square, supra </em>at 613 (\u201c[i]f ... the statutory rate is no longer applicable, . . . it is then up to the judge to determine what interest figure to apply\u201d), with <em>M.B. Claff, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>441 Mass. 596, 600 (2004) (\u201ca claim that the statutory rate of interest is unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff is one that needs to be proved, and a proper articulation in a timely pleading followed by proof at trial is the customary method for establishing a party\u2019s claim\u201d). See also <em>Waltham Telecommunications </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>403 Mass. 747, 749 (1989) (suggesting that \u201cart. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights secures the right to a jury determination of just compensation in eminent domain cases\u201d). Given our conclusion that CWDA has failed to meet its threshold burden of rebutting the presumption that the rate utilized by the statute is reasonable as applied, we need not resolve this ambiguity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">We are unpersuaded by CWDA\u2019s alternative argument that whether the statutory rate falls substantially below what a \u201creasonable\u201d prudent investor would have earned is never appropriately determined as matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In so holding, we acknowledge that CWDA\u2019s report reflects a disparity in excess of four percent in four of the twelve years at issue. Were this disparity shown to be consistent across similar safe investment vehicles, it could be constitutionally significant. In the absence of such data, however, it is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">General Laws c. 79, \u00a7 37, provides that \u201c[w]here the period for which prejudgment interest is owed is more than one year, . . . interest for each additional year shall be calculated <em>on the principal amount due </em>. . . .\u201d (emphasis added). The emphasized language was added to the statute by St. 2004, c. 352, \u00a7 36. The prior versions of the statute did not specifically require simple interest only on the damages award. Historically, \u201c[t]he general rule in equity and law is to allow simple interest by way of damages .... But this general rule is not always followed.
