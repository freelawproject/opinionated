The plaintiff alleged that the mortgage had been discharged under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33, the \u201cObsolete Mortgages\u201d statute, since the mortgage holder had failed to record the mortgage with the registry of deeds as required by the statute. The defendant filed an answer and counterclaim seeking a declaration that the mortgage was \u201cbinding and in effect\u201d as to the plaintiff, who had actual notice that the mortgage had not been satisfied. On cross-motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Land Court concluded that the mortgage had expired and was discharged, and entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33, is ambiguous and should be interpreted so as to provide an \u201cactual notice\u201d defense to the limitation period provided therein. Moreover, the defendant argues that if the statute applies, an affidavit filed by Andre Danesh satisfied the recording requirement. The defendant further asserts that the plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 75, which obligates an attaching creditor to pay off an outstanding mortgage after demand has been made by the mortgage holder and, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s right to the property is void and equitable estoppel should preclude the plaintiff from denying the validity of the mortgage. We find no merit to the arguments advanced by the defendant, and accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"><em>Background. </em>The salient facts are not contested. Bahig Bishay purchased property located at 163 Blue Hill Drive, Westwood (property), in 1978. On May 24, 2001, Bishay and Brighton Avenue Associates, LLC (BAA),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> executed an agreement for judgment with respect to a then-pending case in the District Court. On May 30, 2001, a judge of the District Court issued a judgment by agreement in favor of BAA, whereby BAA was awarded, among other things, a monetary judgment and a writ of execution (execution) dated May 30, 2001, in favor of BAA and against Bishay.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">On May 31, 2001, Bishay granted defendant Allied Properties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and Mortgages (Allied) a mortgage (mortgage) on the property to secure a $300,000 debt. Allied recorded the mortgage with the Norfolk County registry of deeds on May 31, 2001. The mortgage provided that it was to be due and payable on August 31, 2001. An extension agreement, which extended the term of the mortgage to August 31, 2003, was executed on August 31, 2001, but the extension agreement was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On August 15, 2001, pursuant to the execution, a Norfolk County deputy sheriff seized Bishay\u2019s right, title, and interest in the property. BAA then assigned to Harvard 45 its right, title, and interest in the execution \u201cto the extent necessary to enable [it] to bid as the creditor up to the full amount on the [execution, at its discretion, for the purchase of [the property].\u201d The plaintiff acquired title to the property on February 18, 2004, following a sheriff\u2019s sale. On February 9, 2005, Bishay filed an action in the Superior Court to exercise his right of redemption regarding the property. Final judgment was entered on October 13, 2006, terminating Bishay\u2019s right of redemption, in which the judge declared that the plaintiff \u201cholds fee simple title to the [p]roperty . . . free of all Bahig Bishay\u2019s rights of redemption.\u201d That judgment was later affirmed in this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On November 30, 2006, Allied assigned the mortgage to defendant Andre Danesh, the president and treasurer of Allied; that assignment was recorded in the Norfolk County registry of deeds on December 7, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The plaintiff brought a summary process action against Bishay and his wife, Mary Bishay, for possession of the property on March 17, 2008, and judgment for the plaintiff was entered on April 17, 2008. An appeal of the summary process action was dismissed on August 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">On September 19, 2008, the plaintiff filed this action in the Land Court to quiet title to the property and to seek a declaration that the mortgage held by Allied and, subsequently, Danesh was discharged pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33. The plaintiff named Danesh and Allied as defendants. Danesh, on September 29, 2008, executed an affidavit pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 33-35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(affidavit), concerning the mortgage. By instrument dated October 2, 2008, Danesh assigned the mortgage to Mary Bishay, and subsequently, the plaintiff amended its complaint to add Mary Bishay as a defendant. After a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Land Court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The \u201cObsolete Mortgages\u201d statute. </em>General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 33, the statute of limitations governing the enforceability of mortgages, was amended by St. 2006, c. 63. The amended statute applies retroactively to mortgages that were recorded before the effective date of the amendment, which was October 1, 2006. Specifically, the statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201cA power of sale in any mortgage of real estate shall not be exercised and an entry shall not be made nor possession taken nor proceeding begun for foreclosure of any such mortgage after the expiration of, in the case of a mortgage in which no term of the mortgage is stated, 35 years from the recording of the mortgage or, in the case of a mortgage in which the term or maturity date of the mortgage is stated, 5 years from the expiration of the term or from the maturity date, unless an extension of the mortgage, or an acknowledgment or affidavit that the mortgage is not satisfied, is recorded before the expiration of such period. In case an extension of the mortgage or the acknowledgment or affidavit is so recorded, the period shall continue until 5 years shall have elapsed during which there is not recorded any further extension of the mortgage or acknowledgment or affidavit that the mortgage is not satisfied. The period shall not be extended by reason of. . . agreement, extension, acknowledgment, affidavit or other action not meeting the requirements of this section and sections 34 and 35. Upon the expiration of the period provided herein, the mortgage shall be considered discharged for all purposes without the necessity of further action by the owner of the equity of redemption or any other persons having an interest in the mortgaged property 5?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Statute 2006, c. 63, \u00a7 8, provides that the amendment \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>apply to all mortgages, whether recorded before, on or after the effective date hereof, except that, the term of a mortgage which as a result of [G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33,] would expire within 1 year after the effective date of this act shall be extended for a period of 1 year from the effective date of this act [October 1, 2007].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVy\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 34, sets forth the requirements for an extension or acknowledgment of a mortgage. It provides that an affidavit will not be sufficient to extend the expiration date of the mortgage unless it is (1) executed by the holder of the mortgage, (2) describes the mortgage sufficiently to identify the record thereof, (3) names one or more of the person or persons then appearing of record to own the real estate then subject to the mortgage, and (4) states \u201cthat the mortgage remains unsatisfied, and if the mortgage secures a promissory note or sum of money, the amount believed to remain unpaid.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asv\">The defendant argued before the Land Court, and maintains now, that the language of the Obsolete Mortgages statute is ambiguous, and that the legislative intent of the statute indicates that it does not apply to the mortgage in dispute. When the meaning of a statute is at issue, we look first to the actual language of the statute. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983); <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Land Bank Commn. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of West Tisbury, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (2004). Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, \u201cjudicial inquiry into the statute\u2019s meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\u201d <em>Beaupre </em>v. <em>Cliff Smith &amp; Assocs., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 480, 491 (2000), quoting from <em>Estate of Cowart </em>v. <em>Nicklos Drilling Co., </em>505 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>469, 475 (1992). \u201cWhere the words are \u2018plain and unambiguous\u2019 in their meaning, we view them as \u2018conclusive as to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Dept. of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. </em>Protection, 455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting from <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986). Courts must follow unambiguous statutory language \u201cunless \u2018following the Legislature\u2019s literal command would lead to an absurd result, or one contrary to the Legislature\u2019s manifest intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>453 Mass. 135, 142 (2009), quoting from <em>White </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). We cannot look beyond the words of the statute in such a case, even if \u201cwe . . . recognize a potential unfairness within a statute\u2019s clear language . . . [or] a statute creates a potential anomaly\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The language of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33, is unambiguous. The statute clearly discharges as matter of law all mortgages five years after the date on which they become due, unless an extension, acknowledgment, or affidavit is <em>recorded </em>within that period of time. There is no room for debate over the meaning of language that establishes a clear set of requirements that may not be circumvented to avoid the consequences of discharge. The language of \u00a7 33 is final and applies universally to discharge mortgages, regardless of the intent, knowledge, or \u201cacknowledgment\u201d of the mortgagee or mortgagor, if the appropriate documents are not timely recorded.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Our reading of the statute finds support in Federal decisions interpreting the same language. Rejecting the argument that \u00a7 33 applies only to defunct or inactive mortgages, a claim also advanced by the defendant in this appeal, the United States Bankruptcy Court concluded, \u201c[t]he language of the Obsolete Mortgages [s]tatute is unambiguous and contains no exceptions. A mortgagee\u2019s actions, short of timely recording an appropriate document, are ineffective to extend an expired mortgage. Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the [Legislature intended the Obsolete Mortgages statute to have a more narrow application, ... it was certainly capable of drafting the statute accordingly.\u201d <em>In re 201 Forest St., </em>LLC, 404 B.R. 6, 10 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2009). Reversing on other grounds, the reviewing court agreed that \u201c[t]he effect of the Obsolete Mortgages [sjtatute is to extinguish the mortgagee\u2019s rights as mortgagee.\u201d <em>LBM Fin., LLC v. 201 Forest St., LLC, </em>422 B.R. 888, 893 n.7 (B.A.P 1st Cir. 2010). See <em>Motta </em>v. <em>Andre, </em>434 B.R. 193, 201 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2010).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also find support for our approach in the decisions of other States, which have strictly construed the recording requirements of mortgage extensions. The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded that the failure to record an extension precludes an action between mortgagor and mortgagee to foreclose a mortgage that has been discharged pursuant to the state\u2019s \u201cForeclosure of Ancient Mortgages\u201d statute. See <em>Willow Tree Invs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilhelm, </em>465 N.W.2d 849, 850 (Iowa 1991). See also <em>Pro-Max Corp. </em>v. <em>Feenstra, </em>117 Nev. 90, 95 (2001) (concluding similar Nevada statute was unambiguous and operated to extinguish any debt on real property secured by a deed of trust ten years after the debt becomes due in the absence of a recorded extension).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Turning to the facts at hand, we agree with the Land Court judge that, under the plain language of \u00a7 33, the mortgage has been discharged. The mortgage, clearly within the purview of the statute, expired on August 31, 2001, and was therefore discharged by operation of law on August 31, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The extension agreement did not, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, extend the maturity date of the mortgage for purposes of the Obsolete Mortgages statute. The extension agreement was never recorded and is therefore not a valid extension under the clear requirements of \u00a7 33. Neither the assignment to Danesh nor the affidavit executed by Danesh constitutes valid extensions of the mortgage. Both documents were executed after the mortgage had expired, on November 30, 2006, and September 29, 2008, respectively.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">2. <em>Additional claims. </em>We turn now to the additional arguments advanced by Bishay challenging the discharge of the mortgage and address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The defendant maintains that the plaintiff lacks good title to the property because the execution in which Harvard 45 acquired the property was dissolved pursuant to G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 75, as amended through St. 1959, c. 580, \u00a7 19, which provides, in relevant part, \u201cwithin a reasonable time after such property has been attached ... the mortgagee, pledgee, lienor, conditional vendor or secured party, or his assigns, may demand payment of the money for which the property is liable .... If the balance as stated in the account, whether then payable or not, is not paid. . . within ten days after such service, the attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>shall be dissolved . . . .\u201d We are not persuaded that the statute is applicable here. Section 75 refers, through the phrase \u201csuch property,\u201d to the previous section, G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 74; both sections concern the attachment of \u201c[pjersonal property of a debtor which is subject to a mortgage, pledge or lien, and of which he has the right of redemption, or personal property sold under a contract of conditional sale reserving title in the vendor . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 74. Neither section is applicable here, where the plaintiff acquired real property following a sheriff\u2019s sale. See <em>Mugford </em>v. <em>Rival Foods, Inc., </em>302 Mass. 435, 437 (1939) (\u201c[t]he purpose of the statute in requiring this \u2018just and true account of the debt or demand\u2019 for which the property is liable is to give those who are attaching the property sufficient knowledge so that they may intelligently decide upon their course of action\u201d); <em>Atlantic Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Galvam, </em>311 Mass. 49, 51 (1942); <em>Bishins </em>v. <em>Richard B. Mateer, P.A., </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 423, 430-431 (2004) (judgment on \u201cchattel mortgage\u201d entitles holder only to interest in a limited partnership, but not a portion of real estate owned by the partnership). The plaintiff\u2019s fee simple title to the property has been affirmed in a previous judgment by this court, and the defendant\u2019s challenge here is limited to the validity of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The defendant also maintains that the plaintiff should be judicially estopped from asserting that the mortgage is discharged pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33, because of several assertions made in discovery in the summary process action purportedly acknowledging the ongoing validity of the mortgage. The defendant cites an interrogatory to which the plaintiff responded that it did \u201cnot know the current pay-off amount\u201d of the mortgage, and the plaintiff\u2019s response to a request for admissions in which it admitted to having made no mortgage payments. Although neither response directly challenges the validity of the mortgage, the absence of such a challenge does not render the plaintiff\u2019s responses inconsistent with its position in the current action. Moreover, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 33, operates to discharge a mortgage regardless of the parties\u2019 actual knowledge of it or efforts to maintain it, should those efforts fail to meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that judicial equity favors the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>continuing validity of the mortgage. Having concluded that the statute is unambiguous and the Legislative intent clear, we lack the authority to circumvent the operation of the statute. \u201cWhere, as here, the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). See <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Chaplic, </em>388 Mass. 398, 406 n.15 (1983) (a court cannot \u201cdisregard statutory requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the mortgage is discharged as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Brighton Avenue Associates, LLC is affiliated with Harvard 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"><em>Bishay </em>v. <em>Brighton Ave. Assocs., LLC, </em>71 Mass.

No affidavit that the mortgage is not satisfied shall be sufficient to extend the period unless it is executed by the holder of the mortgage, describes the mortgage sufficiently to identify the record thereof, names one or more of the person or persons then appearing of record to own the real estate then subject to the mortgage, and states that the mortgage remains unsatisfied, and if the mortgage secures a promissory note or sum of money, the amount believed to remain unpaid. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Without deciding whether certain acts of the plaintiff or documentary admissions constitute \u201cacknowledgment\u201d of the mortgage, or whether the assignment to Danesh \u201cplaced the world on notice that the mortgage was still in effect,\u201d we reject Bishay\u2019s argument that the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the debt renders the statute inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AmJ\">At oral argument, Bishay argued that a plain reading of \u00a7 33 presents a constitutional difficulty because if the statute is applied retroactively to mortgages that expired prior to the effective date of the statute, they do not receive the benefit of the one-year savings clause, and it would result in an unconstitutional taking of the mortgagor\u2019s power of sale. See <em>Gandolfo </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>16 Mass. Land Ct. Rep. 158, 161-162 (2008) (concluding that the statute must be construed so as to extend the applicable statute of limitations to October 1, 2008). Though we need not reach the constitutional question in this instance because the parties both argued below that the mortgage matured on October 1, 2007, under the one-year savings provision of the statute, we note with approval a subsequent decision in the same case, concluding that \u201cthe Legislature explicitly deferred the effective date [of the amended statute] until October 1, 2006 .... [T]his court is satisfied that the approximate five and a half month period afforded by the Legislature in which to pursue a foreclosure claim is entirely adequate from a constitutional perspective.\u201d Gandolfo <em>vs. </em>Graham, Order Allowing Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration, Order Allowing Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, Land Court, No. 07-MISC-346141 (October 8, 2010). See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 576 (1991) (\u201cA legislative enactment carries with it a presumption of constitutionality, and the challenging party must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that there are no \u2018conceivable grounds\u2019 which could support its validity\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The Land Court judge did not decide the operative date on which the mortgage was discharged. Both parties argued below that the amendment to the statute extended the maturity date of the mortgage to October 1, 2007, one year after the effective date of the amendment. Though we do not agree that the mortgage would have received the benefit of the one-year savings clause, the actual date on which the mortgage expired does not alter our analysis. The mortgage is discharged as matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b234-14\">The Land Court judge also concluded that the assignment failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 34 \u201cbecause it was neither executed by the owner of the [property] at the time of execution (plaintiff), nor does it state that [the property] is subject to the mortgage or that the mortgage is not satisfied.\u201d The requirements of \u00a7 34 are clearly stated and failure to comply will render a purported extension or acknowledgment that the mortgage is not satisfied invalid.
