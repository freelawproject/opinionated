The board based the denial on its \u201cPolicy Number 9\u201d (Policy 9),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which purports to cap at twenty the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>class 2 used car dealer licenses in the town. When Policy 9 was adopted in 1999, the board did not specify why that precise number would be the cap. Rather, all that was stated by the board was that twenty licenses would \u201csufficiently meet the needs of the public for the Town.\u201d Notwithstanding this, Policy 9 reserved unlimited and standardless discretion to the board to grant licenses beyond the purported cap. In this regard, Policy 9 provided that, even if the twenty-license limit was reached, class 2 used car dealer license applications would be accepted, and the board, in its unfettered discretion, could decide to grant a license in excess of the twenty-license cap, or could \u201cat any time deny a request [beyond the cap] based on the public\u2019s interest already being met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We reverse the judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for declaratory relief. We conclude that to the extent Policy 9 purports to set a per se cap, it is invalid as it conflicts with the statute governing the grant of class 2 used car dealer licenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a per se cap erases the case-by-case review that the statute requires. Furthermore, Policy 9 is not sustainable as matter of law because it lacks any discernible standards, rendering the policy so vague as to pose a risk of arbitrary and capricious application defying judicial review. \u201c[Vjague laws that do not limit the exercise of discretion by officials engender the possibility of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 873 (1983). The vagaries of Policy 9 are tellingly reflected in the errant commentary of one board member concerning the review of the plaintiff\u2019s application and the ensuing denial thereof by the board. See note 8, <em>infra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Furthermore, even if we assume that Policy 9 is valid, as applied in this case, the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application under Policy 9 appears to rest on an outright and absolute rejection of Internet sales as not beneficial to the town,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was not based on substantial evidence, and was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">1. <em>Procedural and factual background. </em>At the time of Policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>9\u2019s adoption in 1999, there were twenty-three class 2 used car dealer licenses outstanding. All of these twenty-three licenses were protected as grandfathered when Policy 9 was adopted. For reasons not apparent on the record, over the years, the number of outstanding used car dealer licenses was reduced to twenty. Certain of these twenty existing licenses were transferred, with board approval, from previous holders to new licensees. Thus, the status quo of twenty licenses was locked in a process of transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In 2007, the plaintiff applied for a class 2 used car dealer license. At this time, there were twenty such licenses outstanding. As submitted to the board, the plaintiff\u2019s business plan provided that through Internet auction sites, the plaintiff would purchase and sell high-end, luxury, antique, and vintage automobiles. The plaintiff planned to store only three to five cars inside in a garage owned by his father\u2019s construction company. The garage is located in a limited industrial zoning district in the vicinity of multiple other commercial operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The town\u2019s zoning board of appeals granted a variance to allow the proposed business to operate at the site. The police department, the treasurer\u2019s office, and the fire department approved the site for use as proposed by the plaintiff. The board, however, invoking Policy 9, voted to deny the plaintiff\u2019s application for a class 2 used car dealer license. Reduced to essentials, the board \u2014 without adequate findings and consideration of the particular facts underlying the application \u2014 rested the denial on the generalized concept that the public need was adequately met by the existing twenty licenses and, as previously noted, that out-of-State, Internet sales would not benefit the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court, seeking entry of a judgment declaring that Policy 9 was invalid and in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59. Beyond that declaration, the plaintiff also sought a declaration that the board\u2019s denial of the application was unlawful, not based on substantial evidence, and was arbitrary and capricious, and that, accordingly, an order should issue granting the plaintiff a class 2 license to sell used cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Following a bench trial, a Superior Court judge denied the requests for the entry of declaratory judgment and affirmed the decision of the board. First, with respect to the declaratory challenge to the validity of Policy 9, the judge held that the \u201c[bjoard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>was well within both its executive and its legislative authority to enact Policy 9,\u201d and that Policy 9 was adopted in good faith by the board as the policy maker for the town. Second, in denying the request for declaratory judgment concerning the board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application, the judge reasoned that the plaintiff\u2019s business plan to sell used cars through the Internet did not advance the needs of the town, and that the board\u2019s denial determination was reasonable. We reverse for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The requests for declaratory relief in this case are intertwined with the standards for judicial review under the used car dealer licensing statute, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59. Under that statute, an appellate court focuses on both \u201cwhether the decision of the [board] is based upon an error of law or is unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ludvigsen </em>v. Dedham, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 682, 685 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The used car dealer licensing statute imposes on a licensing board a requirement <em>\u201cto determine the facts and to pass upon the application in each instance </em>under the serious sense of responsibility imposed upon [it] by [the board\u2019s] official position[] and the delicate character of the duty entrusted to [it]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>405 Mass. 79, 83-84 (1989), quoting from <em>Mosey Caf\u00e9 </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. for Boston, </em>338 Mass. 199, 205 (1958). This responsibility for case-by-case review, as required by the licensing statute, must be based on neutral and defined standards. These are not present in Policy 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Furthermore, while there is broad discretion in reviewing license applications by a municipal authority, that discretion is not unfettered. See <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. </em>of Boston, 405 Mass. at 82; <em>Goldie\u2019s Salvage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Walpole, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 730 (1992). The integrity of a licensing scheme depends upon standards that ensure fair and even-handed review of applications by the board and a framework for judicial review of whether a particular decision is arbitrary and capricious or based upon error of law. See <em>Ludvigsen </em>v. <em>Dedham, supra. </em>Policy 9 fails in these respects, as the policy lacks any fundamental standards. See, e.g., <em>Turnpike Amusement Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Commn. of Cambridge, </em>343 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Mass. 435, 437-438 (1962) (licensing authority\u2019s policy of denying all applications for new and renewed licenses to operate pinball machines not supported by enabling statute and was arbitrary and capricious); <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>378 Mass. 435, 440-441 (1979) (invalidating town by-law prohibiting removal of sand, loam, or gravel from land not in public use because bylaw exercised power provided by neither enabling statute nor Home Rule Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As noted, Policy 9 purports to be predicated on a capped maximum number of twenty class 2 licenses \u2014 notwithstanding that no such cap is provided for by the licensing statute. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59. The board contends that Policy 9 is not a hard cap but rather a flexible guideline, which, the board submits, is not in conflict with the licensing statute. We are not so persuaded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather than a flexible guideline with set borders, Policy 9 is a borderless zone in which the board may make unfettered decisions absent adherence to defined standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Even assuming that Policy 9 were not invalid, there is an independent basis to set aside the board\u2019s action in this case. Because Policy 9 lacks standards, it allows for arbitrary and capricious application, such as occurred in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From all that appears of record, the plaintiff\u2019s proposal would have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>limited negative impact in that there would be only five cars in the industrial garage; none would be stored outside. The plan was approved by the town\u2019s police department, the fire department, the treasurer\u2019s office, and the zoning board of appeals. These particularized case-by-case facts underlying the plaintiff\u2019s application were not adequately addressed by the board, leaving the decision unsupported by substantial evidence. \u201cWhen a decision contains conclusions that do nothing more than repeat regulatory phrases, and are unsupported by any facts in the record, we are constrained to conclude that the decision is \u2018unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary,\u2019 and therefore invalid.\u201d <em>Wendy\u2019s Old Fashioned Hamburgers of N.Y., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Billerica, </em>454 Mass. 374, 386 (2009), quoting from <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., </em>429 Mass. 478, 486 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated. A new decree shall enter declaring that</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">1. Policy 9 enacted by the board of selectman in 1999 with respect to class 2 used car dealer licenses subject to the State statutory scheme set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, is invalid,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">and</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>2. The plaintiff is entitled to a class 2 used car dealer license subject to the business plan set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s application, and to all applicable provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-17\">Policy 9 states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">\u201c1.

The used car dealer licensing statute, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 59, differs from the liquor licensing statute. Compare G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. \u201cThe general policies and standards to be observed in administering the laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages [including the number of licenses] are amply set out in various sections of c. 138.\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>334 Mass. 613, 618 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">That Policy 9 lacks standards and may be applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner (as in this case) is illustrated by the following testimony by a board member in respect to the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd a person coming before the Board making a presentation would not necessarily know what or how you were going to view an application until you actually voted on it, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">A.: \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t know what criteria you were using in exercising your judgment until you actually voted and maybe elucidated for him what the criteria were in either allowing or denying the license, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>A.: </em>\u201cThat\u2019s correct, they would have the policy that said it would be based on public need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cAnd, again, you\u2019ve never seen any survey or scientific or accepted method of survey \u2014 strike that.
