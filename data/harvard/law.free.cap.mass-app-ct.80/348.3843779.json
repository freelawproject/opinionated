The first is the familiar question whether the claimant was an independent contractor or an employee at the time of his injury. The second is the unfamiliar question whether he was working jointly for two employers at the time of his injury so as to impose statutory financial liabilities upon each of them. By thorough findings and reasoning after an evidentiary hearing, an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) concluded that the claimant was a covered employee of both entities. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>reviewing board of the department (board) summarily affirmed. For the following reasons, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the material facts included in the subsidiary findings of the administrative judge. They receive ample support from the evidence. We add several points of uncontested evidence from the hearing conducted in accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The claimant, Leo Whitman, was an experienced construction worker particularly skilled in drywall installation. In February of 2003, at the age of twenty-eight, he began his own business under the name of Creative Drywall Systems (Creative Drywall) and began to solicit work. Creative Drywall attracted little business throughout the ensuing year. In late 2003, a plasterer introduced Whitman to Stephen Sarcia and John Citrano, who were engaged in the purchase, rehabilitation, and resale of distressed residential properties. Citrano hired Whitman to perform some construction work on his home. Sarcia and Citrano then engaged Whitman in early 2004 to work on one of their projects: the conversion of a mill structure in Lynn to condominium units. Whitman worked on that site for about ten months, at the rate of $250 per day for five to seven days per week. Sarcia and Citrano set Whitman\u2019s day-to-day assignments and paid him weekly by checks addressed to him individually. The payments were his sole income. Whitman did not submit a bid or sign a contract related to his work on the mill conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">During the course of the mill project, Sarcia and Citrano introduced Whitman to Anthony Pace, the owner of Pace Properties Management, LLC (PPM), a company also engaged in the purchase, redevelopment, and sale of distressed properties as condominium residences. At the conclusion of the mill project, Whitman began work at an adjacent job site owned by PPM. The working terms were the same. Whitman received $250 per day, worked five to six days per week under daily assignments from Pace, and received weekly checks payable to him individually. PPM furnished all materials to Whitman. The work involved no bidding or contracts, lasted for five months, and generated Whitman\u2019s entire income for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Thereafter Whitman continued to receive work from Sarcia and Citrano, whom he regarded as partners, and from PPM. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Whitman viewed them collectively as \u201ca group\u201d with which he was \u201clocked in\u201d by reason of their continuous supply of full-time work for him. He no longer solicited work for Creative Drywall.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Throughout 2004 and 2005, Whitman worked for Sarcia and Citrano or PPM at ten different sites. During occasional lulls between projects, Sarcia, Citrano, or Pace would provide Whitman with work at their homes. During that period, Whitman completed only one separate short-term side job for which Citrano recommended him. Whitman\u2019s working terms remained constant: activity for five or more days per week at the rate of $250 per day, with overtime compensation for longer hours and additional days, and weekly payment by checks drawn to him individually predominantly from real estate company accounts and delivered to him by Sarcia, Citrano, or Pace. In 2005, Sarcia and in 2006 Pace delivered a monetary Christmas bonus to him. After January, 2007, PPM sent Whitman an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1099 as record of his compensation for the 2006 calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">While Whitman\u2019s primary work consisted of dry walling, it included also the installation of doors, cabinetry, baseboards, and tiling, and miscellaneous additional labor. Sarcia, Pace, and Citrano continued to furnish all materials and supplies. Whitman used his own tools, with the exception of some large or expensive equipment. He continued without bids or contracts and submitted no invoices. Sarcia, Pace, or Citrano did not direct Whitman in the detailed performance of his skilled work; they did assign him to specific daily and weekly segments of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">In late 2006, Whitman began work on a building in Ipswich which PPM had contracted to purchase. The seller had permitted Sarcia and PPM to undertake alterations before the closing. Sarcia and PPM planned to divide the building into two condominium units; each would own one. One of Whitman\u2019s immediate tasks was to erect the demising wall between the intended units. On December 20, 2006, the collapse of a scaffold caused Whitman to fall from a height of about fourteen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>sixteen feet. He suffered serious fractures of the tibia and fibula of his left leg, and underwent two surgeries and the implantation of two plates and multiple orthopedic screws. He was totally incapacitated for three months, and has been partially disabled ever since. His limitation to sedentary work has reduced his weekly earning capacity from $1,300 to $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Whitman brought his claim for benefits as an employee of Sarcia and or PPM. Neither had maintained statutory coverage for him; they characterized him as an independent contractor. The evidentiary hearing before the administrative judge included the testimony of Whitman, Pace, Sarcia, and Citrano. The administrative judge concluded that Whitman had worked as an employee of PPM and Sarcia, even though Pace and Sarcia had in subjective good faith regarded him as an independent contractor; and that PPM and Sarcia had constituted a \u201cconsortium of employers,\u201d each of whom had an employer\u2019s statutory responsibilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The administrative judge ordered the Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund (trust fund) to pay Whitman temporary total disability compensation for the three months immediately after the accident pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34; to pay him partial disability compensation from that point onward pursuant to \u00a7 35; to pay for all reasonable and necessary related medical treatment pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30; and to pay the fee and reasonable expenses of Whitman\u2019s counsel pursuant to \u00a7 13A(5). The payments by the trust fund expose the uninsured employers to recovery by the trust fund of all such expenditures and its necessary and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(8). Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), only PPM has appealed from the board\u2019s summary affirmance of the orders of the administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>PPM challenges both determinations of the administrative judge. It contends that, as an error of law, he misapplied the criteria distinguishing an independent contractor from an employee; and that his treatment of PPM and Sarcia as joint employers lacked the support of requisite findings and comprised a conclusion arbitrary, capricious, and abusive of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>In cases of summary affirmance of a decision of the administrative judge by the board, the reviewing court is examining the findings and reasoning of the administrative judge. See <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068, 1068 (1982); <em>Coggin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587 (1997), and cases cited. In accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), we review the decision under the standards of the Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a) through <em>(d), (f), </em>and (g). In this instance PPM argues in effect that the characterization of Whitman as an employee amounts to an error of law within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c); and that the determination of PPM as a joint employer rests upon inadequate findings and therefore unlawful procedure in violation of \u00a7 14(7)(&lt;i) and, further, constitutes action arbitrary, capricious, or abusive of discretion within the meaning of \u00a7 14(7)(g). Review is deferential. \u201cThe court shall give due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">2. <em>Employee status. </em>PPM insists that the administrative judge undervalued the criterion of control over the work performed at job sites by Whitman. It emphasizes that Whitman \u201cwas a career drywalling professional who specialized in drywalling, had a professional drywalling business . . . , had been a drywaller for several years, and, by his own admission, knew that PPM was relying on his expertise on projects for which he was hired and that he enjoyed wide discretion in determining how to do his job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The administrative judge acknowledged Whitman\u2019s skill and his freedom from over-the-shoulder supervision by PPM and Sarcia in the performance of his work. At the same time he conducted a far wider ranging evaluation of Whitman\u2019s status under the multiple criteria drawn from Massachusetts decisional law and the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 220(2) (1958) and typically employed in the department\u2019s administrative adjudications. See <em>MacTavish </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Lumber Co., 6 </em>Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 174, 177 (1992). The administrative judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>applied twelve such criteria to the largely undisputed evidence. We summarize them in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In the calculus of the administrative judge, seven criteria favored independent contractor status and five an employment relationship. However he assigned greater weight to the indicia supporting employee status, especially the duration, continuity, near exclusivity of the working relationship, the absence of any contract and the resulting exposure of Whitman to at-will termination, and the payments to him as an individual. The question of employment status within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), \u201cis essentially a question of fact for the board, not to be set aside if it is justified by the evidence, unless, of course, it is tainted by some error of law.\u201d <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 481 (1985). Here the administrative judge\u2019s careful, multifactorial assessment shows no error of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>3. <em>Joint employment. </em>PPM\u2019s remaining argument suggests that Whitman was not a joint employee of both Sarcia and PPM. It attacks the administrative judge\u2019s determination of jointness upon two grounds, one procedural and the other substantive. The procedural contention is that the administrative judge summarily made an ultimate finding that PPM, Pace, Sarcia, and Citrano comprised \u201ca consortium for which [Whitman] worked exclusively during the two years prior to his industrial injury\u201d without necessary subsidiary findings and reasoning in violation of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (8),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and thereby upon unlawful procedure within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">While the administrative judge applied the bulk of his decision to the issue of employee status, the evidence and his findings additionally support his identification of a consortium of employers jointly engaging the labor of Whitman. His subsidiary findings included the facts that Whitman had suffered his injury at the job site planned for purchase by PPM and Sarcia; that PPM and Sarcia were sharing the expenses of the rehabilitation of the structure; and that PPM and Sarcia each would own a designated half of the completed renovation. He found specifically that \u201cPace, Sarcia and Citran[o] worked cooperatively throughout the claimant\u2019s tenure\u201d of two or more years of assigned work. As a matter of form required by \u00a7 11(8) and \u00a7 <em>14(7)(d), </em>the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion rests upon adequately stated findings and reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The substantive contention is that the determination of joint employment is arbitrary, capricious, or abusive of discretion, within the sense of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g), because the evidence could not support the necessary findings that PPM and Sarcia operated as a single employer with common management, ownership, and financial controls. This case appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>present the first appellate occasion for a determination of joint employers\u2019 responsibility under the workers\u2019 compensation program in Massachusetts. For the following reasons we conclude that the administrative judge ruled correctly as a matter of law and sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">No authority supports PPM\u2019s premise that joint employers must be integrated or \u201csingle\u201d by ownership, management, and finances. Workers\u2019 compensation law in Massachusetts allows separate entities to constitute joint employers. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 26B, inserted by St. 1957, c. 276, explicitly acknowledges a covered worker\u2019s employment \u201cin the concurrent service of two or more insured employers\u201d and the assignment of joint and several liability to their respective insurers for compensable injury incurred in work \u201ccommon to such employers.\u201d In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Westover Finishing Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 58, 59-62 (1987), this court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 decedent qualified as a worker jointly employed by two employers, and that the decedent\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation coverage provided both employers with immunity from liability in tort to her estate. Both employers, therefore, received the benefit of coverage. <em>Ibid. </em>In this instance, joint employment works consistently in the converse situation. Since Whitman worked jointly without coverage for two employers, both employers must bear the burden or detriment of non-coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Here the evidence shows that PPM (through Pace) and Sarcia controlled the assignment of Whitman\u2019s work and were receiving the benefit of it at the time and place of his injury. The elements of shared control and benefit characterize joint employment. See <em>id. </em>at 60 (\u201cJoint employment, where a person under the simultaneous control of two employers simultaneously performs services for both, is a well recognized phenomenon\u201d); 3 Larson, Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 68.01 &amp; 68.03 (rev. ed. 2011). That relationship arises commonly \u201cbecause there is nothing unusual about the coinciding of both control by two employers and the advancement of the interests of two employers in a single piece of work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 68.01, at 68-2. The evidence established that PPM and Sarcia were undertaking the Ipswich project jointly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In instances of symbiotic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>business arrangements, the trend of courts is \u201cto dispose of close cases, not by insisting on an all-or-nothing choice between two employers both bearing a close relation to the employee, but by finding a joint employment on the theory that the employee is continuously serving both employers under the control of both.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 68.02, at 68-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We therefore affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In Whitman\u2019s words, \u201cSo I pretty much just gave up hope on Creative Drywall because I was under the understanding that I was locked in with these individuals and they told me they had enough work to keep me busy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The administrative judge attributed honest and credible testimony to Pace, Sarcia, and Citrano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The administrative judge applied the following twelve criteria: (1) the extent of control exercised by the employer over the details of the work (supported independent contractor status); (2) whether the worker was engaged in a distinct occupation or business (supported independent contractor status); (3) whether, in the locality, the type of work usually proceeded under the direction of an employer or by an unsupervised specialist (supported independent contractor status); (4) the skill required for the occupation (supported independent contractor status); (5) whether the employer or the worker supplied the tools and place of work (on balance, supported independent contractor status); (6) the length of time of the working relationship (supported employee status); (7) the method of payment (supported employee status); (8) whether the work was part of the regular business of the employer (supported employee status); (9) whether the parties believed that they were creating an employment relationship (Whitman\u2019s belief of his \u201clocked in\u201d posture supported employment status against Pace\u2019s contrary belief); (10) whether the alleged employer constituted a business (supported employee status); (11) the tax treatment applied to payment (use of form 1099 favored independent contractor status); and (12) the presence of the right to terminate the relationship without liability, as opposed to the worker\u2019s right to complete the project for which he was hired (supported employee status).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The administrative judge derived criteria one through ten from <em>MacTavish </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Lumber Co., supra, </em>which had assimilated them from the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 220(2). He applied factor eleven independently and drew factor twelve from <em>Madariaga\u2019s Case, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 481 (1985). For an analogous survey of criteria, see Nason, Koziol and Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 8.1 through 8.09 (3d ed. 2003 &amp; 2010-2011 supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">PPM\u2019s precise contention is that the administrative judge should have given his favoring treatment of the criterion of supervisory control overriding weight. No precedent commands that result. If anything, however, that treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ment may already have been overly generous to PPM. Not actual supervisory control of the worker\u2019s performance, but rather the \u201cright to control\u201d is decisive. <em>McDermott\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 74, 76 (1933). If the worker is subject to \u201ca right to designate the work to be done under the contract . . . then he is a servant or employee.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It was undisputed that Pace and Sarcia always \u201cdesignated\u201d the assignments of Whitman\u2019s work at each project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\">General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, requires in pertinent part that an agency decision \u201cshall be accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision, including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Their plan was to divide the building into two condominium units so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>each could purchase one unit and then resell it. Their collaborative sharing of the expenses, implementation, and benefits of the project created a joint venture. See <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 615, 623-624 (1990). \u201c[J]oint employment may come about simply because of the joint character of the business arrangement between the two employers. The most obvious illustration is that of a classic joint venture.\u201d Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 68.03, at 68-4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b380-13\">The wide majority of States have expressly acknowledged that multiple employers may be jointly liable for provision of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under their statutory programs if the employee was serving their interests at the time of injury.
