L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, in accordance with G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also appeals from the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial, which is consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>with the underlying appeal. The father argues that his due process rights were violated because the trial was conducted while he was incarcerated and unaware that it was taking place, even though the judge was alerted to the father\u2019s possible incarceration multiple times during the trial. We agree, reverse the denial of the motion for a new trial, vacate the decree, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>On September 22,2009, the Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed a care and protection petition pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, on behalf of Jacqui. This followed a G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, report alleging neglect of Jacqui as a result of the mother\u2019s drug use and homelessness causing the mother and child to live in a car. The judge held a temporary custody hearing on October 2, 2009, which was deemed waived by the parents, who did not attend that hearing. Temporary custody of Jacqui was awarded to DCF. The trial on the merits of DCF\u2019s care and protection petition was held on May 4, 2010. Again, neither parent was present, although their attorneys were in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">At the commencement of the trial, the attorney for DCF stated that \u201ca couple of weeks ago, [an individual] from probation . . . must have run a CORI on the father and discovered that he was incarcerated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The attorney then indicated that she had filed a motion for the release of the father\u2019s and mother\u2019s CORI which would \u201cbe able to confirm whether or not [the father] is incarcerated.\u201d She continued, \u201c[I]f he is, we\u2019ll figure out how to proceed from there.\u201d The judge allowed the motions. The judge then asked the father\u2019s attorney if she had any contact with the father. She responded, \u201cNot recently, Your Honor, although I couldn\u2019t say if he was incarcerated.\u201d The judge then commented, \u201cHe forgot to call you before he had to go,\u201d to which his attorney responded, \u201cYeah.\u201d The father\u2019s attorney also indicated that she last saw her client in November, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">After further discussion of preliminary matters, the attorney for the father asked the judge to clarify if the trial was for both parents, inquiring, \u201cYour Honor, we are not proceeding only as to mother at this point. Is that correct?\u201d The judge responded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d A little later, the judge asked again, \u201cAnd father is \u2014 Is father incarcerated?\u201d A \u201cvoice\u201d responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have that information, Your Honor.\u201d The attorney for DCF then indicated that the information regarding the father\u2019s purported incarceration came from the father\u2019s mother and not from the probation department. The DCF attorney also stated that as recently as April 9 (three and one-half weeks previously), \u201cthe worker checked and confirmed that [the father] was not incarcerated.\u201d The judge then said that the trial was \u201cas to both parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Under direct examination, the social worker assigned to the case testified that the last time she saw the father was the first week in November when she met with him in the context of a visit with Jacqui to discuss the service plan of DCF.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Subsequent to that encounter, the social worker attempted to contact the father by telephone, by mail, and in person when she tried to visit him at his last known address, but she was unsuccessful in locating him. She then went on to testify that while talking to the father\u2019s mother on April 27, she learned that he had been incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Despite the numerous intimations before and during the trial that the father might be incarcerated, the trial continued without stopping to discover if he was indeed incarcerated. The father\u2019s attorney did not object to the trial continuing in his absence, nor did she insist on discovering if her client was incarcerated. Following the hearing, the judge found that both parents were unfit by clear and convincing evidence and that it was in Jacqui\u2019s best interests to terminate the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The father filed a posttrial motion for visitation, and a hearing was held on June 16, 2010. At that hearing, the father\u2019s incarceration at the time of the May 4 trial was confirmed by his attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The father, who had been brought to court by a habeas petition, stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that there was a trial.\u201d The judge responded by asking the father\u2019s attorney why she did not notify her client of the trial date, to which she replied that she had sent him a notice to his last known address. The motion for visitation was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The father filed a motion for a new trial that was also denied by the judge after a hearing on September 15, 2010. In support of his motion, the father stated in an affidavit that he was incarcerated as of April 12, 2010, and was, in fact, incarcerated on May 4, 2010, the day of the trial. At that hearing, where the father again was not present, the judge stated to the father\u2019s attorney that the father \u201chas an obligation to keep in touch with you and his social workers and so on and so forth,\u201d and asked if the father knew about the trial date. His attorney again responded that she sent \u201ccorrespondence to the last known address so I cannot say if he knew about it.\u201d The judge then inquired if the father had the attorney\u2019s address, to which she replied, \u201cYes . . . as far as I know.\u201d Somewhat remarkably, given the nature of her client\u2019s request for a new trial, his attorney stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t check [his] file. I may have forgot to habe him.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cAll right. So he could have been habed today. He wasn\u2019t habed today.\u201d The father\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The father claims that he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution right to due process because the trial terminating his parental rights took place despite the fact that he lacked notice, that he was incarcerated at the time of the trial, and that his incarceration was mentioned multiple times in the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\u201cParents have a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining custody of their children, which is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Erin, </em>443 Mass. 567, 570 (2005). \u201cState action terminating a parent-child relationship must comport with due process, including notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Adoption of Zev, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905 (2009). This court has held that an incarcerated parent must have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard\u201d when his parental rights are in danger of being terminated. See <em>Adoption of Edmund, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 526-527 (2000) (father incarcerated out-of-State denied \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard\u201d when telephone equipment enabling father to participate in trial did not work correctly and judge refused to grant father continuance); <em>Adoption of Whitney, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 832, 832, 838 (2002) (incarcerated father denied \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard\u201d when judge relied \u201con one-sided\u201d adverse testimony to terminate father\u2019s parental rights despite father\u2019s attorney\u2019s objection to proceeding in father\u2019s absence). Cf. <em>Adoption of Rory, ante </em>454, 459 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">A parent cannot exercise a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard,\u201d however, if he has not first received notice that he is in danger of having his parental rights terminated. Failure to give notice of a pending proceeding to terminate parental rights violates \u201cthe most rudimentary demands of due process of law.\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 550 (1965). Compare <em>Adoption of Hugh, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 350 (1993) (notice of proceeding to terminate parental rights is inadequate when given by publication where parent cannot read and more diligent effort to locate parent would have found him residing in community where he lived most of his life).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">DCF\u2019s main argument in this case is that the father was not present at the trial as \u201cthe result of his own actions and inaction,\u201d contending that it was the father\u2019s duty to inform his attorney that he was incarcerated and that an incarcerated parent must make his desire to participate in a parental termination hearing \u201cabundantly clear.\u201d Contrast <em>Adoption of Whitney, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 837. However, this argument misses the mark, because the father states that he did not receive notice of the upcoming trial due to his being incarcerated. Lacking notice, the father patently could not have made it clear that he wished to participate in the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Counsel for Jacqui argues that the father should have instituted \u201cinquiry\u201d into future proceedings, including the possibility that his parental rights would be terminated. However, because the social worker did not inform him that DCF might change its goal from reunification to adoption, the father could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>foreseen the need to make a \u201creasonable diligent inquiry\u201d about a future hypothetical hearing that could result in the loss of his parental rights. Contrast <em>Adoption of Simone, 427 </em>Mass. 34, 40 (1998). At the same time, the father did have some responsibility to keep his attorney informed of any changes in his address in the ongoing care and protection case. Had he done so, he may well have learned of the change in goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">DCF suggests that the father\u2019s due process rights were protected since he was represented by his attorney at trial and in posttrial hearings. It is plain, however, that the father\u2019s representation was cursory. Even when it became clear during the course of the trial that her client might be incarcerated, the father\u2019s attorney did not object to the continuation of the trial. In response to questions from the judge asking if her client had received notice, she repeatedly responded that she had sent the notice to his last known address.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\u201c[A]n incarcerated parent does not have an absolute right to attend a hearing that could result in a termination of parental rights, particularly if the parent is represented at trial by a lawyer.\u201d <em>Adoption of Edmund, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 529. However, where, as here, there was uncertainty about the father\u2019s incarceration, and his attorney had been out of contact with him, the father could not have been adequately represented. In these circumstances, we think the judge had a responsibility to \u201cdevis[e] a mechanism for meaningful participation\u201d by the father. <em>Adoption of Whitney, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 836. Compare <em>Adoption of Rory, supra </em>at 458-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">There is little doubt that proceeding with trial in these circumstances was improper, and it appears that the judge weighed the father\u2019s absence heavily, drawing a negative inference from the father\u2019s failure to appear. Incarceration alone is not a ground for termination of parental rights, and the \u201ccompelled absence of a parent by reason of incarceration [is] to be taken into account but [does] not conclusively render a parent unfit.\u201d <em>Adoption of Nicole, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 261 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The judge\u2019s findings concerning the father principally indicate that he was only minimally engaged with DCF, having no contact with DCF since November, 2009; failed to cooperate in completing service plan tasks; and visited Jacqui only twice. There are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>no specific findings that the father failed in particular parental duties. It is especially significant that in July, 2009, the mother voluntarily agreed to Jacqui\u2019s placement in foster care, a decision made without any involvement by the father. Ultimately, the judge\u2019s findings appear to be based on evidence offered by DCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Posttrial, the father submitted a motion for visitation, which was denied on the ground that his parental rights had been terminated and that he failed to submit evidence of a bond with Jacqui at trial. The hearing on the father\u2019s motion for a new trial consisted only of a few preliminary questions and, more significantly, the father\u2019s attorney \u201cmay have forgot to habe\u201d the father. The hearing could not seriously be considered a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Because it is clear that the father did not receive proper notice of the trial to terminate his parental rights, and was not able to participate in the trial due to his incarceration, he was denied a meaningful opportunity to rebut the adverse evidence against him, despite having an attorney who participated at his trial. The father was denied his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We reverse the denial of the father\u2019s motion for a new trial. We vacate the decree and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\">The mother is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">\u201cCORI\u201d refers to criminal offender record information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">At the time of her discussion with the father, the goal of DCF was reunification of the family. While the social worker indicated that she told the father about the importance of complying with DCF\u2019s service plan, she also testified that she did not tell him that DCF might change the goal to adoption if he failed to comply with the plan. DCF\u2019s goal for Jacqui was changed to adoption on April 16, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">DCF\u2019s adoption plan was recruitment of a family that would be \u201csensitive to [Jacqui\u2019s] emotional needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Because we conclude that the due process violations require a new trial, we need not reach the remaining claims raised on appeal including the judge\u2019s decision that the father was unfit to parent Jacqui or that it was error to deny the father posttrial visitation with his daughter. The father may seek visitation in the trial court. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
