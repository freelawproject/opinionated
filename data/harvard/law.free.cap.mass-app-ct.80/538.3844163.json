Scully, was convicted of two counts of possession of child pornography, the Beverly retirement board (board) revoked his retirement allowance on the ground that the convictions involved violations of the laws applicable to Scully\u2019s office or position as director of community services at the Beverly Public Library (library). See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4). The board\u2019s decision was affirmed by a District Court judge, and then by a Superior Court judge, who, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>on Scully\u2019s petition for certiorari review pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the board. While Scully\u2019s conduct was reprehensible, in view of the narrow interpretation that consistently has been given to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), we are constrained to conclude that the mandatory forfeiture of Scully\u2019s pension was not legally tenable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Background. </em>Scully began his employment as director of community services with the library in 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He resigned in May, 2005, after Beverly police executed a search warrant at his home and discovered seven images of child pornography on his home computer. The police had been conducting an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct perpetrated by Scully with a seventeen year old male, whom we shall call Matthew. The police interviewed Matthew on April 22, 2005, at which time Matthew disclosed that he had met Scully at the library when he was fifteen years old. According to Matthew, Scully approached him after discovering that he was viewing questionable material on a library computer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Scully warned Matthew to be careful, and then invited Matthew back to his home where Matthew could \u201csafely\u201d view such material. Matthew went to Scully\u2019s house many times. While there, he viewed adult pornography on digital video discs (DVDs) provided by Scully. As set forth in the police report, Matthew \u201cindicated that Scully had printed pictures of naked boys from his home computer and gave them [to Matthew] to keep [and that] one of the pictures was of a child who was definitely under 18.\u201d Matthew also told the police that on one occasion Scully had \u201cgrabbed\u201d his \u201cbutt\u201d with one hand over his clothing while Matthew was walking upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Shortly thereafter, on July 13, 2005, Scully was indicted on seven counts of possession of child pornography, one count of providing obscene matter to a minor (Matthew), and one count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of indecent assault and battery on a person age fourteen or over (Matthew). For reasons that do not appear in the record, the indecent assault and battery indictment was dismissed on July 7, 2006. The rest of the case was resolved three years later when, on January 29, 2009, Scully pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of child pornography. The Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi on the remaining indictments at the time of the plea. During the guilty plea hearing, Scully admitted that he had possessed two images of child pornography on his home computer. However, there was no allegation (and therefore no admission) that he had shown either image on which the convictions were based to Matthew.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Meanwhile, upon his resignation from the library, Scully submitted an application for voluntary superannuation retirement pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1), which the board granted effective May 12, 2005. In February, 2009, the board notified Scully that it was commencing a proceeding to determine the effect (if any) of his convictions on his entitlement to a retirement allowance. A hearing before the board, at which Scully was represented by counsel, was held on July 30, 2009. The hearing officer, an attorney who also represents the board, presented copies of the indictments against Scully, the transcript of Scully\u2019s plea colloquy, and a police report containing Matthew\u2019s statements as referenced above.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the hearing officer asked Scully, who appeared at the hearing pursuant to a subpoena, a number of specific questions with regard to the factual circumstances underlying the criminal investigation. Three of the questions posed sought information about Scully\u2019s conduct toward Matthew. The three questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cMr. Scully, do you dispute that upon meeting this child in the Beverly library, that you invited this child to your home in Beverly and allowed him to view and showed him under-age pornographic material?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\"><em>Q:. </em>\u201cMr. Scully, do you dispute that the pornographic material for which you were convicted was taken from the same computer that you permitted the child you met in the library to view in your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\"><em>Q:. </em>\u201cMr. Scully, do you dispute that you pleaded guilty to two counts of child pornography and that these criminal charges stemmed from your alleged inappropriate conduct with a minor child you met at the library in your capacity as director?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">On the advice of counsel, Scully invoked his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and did not answer the questions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The hearing officer concluded that Scully\u2019s convictions involved violations of the laws applicable to his office or position within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), and recommended that the board revoke Scully\u2019s retirement allowance. In his written recommended findings and decision, the hearing officer reasoned that notwithstanding the entry of nolle prosequi or dismissal of all charges based on conduct involving Matthew, a direct link between Scully\u2019s convictions and his position at the library existed because \u201cbut for\u201d meeting Matthew at the library and inviting Matthew to his home, the police would not have had probable cause to search Scully\u2019s home computer where they found evidence of a crime, namely the possession of child pornography. The hearing officer also determined that, based on an adverse inference drawn from Scully\u2019s refusal to answer the questions quoted above, \u201c[Matthew] was allowed to view [the same child pornography that was discovered on Scully\u2019s] computer.\u201d By a three-to-two vote, the board adopted the recommendation of the hearing officer. Based largely on the same reasoning, the District Court and the Superior Court judges affirmed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The scope of judicial review in the nature of certiorari is limited. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 173 (2006). \u201cCertiorari allows a court to \u2018correct only a substantial error of law, evidenced by the record, which adversely affects a material right of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>v. <em>Auditor of the Commonwealth, </em>430 Mass. 783, 790 (2000). In reviewing an administrative decision pursuant to a petition for certiorari, we review the entire record to determine whether the decision is legally tenable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, </em>425 Mass. 130, 135 (1997). In doing so, we are not authorized \u201cto make a de novo determination of the facts, to make different credibility choices, or to draw different inferences from the facts found by the [board].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, quoting from <em>Pyramid Co. </em>v. <em>Architectural Barriers Bd., </em>403 Mass. 126, 130 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We now turn to the issue whether the board\u2019s decision that Scully must forfeit his pension is legally tenable. The statute, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), inserted by St. 1987, c. 189, \u00a7 47, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]n no event shall any member [of the retirement system] after final conviction of a criminal offense <em>involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position, </em>be entitled to receive a retirement allowance ...\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Judicial Court has held that \u00a7 15(4) \u201cis considered to be penal and, therefore, its language must be construed narrowly, not stretched to accomplish an unexpressed result.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 174-175. The scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), was enunciated in <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 4 (1996), where the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \u201c[t]he substantive touchstone intended by the General Court is criminal activity connected with the office or position.\u201d In determining whether the forfeiture provision has been triggered, therefore, we \u201c[l]ook[ ] to the facts of each case for a <em>direct link </em>between <em>the criminal offense </em>and the member\u2019s office or position.\u201d <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, supra </em>at 175, quoting from <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 4-5. We remain mindful, however, that \u201cthe General Court did not intend pension forfeiture to follow as a sequel[] of any and all criminal convictions.\u201d <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 5. Accord <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 653 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Scully contends that the record fails to establish a direct link between his convictions of possession of child pornography and his position at the library. While we do not ignore the severity of the offenses to which Scully pleaded guilty, we conclude that the facts underlying the convictions do not present \u201cthe type of direct link intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. Initially, we note that there is no evidence in the record that Scully either stored or accessed child pornography on library computers. Furthermore, Scully did not use his position to facilitate the crime of which he was convicted. Here, the criminal conduct at issue \u2014 possession of child pornography \u2014 occurred at Scully\u2019s house and involved his personal computer. Although we do not condone Scully\u2019s conduct, in particular his interaction with Matthew, a direct link between Scully\u2019s position and the conviction of possession of child pornography must be shown. As noted, all the charges concerning Matthew were dismissed or nol pressed by the Commonwealth in connection with a negotiated plea bargain. Therefore, the direct link that the statute requires has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The board argues that Scully\u2019s convictions are directly linked to his job because Matthew\u2019s statement to the police provided probable cause to search Scully\u2019s home, which, in turn, led to the discovery of the child pornography for which Scully was convicted. We are not persuaded. The forfeiture provision, which must be construed narrowly, is not triggered where some work-related conduct sparks an investigation, but where there is \u201ca direct link between the public position and the offense for which the member is convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654-655. The connection the board asserts is too tenuous to meet that standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Likewise, we are not persuaded by the board\u2019s assertion (adopted by the Superior Court judge) that a direct link between the child pornography convictions and Scully\u2019s position exists because \u201c[Matthew] viewed the same illegal pornography for which Scully was convicted of possessing.\u201d This argument is flawed in two respects. First, the asserted connection is based on conduct related to a criminal charge (distribution of harmful material to a minor) that did not result in a conviction, as required by the statute. The board\u2019s analysis simply does not take into account the fact that the mandatory forfeiture provision is triggered only by a member\u2019s conviction and not by illegal (or unsavory) conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have emphasized, the forfeiture provision has been construed narrowly by our cases. Moreover, despite this consistent interpretation, the Legislature has not modified the statute. Based on controlling precedent and the plain (unchanged) language of the statute, the board\u2019s reliance on criminal activity that did not result in a conviction constitutes a substantial error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Second, the board\u2019s finding that Scully showed Matthew the same child pornography for the possession of which he was convicted is not supported by substantial evidence. The board\u2019s finding is based almost entirely on the inference it argues may be drawn from Scully\u2019s refusal, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to answer the question whether he showed that same child pornography to Matthew. \u201cIn a civil action, a reasonable inference adverse to a party may be drawn from the refusal of that party to testify on the grounds of self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Quintal </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; </em>Training, 418 Mass. 855, 861 (1994), quoting from <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>Fall River Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>382 Mass. 465, 471 (1981). However, \u201cthe adverse inference drawn from the silence of a party is insufficient, \u2018by itself, to meet an opponent\u2019s burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616 (1986). \u201cInstead, \u2018a case adverse to the interests of the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>affected [must be] presented\u2019 before an adverse inference may be drawn.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Custody of Two Minors, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In this case, the only evidence in the record that supports the board\u2019s finding is the statement (attributed to Matthew) in the police report to the effect that Scully gave Matthew a picture depicting \u201ca child who was definitely under 18.\u201d However, even assuming, arguendo, that this statement is true,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there is no evidence that Matthew saw either one of the two images underlying Scully\u2019s convictions. Thus, on the record before us, there is no basis in fact for the board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In sum, the board\u2019s decision is not in accordance with the law. As noted, the \u201cstatute at issue is a penal provision that must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Essex Regional Retirement Bd., </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 655. Because the requisite connection between Scully\u2019s convictions and his position has not been established, we are constrained to conclude that the board committed a \u201csubstantial error of law\u201d adversely affecting Scully\u2019s \u201cmaterial\u201d right to receive his pension. <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment shall enter in the Superior Court reversing the judgment of the District Court and the decision of the defendant board.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In light of our conclusion, we need not reach Scully\u2019s claim that the forfeiture of his pension constituted an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Scully had previously worked at the Peabody Public Library. At the time of his resignation, Scully had completed more than twenty-seven years of creditable service under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Matthew told the police that he was visiting a \u201cBuffy the Vampire\u201d Internet chat room where he was \u201ccybering,\u201d an activity which Matthew described as \u201con-line sex.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The record reflects that, prior to the hearing, the hearing officer also distributed to the board, in violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13D, transcripts of the 2005 grand jury proceedings which had resulted in Scully\u2019s indictments. Conceding that this was improper, the recommendation (which was adopted by the board) expressly disclaims any reliance on the grand jury transcripts, and we do not consider them in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">As the board acknowledges, Scully apparently was willing to waive his constitutional rights and answer some of the questions but was informed that he could either answer all the questions or none.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Section 15(4) further provides that upon such a conviction the member \u201cshall receive, unless otherwise prohibited by law, a return of his accumulated total [contributions to the retirement system]; provided, however, that the rate of regular interest for the purpose of calculating accumulated total [contributions] shall be zero.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The board\u2019s reliance on <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Justices of the Quincy Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept. </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 612 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>452 Mass. 517 (2008), is misplaced. In that case we upheld forfeiture under \u00a7 15(4) when a city inspector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>was convicted of breaking into the city hall and stealing documents from his personnel file. <em>Id. </em>at 616-617. Here, unlike the facts in <em>Maher, </em>Scully\u2019s convictions of child pornography were not related to his position at the library.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The issue whether Scully forfeited his pension on the ground of moral turpitude, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1), is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">WhiIe the proceedings before the board were not, of course, subject to the rules of evidence, the hearing officer was obligated to rely only on \u201cthe kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(2). 840 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.12 (2002). The Supreme Judicial Court has held that hearsay is admissible in pension revocation hearings, but only if it bears the requisite \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Medford, </em>425 Mass. at 140 (approving retirement board\u2019s consideration of prior trial testimony where retiree had been given opportunity to cross-examine witnesses). Matthew\u2019s statement to the police, including his disclosure that Scully gave him child pornography (one printed image), was not subjected to cross-examination and, therefore, might well lack the requisite indicia of reliability to constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d before the board. See <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988) (hearsay may constitute \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in administrative proceeding only if it presents \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
