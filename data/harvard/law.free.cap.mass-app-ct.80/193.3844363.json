Roach, and Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, Inc., for negligently failing to diagnose Curreri\u2019s cancer. The trial judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to satisfy her burden under a loss of chance theory that physician negligence had diminished or destroyed Curreri\u2019s chance of survival. The plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Background. </em>As developed at trial, the chronology of relevant events is not in dispute. On July 25, 2002, Curreri saw his primary care physician, Isihara, with complaints of hoarseness and acid reflux. Curreri had been treated with Prilosec for acid reflux since 2001. Isihara concluded that Curreri had laryngitis and esophageal reflux.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On August 28, 2002, Roach, an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist, evaluated Curreri. At that time, Roach performed a fiberoptic examination of the larynx. This procedure revealed damage to the left vocal cord.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Roach\u2019s principal diagnosis was an unspecified voice disturbance, and he also considered reflux esophagitis. Roach doubled the dosage of Prilosec prescribed for Curreri and recommended a speech evaluation. On September 23, 2002, Curreri visited a speech therapist. At that session, Curreri presented \u201cwith poor voice quality and no voice power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On October 29, 2002, Roach ordered that a videostroboscopy of the larynx be performed. There were no medical records indicating that a videostroboscopy ever was performed. On December 17, 2002, Curreri returned to visit Isihara and requested a second opinion from another ENT specialist. At that appointment, Isihara learned that Curreri had stopped taking the increased Prilosec dosage that Roach had prescribed, and Isihara prescribed a stronger medicine to treat Curreri\u2019s acid reflux.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On January 9, 2003, Curreri saw a second ENT specialist, Neil Bhattacharyya, pursuant to the referral from Isihara for a second opinion. At that appointment, Bhattacharyya performed a fiberoptic examination of the larynx, which \u201cdocumented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>left true vocal cord immobility with bowing.\u201d After diagnosing the vocal cord immobility, Bhattacharyya ordered a computer tomography (CT) scan of Curreri\u2019s head, neck, and chest. This CT scan identified a mass next to his esophagus and another in his lung. Bhattacharyya found that the mass next to the esophagus had caused Curreri\u2019s left vocal cord paralysis by pressing on a nerve.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">On February 28, 2003, biopsies of the masses identified by the CT scan were taken. The biopsy results revealed that Curreri had metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, i.e., lung cancer. A radiation oncologist subsequently staged the cancer at stage 3B. Curreri underwent chemotherapy and a variety of other treatments for his cancer. Treatment was unsuccessful and Curreri died on August 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Procedural history. </em>In 2005, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice, wrongful death, negligent infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract. Following the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matsuyama </em>v. <em>Birnbaum, </em>452 Mass. 1 (2008), the plaintiff was allowed to amend her complaint to add a claim for loss of chance. The trial began on August 18, 2009. On the fourth day of trial, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, because in the judge\u2019s view the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Sidney P. Kadish, a radiation oncologist, had failed to provide testimony specifically staging Curreri\u2019s cancer in July or August of 2002 (the time of the alleged malpractice). The judge ruled that the plaintiff had failed to meet her burden of proof necessary to have the loss of chance claim submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\"><em>Discussion. </em>In a medical malpractice case, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish a causal connection between the alleged negligence of a defendant and any damages. <em>Glicklich </em>v. <em>Spievack, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 492 (1983). Traditionally, the \u201ccausal connection must generally be established by expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>that the injury sustained was more probably than not a result of the doctor\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, in 2008, the Supreme Judicial Court accepted the loss of chance doctrine in <em>Matsuyama, supra </em>at 3, allowing a plaintiff to establish causation \u201ceven if the possibility of recovery was less than even prior to the physician\u2019s tortious conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Under a loss of chance theory, a \u201cplaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the physician\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, where the injury consists of the diminished likelihood of achieving a more favorable medical outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. The court explained: \u201c[Pjrobability of survival is part of the patient\u2019s condition. When a physician\u2019s negligence diminishes or destroys a patient\u2019s chance of survival, the patient has suffered real injury. The patient has lost something of great value: a chance to survive, to be cured, or otherwise to achieve a more favorable medical outcome.. . . Thus we recognize loss of chance not as a theory of causation, but as a theory of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Cancer frequently is classified into separate stages, from stage 0 to stage 4, \u201cwith each higher stage signaling a more advanced cancer and carrying a statistically diminished chance for survival.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. \u201cThe survival rate is often stated as a five-year survival rate, which is the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive five years after diagnosis or treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 n.15, quoting from the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Dictionary of Cancer Terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">A. <em>Exclusion of evidence. </em>On appeal, as below, the plaintiff claims that Isihara and Roach negligently failed to diagnose Curreri\u2019s cancer when he met with Isihara in July of 2002, and with Roach in August of 2002, and negligently failed to conduct imaging studies which would have assisted in that diagnosis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the judge \u201cintervened and refused to allow Dr. Kadish to testify as to the staging of the cancer.\u201d The defendants respond that the plaintiff\u2019s expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cwas not precluded from opining about [Curreri\u2019s] alleged loss of chance; rather, [the expert] simply had no admissible opinion on the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">First, we consider whether the testimony that allegedly was excluded would have been admissible. During trial but outside the presence of the jury, prior to Radish\u2019s testimony, plaintiff\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> read an interrogatory answer, representing to the judge that Radish would testify, based on his loss of chance analysis, that \u201c[i]f the medical condition of nonsmall cell lung cancer had been diagnosed at or near the times of either . . . July 25th or August 28th, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based on the evidence, Mr. Curreri would have been diagnosed no worse than stage 2 disease and possibly stage 1.\u201d That interrogatory answer further provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201c[Wjith a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based on the evidence available, Dr. Radish will testify that when [Curreri] complained of hoarseness in July 2002, he had an earlier stage than that of February 2003, when he had Stage III B disease. Also with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based on the evidence available, Dr. Radish will testify that when [Curreri] complained of hoarseness in July 2002, that [he] had Stage II disease, and that he had a 40 to 50% chance to live 5 years after appropriate treatment, and the disease was more treatable. Since he was diagnosed in February 2003, with an advanced Stage M B, his chance of survival at that time was reduced to 5 to 10%. Accordingly, the delay may have caused a 30 to 45% loss of chance of 5 year survival. If the disease was at Stage I [when, according to the chart included in the interrogatory answer stating that the estimated five-year survival rate was fifty-five to seventy-five percent], then the percentages would be adjusted accordingly [and caused a forty-five to seventy percent loss of chance of five-year survival].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The judge correctly ruled that an expert opinion that the cancer was \u201cpossibly stage 1\u201d at the time of negligence was not sufficient to move the case forward for consideration by the jury. See <em>Goffredo </em>v. <em>Mercedes-Benz Truck Co., </em>402 Mass. 97, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>102-103 (1988) (\u201cAn expert opinion, stated in terms of possibilities, does not satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof\u201d). See also <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978) (on appeal of directed verdict, \u201cthe test has been stated as whether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u2019 That the inferences be reasonable requires that they be based on \u2018probabilities rather than possibilities\u2019 and not the result of \u2018mere speculation and conjecture\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]). However, in our view \u2014 and as defense counsel acknowledged during oral argument before us \u2014 testimony that the cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was admissible, and would in the context of the evidence here satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s burden against a directed verdict motion because it provides sufficiently definite evidence that at the time of the negligence the cancer was at a lesser stage than when the cancer actually was diagnosed. See discussion of <em>Matsuyama </em>damages formula, 452 Mass. at 27-29; <em>Renzi </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>452 Mass. 38, 42 (2008) (in medical malpractice case alleging failure to diagnose, expert testimony about range of potential stages for plaintiff\u2019s cancer was submitted to jury). See also <em>Sacco </em>v. <em>Roupenian, </em>409 Mass. 25, 29-30 (1990) (in medical malpractice case alleging failure to diagnose, expert witness testified that \u201cthe cancer was in stage one or stage zero\u201d at the time of the negligence; court rejected argument that it was \u201cnecessary to know the exact stage of the cancer in order to infer whether the cancer was detectable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Azl\">Because the testimony that the cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2\u201d would have been admissible, we turn our attention to the question whether the judge excluded this testimony. During the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel believed that the plaintiff was being asked to present evidence as to the specific stage of the cancer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, Kadish at first appears to focus on his inability to identify the precise stage, given that no imaging studies had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>been taken in July or August of 2002.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, after the judge clarified that the expert only was testifying \u201cbased upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u201d Kadish clarified, \u201cI want to say that it was a lesser stage.\u201d At that point Kadish is interrupted by objections from defense counsel before stating again, \u201cI can\u2019t say what the stage is. I don\u2019t know the stage.\u201d The judge subsequently sustained an objection to the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to further develop Kadish\u2019s lesser-stage testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When asked about his loss of chance analysis, Kadish again appears focused on his inability to precisely stage the cancer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">At the request of defense counsel, the judge held a bench conference to discuss Kadish\u2019s staging testimony. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel indicated that he believed Kadish would testify to a range of stages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the judge, \u201cMay I inquire of the witness again as to whether or not, based on his loss of chance study<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> . . . if he has an opinion as to the stage of cancer in August of 2002, based on this analysis?\u201d The judge refused to allow additional testimony from Kadish \u201c[bjecause what [plaintiff\u2019s counsel is] suggesting is so far not admissible under what [Kadish] said so far.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Arp\">The judge subsequently permitted a voir dire examination of Kadish for purposes of developing an appellate record. In an effort to clarify what would be deemed sufficient testimony, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the judge, \u201c[A]s I understand it, [you are] in the position where [you are] making a determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the case would not proceed unless Dr. Kadish is able to basically say with a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the stage of the cancer [in July and August of 2002].\u201d The judge agreed with this assessment. During this voir dire, in response to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Kadish stated that because imaging studies were not performed in July and August 2002, as he believed they should have been, he was unable to conclude the stage of the cancer that would have been disclosed in the studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Based on this record, it appears that plaintiff\u2019s counsel believed that he was prohibited from offering testimony that the cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2.\u201d Regardless of whether the judge intended to prohibit such testimony, the exchanges quoted, <em>supra, </em>fairly may be interpreted as precluding it. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert impermissibly was truncated, leading to the exclusion of relevant, admissible evidence. Thus, she is entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The defendants also argue that the plaintiff is barred from arguing that the testimony was excluded because she failed to make an offer of proof that Kadish would testify that Curreri\u2019s cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2.\u201d We disagree. The plaintiff did make an offer of proof in the bench conference.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 88 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(substance of excluded testimony was apparent from the questions defense counsel attempted to ask); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 103(a)(2) (2011). It is clear from the record that plaintiff\u2019s counsel was handing Kadish a copy of the loss of chance analysis when defense counsel requested a bench conference, and from plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s multiple requests during the bench conference to be allowed to question Kadish about his loss of chance analysis (discussed supra) that the plaintiff sought to introduce testimony from this document.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">B. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>In the interests of judicial economy, we address an argument raised on appeal that may arise during the new trial proceedings. The plaintiff argues that putting the staging testimony aside, the evidence that was presented at trial was sufficient to meet her burden under a loss of chance theory. Specifically, the plaintiff points to Radish\u2019s testimony that the tumor would have been smaller and therefore more susceptible to treatment at the time of the alleged negligence. The plaintiff argues that based on this testimony, \u201cthe jury could infer that . . . Curren\u2019s chances of survival would have been greater had his cancer been diagnosed in July or August of 2002.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In <em>Matsuyama, </em>the court clearly stated that \u201c[t]he key [in loss of chance cases] is the reliability of the evidence available to the fact finder.\u201d 452 Mass. at 18. The court explained that \u201cprogress in medical science now makes it possible, at least with regard to certain medical conditions, to estimate a patient\u2019s probability of survival to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. \u201cThe availability of such expert evidence on probabilities of survival makes it appropriate to recognize loss of chance as a form of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Indeed, the damages calculation in a loss of chance case is dependent upon such probabilities of survival. <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In the case before us, staging the cancer at the time of the negligence is critical to the ability to provide an accurate calculation of the patient\u2019s probability of survival.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While we agree that it is not necessary to identify the precise stage (see discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>sion, <em>supra), </em>testimony as to a stage or a range of stages is critical because this determines the probability of survival. Without probability of survival evidence, the jury does not have the information that it needs to properly conduct the loss of chance damages calculation. See <em>id. </em>at 27. Thus, testimony that the tumor was smaller and therefore more susceptible to treatment does not adequately establish the statistical evidence that is required by Matsuyama,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment on the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict is vacated, and the case is remanded for a new trial, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Specifically, the test \u201crevealed decreased left true vocal cord movement, atrophy of the left vocal cord, and a posterior commissure and false vocal fold area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The judge explained: \u201cThe reason that I directed verdicts is because it became apparent during the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Sidney Kadish, that the plaintiff would be unable to prove loss of chance injury in accordance with <em>[Matsuyama].\u201d </em>The judge earlier had ruled that, without proof of loss of chance, i.e., the injury, none of the plaintiff\u2019s other claims could go forward either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">To the extent footnote 1 of the memorandum of decision on the defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict could be interpreted to suggest otherwise, that would be in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Allegations that Isihara negligently failed to diagnose the cancer in March of 2002 were excluded by the judge because they lacked evidentiary support. The plaintiff has not appealed this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s trial counsel also represents her on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AO7\">Testimony that the cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2\u201d is functionally equivalent to testimony that the cancer was at \u201cstage 1 or stage 2.\u201d For simplicity, we use the language from the loss of chance analysis, even when referencing arguments by the parties that use the \u201cstage 1 or stage 2\u201d language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AqmS\">On the first day of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel commented that what the judge \u201cwould be looking for is for Dr. Kadish to specifically testify as to a stage of cancer.\u201d The judge did not disagree with plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Kadish testified, \u201cI can\u2019t pinpoint the stage because there were no studies. ...

It is at an earlier stage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[14]\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">14This loss of chance study is the same analysis quoted, <em>supra, </em>which opined that the cancer was \u201cno worse than stage 2\u201d at the time of the alleged negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Similarly, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked later in the bench conference: \u201cIf [Kadish] were to testify with regard to the loss of chance analysis, and then based on when he performed this analysis, he found it to be at stage 2, would the [judge] accept that?\u201d The judge responded: \u201c[Kadish] just said he couldn\u2019t do that. So, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We note that the record reflects that the judge consistently endeavored to be fair and patient with all the parties. For example, he allowed an emergency motion for reconsideration of another judge\u2019s prior order precluding the plaintiff from offering evidence of Curreri\u2019s loss of chance of survival. During the trial, the judge permitted the plaintiff to file late the interrogatory answer relating to Kadish\u2019s expert testimony, and also permitted a voir dire of Kadish so that a record could be developed for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> Judge: \u201cWhat would you like to bring out from Dr. Kadish? What is your offer of proof?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cI was going to actually take him through the loss of chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Judge: \u201cSo, what I mean is, if you\u2019d explain it to me now what he would say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cOkay. What he would say is that the cancer is not at 3B at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Judge: \u201cWhere is it then?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201cIt is somewhere in here. It is at an earlier stage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Kadish\u2019s loss of chance analysis acknowledges the critical link between the stages and the estimated five-year survival rates. The plaintiff does not suggest that survival rates could be calculated without staging the cancer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The plaintiff also claims that expert testimony traditionally has not been required to show the extent of the injury caused by the alleged negligence and argues that \u201cthe question of the extent of the decrease in . . . Curreri\u2019s chance of survival should go to the finder of fact.\u201d The plaintiff does not cite any cases in support of this argument. As such, it does not rise to the level of proper appellate argument. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Moreover, the plaintiff does not provide any nonexpert testimony on staging or on probability of survival that could substitute for Radish\u2019s expert testimony on these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
