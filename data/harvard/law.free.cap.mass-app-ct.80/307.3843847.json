Dodgson, of three counts of attempted dissemination of matter harmful to a minor within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a728 and 31; one count of dissemination of obscene matter within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 29 and 31; and two counts of enticement of a child under the age of sixteen within the meaning of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26C.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The defendant now appeals from these convictions upon grounds that (1) online instant messages are not \u201cmatter\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 31; (2) the private transmission of a picture is not \u201cdissemination\u201d of obscene material under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a729 and 31; (3) the admission of his subscription to an online adult dating service was improper; (4) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper; and (5) he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgments for dissemination of obscene matter and enticement of a child. We reverse the judgments for attempted dissemination of matter harmful to a minor, set aside those verdicts, and enter judgments for the defendant on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Background. </em>The evidence permitted the jury to find as follows. In June, 2006, Deputy Sheriff Melissa Marino and State police Trooper Peter Cooke were conducting an undercover online investigation in which each posed as a minor. On June 14, 2006, Marino entered a Yahoo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Massachusetts-based adult romance \u201cchat room\u201d using the undercover screen name \u201cmelissaqtl995.\u201d Her profile indicated that she was an eighth-grader named \u201cMelissa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The defendant, also in the chat room, sent a private instant message to \u201cMelissa\u201d under the screen name \u201calaughahugandasmile,\u201d and they began to converse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cMelissa\u201d said that she was a thirteen year old girl living in a hotel in the town of Kingston with her mother. The defendant claimed to be a twenty-four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>year old male.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The discussion quickly turned sexual, and the defendant continuously made graphic sexual remarks and proposals. He eventually sent \u201cMelissa\u201d a picture of a naked erect penis, which he claimed to be his own, and made sexually explicit comments about it. \u201cMelissa\u201d and the defendant discussed the possibility of a meeting, but made no specific plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On June 15, 2006, the defendant began a private instant message conversation with \u201cMelissa.\u201d Almost immediately, the conversation turned sexual. During the conversation, \u201cMelissa\u201d said that she was talking to her friend \u201cKrissy,\u201d who was also thirteen. \u201cKrissy\u201d was Cooke\u2019s undercover identity. The defendant suggested that the three of them should meet and engage in sexual intercourse and related activity. \u201cMelissa\u201d eventually gave the defendant \u201cKrissy\u2019s\u201d screen name, \u201ckrissy01_10_1993,\u201d and the defendant sent an instant message to her. Their conversation was also immediately and continuously sexually graphic. The defendant mentioned to \u201cKrissy\u201d the possibility of meeting both girls that night. He later made specific plans with \u201cMelissa\u201d by both instant message and a brief telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The defendant agreed to meet \u201cMelissa\u201d and \u201cKrissy\u201d at a Burger King located in Kingston. At the agreed meeting time, Marino, Cooke, and two other law enforcement officers, all undercover, parked at a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts shop across the street from the Burger King. Marino received a telephone call from the defendant and saw him on a cellular telephone in a green van. After the telephone call, Marino watched the defendant walk up and down the road in front of the Burger King. He then drove to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts lot, parked directly across from Marino and Cooke\u2019s vehicle, stared at Marino and Cooke as he exited his van, entered the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, looked at them again as he returned to his vehicle, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On June 16, 2006, the defendant sent an instant message to \u201cmelissaqtl995\u201d stating, \u201cI am glad to see the young girls of Kingston are being protected [from] potential harm.\u201d He claimed that he knew that he was communicating with a police operation and that he was testing the effectiveness of the law enforcement system. For part of this conversation, Cooke pretended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cMelissa,\u201d but eventually revealed himself as a State trooper and proposed that the defendant contact him to arrange an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On June 19, 2006, the defendant, using a computer at the office of his employer, deleted all his Yahoo contacts and edited his profile on Yahoo. He also reinstalled the Windows operating system on that computer. On June 20, 2006, the defendant created a two-page document describing the events of June 14 and 15, 2006, his motives, and the perceived flaws in the police operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On July 15, 2006, Cooke and State police Trooper Richard Long arrested the defendant. The defendant waived his Miranda rights and Cooke and Long interviewed him. During the interview, the defendant continued to assert that he knew that he was talking to the police and was testing their performance because he was concerned about his daughters\u2019 online safety. Throughout the interview Cooke challenged the defendant\u2019s claims and stated his opinion that the defendant was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">At trial, the transcript and audiotapes of Cooke\u2019s interview came into evidence without objection. Also without objection, Marino and Cooke read the instant message dialogues to the jury; the jurors then received copies of the transcript of them. Over objection, the judge allowed evidence of an adult dating site subscription found on the defendant\u2019s computer and paid for by the defendant\u2019s credit card. In his closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s guilt, his ability to \u201crehearse\u201d his story, and his lack of communication with his wife about his testing of Internet law enforcement. Defense counsel objected unsucr^-fuily the prosecutor\u2019s reference to guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\"><em>'Uscussion. </em>1. <em>Online messages as \u201cmatter harmful to a child.\u201d </em>eral Laws c. 272, \u00a7 28, as amended by St. 1982, c. 603, provides: \u201cWhoever disseminates to a minor any matter ml to minors, as defined in section thirty-one, knowing it to 1 armful to minors, or has in his possession any such matter x the intent to disseminate the same to minors, shall be pun-1 1 . ...\u201d At the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct in June, 2 i, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, as amended by St. 2002, c. 161, \u00a7 1, <em>c </em>led \u201cmatter\u201d as \u201cany handwritten or printed material, visual : esentation, live performance or sound recording including but i limited to, books, magazines, motion picture films, pamphlets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>phonographic records, pictures, photographs, figures, statues, plays, dances.\u201d Here, the \u201cmatter\u201d found to have been disseminated was instant message communications over the internet. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 30-33 (2010), the court held that online electronically transmitted messages are not \u201cmatter\u201d as defined by \u00a7 31. Therefore, we must reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions for attempted dissemination of matter harmful to a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">After <em>Zubiel, </em>the Legislature amended G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, to include within the definition of matter any electronic communication, including online messages. St. 2010, c. 74, \u00a7 2 (approved April 12, 2010). The 2010 amendment, however, cannot apply retroactively to the defendant\u2019s 2006 conduct. Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, of the United States Constitution (\u201cNo State shall. . . pass any ... ex post facto Law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">2. <em>Dissemination of the picture. </em>The defendant argues that the transmission of the picture of the naked erect penis in a private online conversation does not constitute \u201cdissemination\u201d of obscene matter under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a729 and 31. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 31, inserted by St. 1974, c. 430, \u00a7 12, defines the term \u201cdisseminate,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 29, as \u201cto import, publish, produce, print, manufacture, distribute, sell, lease, exhibit or display.\u201d The defendant argues that the common thread of these words is public or commercial character. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 154-156 (2003), the defendant dropped in a residential area obscene materials from a car on three different occasions. This court held that the evidence was sufficient for a finding that the defendant had dropped the material \u201cintending and expecting that the material would be seen by individuals whom he knew were in the area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157. Thus, the defendant in <em>Rollins </em>\u201cdisseminated\u201d the material within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, despite the absence of commercial activity. <em>Id. </em>at 157-158. Additionally, we have noted that additions to the obscenity statutes by the Legislature have \u201ccriminalized behavior that is not necessarily commercial in nature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keefe, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 571 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Nor does dissemination require proof of multiple recipients. The opening words of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28, as example, recite, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cWhoever disseminates to <em>a minor </em>any matter harmful to minors . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). As one synonym of the verb \u201cdisseminate,\u201d \u00a7 31 uses the word \u201cdistribute.\u201d One can \u201cdistribute\u201d material to singular or multiple individuals. As a practical matter, distribution of obscene matter to a single individual, especially a minor, releases it for redistribution to others in either original composition or copied form. Requirement of proof of multiple original recipients would contradict the letter and impair the purpose of \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">3. <em>Admission of the online adult dating service subscription. </em>The defendant argues that the admission of his online adult dating service subscription created improper propensity evidence. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purpose of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 529 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 206 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 356, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996). Such conduct, however, may be admissible for other purposes, such as to show a \u201ccommon scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). The trial judge will \u201cdetermine whether such evidence has probative value and, if [it does], whether its probative value outweighs the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 129 (2006). On appeal, the defendant must show an abuse of discretion by the trial judge. See <em>id. </em>at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The admission of the dating service subscription was relevant to motive. The defendant claimed that the purpose of his actions was to test the law enforcement response to possible online child predators. The dating service subscription weakened that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>claim and tended to show a motive of sexual indulgence or gratification. The trial judge did not abuse her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>In his closing remarks addressing the picture of the naked erect penis, the prosecutor stated, \u201cIt is an obscene image. And the defendant is guilty.\u201d The prosecutor also used the word \u201cwe,\u201d referred to the ability of the defendant to \u201crehearse\u201d his story, and commented on the defendant\u2019s lack of communication with his wife about his claimed probe of law enforcement effectiveness. The defendant, who did not object to those statements at trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contends that those statements separately or collectively require reversal of his convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Prosecutors must confine their arguments to facts in evidence and reasonable inferences from those facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 713 (1993). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 730 (2002). We consider the statements in the setting of the closing argument as a whole, of the jury instructions, and of the evidence produced at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 471 (1998). We consider also the lack of objection at trial as \u201csome indication that the tone [and] manner . . . of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s argument were not unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">a. <em>Use of \u201cwe\u201d and references to obscenity and the defendant\u2019s guilt. </em>The prosecutor stated that the picture of the naked erect penis \u201cis an obscene image. And the defendant is guilty.\u201d While it is improper for a prosecutor to express his personal belief that the defendant is guilty, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 203 (1977), he is \u201cpermitted and expected to marshal the evidence and to argue for a decision of the controversy in favor of his client.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, 374 </em>Mass. 453, 459 (1978). Here, the prosecutor was arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the evidence proved the obscenity element of the offense and supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The reference was not an improper expression of personal belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In reference to the online messages between Marino and the defendant, the prosecutor stated that \u201cthe community standard is that those things are not what we want our kids to see and read and hear about.\u201d The defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly aligned himself with the jury and appealed to their emotions. While this court has been \u201ctroubled\u201d by the use of the pronoun \u201cwe,\u201d the fleeting use in this case was not excessive and did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burts, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 688-689 (2007). In a trial involving obscenity, the use of the word \u201cwe\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s closing may present a special problem. The definition of \u201cobscene\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, as amended by St. 1982, c. 603, \u00a7 7, requires an application of \u201ccontemporary standards of the county where the offense was committed.\u201d The prosecutor should not represent himself or herself as the source of those \u201cstandards.\u201d The use of the word \u201ccommunity\u201d rather than \u201cwe\u201d maintains the proper distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">b. <em>Rehearsal reference. </em>The defendant argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to characterize the defendant\u2019s opportunity to rehearse his testimony. In his closing argument, the prosecutor said that the defendant \u201chad all this time to come and rehearse and come on the stand and testify a year later.\u201d He went on to ask the jury to consider whether the defendant\u2019s testimony sounded \u201crehearsed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">A prosecutor should generally avoid using the term \u201crehearse\u201d because it may impinge on the defendant\u2019s right to prepare for trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 574 (1983) (improper to suggest witness\u2019s testimony was rehearsed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 541-542 (2006), <em>S.C., </em>449 Mass. 1035 (2007) (discussing defendant\u2019s right to prepare for trial). This impropriety usually arises from the prosecutor\u2019s proposal that the defendant, or a witness, prepared testimony with a defense attorney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ewing, supra </em>(suggesting witness testimony \u201cwas prepared or at least gone over, what I would call rehearsed, I would submit to you rehearsed before they came into this courtroom\u201d). Here, the prosecutor was suggesting that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>fabricated the explanation that he was testing the efficacy of Internet law enforcement. Prior to the rehearsal references, the prosecutor noted that the defendant had reinstalled Windows and had then written the June 20 document describing his plan to test Internet policing. The prosecutor argued that those actions were part of a preemptive defense strategy and that the defendant had used the interim before trial to refine that ruse. In context, the references to rehearsal were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">c. <em>Marital communication. </em>With citation to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, the defendant argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to comment on the defendant\u2019s lack of communication with his wife about his police surveillance plan as evidence of consciousness of guilt. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20, as appearing in St. 1996, c. 298, \u00a7 10, provides in pertinent part that \u201cneither husband nor wife shall testify as to private conversations with the other.\u201d By its terms, the statute protects positive exchanges between spouses. It serves several historical common-law policies, including the protection of marital privacy and confidentiality. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>402 Mass. 457, 460 (1988). The prosecutor referred only to the absence of a conversation. That remark did not violate either the letter or the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>For a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that \u201cthere [was] serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defen[s]e.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). The preferred method for raising such a claim is not direct appeal but, rather, a motion for new trial directed to the original trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zinser, </em>446 Mass. 807, 810-811 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>(2006). If the motion presents a substantial factual or legal issue, that process will enable the creation of a meaningful collateral record for its exploration. See <em>id. </em>at 811. The exception to the preferred method arises if \u201cthe factual basis of the claim appears indisputably on the trial record.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). This case does not belong to that exceptional category. The defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance, which includes \u2014 among other grounds \u2014 the failure to object to offers of evidence, requires determination whether trial counsel\u2019s choices rested upon reasonable doctrinal or tactical grounds or upon \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d judgment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273 (1991). That determination typically requires a collateral record. Accordingly, we decline to entertain the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel upon the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the judgment for dissemination of obscene matter, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a729 and 31, because a private electronic transmission of a picture constitutes action to \u201cdistribute\u201d such matter; and we affirm the judgments for enticement of a child. We reverse the judgments as to attempted dissemination of matter harmful to a child, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 31, upon the authority of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. at 30-33, set aside those verdicts, and enter judgments for the defendant on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Yahoo is a Web site that provides public Internet discussion and private online conversations, which are also known as \u201cinstant messages.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 28 n.2 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The defendant conducted all instant message conversations from a computer at the office where he was working as a computer network consultant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">He was actually forty-seven.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The Legislature inserted in \u00a7 28 the phrase \u201cdisseminates to a minor\u201d by St. 1974, c. 430, \u00a7 1.
