Soldega, was convicted by a judge, sitting without a jury, of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor, second offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence of guilt and that the prosecutor made certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>improper comments in his closing argument, creating reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\"><em>Background. </em>On November 8, 2009, at about 1:30 a.m., a Hadley police officer was in a marked police cruiser at the intersection of Southbridge and River Drive. He observed an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) coming toward him \u201con a public way.\u201d The ATV was approaching the officer at an estimated speed of about sixty miles per hour. The officer activated his cruiser\u2019s lights, at which point the ATV increased its speed. The ATV\u2019s operator, later identified as the defendant, wove the vehicle back and forth over marked lanes and turned its lights on and off three or four times. The defendant then drove onto Meadow Road, causing the ATV to become airborne and thereby ejecting him. The ATV rolled on top and then off of the defendant. The officer called an ambulance. He then approached the defendant, noticing the smell of alcohol coming from him. He asked the defendant if he had been drinking, and the defendant responded, \u201cSome.\u201d The defendant was arrested and taken to the hospital, where, among other things, a technician drew his blood. The vehicle that the defendant was operating was a four-wheel ATV, specifically a large four-by-four Honda model capable of seating two people. Its size was large enough to attach a plow.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a), prohibits, among other things, the operation of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The defendant claims that because the vehicle he was operating was a recreation vehicle, the Commonwealth failed to offer sufficient evidence that the ATV was indeed a motor vehicle and therefore subject to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We agree with the defendant that \u201call-terrain vehicles\u201d and \u201crecreation vehicles\u201d are regulated by G. L. c. 90B. Nevertheless, G. L. c. 90B, \u00a7 20, as in effect prior to St. 2010, \u00a7 6, defines a \u201c[rjecreation vehicle\u201d as \u201cany motor vehicle designed or modified for use over unimproved terrain if used for recreation or pleasure <em>off a public way </em>as defined in chapter ninety\u201d (emphasis added). Therefore, because the defendant was operating his ATV on a public highway at the time in question, during that time it was exempted from the relevant regulations pertaining to \u201crecreation vehicles\u201d contained in c. 90B.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Our analysis, however, does not stop here. The term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a), but is broadly defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1, to include \u201call vehicles constructed and designed for propulsion by power other than muscular power.\u201d The statute specifically exempts those motor vehicles that cannot exceed twelve miles per hour <em>and </em>are \u201cdesigned especially for use elsewhere than on the traveled parts of ways.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1. Here, the ATV was powered by a motor and was being operated at speeds estimated at sixty miles per hour on a public highway. Therefore, although the ATV may indeed have been a \u201crecreation vehicle,\u201d in these circumstances it also fell into the category of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d subject to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The defendant\u2019s conduct is also of the type that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(ti), is meant to address in order to \u201creduc[e] the \u2018carnage caused by drunk drivers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tromble, </em>396 Mass. 81, 86 (1985), quoting from <em>South Dakota </em>v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 558 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We add that a contrary result would violate the rule of statutory construction that \u201ca statute should be construed in a fashion which promotes its purpose and renders it an effective piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 462 (1984), quoting from <em>Worcester Vocational Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor committed reversible error by vouching for the credibility of the hospital records that showed the percentage of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood. There was no objection to the comment. That omission is \u201csome indication that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>tone [and] manner ... of the now challenged aspect[ ] of the prosecutor\u2019s argument [was] not unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>453 Mass. 331, 346 n.15 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 471 (1998). Further, the judge was sitting as fact finder. Thus, we presume that he correctly instructed himself on the manner in which evidence is to be considered. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 648 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">We hold that there was no error, and if there was error, it did not amount to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">The defendant was also found guilty of failing to stop for a police officer and found responsible for operating a recreational vehicle on a public way. These matters were not mentioned in the defendant\u2019s brief, and appellate counsel acknowledged at oral argument that they were not part of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 509 (2002), we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for receipt of a stolen motor vehicle, an ATV. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griswald, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 461-462 (1984), we held that a motorized bicycle (moped) is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The defendant argues that decisions construing insurance policies control the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d In interpreting the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a), we do not adopt the narrow definition found in civil insurance law cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Since the occurrence of the events in this case, there were a number of amendments to G. L. c. 90. Those changes are not properly before this court, and accordingly they are not addressed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
