Thereafter, in 1999, defendant pleaded guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term pursuant to the plea agreement. In 2012, defendant filed two CPL 440.10 motions seeking vacatur of the judgements of conviction on the ground that neither his attorneys nor County Court advised him of the deportation consequences of his plea. The motions were denied without hearings. By permission of this Court, defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal.

Accordingly, the orders are affirmed and counsel\u2019s request for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650 [1986]; <em>see generally People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\">Peters, P.J., Lahtinen, Garry and Rose, JJ., concur.
