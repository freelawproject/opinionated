The plaintiff, therefore, had no cause of action, save as contained in the printed passage ticket, an admittedly accurate copy of which was introduced in evidence by defendant\u2019s counsel without exception on the part of the plaintiff. This evidence was properly admitted under the general denial contained in the answer, and the only objection made to its introduction was that it was not binding upon plaintiff because of the alleged subsequent special contract of transportation, which contract plaintiff failed to establish by competent proof. This printed contract for transportation from Paris to New York, which constituted the only cause of action proven by plaintiff, must be considered as an entirety, and plaintiff is bound by the terms thereof. The legal effect of the written contract became, therefore, one of the principal questions litigated between the parties, as to which requests to charge were submitted to the court and instructions given to the jury which in our opinion, under the authorities, constituted reversible error. \u201cIn the absence of amended pleading or stipulation, the court of review must infer the consent to try issues from the evidence offered upon the one side, and the absence of objections, or the character of the objections, if any are made, upon the other side.\u201d Frear v. Sweet, 118 N. Y. 454, 458, 23 N. E. 910, 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-22\">The opinion previously filed herein has been corrected, so as to eliminate the erroneous reference to the proposed amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-23\">For the reasons above stated, and for the further reason that an application, if made at Special Term, to amend the answer so as to allege limited liability, would doubtless be granted, thus limiting plaintiff\u2019s recovery to $100, the motion for a reargument is hereby denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
