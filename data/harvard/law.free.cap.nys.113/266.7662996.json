J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuN\">Courts are not looking for pretexts to destroy wills. A disposition of property by a testator with a disposing mind is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sumed to be just and equitable. Such disposition will be upheld by the courts unless it is in contravention of some statute. The statute of. wills is a wise statute, and all instruments drawn as wills will be tested by its provisions, and condemned where they are obnoxious either to its letter or its spirit. In the will in question the eighth paragraph is concluded by a marginal insertion. There is neither a statute nor a decision of a court which holds invalid a will simply because an insertion has been put into the margin upon the same page. The statute of wills has never attempted to condemn or prevent interlineations and insertions in the will itself. It has only condemned those additions which are inserted after the signature and wills where such insertions have been attempted. If this marginal insertion, therefore, had all been above the line of the signature, it cannot be doubted that this paper would have been without the condemnation of the statute. Because part of a sentence\u2014a single phrase of the marginal insertion \u2014comes below the line of the signature, the attempted disposition of the property of the testatrix has been nullified. This, too, where the clause which appears below the line of the signature is a wholly immaterial clause. It adds nothing to the will, and in fact the entire eighth provision simply declares a distribution which the law itself would decree with the provision omitted. If this will, then, be subject to the condemnation of the statute, as not signed at the end thereof, it is not because that part below, the line of the signature was or may have been inserted in fraud. It is not because any mischief was or may have been caused to prevent which the statute was enacted. In other words, the form of the proposed will is in no way obnoxious to the spirit of the statute, nor to its letter, except by a most technical construction. Such a technical construction of the statute, which results in thwarting a presumably just distribution of property, should not, in my judgment, be upheld by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The decisions of the courts in this and other jurisdictions, holding that a material portion of a will following the testator\u2019s subscription renders void even that portion of the will prior to such subscription, are based upon the principle that the testator presumably makes his will as a completed whole. It is, therefore, impossible to assume that he would wish .only a part of it to stand, and the entire will is accordingly refused probate, as not complying with the statute. Sisters of Charity v. Kelly et al., 67 N. Y. 409, 416; Matter of Will of O\u2019Neil, 91 N. Y. 516, 524; Glancy v. Glancy, 17 Ohio St. 184. It will be noted, however, that in each case where this doctrine, has been applied the latter portion of the will covered an important or material provision, usually expressly so described by the courts, and I find no case holding that an unimportant or immaterial subsequent provision has any such effect. Obviously the principle mentioned will not, then, apply, for it rests on the assumption that a testator would not wish his will to stand with any material part stricken, out. But- if it be admitted that the part objected to, or to be stricken out, is actually immaterial, there is, then, no reason assignable why the testator, if living, could object to its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The case of Baker v. Baker et al., 51 Ohio St. 217, 37 N. E. 125, was under a statute requiring subscription \u201cat the end\u201d of the will. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The testator appointed his sister-in-law as executrix, and then, after his signature, added the clause, \u201cMy sister-in-law is not required to give bond when probated.\u201d This clause, if valid, would have been, under the Ohio statutes, subject to the discretion of the court admitting the will to probate, which might have required a bond, or not, as might seem expedient, or might have required a bond at any time subsequently. See page 224 of 51 Ohio St., page 125 of 37 N. E. Although the Ohio rule is similar to the New York rule as regards material provisions below the signature (see Glancy v. Glancy, supra), and although it was in this case clearly recognized that dispositive parts of the will should be above the signature, the court held that other parts below the signature might be excluded from probate, and yet not invalidate the entire instrument. But the part written below must not be \u201cof a dispositive nature, nor contain anything likely to affect the construction of the will or the rights of the beneficiaries (pages 222, 223 of 51 Ohio St., page 127 of 37 N. E.).\u201d The clause in question was accordingly rejected as' unessential, and the balance of the will admitted to probate. To the same effect is the dictum of the court in the late case of Irwin v. Jacques, 71 Ohio St. 395, 73 N. E. 683, 69 L. R. A. 422, where an important or dispositive provision was carried along a margin and below the signature. In holding the will not signed \u201cat the end thereof,\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201cIf the language so written has no legal signification, and has no effect on the other provisions of the will, it might be treated as mere unimportant surplusage, as in Baker v. Baker et al.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In the recent case of Ward et al. v. Putnam et al., 119 Ky. 889, 85 S. W. 179, under similar statutes, it was held that a subsequent clause appointing an executor did not invalidate a prior and dispositive part of the will, as the addition did not in any wise, \u201caffect the disposition of the estate contemplated by the testator.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">\u201cWhere the signature is placed at the close of the substantial provisions of the document, and the writing as signed is sufficient to effectuate the intention of the party signing it, the statute is substantially complied with, although there may be words following the signature which are unessential to the validity of the instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">It will be seen that the opinion in this case is based on the- general principle that nonsubstantial or unessential portions of a will may be excluded, although it declines to follow the decisions of this and some other states which hold in effect that a clause appointing an executor is a substantial part of a will. The rule as laid down by Page on Wills (1901), at page 206, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">\u201cIf the clause added below the signature neither affects the disposition of the estate nor appoints executor or guardian, the authorities are unanimous that such clause does not invalidate the will, and that within the meaning of the statute the signature is at the end of the will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">The statutes requiring the testator to subscribe \u201cat the end\u201d of the will are obviously intended to prevent fraud in the way of unauthorized additions, and so are to be \u201cstrictly construed.\u201d Matter of Andrews, 162 N. Y. 1, 11, 56 N. E. 529, 48 L. R. A. 662, 76 Am. St. Rep. 294. See, also, Matter of Will of O\u2019Neil, supra; Younger v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Duffie, 94 N. Y. 535, 539, 46 Am. Rep. 156; Glancy v. Glancy, supra. But in the case of unimportant and nondispositive matter following the signature I think, to use the language of Judge Earl in Younger v. Duffie, that \u201cthe case is not within the mischief intended to be guarded by the statute.\u201d No wrong can possibly arise from the addition of admittedly unimportant provisions after the signature, and I accordingly see no reason why such a provision, as in the will at bar, may not be stricken out and the portion of the will above the signature\u2014the only material and essential part of the instrument\u2014 admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Decree appealed from reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to surrogate, to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Decree reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to surrogate, to proceed in accordance with opinion. All concur; KELLOGG, J., in memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b304-7\">JOHN M. KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM7f\">(concurring). I concur in the result. The words in the margin are written across the left-hand margin from left to right opposite the clause in the will appointing the ex- . ecutor and the testamentary clause, and are found in 19 lines of from one to four words each. Eleven lines are found below the name of the testator, and the last line is on the same line, substantially, where the name of the last subscribing witness is found, and three inches below the name of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">If these marginal words contained any disposing provision or any matter which affected the disposition or management of the testator\u2019s estate, we might well say that the testator had not signed the will at the end thereof; but the effect of the will is the same in every respect, whether these words are treated as a part of the will or not. If contained in the will, they would have no more effect upon it than a discussion of the weather conditions. They are not, therefore, any part of the will, and should not be treated as a part of it, when the only effect of such treatment is to vitiate a will otherwise valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">I think, therefore, that these marginal words should be disregarded, and that the will is executed in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
