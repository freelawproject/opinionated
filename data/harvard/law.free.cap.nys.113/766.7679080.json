A reading of the complaint shows clearly that it is an action for work, labor, and services, and not for a sale of goods, as claimed by the defendant. Where a chattel is in existence at the time the contract is made, and the vendor is to do some work upon it to adapt it to the uses of the vendee, such contract is a sale. But the complaint in the case at bar alleges that the plaintiff \u201cmade\u201d for the defendant \u201cclothes and coats.\u201d Clearly these chattels were not in existence, but were to be made by the plaintiff, and therefore the contract does not fall within the rule above stated. It may also be said that there is no evidence that even the material out of which the clothes and coats were to be made was in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-22\">Judgment overruling demurrer affirmed, with costs, with leave to defendant to plead, upon payment of the costs in the court below and in this court within five days. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
