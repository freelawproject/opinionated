Y. Supp. 232. But on further review of the second trial, and in consideration of the additional evidence, we think that the judgment of dismissal at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">The trolley surface road of the defendant was along a highway which ran through the lands of the plaintiff. The time of the accident \"'as 11 o\u2019clock o. m., but the moon was full. The motorman saw four cows ahead of him, on the west side of the track, at a place where there was a steep bank and a wall. He first saw the cows on that bank, or in the gutter, 75 or 80 feet away. The space between the wall and the west rail was 8 or 10 feet wide. As the car went along, the cow, afterwards struck by the car, started to go onto the track. The motorman supposed that the animal was about to cross the track when his car was 40 or 50 feet distant from her. When he first saw the cows 75- feet away they were in a safe place, and he judged that his car could proceed without striking them. He took no precautions whatever when he thus saw them, but \u201ckept moving right along.\u201d We think it was for the jury to say, in view of the proximity of the cows to the track, confined as they were by the physical conditions which we have described, whether the motorman exercised due care in running his car without taking any precautions to avoid any possible ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>cident. It is well to note the fact that the additional evidence is not subject to the criticism that it was furnished by friendly witnesses to eke out or to obviate the shortcomings of the plaintiff\u2019s case on the first trial, but that it was obtained from the lips of the defendant\u2019s motorman.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial should be ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Judgment and order of the County Court of Westchester County reversed on reargument, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
