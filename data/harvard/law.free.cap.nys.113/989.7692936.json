At the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence the trial court dismissed the complaint as to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Reid &amp; Co., were contractors engaged in the construction of a building on 135th street, in the borough of Manhattan. For the purpose of getting the required materials' to the different floors of the building as it progressed, they rented from the defendant, the Pelham Operating Company, a hod elevator, with its appliances, which they operated with their own men, with the exception of an engineer, who ran the engine moving the elevator itself, as and when directed by signals given him by the employ\u00e9s of Reid &amp; Co. from the different floors where they were working. The compensation of the engineer was included in the rental paid to the Pelham Operating Company. He was under the direction, in all things, of the foreman and employ\u00e9s of Reid &amp; Co., and Mr. Reid testified that after the installation of the elevator it was operated by his men. The plaintiff was an ironworker, in the employ of the Howell Iron Company (which furnished and erected the structural ironwork of the building) j and on the day of the accident he went to the cellar of the building for the purpose of getting a drink of water. While in the cellar the elevator came down, striking him and causing .the injury for which he seeks to recover damages in this action. There was no work being done in the cellar at the time of the accident. There was no sign, guard, or warning, at the elevator shaft or at any other place in the cellar, directing attention to the elevator, or to any danger to be apprehended from its operation, or preventing a person from walking under the opening through which the elevator was lowered into the cellar. When the plaintiff rested his case, the defendant moved for a nonsuit. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded that there was no question of negligence in operation, other than the one of guard and warning, and the learned trial justice dismissed the complaint. All questions save the one of whether the elevator was without \u201cproper guard or warning about its shaft or runway\u201d were thus eliminated. It is not seriously contended that the dismissal as to the defendant, the Pelham Hod Operating Company, was improper. The defendant the Pelham Operating Company was not \u201cthe contractor or owner\u201d required to cause the shafts or openings in each floor to be inclosed or fenced in on all sides, by the provisions of section 30, c. 193, of the Raws of 1899, which was the only statute upon the subject in force at the time of the accident. There is no proof of any negligence on the part of the engineer, and the cases cited in which liability of hod elevator companies has been predicated upon the negligence of their engineers in raising or lowering the elevator without or contrary to signals given are not applicable, even were it to be held that in his work the engineer operating the elevator was the servant of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">It is contended that outside of the statutory requirement, the duty rested upon those operating the elevator to guard against such danger as could or ought reasonably to be apprehended in the exercise of reasonable prudence and care. Conceding this rule of law to be cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>rect, it has no application to this case, for it is shown that the defendant was not operating the elevator. From the time of its installation it had been operated by the contractor, Reid &amp; Co., as testified to by Mr. Reid, and the liability, if any, for a negligent operation of the elevator at the time of the injury, rested upon that company, and not upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be overruled, his motion for a new trial denied, and judgment for the defendants may be entered, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
