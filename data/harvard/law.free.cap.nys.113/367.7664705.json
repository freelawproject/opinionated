One of the findings upon which the judgment was entered was to the effect that the relator was entitled to recover the costs of the proceeding at the same rate as in an action to be taxed, and also certain disbursements, together with $150 as damages for a false return. The judgment entered simply awarded the plaintiff $150 as damages for a false return and $18 disbursements. The final order directed that the relator recover $150 as damages assessed for counsel fees and $18 as disbursements, making a total of $168.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">Damages for a false return to a writ of mandamus should not include the relator\u2019s counsel fees or other disbursements of the trial. People ex rel. Lally v. New York Central &amp; Hudson River R. Co., 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>App. Div. 849, 102 N. Y. Supp. 385. So far as the judgment and final order award damages for counsel fees, the same are erroneous. It is evident from the findings that the court intended to award costs to the relator as in an action. This it had a right to do. Section 2086 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides that, where an alternative writ of mandamus has been issued, costs may be awarded as in an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We think, therefore, that the judgment should be modified, by striking out the award of $150 damages and $18 disbursements, and inserting in place thereof a provision to the effect that the relator is entitled to recover costs, including disbursements, in the proceeding as in an action. Then the judgment in this respect will conform to the finding. The final order should also be modified by striking therefrom the provision that the relator is entitled to recover from the respondent \u201cthe sum of $150 as damages assessed for counsel fees and the sum of $18 as disbursements,\u201d and inserting in place thereof a provision to the effect that the relator is entitled to recover from the respondent the costs and disbursements of the proceeding as in an action, to be taxed by the clerk in the manner provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">As thus modified, the orders and judgment appealed from are affirmed, without costs to either party in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
