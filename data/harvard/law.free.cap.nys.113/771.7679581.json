She says that, while in the employ of defendant\u2019s mother as cook, defendant asked her to do this extra work at a stipulated price. SEe was the only witness. Before defendant made any motion, and without hearing the defense, the court gave judgment for defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted, is not opposed to the probabilities, and is not in its nature surprising or suspicious. Second Nat. Bank v. Weston, 172 N. Y. 250, 64 N.
