On petition by an administrator of an intestate the Surrogate\u2019s Court may make a decree empowering him to sell real estate of the intestate to pay debts and funeral expenses; and thereupon, but after first filing in the said court his bond with two sureties, in a penalty to be fixed by the Surrogate, for the faithful performance of his duties, he shall have the same power of sale of such real estate as if he were acting as executor under a will of the decedent containing a power of sale of real estate to pay debts and funeral expenses. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2750 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>et seq. Until such decree has been made, and he is under the sanction of such bond, he has no power to make a contract of sale.
