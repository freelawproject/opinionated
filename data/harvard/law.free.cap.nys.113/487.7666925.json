She had no knowledge or information, nor was there any circumstance which would lead her to believe that the substance was not butter.- Indeed, it was necessary to have a chemical analysis to determine that it was oleomargarine colored to imitate butter. It was conceded on the trial that the defendant was entirely innocent-of intent to violate the statute, and a willful violation thereof is nbt ascribed to her. Under the circumstances I think the maximum penalty should not have been imposed. A penalty of $50 would have been adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment to $50, in which event the judgment, as modified, is affirmed, but without costs to either party in this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
