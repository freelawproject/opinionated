Upon this petition an alternative writ of prohibition was granted, by which the defendant was required to show, cause why the writ should not be made absolute. The Special Term denied this application, and the relator appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Section 50 of the insurance law (chapter 690, p. 1954, of the Laws of 1892) provides that every person or corporation acting as agent for any foreign insurance company shall annually on the 1st of January or within 60 days thereafter procure a certificate of authority from the Superintendent of Insurance, who shall file in his office evidence of the issuance of such certificate to the agent as aforesaid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>And section 91 of the insurance law provides that no person shall act as agent, subagent, or broker in the solicitation or procurement of applications for insurance, or for any policy of insurance, for any life insurance company doing business in this state, without first procuring from the Superintendent of Insurance a certificate of authority, which must be renewed annually on the 1st day of January, or within 60 days thereafter-. By chapter 326, p. 774, of the Laws of 1906, a new section (section 60) was added to the insurance law, which, as amended by chapter 347, p. 1015, of the Laws of 1908, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">\u201cNo life insurance company doing business in this state, and no officer, director or agent thereof, shall issue or circulate, or cause or permit to be issued or circulated, any estimate, illustration, circular or statement of any sort, misrepresenting the terms of any policy issued by it, or the benefits or advantages promised thereby, or the dividends or share of surplus to be received thereon, or shall use any name or title of any policy or class of policies misrepresenting the true nature thereof. Nor shall any such corpora' tion or agent thereof make any misrepresentation to any such person insured in another company for the purpose of inducing or tending to induce such person to lapse, forfeit or surrender his said insurance. Any violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Insurance to revoke the license of the corporation or agent so offending.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The charges referred to in the petition called the attention of the Superintendent of Insurance to an alleged violation of this provision of the insurance law. The Superintendent then notified the relator that he would be given a hearing in relation to such charges. The court at Special Term denied the application, upon the ground that the act of the Superintendent of Insurance in revoking such license was not judicial, but administrative, and that voluntarily giving notice to the relator of the charges and affording him an opportunity of being heard does not transform the proceeding from one in its nature administrative to one that is judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The statute does not require that a person applying to the Superintendent of Insurance for a certificate of authority should produce evidence of their qualifications or character. Section 50 provides that every agent shall annually on the 1st day of January, or within 60 days thereafter, procure a certificate of authority from the Superintendent; and section 91 provides that no person shall act as agent without first procuring such a certificate. Section 91 further provides that on the conviction of a person to whom such a certificate of authority has been issued of a violation of that or the preceding section the Superintendent should immediately revoke the certificate of authortiy issued to such agent. Thus, before the amendment of section 60 of the insurance law, a certificate of authority once issued was irrevocable, except on the conviction of' the holder under either section 90 or section 91 of the act (Laws 1892, pp. 1971, 1972, c. 690). By the addition of section 60, however, with its amendment of 1908, a misrepresentation by an agent was made a misdemeanor, and it was made the duty of the Superintendent to revoke the authority of the person so offending against the provisions of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>. I think it may fairly be said that two penalties were provided for the violation of this section: First, by punishment in a criminal proceeding ; and, second, by the revocation of the certificate of authority which had theretofore been issued by the Superintendent of Insurance. The provisions of section 60 of the insurance law are entirely distinct from the provisions of section 91 of the same act. By section 91 the revocation is to follow upon the conviction of the agent of a violation of sections 90 or 91. Under section 60, the revocation of the certificate of authority depends upon the violation by the agent of that particular section. If this is a penalty imposed by law for a violation of a law, it would seem to follow that the officer charged with the duty of revoking the license had necessarily to determine whether the law had been violated before exercising the authority conferred upon him to revoke the license. He had authority to revoke the license of a person \u201cso offending\u201d only, and therefore, before he could exercise that authority, there was imposed upon him the duty of determining whether, the person had \u201cso offended.\u201d It is true the statute contains no provision for notice to the agent, or that he should have an opportunity of being heard before the Superintendent of Insurance should revoke the license; but, because of the nature of the offense and the serious consequences which would ensue upon a revocation of the license, I am inclined to think that, although there is no express provision for notice, such a condition was implied, and action by the Superintendent of Insurance without notice, and without an opportunity of the person charged with a violation of the section to be heard, would\" be a violation of his right to pursue his calling. There was clearly contemplated an investigation by the Superintendent of Insurance of the question as to whether the person against whom the proceeding was taken had violated the provisions of the section; and, if the question was now- before us, I am inclined to think that such a proceeding was in its nature judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The determination of that question, however, is not presented upon this appeal. Assuming that the proceeding before the Superintendent was in its nature judicial, he would necessarily have to determine whether the charges were or were not sufficient to justify the revocation of the certificate of authority, and whether proof of a violation of section 60 of the insurance law justified his acting, and he would therefore have jurisdiction to determine that question in the first instance, subject to review by a proper proceeding. If there was a judicial proceeding, it was the Superintendent of Insurance who had jurisdiction to determine it; and there could be no assumption that the Superintendent would improperly determine the question submitted to him. If, as the relator contends, the certificate of authority could only be revoked after the conviction of the holder of the certificate of a misdemeanor for a violation of the section, we must assume that the Superintendent would so decide.. It is not really a question of jurisdiction at all, but a question of whether, on the facts presented to the Superintendent, he was justified in revoking the certificate of authority. Of course, if the act of the Superintendent in proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\"ing under this section was not in its nature judicial, but administrative or executive, the writ of prohibition would not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">So, whatever way it is considered, the court below correctly refused to make the writ permanent; and, without passing upon any of the other questions presented upon this appeal, the order is affirmed, for the reason that, whether the action is judicial or administrative, a writ of prohibition would not lie, with $50 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">CLARKE, HOUGHTON, and SCOTT, JJ., concur. LAUGH-LIN, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
