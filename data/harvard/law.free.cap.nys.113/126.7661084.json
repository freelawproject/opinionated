This case is no exception to the general rule that payment has to be pleaded as a defence. That the condition of the bond depends on payment by one other than this defendant does not make a difference. The bond is not to be construed, as the appellant contends, as an obligation in form to pay the judgment if the defendant therein does not, in which an allegation of non-payment might be necessary to the complaint. It is an absolute undertaking to pay, followed by a condition that it shall be void upon payment, which is the usual form.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.
