Having removed the defendants by summary proceedings, the right to recover for a breach of the covenant remained in force. Vernon v. Brown, 40 App. Div. 204, 58 N. Y. Supp. 11. In that case rental value and cost of restoration were allowed as damages, as herein may be allowed the rental value and cost of removal of property belonging to the defendants, but not the sums allowed by the court below consisting of counsel fee, marshal\u2019s fees, and charges for taking out the precept, service of same, and putting the summary proceedings on the calendar, as not properly contemplated within the result of the breach of the covenant sued on. The judgment should therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>be reduced by the sum of $38.50, and, as thus modified, affirmed without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Judgment modified by being reduced by the sum of $38.50, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.
