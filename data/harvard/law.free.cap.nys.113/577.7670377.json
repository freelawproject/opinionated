Y. Due to delay in the delivery of the goods, plaintiff and his several guests who made up a camping party were compelled to put up at a hotel. He voluntarily paid the expenses of the entire party, arid sued to recover the amount. Judgment was given in his favor for the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">Hotel bill for seven .persons for five days at $2 per day............. $70 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">Expressage on parcel sent by freight through the error of the defendant <em>company.....\u25a0.............................\u25a0.................. </em>35</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">Telephone message notifying the Express Company of the nonarrival of the articles shipped........................................... GO</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">$70 95</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">That an erroneous measure of damages was applied is obvious. \u201cThe carrier will not be liable for profits lost by\" reason of failure to perform a special contract, or on account of other special circumstances not apparent from the transaction itself, unless he has notice of the facts which caused the loss. And this notice should be given when the goods are delivered for transportation.\u201d 6 Cyc., p. 450. Notice to the driver of the express wagon that he \u201crequired these things urgently\u201d was not a sufficient compliance with fhis rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">HENDRICK, J., concurs. GIEGERICH, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
