One paragraph of his complaint alleges that the defendants are partners. The next paragraph alleges a sale and delivery of the goods to the defendants. The defendant Moses Colish answered. On the trial, plaintiff could not prove the partnership; but at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case defendant\u2019s counsel admitted that Moses Colish owed $188.25, which is the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Plaintiff then moved to amend the complaint, so as to allege a cause of action against Moses Colish individually, instead of against a partnership, and to discontinue as against the other defendant, and to amend the summons and complaint by striking out the words \u201cand as copartners,\u201d which motion the court took under advisement, together with defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of the whole case. Subsequently the court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">Since the proposed amendment was not opposed on the ground of surprise, such motion should have been granted. Universal Cutter Co. v. Emden (Sup.) 107 N. Y. Supp. 669; Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1542, c. 580) \u00a7 166; Langbein\u2019s Mun. Ct. Pr. (6th Ed.) pp. 329, 300, and cases there cited. But it was not necessary to make such a motion. Where two or more are sued as joint debtors, and plaintiff fails, to establish a joint liability against all, judgment may be had against one, if only one is liable. Stimson v. Van Pelt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>66 Barb. <em>151; </em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Theiss, 23 Misc. Rep. 625, 52 N. Y. Supp. 163, distinguishing Hand v. Rogers, 16 Misc. Rep. 17, 37 N. Y. Supp. 657, relied on by the defendant; Lawton v. Partridge, 111 App. Div. 8, 97 N. Y. Supp. 516. It is certainly going pretty far to dismiss the complaint in an action for goods sold and delivered, where one of the defendants admits owing the amount sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and judgment entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant Moses Colish for the relief demanded in the complaint, with costs in the court below. All concur. ' \u2018 \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
