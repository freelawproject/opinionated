His testimony that he tried to buy livers in the open market, and found that none could be had, took the measure of damages out of the general rule. It became a question'then as to whether there was or was not a market for livers. On that point there was a conflict of testimony, and it was for the jury, and not for the court, to determine the fact. The trial court erred in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint at the end of the defendant\u2019s case, and the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
