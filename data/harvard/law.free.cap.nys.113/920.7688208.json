Newberg failed to take or pay for the labels, and plaintiff sued defendant and obtained judgment. It seems to us that the judgment is so clearly against the evidence that a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
