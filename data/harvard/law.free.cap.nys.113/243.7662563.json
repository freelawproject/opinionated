This motion is by the plaintiff to have our order of reversal amended so as to read \u201cReversed upon the law and not upon the facts.\u201d There is no such form of reversal in any case, and it would serve no purpose to grant the motion. It would in no way affect the status of the appeal to the Court of Appeals, but would be useless verbiage. The motion is made out of an entire lack of knowledge on the subject, which could only result from a failure to read the statute which is applicable, although we have been at much pains to point out the provisions of such statute and the practice in respect of orders of reversal. Brennan v. City of New York, 123 App. Div. 7, 107 N. Y. Supp. 455; Duryea v. Zimmerman, 123 App. Div. 805, 108 N. Y. Supp. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-17\">The motion is denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
