The defendant appeared specially and procured the dismissal of the action. Judgment was thereupon entered for $15 costs against the plaintiff, who contends that this judgment was unwarranted by law. I agree with him, upon the ground that the Municipal Court act makes no provision for costs under such Circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The judgment should be modified, by striking out the provision for costs, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. The appeal from the order should be dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
