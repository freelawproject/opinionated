Y. The evidence shows that the goods were packed by plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9s in a car furnished by defendant and then delivered to defendant\u2019s agent, who sealed the car, but took no part in the packing of the goods. Upon the arrival of the car at its destination in New York the piece of machinery in question was found to be damaged, requiring an expenditure by plaintiff of $183:33, for which action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-22\">It was essential to plaintiff\u2019s recovery to prove that the goods, when delivered by plaintiff, were in good condition and properly packed for transportation; and the court charged the jury that if they found \u201cthat the goods were not properly packed, and this contributed in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>to the damages suffered, there can be no recovery.\u201d Plaintiff called witnesses who testified to the manner in which the goods were packed and that they were in good condition at the time of delivery to the defendant\u2019s agent. The defendant called as an expert witness one Mc-Ilgrib, who testified that he had been engaged for 42 years in the machinery business, for 10 or 15 years in the packing of machinery in railroad cars for transportation; that during that time he had packed and shipped hundreds of car loads of machinery; but that he was not familiar with book-binding machinery, except in a general way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Objection was then made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the witness was not an expert, the objection sustained, and exception noted by the defendant. \u201cThe witness had been qualified as an expert upon the subject-matter under investigation, <em>* * * </em>and he was therefore competent to give an opinion. * *\u25a0 * No such rule of limitation as that enforced by the court has ever, so far as we are aware, been applied in the case of a person who is qualified to testify as an expert upon the subject under investigation.\u201d Scandell v. Columbia Construction Co., 50 App. Div. 512, 64 N. Y. Supp. 232. See, also, Scheider v. Amer. Bridge Co., 78 App. Div. 163, 79 N. Y. Supp. 634. The exclusion of such testimony was prejudicial to defendant, and constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">The trial justice also erred in admitting testimony as to declarations and admissions made by alleged agents of the defendant, without competent proof as to their authority to make such admissions or declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
