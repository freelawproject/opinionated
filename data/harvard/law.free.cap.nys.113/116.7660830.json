The clerk taxed all of the costs of the action to the date of the order, including the costs before notice of trial, $15, and four term fees, $40, and the order appealed from denied a motion for retaxation. The purpose of the condition is to reimburse the successful party at the trial for the disbursements incurred and the services performed which are rendered futile by the order setting aside the verdict. Had it been intended to allow all costs of the action, the order would have so stat.ed. The costs after notice of trial, $15, and the .trial fee, $30, are allowed for services which will have to be performed again, and are the costs intended to be imposed by the order. The items of $15, costs before notice of trial, and $40, term fees, should be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The order, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for retaxation in accordance herewith is granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
