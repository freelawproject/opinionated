The amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff was agreed upon by both parties, and the jury found for the plaintiff. The judgment is attacked for an alleged error in the charge. The portion of the charge in question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-20\">\u201cIf you believe that any witness who has testified in this case has testified falsely to a material fact in the case, you must disregard the testimony as to that fact; you may disregard this entire testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">The above quoted language is a portion of the main charge, and the criticism is for the omission of the word \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cwillfully.\u201d This omission was an error, and an exception was duly taken. The weakness of the appellant\u2019s position lies in the fact that the trial counsel did not clearly point out the error, and indicate specifically to the court the real purpose of his exception. McGinley v. United States Life Ins. Co., 77 N. Y. 495. The record is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-22\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I except to that portion of your honor\u2019s charge where you said \u2018where any witness has testified falsely as to any particular matter.*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-23\">\u201cThe Court: I said as to material fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-24\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: As to a material fact\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-25\">\u201cThe Court: That they must disregard his testimony as to that fact. They may disregard his entire testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-26\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I except to that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-27\">It is apparent that the learned trial judge understood that it was the claim of the defendant\u2019s counsel that the charge contained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>words falsely as to \u201cany particular matter,\u201d whereas the words \u201cmaterial fact\u201d had properly been used. Counsel should have requested the proper complementary instruction. Had such a request been refused. an exception would clearly have been available. It will be observed that counsel was interrupted by the court, and not allowed to complete his statement. This may be treated as some excuse for not making a suitable request to charge, and also for failure to be c sufficiently explicit. In the face of the well-settled rule that \u201cfor error in the charge of the court the judgment must be reversed, unless the prevailing parties show affirmatively that the error could not possibly have influenced the verdict,\u201d under the circumstances disclosed, we think the judgment should not be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">SEABURY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGRg\">(concurring). The part of the charge of the court to which the defendant\u2019s counsel took exception was incorrect. The exception being good, the appellant is entitled to a reversal of the judgment. Counsel repeated the erroneous part of the charge in the language of the court, and specifically noted his exception to it. This was all that he was required to do to be able to avail himself of his exception. It was not his fault that the learned trial justice misapprehended the point of the objection, and interrupted him in his effort to state more clearly the precise fault objected to. I do not think that counsel was required to state the proper complementary instruction. He might well have done so if the court had permitted it, but he was not required to do it in order to take advantage of the exception he had taken. The dictum contained in Lindheim v. Duys, 11 Misc. Rep. 16, 31 N. Y. Supp. 870, that counsel must request the \u201cproper complementary instructions\u201d' is contrary to the rule as declared in Goldman v. Abrahams, 9 Daly, 223. In Brickwood Sackett\u2019s on Instruction to Juries, \u00a7 300, it is stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201cThe party does not waive exceptions made to erroneous charges by reason of the fact that no request is made by him for a proper one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">I think that this is a statement of the correct rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">MacEEAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
