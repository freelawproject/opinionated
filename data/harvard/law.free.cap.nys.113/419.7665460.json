As I view this section of the tax law, it was not designed to cover any such case as this. The court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>given power to dismiss the action \u201con payment of such part of the tax as may be just or on payment of costs\u201d where it appears that the person or corporation is unable, for want of property, to pay the tax, or where \u201cfor other reasons upon the facts\u201d it seems just to the court that the tax should not be paid, but evidently this is not intended to afford an additional remedy by way of review of the legality of the assessment, depending upon no new facts. The relief to which this defendant was entitled was to be obtained upon certiorari, and the fact-that the court, up to the time when the assessment was made, had no occasion definitely to pass upon the question of law involved, did not justify the defendant in suffering the time within which certiorari proceedings might have been instituted to elapse. Presumably the law would have been similarly applied in a proceeding brought to determine the validity of this assessment, just as it was applied in the later case, and I fail to find in the situation presented any reasons which would lead the court to say that the payment' of the tax should not be enforced at the present time. The case is simply one in which the corporation assessed has abandoned its legal rights in the matter of review, not one in which new circumstances have arisen which would render the collection of the tax inequitable, and, while there appears to be no actual opposition upon the part of the city to the granting of this motion, the dismissal of the action is not consented to, and I fail to find ground for the application in the statute referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">Motion denied.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b454-6\">Argued before INGRAHAM, McLAUGHLIN, HOUGHTON, CLARKE, and SCOTT, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-7\">M.
