She was dismissed at the close of her case. After testifying that she got into the closed car, the plaintiff continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201cI could not have been very far in the car. I just passed the door. Then I started to go, and the car started and I braced myself on my right foot, waited a couple of minutes, and then, thinking everything was all right, I started again. It gave a terrific jolt and threw me, and I braced on my left foot, and with that something snapped in the inside of my left knee. * * * It jerked me. I did not fall at all. I caught the nearest thing, one of the chairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I think that the jury could infer properly from this testimony that the injury to the plaintiff was due to the fact that the car was started before the woman had gained her seat. At the time of the alleged jolt, she was still in the act of seeking a seat, and the jury, could conclude that her wait was due to the fact that the car had been started prematurely, and was incidental to her progress towards a seat. I think that the fact that the witness testified that she waited \u201ca couple of minutes\u201d was not necessarily to be taken as a statement that she desisted for 120 seconds in the act of seeking a seat. We all know well that it is common parlance to describe the briefest space of time\u2014a second or a few seconds\u2014by some such expression as \u201ca minute\u201d or \u201ca few minutes.\u201d Loosely a minute is \u201ca short space of time.\u201d Century Dictionary. I think under the rule of Dochtermann v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 32 App. Div. 13, 52 N. Y. Supp. 1051, affirmed 164 N. Y. 586, 58 N. E. 1087, stated by Cullen-, J., and adopted by us in Morrow v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 119 App. Div. 22, 103 N. Y. Supp. 998, that the plaintiff should not have been nonsuited. That rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">\u201cBut, assuming that the liability in the operation of electric cars is no greater than that of horse cars, I am still of opinion that, considering the frequency of the occurrence of such accidents, the jury might properly find that it was want of even ordinary care to start the car until a woman had obtained her seat, whatever may be the rule when the passenger is a man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">See Morrow v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., supra, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">I advise that the judgment be reversed and a new trial be granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">HOOKER and MILLER, JJ., concur. GAYNOR, J., concurs in separate opinion. WOODWARD, J., dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">GAYNOR, J. I am not willing to concur in the suggestion that it may have been negligent to start the car before the plaintiff was seated. The universal practice with stages and cars, here and abroad, is to start them before the passenger is seated. A contrary practice would be an interruption of travel which the community could not and should not tolerate. I vote to reverse on the ground of the \u201cterrific\u201d jolt. As little as we believe that it happened, it was for the jury to say.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
