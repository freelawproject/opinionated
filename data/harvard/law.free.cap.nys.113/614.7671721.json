But two questions that merit discussion are raised on this appeal: First, whether the failure to make the undertenants parties is fatal to the proceedings; and, secondly, whether the acceptance of the indorsed notes was a payment of the rent. Section 2235 of the Code does not require the undertenants to be joined. All that it requires is that the petition shall name or describe the persons against whom the special proceeding is instituted. Undertenants are proper parties to a summary proceeding, but they are not necessary parties. If a failure to name them as parties would defeat a landlord\u2019s right to evict them, the objection may be taken advantage of by the under-tenants, and not by the tenant. The tenant cannot shelter himself \u2022behind his subtenants. The notes were four in number, each for $300. They were given on April 28th for the amount of the rent for April and May. The April rent was $600. It became due on April 1st. As to that rent, two of the notes were given for an existing debt. The law is clear that, when a note is given for an existing debt, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>not discharge the debt, but the burden is on the debtor to show affirmatively that it was given and accepted in payment; and the rule is the same even if the note is that of a third party. In this case there is no such proof, and there is evidence to sustain the opposite view. The evidence in the case leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the whole transaction, so far as the tenant is concerned, was intended to defraud the landlord and deprive him of his property under the protection of law. This court, like the trial court, will not lend itself to advance such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Final order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
