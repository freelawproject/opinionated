Upon the liberal construction of pleadings more and more obtaining, the second defense contains a statement of facts, which, if established, will prevent a recovery, for, whether provable under the denial or under these affirmative allegations, the plaintiff cannot succeed on due showing that what he claims as Kries\u2019 services were in truth rendered by another without any effort or influence of Kries, and that the agreement, express or implied, upon which he alleges he relies, was induced by Kries\u2019 false and fraudulent representations. Similarly as to the counterclaim. Assuming, as it must be on demurrer, that, in the transaction in which the plaintiff claims his assignor was employed, his assignor so negligently and unskillfully performed what he had undertaken and agreed to render and do, upon the promise of payment implied or express alleged in the complaint, as to bringing loss to his employer, the plaintiff, who claims the benefits of the transaction, must accept likewise its obligations and burdens. Moreover, inasmuch as affirmative relief is demanded in the counterclaim, it is not open to a demurrer on the ground that it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof. Isabell-Porter Co. v.
