Entrance to the rear house was through the hallway of the front house and along the yard. The second story of the rear house consisted of three rooms, access to which was had by an outside stairway and landing. These three rooms were leased to one O\u2019Hara by defendant\u2019s agent. The plaintiff had paid a visit to the tenant\u2019s wife, her sister, and as she was about to depart stopped upon the landing, which gave way, throwing her to the ground and inflicting the injuries for which this action is brought. At the commencement of the trial the plaintiff was permitted to amend her complaint by alleging that the defendant, as landlord, retained control of the landings, halls, and stairways of the premises in question, and at the suggestion of the court a further amendment was inserted to the effect that the defendant agreed to keep them in repair. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the court dismissed the complaint, on the ground that there was no proof that the landlord retained control of the landing which fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We think the learned trial court took an erroneous view of the evidence. The testimony shows that the tenant\u2019s wife, having seen a notice \u201cTo let\u201d upon the premises, applied to the defendant\u2019s agent and asked him what rooms he had to let. He said he had three rooms in the rear house, access to which was by an outside stairway and along the landing to the door. Upon payment of the rent he gave her a. receipt to show to the janitress, who, he said, would give her the key. This evidence did not show a hiring of the yard adjacent to the house, and the stairway and the landing, together with the rooms, but only a hiring of the rooms themselves. This being so, it followed that the landlord retained control of the stairway and landing. Having retained such control, it became her duty to exercise reasonable care to keep .the stairway and landing in suitable repair for use. Dollard v. Roberts, 130 N. Y. 269, 29 N. E. 104, 14 L. R. A. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">This duty did not depend upon contract, but was one which the law raised without special agreement, and the second amendment to the complaint suggested by the learned court was unnecessary, and did not have the effect of changing the action from tort to contract; for the whole burden of the complaint was negligence on the part of the defendant for failure to keep that part of the premises over which she retained control in reasonable repair. The plaintiff was lawfully upon the premises, and so far as appears exercised due care on her part. She proved a prima facie cause of action, and the dismissal of her complaint was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
