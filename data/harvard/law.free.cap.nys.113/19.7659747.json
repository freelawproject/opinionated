Neither summons nor notice of entry of judgment have ever been served personally upon the defendant, who appeared only for the purpose of the motion. The judgment is therefore appealable (Dixon v. Carrucci [Sup.] 97 N. Y. Supp. 380, 383), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and likewise the order, and, it not appearing from the original papers upon which the warranty of attachment was issued whether the defendant is or is not a resident of the state, the denial of the motion to vacate the warrant was error, as by subdivision 2 of section 74 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1513, c. 580) it must appear that the defendant is a resident to entitle the plaintiff to a warrant on the ground that the defendant keeps himself concealed to avoid service of the summons. The order must therefore be reversed, and the warrant vacated, as also the judgment, for the property of the defendant is no longer duly attached, a prerequisite to the hearing and determination of an action wherein the defendant has not appeared and the summons has not been personally served upon him. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs, and the attachment vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
