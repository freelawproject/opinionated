It appears that an action was commenced against him and his partner for a copartnership debt; that his partner was served, and a judgment was obtained against the party served; but the petitioner was not served, and the clerk could only enter a judgment against the defendant served. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 456. Consequently there is no individual judgment against the petitioner. So far as appears, there was no adjudication in bankruptcy as to the copartnership, and the discharge was only an individual discharge, \u2022 and does not affect the judgment so far as it affects the copartnership property. It is only where a judgment has been rendered against a bankrupt that he can apply to have the judgment discharged. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">The order is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
