This action was brought because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of loss by a burglary committed February 26, 1904, in her premises 774 East 165th street, New York City. . The defendant pleaded and proved on the trial that th\u00e9 statement signed by the plaintiff in the schedule was not in all respects true, in that while the plaintiff had declared in the schedule, \u201cThe assured has never suffered loss by burglary, theft, or larceny, either at the premises above described or elsewhere, nor received indemnity therefor,\u201d she had suffered loss by burglary on January 13, 1903, at 319 East 72d street, and received on or about the 4th day of March of the same year from the General Accident Insurance Corporation, of Perth, Scotland, the sum of $600 under a policy of burglary insurance issued to her by that company. This breach of warranty vitiated the policy, and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The plaintiff here contends that the breach of warranty was waived, because the defendant, after the plaintiff under examination had admitted the facts of the alleged loss, continued that examination, and relies upon statements in the opinion and rulings in the case of Titus v. Glen Falls Ins. Co., 81 N. Y. 410, more or less followed in Roby v. Am. Ins. Co., 120 N. Y. 510, 24 N. E. 808, and Carpenter v. G. A. Ins. Co., 135 N. Y. 298, 31 N. E. 1015. In each of those cases, however, the facts were dissimilar to those proven here, wherein nothing was done by the defendant or its agents to lead the plaintiff to suppose that it did not intend to act upon the breach of warranty. To avail herself of such a plea of waiver, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to plead a waiver of facts which, taken together, constituted a waiver on the part of the defendant. Winter v. City of Niagara Falls, 190 N. Y. 198, 82 N. E. 1101. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">GILDERSEEEVE, P. J\u201e concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">SEABURY, J. I concur on the ground that, under the pleadings, the plaintiff could not prove a waiver.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
