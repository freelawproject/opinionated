Before the codification of all statutes relating to towns was adopted (Laws 1890, p. 1211, c. 569), an action like this was specifically authorized by statute (Rev. St. [1st Ed.] p. 349, pt. 1, c. 11, tit. 4, art. 1, \u00a7 5, as amended by chapter 534, p. 1146, Laws 1866; Town of Guilford v. Cooley, 58 N. Y. 116). It was also comprehensively provided that \u201cwhenever any controversy or cause of action shall exist between any towns of this state, or between any town and an individual or corporation,\u201d it might be tried at law or in equity. Rev. St. (1st Ed.) p. 356, pt. 1, c. 11, tit. 5, \u00a7 1. These statutes were repealed by the repealing section of the town law (Laws 1890, p. 1243, c. 569, \u00a7 240), but were not-incorporated in the said law. There is, however, a general provision therein, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">\u201cAny action or special proceeding for the benefit of a town, upon a contract lawfully made with any of Its town officers, to enforce any liability created or duty enjoined upon those officers, or the town represented by them, or to recover any penalty or forfeiture given to such officers, or the town represented by them, or to recover damages for injury to the property or rights of such officers, or the town represented by them, shall be in the name of the town.\u201d Section 182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">The crudeness of this is manifest, and shows the \u201c \u2019prentice hand,\u201d for literally it enables the town to sue itself; but the phrase \u201cto enforce any liability created or duty imposed upon those officers,\u201d is broad enough to embrace the duty to account, which is expressly put upon supervisors (section 80), the provision being taken from the section of the Revised Statutes first cited above. The prime object of the town law was to codify, not change, the law; and although the part of section 182 quoted above is apparently only to enact that the actions it specifies, which were all authorized by statutes which the town law repeals, \u201cshall be in the name of the town,\u201d it may fairly be taken to also perpetuate such rights of action, since no other part of the act does, although such provision does not' affirmatively or in so many words do so. A crude and unscientific statute cannot be construed with the same strictness as a scientific one in ascertaining its intention and effect. Matter of Hodgins v. Bingham (Sup.) 112 N. Y. Supp. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
