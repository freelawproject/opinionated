He was to pay $1.30 per gross ton, delivered. The carrying capacity of the schooner was from 300 to 320 tons. The only issue of fact involved is as to what took place immediately preceding the sailing of the vessel for New York, and this has been resolved in favor of the plaintiff. The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s brother is to the effect that, in the late afternoon of the day before the vessel sailed, its captain informed him that there was stone enough on the dock to complete the loading of the vessel and make a full cargo of 300 tons; that he was going to Boston, and if plaintiff\u2019s brother wanted him to he would hire a tugboat, and sail at noon on the following day, to which plaintiff\u2019s brother replied, \u201cAll right, if he had sufficient cargo, to hire the tugboat.\u201d This is denied by the captain, who testified that plaintiff\u2019s brother told him he would have the boat loaded that day and directed him to get a tug, and that he then informed plaintiff\u2019s brother that the vessel was not fully loaded and could take on stone until she was lowered another foot in the water. There is sufficient evidence to sustain the finding of the municipal justice, and the question of whether or not the plaintiff was bound under his contract to furnish a cargo of at least 300 tons becomes immaterial. The captain of the vessel, having prevented the loading of more stone than was on the vessel when she sailed, limited the liability of plaintiff to the compensation of $1.30 per ton for the number of tons actually carried. When the schooner reached the dock in New York, the captain refused to permit any of the stone to be unloaded or removed from the vessel until the plaintiff had paid him the freight for a full cargo of 300 tons, amounting to $390. The plaintiff thereupon advised with counsel and was informed that, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>stone being in the possession of the defendants, they had the right to retain it until the freight was paid. Plaintiff, accordingly, paid the captain, under protest, and took from him the following receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajqk\">\u201c\u00a7390oo/10o. Long Island City, Jan. 2, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cReceived from Clancy Granite Work the sum of three hundred and ninety dollars demanded as payment for cargo of stone from Quincy, Mass. Amt. protested according to contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cIP. J. Martin, Master of Sch. Helena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The cargo weighed 208% tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">It is contended that this payment was voluntary, and by operation of law precludes the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. In this contention the defendants are in error. To constitute a voluntary payment the party paying must have had the freedom of exercising his will. When he acts under any species of compulsion, the payment is not voluntary, and if a party has in his possession property belonging to 'another, and refuses to deliver such property to that other, unless the latter pays him a sum of money which he has no right to receive, and in order to obtain possession of his property the owner pays that sum, the money so paid is a payment made by compulsion and may be recovered back. Harmony v. Bingham, 12 N. Y. 99, 117, 62 Am. Dec. 142; Stenton v. Jerome and Others, 54 N. Y. 480; Scholey v. Mumford, 60 N. Y. 498; Baldwin v. Liverpool &amp; G. W. S. S., 74 N. Y. 125, 30 Am. Rep. 277; Spann v. Erie Boatman\u2019s Transportation Co., 11 Misc. Rep. 680, 33 N. Y. Supp. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The judgment, however, was erroneous to the extent of $10.83. The amount paid by plaintiff was $390. The amount he was obligated to pay was $1.30 per ton for 208% tons, amounting to $270.83. He was entitled to recover the difference between these amounts, $119.17, but has been permitted to recover $130.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Judgment modified by deducting therefrom $10.83, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs in this court to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
