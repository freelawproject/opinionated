But whether -or not this is true is beside the question. The statute requires a true statement of the material facts as they exist at the time of the making of the application, and while this court would not permit the cancellation of a certificate for some incidental matter which was in good faith in process of cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>rection at the time of making the application, where the statute requires a statement of the number of dwelling houses within a certain distance to be stated, and consents to be filed of a majority of the owners of such dwelling houses, it is not a compliance with the statute to intend to make changes in the entrances of the licensed place to exclude a dwelling house which is in fact at the time within the territory contemplated by the statute. The law requires a true statement of the material facts as they exist at the time, not what they may be at some subsequent time, and it places the burden of making this statement upon the applicant, who is bound to know the truth. The applicant in this case undoubtedly did know the truth, for it appears that he directed the measurements to be made from the place where he intended to make a new entrance, in' abandoning the old, and he took his certificate with this defect in its title, and he now has no reason to complain at the result of the special proceeding. This is the doctrine laid down in Matter of Barnard, 48 App. Div. 423, 63 N. Y. Supp. 255, and is not inconsistent with the view of this court expressed in Matter of Purdy, 40 App. Div. 133, 57 N. Y. Supp. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">There are other matters involved in this case which it does not seem necessary to discuss or determine, in view of the conclusion which we have reached upon the exclusion of the dwelling house above considered from the statement made by the defendant in his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Order affirmed, with S10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
