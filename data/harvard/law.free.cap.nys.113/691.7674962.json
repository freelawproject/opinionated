These allegations the plaintiffs hardly made out. They offered no evidence of anything visible to an alert observer to indicate need of precaution. The roof was not shown out of repair in any wise. It had been thoroughly overhauled in the autumn for the winter. It appeared that an extraordinary rainfall in the Sunday night of the 5th to 6th of February raised water upon the roof, covered with snow and ice, above the chimney flashings, which were in good ord\u00e9r, something which had not happened in the history of 10 years or more of the building, an occurrence not likely to be foreseen or prevented with ordinary care. The information claimed to have been given of something being the matter with the roof was that on the preceding Friday, the 3d, one of the plaintiffs said to Mr. Eagan, the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper and collector, that the roof must be repaired, or h\u2019e.would get out, and that Eagan promised to repair. For making repairs there was seemingly hardly reasonable opportunity' before the storm of Sunday. If the reasonableness of the time or delay under the circumstances was a question for the jury to determine, that determination was prejudiced by the admission of much evidence irrelevant to the issue proffered by the plaintiffs, such as conduct and occurrences under prior leases, negotiations with Eagan for the subsisting lease, results of talks' with Eagan, his superintending installation of a fire sprinkler, consenting to cutting a hole between the fifth and sixth floors, conversations respecting leaks, all during the prior term, errors in admission of evidence sufficient for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Throughout the trial, however, the chief contention turned upon the effect of a covenant to repair, with a saving proviso running:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">\u201cThe said lessor agrees to make * * * all repairs to the roof and exterior of said building, but it is understood that the lessor shall not be liable to the said lessee for any damage caused by leakage of the roof, vault lights or skylights unless the lessor neglects to repair the same within a reasonable time after a written notice of such leakage is delivered to the said lessor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">This condition, now often stipulated to forefend forced purchases by lessors of goods in lofts, goods claimed to be in rented lofts, it was sought to evade by testimony that the lessor\u2019s bookkeeper and collector, when told of leaks in November and December, 1904, and in January, during the term of a prior lease containing the same condition, said he would have it attended to, and that, upon being asked whether it would be necessary to give a written notice, he said it was not necessary so long as he was informed of it. There is no question that attention was given to such information, one of the plaintiffs testifying that every time he was called up, in fact, he sent somebody to look after it. The information notification of attention needed in the mutual interest of the lessor and the lessee may not be confused with the written notice made a condition precedent to casting the defendant in damages. Nor might the statement of the bookkeeper, if he made it which he denies, be distorted into a waiver of what he had no authority to waive. Nobody\u2019s collector and bookkeeper, nor even be he a general caretaker and factotum, can abrogate a covenant stipulated with his principal unless the latter has actually given him authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>so to do, or by his own acts have appeared to clothe him with that authority. An employ\u00e9 cannot endue himself with authority by his own assertion or by his acquiescence or by his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">To fortify his contention that the written notice was waived, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel cites a passage from the opinion in Underwood v. Farmers\u2019 Joint-Stock Ins. Co., 57 N. Y. 500:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of estoppel lies at the foundation of the law as to waiver. While one party has time and opportunity to comply with a condition precedent, if the other party does or says anything to put him off from his guard and to induce him to believe that the condition is waived or that a strict compliance with it will not be insisted on, he is afterwards estopped from claiming nonperformance of the condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">He predicates application of this doctrine upon the statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cIt is conceded that there was a waiver of written notice by the course of dealings adopted between the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s agents acting under his express authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The very contrary appears. Moreover, the doctrine as to waiver so expressed was not concurred in by the brethren on the bench of the learned commissioner who wrote it (page 506 of 57 N. Y.). The decision itself was distinguished and limited later. Harris v. Burdett, 73 N. Y. 136. The doctrine was even restricted in the opinion itself by reference with approval to \u201cthe true rule\u201d laid down in Ripley v. \u00c6tna Fire Ins. Co., 30 N. Y. 136, 86 Am. Dec. 362. Applicable herein that doctrine might be only on assuming as facts, although absolutely contradicted, that one of-the plaintiffs told Eagan on Friday they would move out unless the roof were repaired; that they remained. because Eagan promised, denied also, to repair and waived a notice in writing, denied again; that there was reasonable opportunity to repair a roof covered with ice and snow before rainfall of Sunday; that Eagan, in waiving the covenanted condition precedent to casting his employer in damages, acted within the authorized sphere of authority with which he had been clothed by the defendant; and that the waiver was supported by an agreement founded upon a valuable consideration. Waiver, so authorized and supported, there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The counsel for the plaintiffs further relies, perhaps relies more, upon a statement in the opinion in Pratt v. Tailer, 114 App. Div. 574, 100 N. Y. Supp. 16, wherein the learned writer, discoursing of a similar provision in a lease, would seemingly have extended <em>to </em>landlords the stringent obligations of common carriers. But the negligence complained of in the case of Pratt v. Tailer, as admitted on demurrer, was a different and affirmative sort, in that the defendant permitted the roof to be occupied for a business calculated to and which did-wear the roof and made holes in it, to the knowledge of the defendants and their agents, and which, as defendants knew, scattered d\u00e9bris upon the roof, and, stopping the drain pipe, caused the water to stand upon the roof and leak through the holes so made. The distinction between such a case as that and the present is expressly recognized in the same opinion by the remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201cThe provision exonerating the defendants from liability for any damage caused by leakage of the roof unless they shall neglect to make repairs within a reasonable time after receiving written notice of the defect 'must be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to refer to defects arising from ordinary wear and tear of the elements, and not from those caused by the affirmative' acts of the defendants themselves or by negligence on their part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The covenanted obligation of the defendant to repair was not a covenant of insurance, and, if the plaintiffs would have the benefit of it, they had needs show compliance with its condition precedent. Failing that, their judgment may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">GIEDERSEEEVE, P. J., concurs. SEABURY, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
