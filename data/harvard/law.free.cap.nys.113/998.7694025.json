Plaintiffs claimed $115, the contract price, and defendant interposed a counterclaim of $113.35 for damages caused by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to perform the work .in accordance with contract. Plaintiffs called witnesses who testified to the printing and delivery of the booklets to defendant) that the work performed was a first-class job \u201cin consideration of the price paid,\u201d and that defendant did not complain of the work until a long time after delivery, and after repeated de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>mands of payment had been made by plaintiffs. Defendant called a number of witnesses who testified that the work was improp\u00e9rly done, and specimens of the work done were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The main question in controversy was whether the work was done in substantial compliance with the contract. The defendant, when called as a witness, testified that he was manufacturing the books in question for the Whitely Exerciser Company, and that he delivered some of them to said company after receiving them from the plaintiff. He was then asked, \u201cQ. Would they accept them?\u201d This question was objected to \"by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, objection overruled, exception taken, and the witness answered: \u201cThey would not.\u201d Again the defendant was asked: \u201cQ. State upon what grounds the Whitely Exerciser people refused to take these books from you?\u201d This question was objected to as incompetent and immaterial, the- objection overruled, an exception taken, and the witness answered: \u201cA. They refused upon the basis that it was a very poor job in printing, and not according to what we contracted to give them.\u201d Again, the defendant was asked: \u201cQ. What was the fair and reasonable allowance to make the Whitely Exerciser Company by reason of the imperfect manner in which these booklets were printed?\u201d- This question was objected to as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and not binding upon the.plaintiffs. The objection was overruled, an ex-ception noted and the witness answered: \u201cA. $117.\u201d The admission of this testimony constituted in each instance reversible error. The contract between plaintiffs and defendant contained .no reference to defendant\u2019s contract with the- Whitely Exerciser Company, and the requirements of the latter contract! were\" not relevant to the issue involved in this action. The declarations and opinions of third \"parties as to the issues involved in this controversy were incompetent, not binding upon the .plaintiffs, and prejudicial to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Judgment reversed and. new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">BISCHOFF,\" J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">GILDERSLEEVE, P.
