The steamship ticket purchased by plaintiff from defendant, a translation of which was introduced in evidence, contained a clause providing that the company\u2019s liability for loss or damage of baggage should be limited to $100 for first-class passengers, unless the passenger had the full value insured under the floating policy of the company. No such insurance was taken out by plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s agent who purchased the tickets, testified that he could not speak or read the language in which the tickets were printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">The defendant appellant claims that the court erred in charging the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-10\">\u201cThis limitation of liability is recognized by the law. The defendant company has a perfect right to limit its liability to any amount; but the Court of Appeals of this state has held that this is only applicable where the limited liability is called to the attention of the shipper, or, on the other hand, that the shipper knew, or had reason to know, at the time of making the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>that there was such a limited liability clause. Under the circumstances, another fact that you will have to consider in this case is: Did Ford know of the limited liability clause on that ticket? If he did, then this plaintiff corporation can only recover against this defendant to the extent of the sum of $100.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">This was error. In Tewes v. North German Lloyd Steamship Co., 186 N. Y. 151, 78 N. E. 864, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 199, in which the trial court had charged the jury to the same effect, the appellate court, in reversing the judgment said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-6\">\u201cThis charge was clearly in conflict with a number of well-settled cases which hold that there is a just and logical distinction between an ordinary railroad ticket, which may often be regarded as a mere token, and a passage ticket for an ocean voyage, the sale and purchase of which is usually conducted with such caution-and deliberation as to invest the transaction with the elements of a contract, the terms of which the purchaser has ample opportunity to ascertain and understand.\u201d Steers v. Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co., 57 N. Y. 1, 15 Am. Rep. 453; Belger v. Dismore, 51 N. Y. 166, 10 Am. Rep. 575; Wheeler v. Oceanic Steam <em>&amp; </em>Navigation Co., 72 Hun, 5, 25 N. Y. Supp. 578, affirmed 149 N. Y. 576, 43 N. E. 990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">It follows that the verdict for $1,250 is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff will stipulate to reduce the judgment to the sum of $100, in which event .the judgment, as modified, is affirmed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
