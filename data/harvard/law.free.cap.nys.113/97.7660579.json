In 1905 the decedent died, leaving a last will and testament, which was admitted to probate in that year by the surrogate of Kings county. The decedent left him surviving three children, who are named in the will as his sole legatees and devisees, and a grandson, the son of a deceased daughter, who is the petitioner in these proceedings, and is not named in the will. The petitioner was cited and appeared by his special guardian upon the probate of the will. A judicial settlement of the administrator\u2019s account was had, and distribution was made in accordance with the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court on March 19, 1906. The petitioner was not cited, nor did he appear in the accounting proceedings. On February 6, 1908, a petition was filed asking for a citation requiring the appellant to show cause why he should not make and settle his account as administrator c. t. a. Citation was then issued in accordance with the prayer of said petition. The order directs the administrator to account, and reserves as to all parties all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>questions as to the construction, interpretation, and validity and effect of the said will. The appellant\u2019s answer alleged inter alia that the will bequeathed the property to the persons named therein, and that the respondent was not a creditor nor a person interested in the estate of the decedent.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b132-5\">Argued before WOODWARD, JENKS, GAYNOR, RICH, and MILLER, JJ.

Section 2623, Code Civ. Proc. But the decree is not in this record, and all that appears therein is that there was probate. The case, then, is not complicated by the fact that the petitioner appeared by special guardian at the probate, inasmuch as the mere probate is conclusive only as to formal validity. Jessup on Surrogates\u2019 Prac. 187; Redfield\u2019s Law and Practice of Surrogates\u2019 Courts (5th Ed.) pp. 855, 856. As I read the judgment in Matter of Killan, 172 N. Y. 547, 65 N. E. 561, 63 L. R. A. 95, the learned surrogate is right in his disposition of this petition. As he has expressly reserved all questions as to the construction, interpretation, validity, and effect of the will, in so far as the same may arise or be necessary to pass on in the disposition of these proceedings, he can upon this proceeding determine first whether the petitioner has any standing, thereupon, if he has, the surrogate can require the accounting; but the citation should be so amended as to bring in the parties who were cited to the original account or appeared upon it. See Matter of Killan, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The proceedings should be thus modified, and, as thus modified, the order should be affirmed, but without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
