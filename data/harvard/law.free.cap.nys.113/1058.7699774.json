Proe. \u00a7 2231, provides for summary proceedings to remove tenants from premises. Section 2232 provides that an occupant of land may be removed where the land is sold under execution against him or one he claims under, or on foreclosure of a mortgage executed by him or one he claims under, or where he holds land after the expiration of an agreement to cultivate it on shares or is a squatter. Section 2233 provides for the removal .of one making forcible entry or detainer. <em>Held </em>that, in cases not falling within sections 2232 and 2233, the proceedings would only lie where the conventional relation of landlord and tenant exists, and hence would not lie to remove one who held over after disaffirmance of his lease if he was a trespasser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1092-17\">[Ed.

Again, the adjudication appealed from is clearly identified by referring to it as \u201cthe judgment.\u201d It is, in effect, the judgment rendered in the proceeding, and a mere technical misnomer of it should not be permitted to invalidate the appeal. The final order was not rendered upon the tenant\u2019s default, and is therefore appealable. On the return day of the precept the tenant appeared, joined issue, and moved the dismissal of the proceeding for insufficiency of the petition. This motion was denied, and the cause was ordered to trial. Thereupon the landlord introduced proof of the facts alleged in the petition, the tenant standing mute, and the final order awarding possession of the demised premises followed. Resting upon his objection to the sufficiency of the facts as affording justification for a determination in the landlord\u2019s favor, the tenant was not bound to go through the idle ceremony of a cross-examination or to do that which would have been more reprehensible, to dispute facts which he could not truthfully deny, in order to avoid a determination for the landlord upon his default. The ruling upon the tenant\u2019s motion for dismissal was none the less a. ruling upon the trial because it was made before the landlord\u2019s proof was taken. We are thus brought to a review of the final order appealed from upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>A prior proceeding between the same parties for recovery of the possession of the premises for default in the payment of rent, in which the tenant pleaded that he had been induced to enter into the lease by the fraud of the landlord, the present petitioner\u2019s predecessor in interest, resulted in an adjudication for the tenant. It is not readily conceivable how the tenant could have succeeded in his plea of a disaffirmance of the lease while he continued in the possession of the premises after his discovery of the fraud, but, since the present petitioner seems to have acquiesced in that determination and is concluded thereby, we must, for the purposes of the present review, regard the lease as invalidated. Such, also, appears to have been the theory upon which the petition in the court below proceeded; the petitioner alleging that upon the disaffirmance of the lease he had elected to regard the tenant as a trespasser. Were the tenant properly to be so regarded, summary proceedings to remove him would not lie. That such proceedings are maintainable only where the conventional relation of landlord and tenant exists, except in the cases specially provided for and of which this is not one (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 2231-2233), is a proposition so familiar and so well settled by past adjudications that reference to particular cases seems needless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Having entered into possession of the premises under a lease from the petitioner\u2019s predecessor in interest, the tenancy upon the avoidance of the lease became one at will (Larned v. Wilson, 60 N. Y. 102; Talamo v. Spitzmiller, 120 N. Y. 37, 23 N. E. 980, 8 L. R. A. 221, 17 Am. St. Rep. 607), and was terminable by the landlord only upon his giving of a written notice to- the tenant of not less than 30 days, requiring the latter to remove from the premises. Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 590, c. 547, \u00a7 198). The fact of such a notice must be alleged in the petition for the tenant\u2019s removal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2236. Until the tenancy is thus put an end to, the t\u00e9nant cannot be said to hold over after the expiration of the term. Post v. Post, 14 Barb. 253, 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Eor the reason that no such notice was alleged or proved the final order for the landlord was erroneously made and must be reversed with costs, and, since the circumstances negative the giving of any such notice, the proceedings should be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
