The evidence of such account stated is that of plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">\u201cQ. Did you talk to Mr. Strassburger [defendant\u2019s president] about this balance? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-16\">\u201cQ. What did he say to you? A. He did not have the money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-17\">\u201cQ. Did he say he would pay it to you ? A. No; he said there were some differences between us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-18\">\u201cQ. You asked him for the money, and he refused to pay it to you? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-19\">On cross-examination plaintiff testified thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-20\">\u201cQ. He [defendant] denied that $40 were owing to you? A. No; he did not. * * * He said he would have to go over the books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-21\">\u201cQ. He did not admit that $40 were due? A. No. * * * He could not admit it because he did not know anything about the books.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-22\">The evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment, which should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-23\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
