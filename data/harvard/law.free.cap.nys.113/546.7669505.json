There is considerable and forceful evidence to show that the value of the services rendered was more than $250. Indeed, were the question before us in the first instance, we would find no difficulty in fixing the value at the amount claimed by the attorney. In cases involving the weight of evidence the conclusion of the trial judge should not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. In this case there is ample evidence to sustain the finding of the trial justice, and his finding should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
