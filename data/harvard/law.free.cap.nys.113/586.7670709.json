Sussman &amp; Co., as part of his brokerage for effecting an exchange of lands, but claimed by the former to have been paid upon the agreement that it was to be returned if title to such lands should fail to pass. Title thereto did not pass. The defendant claims that he was employed as a broker in the transaction, and that the reasonable value of his services was $140; that this sum was earned when he brought the parties to an agreement; and that, although he thereafter agreed to wait until title was closed for the balance of his brokerage and to return the $50 so received if title was not passed, such agreement was wholly without consideration. He accordingly counterclaimed for $90, the difference between the said sums of $140 and $50. The trial justice dismissed the complaint, and awarded the defendant $50 and his counterclaim, and the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">At the trial the plaintiff rested her case upon the introduction in evidence of the agreement between the parties, which was marked \u201cExhibit I,\u201d and which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">\u201cIn consideration of the sum of one ($1) dollar and other good and valuable considerations and of entering into the agreement of exchange of the premises hereinafter mentioned, W. S. Sussman &amp; Go. do' hereby agree with Magdalena Rohkohl and warrant that they are the only brokers who have brought about .the exchange of her property on 137th street, borough of the Bronx, city of New York, for property of Ida Krauss on 168th street in said borough and city the contract for said exchange having this day been executed and the said Magdalena Rohkohl does hereby agree to pay to said W. S. Sussman &amp; Co. the sum of one hundred ($100.) dollars for procuring said exchange if and when the deeds of said property shall be delivered, as agreed in said contract of exchange and the said Sussman &amp; Go. further agree that they shall not be entitled to the payment for any services in case the said deeds are not executed and delivered as agreed in said contract. And the said Sussman &amp; Go. further agree that the said sum of one hundred shall be in full payment of all commissions and brokerage on such exchange.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">\u201cDated this 12th day of February, 1908.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-15\">\u201cW. S. Sussman &amp; Go., by W. S. Sussman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The defendant also signed the following receipt when the $50 was paid to him by the plaintiff, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">\u201cReceived on account of the above the sum of $50. the same to be returned in case title is not passed on the property described above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cW. S. Sussman &amp; Co., by W. S. Sussman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\u2022 The plaintiff contended upon the trial that such agreement (Exhibit I) was signed simultaneously with the contract of exchange (defendant\u2019s Exhibit A), but the defendant insisted that it was afterward. Whatever conflict of testimony there may have been upon the subject was resolved in defendant\u2019s favor as we must assume from the judgment rendered. As the defendant earned his commission when the contract of exchange was executed, and nothing further remained to be done on his part (Meltzer v. Straus, decided at the present term of this court, 113 N. Y. Supp. 583), there was no consideration for the agreement above set forth (Exhibit I). Taubenblatt v. Galewski (Sup.) 108 N. Y. Supp. 588, 589, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">It is urged by the defendant, however, that such agreement expresses a consideration other than that \u201cof entering into the contract of exchange,\u201d viz., \u201cthe sum of one ($1) dollar and other good and valuable considerations,\u201d and that there was no evidence that such consideration did not pass. Although there is not direct evidence upon the point, the circumstances surrounding the transaction, which were fully inquired into upon the trial, fairly warrant the inference that no such consideration was given, especially in view of the absence of proof that any consideration whatever passed. Fargis v. Walton, 107 N. Y. 398, 402, 14 N. E. 303. There was no question raised upon the trial as to the employment of the defendant by the plaintiff. No motions were made when the plaintiff rested or at the close of the whole case; and the question of the defect of evidence on this point cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Bevins\u2019 and Rogers\u2019 Appellate Court Practice, pp. 74, 79, and cases there cited. But, if the question could be raised, the record discloses ample proof of such employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The fact that the defendant acted as a broker for the other party to the exchange appears to have been known to the plaintiff, and the latter cannot, therefore, withhold the payment of the balance of his commission on this ground. Tieck v. McKenna, 115 App. Div. 701, 101 N. Y. Supp. 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
