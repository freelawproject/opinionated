This motion was denied; defendant taking an exception. The facts were then stipulated, and the defendant moved for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the facts proved did not constitute a cause of action. This motion was denied, and an exception taken. A motion was then made by defendant for the direction of a verdict on the same ground, and on its denial defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>took an exception. On motion of plaintiff, a verdict for $750 was directed for the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The learned court appears to have taken the position that it would not determine the question on the sufficiency of the pleadings, but upon the evidence; but the defendant has an exception to the ruling, as well as to the further rulings after the facts were agreed upon. If the attitude of the learned court is right, then, in all actions against street railroads for personal injuries, all that is necessary is to allege that the defendant is occupying the highways with a surface railroad, and, if the defendant does not plead and prove that it is there under lawful authority, the plaintiff is entitled to recover because of the nuisance. In the thousands of cases which have been presented to the courts in this state for personal injuries growing out of the operation of surface railroads in cities, it has never been customary to bring into the controversy the question of the legality of the structure in the streets; for under our Constitution and laws it is hardly possible that a street railroad could be constructed or operated without lawful authority, and the courts might almost take judicial notice of the fact. But this is not necessary. The statute (section 91 of the railroad law [Laws 1890, p. 1108, c. 565]) has provided, ever since the amendment made by chapter 638, p. 1529, of the Taws of 1901, that whenever, \u201cheretofore or hereafter, a railroad has been or shall be constructed and put in operation for one year or the motive power thereon has been or shall be changed and put in operation for a similar length of time, such facts shall be presumptive evidence that the requisite consents of local authorities, property owners and other authority to the construction, maintenance and operation of such railroad or change of motive power have been duly obtained.\u201d It is conceded in this case that the defendant had constructed its railroad and equipped it with the overhead trolley system more than one year prior to the accident; and, this fact being conceded, there arose the presumption that the defendant was lawfully in the highway with its equipment for operating its railroad by electricity, and in the absence of negligence the defendant could not be liable. It is admitted by the plaintiff that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant; that the wire causing the injury fell because of a fire, which threw down a building near at hand, tearing down the defendant\u2019s superstructure.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">This makes it unnecessary to consider the question of pleading, perhaps; but it may not be out of place to call attention to the question a little more fully. The complaint alleges that the defendant is \u201ca domestic corporation duly organized and existing, and engaged in operating street railroads.\u201d To be \u201cduly organized and existing, and engaged in operating street railroads,\u201d is to be legally organized and existing and engaged in operating street railroads, for \u201c \u2018duly,\u2019 in legal parlance, means according to law. It does not relate to form merely, but includes form and substance both.\u201d Brownell v. Town of Greenwich, 114 N. Y. 518, 527, 22 N. E. 24, 26, 4 L. R. A. 685, and authorities there cited. This allegation of the complaint is not denied, and so it stands as established that the defendant was lawfully organized and existing and engaged in the operation of street railroads, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and the allegation that the defendant \u201cknowingly and wrongfully jeopardized the lives,\u201d etc., of persons lawfully on the highway, if not a mere conclusion of law made by the pleader, cannot be construed to controvert the allegation of lawfulness in the first paragraph of the complaint, and must be deemed to relate to negligence, rather than to \u25a0a nuisance. The same is true of the further allegation that \u201csolely by reason of the wrongful acts of the defendant,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We are of the opinion that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the complaint should have been dismissed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
