The state board brought an action against defendant charging him with selling camphor liniment containing only 13.4 per cent, of camphor, instead of 20 per cent. The formula in the Pharmacopoeia prescribed the mixture of so many grammes of camphor and oil, but it was shown that, if the formula.was followed exactly, the liniment would contain less than 20 per cent, camphor because of evaporation during the process, and that it would further evaporate if left exposed. <em>Held, </em>that the penalty should be imposed only where there was a failure to comply with the formula when the preparation was compounded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-10\">[Ed.

The same witness stated that he had experimented, and found that the preparation in question in a period of five months showed a loss of 1 per cent, during which period he allowed the stopper to remain out of the bottle sometimes for two or three hours at a time; but he did not say how many times nor how long in the aggregate. How long it would take, if the stopper were left out of the receptacle containing the preparation, to produce a loss of about 7 per cent., and so run the percentage of camphor down to the figures testified to in this case, is not shown. For all that appears, the carelessness of a clerk in leaving the stopper out and a failure to discover such omission for a day or two might produce the result testified to in this case. My conclusion is that there was not enough shown in this case to warrant the imposition of the penalty, even if it be conceded, which is not clear, that it was intended by the statute that the penalty should apply in the case of volatile drugs where the Pharmacopoeia fails to establish any \u201cstandard of strength, quality, and purity\u201d of the product, but only gives a formula for its compounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">It should be remembered that this is an action to enforce a penalty, and that the statute must be strictly construed. Manhattan Co. v. Kaldenberg, 165 N. Y. 1, 58 N. E. 790. Before prosecutions are attempted in such cases as this, either the statute or the Pharmacopoeia should be so amended as to make the intent plain, and perhaps leave some latitu'de by establishing a maximum and a minimum limit. As it stands now, a druggist who scrupulously followed the formula would obtain a product somewhat less than 20 per cent, strong in camphor and might be prosecuted and fined for a sale made the next instant. If he attenlpted to be on the safe side by using more camphor than the formula directed, there would be a corresponding deficiency in oil, and, strictly speaking, there would then be a variance in the quality of his product from the proportions fixed by the formula. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>present condition of the statute and the Pharmacopoeia, the penalty should\" be imposed only where it is shown that there was a failure to comply with the formula at the time the preparation was compounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Judgment should therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
