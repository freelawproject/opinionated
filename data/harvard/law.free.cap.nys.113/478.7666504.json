He testified that the defendant admitted to him the authority of Croker, the alleged agent of the defendant, and also admitted knowledge of the promises made by Croker on his behalf. I can find nothing in the record which renders this testimony of the plaintiff improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-18\">No reversible error appears in the rulings or in the judge\u2019s charge. In reply to an inquiry made by the jury as to whether they might find in a less amount than $800, the judge told them that they might find the reasonable value of the services, and neither side objected to such instruction. 0</p>\n<p id=\"b512-19\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
