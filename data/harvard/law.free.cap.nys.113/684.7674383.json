Liability thereunder presupposes transaction of business and an office, not a mere shelter, but a business abode with one or more officers employed, with office, and perhaps clerical, equipment. All were wanting. The corporate franchise had not lapsed, the officers had not abdicated, but the corporation\u2019s business had ceased, and it had given up its office and deposited its books in the corner of a stockbrokerage office where the plaintiff found two of the officers, and made his demand in writing, also orally. He asserts grievance because these two men did not leave their occupations, and between two ticks of the clock, as it were, comply with his demand. They did not evince unwillingness to afford him what he wanted. The very circumstances evoked questions as to their duties and his rights. Then, too, in his demand in writing he asked too much (Henry v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 125 App. Div. 538, 109 N. Y. Supp. 853), asked what they might be criticised for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>offering him. What he demanded orally was a repetition of his writing as they seem to have understood it. They asked advice of counsel, and the gentleman they inquired of the same night or the following morning mailed a list of the stockholders to the plaintiff, who returned thanks with a request for the stockholders\u2019 addresses, but he had instituted this action before his request came. The judgment should be reversed. The plaintiff did not make out a cause of action, for the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
