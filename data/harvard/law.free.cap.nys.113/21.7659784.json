Upon the expiration of his term, Goldstein remained in possession, and the petitioner, averring himself to be his landlord, etc., brought this action to dispossess on the ground, that Goldstein was a holdover.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">The final order, awarding the petitioner possession, must be reversed, because, \u201cto authorize a judgment to remove a tenant holding over, the conventional relation of landlord and tenant must exist\u201d (Reich v. Cochran, 151 N. Y. 122, 126, 45 N. E. 367, 37 L. R. A. 805, 56 Am. St. Rep. 607), and that must be by agreement, not by operation of law (Evertson v. Sutton, 5 Wend. 281, 21 Am. Dec. 217). It has been held that a landlord may maintain dispossess proceedings after the expiration of a term, although he has leased the same premises to another to begin upon the expiration of the term of the person in possession (Goelet v. Roe, 14 Misc. Rep. 28, 35 N. Y. Supp. 145); but it has not been held, apparently, that the incoming lessee may maintain such a proceeding. In Imbert v. Hallock, 23 How. Prac. 456, it appears to be held that the lessor is the only proper person under such circumstances to institute summary proceedings, and that decision was rendered in view of the provisions of Rev. St. (1st Ed.) p. 3, c. 8, tit. 10, the source of the present provisions of section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Final order reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
