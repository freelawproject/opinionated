Proof of liability imposed by law was established by the plaintiff, and so his right to recover herein, notwithstanding he alleged that he paid the judgment and that the defendant denied it. It matters not that that judgment was paid by a daughter-in-law of the plaintiff, as the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depends upon proof of a liability imposed by law, and not upon proof of \u201closs actually sustained and paid in money by him in satisfaction of a judgment after trial,\u201d as recited in the brief of the defendant appellant as contained in the policy of insurance, because the policy of insurance was not introduced in evidence and this court may not determine that the policy contained any. such provision or contingent liability. Under the circumstances, the pleadings, and the evidence, the direction of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was proper, and the judgment entered thereon should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">SEABURY, J. I concur on the ground that, the policy not having been offered in evidence, the defendant is in no position to object that a clause alleged to be contained in it was not complied with by the plaintiff. On the pleadings and testimony presented, I think that the direction of the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
