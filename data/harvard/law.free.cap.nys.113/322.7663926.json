Jacocks, that he would procure to be conveyed to him 15 acres of land owned by the Federal Copper Company, \u201cto be selected by the said George M. Jacocks out of one of the plots owned by the said company,\u201d or in default of such conveyance to pay to him the sum of $3,500 in cash, and that such conveyance was not procured, and that therefore the $3,500 became due. The defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action, and the demurrer was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">The chief defect of the complaint is that it is not alleged that George M. Jacocks selected any particular 15-acre plot. The complaint is fatally defective because of the omission of such an allegation. Under the contract set forth in the complaint the defendant was not liable to pay the stipulated amount until he was put in default by failure to procure conveyance. He could not be guilty of such failure until the particular plot had been selected, for selection was a condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">The defect was not cured by the allegation that \u201ca demand was duly made by the plaintiff,\u201d after assignment of the contract to her, that the defendant should perform his agreement by causing such conveyance to be made, because, so far as appears from the allegations, defendant did not know and could not know what particular 15-acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>plot George M. Jacocks or the plaintiff desired should be conveyed. If from death or incapacity George M. Jacocks could not make the selection, such excuse should have been pleaded. If from such an event selection devolved upon the plaintiff, after assignment of the contract to her, the complaint should have alleged a selection on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer must be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to serve an amended complaint on payment of costs of this appeal and of the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
