The record on the appeal from the judgment now before us, which is in amplification .of the record on this appeal, shows that at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that there was no proof of the cause of action alleged in the complaint. The court granted the motion under exception. Thereafter the court filed its decision that contained findings of fact that the grantor made, executed, and delivered to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>defendant Marshall a warranty deed of the premises in question, which was absolute and was not given or intended as a mortgage, and conclusion of law that Marshall is the owner - of' the premises, entitled to the possession thereof, and that she was entitled to final judgment in her favor dismissing the complaint. Thereupon a judgment was entered in accord. \u201cGenerally a mere order for a decree in.equity before it is extended in due form and' in apt and technical language cannot be held to be a complete record of the judgment of the court.\u201d Thompson v. Goulding, 5 Allen (Mass.) 84, cited in Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 39. Moreover, the disposition at the trial was not the decision in the case, inasmuch as the decision must be in writing and filed in the clerk\u2019s office. Section 1010, Code Civ. Proc. The oral declaration of the court of its intended disposition of the case as adverse to the plaintiff was not conclusive upon the court, and did not preclude it from such decision as it finally concluded to render. And, when it came to the making of its decision in the manner prescribed by law, it was entirely proper that it should state it in its present form. Wood v. Lary, 124 N. Y. 87, 26 N. E. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The order is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
