The defendant offered no evidence. The plaintiff was corroborated in his version of the accident by one witness. The evidence given is not very clear, but seems to be substantially as follows: The plaintiff, with other employ\u00e9s of the defendant, was engaged in removing lumber from a ship with a hand truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">On the day the accident happened, a person designated by the plaintiff as the \u201cforeman\u201d directed him to take the truck inside the ship, and put it near the lumber. On the main deck of the ship was a stationary engine and a wire to which was attached a rope which was lowered into the hold. The rope passed around the lumber, which was then raised by means of the engine, and placed upon the trucks and removed from the ship. The plaintiff testifies that, as soon as he had taken his truck into the ship, a piece of lumber fell and struck him. He was asked: \u201cWas it from up above you?\u201d and he answered: \u201cIt fell on my head.\u201d The other witness testified to the effect that the foreman told the plaintiff to put his truck under the lumber, and that, as he was doing so, the \u201crope broke, and he got hurt.\u201d It further appeared that \u201cthe wire is let down by steam and they tie the wood with the rope.\u201d The plaintiff testified over objection, when asked, \u201cWhat kind of a rope was it, a new or an old rope?\u201d that it was \u201can old rope.\u201d The other witness said he had seen the rope used \u201cabout a day or two,\u201d and that it looked like an old rope. It was also testified that the rope was\u2019 \u201can ordinary rope.\u201d The action is brought under the employer\u2019s liability act (Laws 1902, p. 1748, c. 600), and the sufficiency of the notice given to the defendant is challenged. I am of the opinion that the notice is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of that statute, and that in such respect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>defendant cannot complain. I am of the opinion, however, that the plaintiff failed to prove any negligence on the part of the defendant. Unless the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which is invoked by the plaintiff herein, is applicable, the plaintiff failed to sustain his cause of action. It must be borne in mind that the mere happening of an accident is not always sufficient to charge a defendant with negligence. Hahn v. Conreid Metropolitan Opera Co., 126 App. Div. 815, 111 N. Y. Supp. 161, 162. As was said in Griffen v. Manice, 166 N. Y. 188, 59 N. E. 925, 52 L. R. A. 922, 82 Am. St. Rep. 630:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-4\">\u201cIt is not that in any case negligence can he assumed from the mere fact of an accident, hut in those cases the surrounding circumstances, which are necessarily brought into view, by showing how the accident occurred, contain, without further proof, sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s duty and of his neglect to perform it.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Neither does the doctrine apply simply because the accident is unusual or unexplained. Dittman v. Edison El. Ill. Co., 125 App. Div. 691, 110 N. Y. Supp. 87. There must be something more shown than evidence from which a mere guess may be made that there was negligence. There must appear that from the surrounding circumstances attending the accident that except for some negligence on the part of the master either of omission or commission the accident would not have happened. \u201cThe proof of the occurrence and the surrounding circumstances, the \u2018res\u2019 makes a prima facie case.\u201d Moglia v. Nassau El. Ry. Co., 127 App. Div. 243, 111 N. Y. Supp. 70. This doctrine can rarely be invoked between employer and employe. Lane v. N. Y. Contracting Co., 125 App. Div. 808, 110 N. Y. Supp. 91. Applying these principles to the testimony in the case at bar, we fail to find anything tending to show lack of care on the part of the defendant in furnishing safe, sound, and suitable appliances for the work to be done, and in such failure only can negligence be imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">It is urged that the breaking of the rope alone is sufficient proof of its inability to perform its work, and therefore constitutes negligence on the part of the defendant. Eor all that appears in the evidence the rope in question may have been amply sufficient to sustain any reasonable burden that a person of ordinary prudence would place upon it, or that was intended to be placed upon it, and its breaking at the time it did might have been caused by an unusual and extraordinary load placed there by a fellow servant of the plaintiff, and for whose acts the master could in no way be made responsible. It nowhere appears as to what amount of strain the rope was expected to be subjected to in the use to which it was being put, nor does it even appear what size it was, whether one inch in diameter or larger. There is no evidence that the load bearing upon the rope when it broke was placed there by the direction of the foreman, or that he had the slightest knowledge of its weight. The plaintiff was asked, \u201cHow long and how thick was the lumber ?\u201d meaning the lumber which was tied by the rope that broke. As to its thickness, he indicated in the courtroom about 3 feet, and as to its length a like indication of about 30 feet. As to whether or not this amo\u00fcnt was the ordinary load for an \u201cordinary\u201d rope or whether or not it was of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>a weight as to practically insure the breaking of an \u201cordinary\u201d rope, and who was responsible for its being placed within the rope, does not appear. In the case of Haggblad v. Brooklyn Heights Railroad Co., 117 App. Div. 838, 102 N. Y. Supp. 1039, the method or system of placing and securing the hoist was attacked, and the court there held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-3\">\u201cThe fall of the hoist while being properly used for the purpose for which it was set up was of itself evidence that it was unsafe, and brought the case within the rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">In the case at bar, however, there is not the slightest evidence that the rope was being \u201cproperly\u201d used, or that it was unsafe if so used, and, if insufficient in size or if improperly used, by whose authority or by whose direction it was so used. That the rope was \u201cold\u201d is of no materiality unless accompanied by proof of its unfitness for the purpose for which it was intended to be used, and the fact that it broke while being used, unaccompanied by proof of any other circumstance showing negligence on the part of the defendant, is insufficient to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
