The plaintiff was a citizen of the United States, and the only heir of a sister of the decedent, and the defendants were aliens and the heirs of another sister of decedent. The statute of descents provides that, when the heirs are related in equal degree to the decedent, they shall inherit equally. The complaint' alleged that the plaintiff was entitled to an undivided half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the premises, and that the five defendant heirs were each entitled to an undivided one-tenth. This was admitted by the answer and also by a stipulation between the attorneys that the complaint correctly stated the interests of the parties. The referee\u2019s report on title and the interlocutory judgment directing a sale followed the complaint and the stipulation as to the interests of the parties. The error was discovered by defendants, as they insist, where a purchaser at the sale successfully objected to the title on that and other grounds. Defendants moved below to set aside the interlocutory judgment and referee\u2019s report, for relief from the stipulation, and for leave to amend their answer, which was granted without costs, the disbursements made, which were heavy because of the futile sale, etc., to be borne in proportion to the interests of the parties, one-sixth by plaintiff and five-sixths by defendants, and without permission to plaintiff to amend the complaint. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, opposing the motion, swore that the complaint was not so drawn by mistake, and that the stipulation was made by defendant\u2019s attorneys after conference with plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and was so done because, if they had insisted on their client\u2019s rights, plaintiff would have amended the complaint by alleging the alienage of defendants, and would have contested their right to inherit at all.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b568-5\">Argued before PATTERSON, P.

The present appeal seems to have been taken because the appellant\u2019s attorney thinks that the terms more favorable to him should have been imposed. In view of his extraordinary statement now made that he labored under no mistaken view of the law, but consciously and intentionally misstated the proportion of the estate to which his client was entitled, in the hope that the defendants would be misled thereby to their own disadvantage, but to the plaintiff\u2019s advantage, the terms imposed might well have been made more onerous upon the appellant, and have been charged against the attorney personally. Since the respondents, however, are content with the present order, we do not feel called upon to modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
