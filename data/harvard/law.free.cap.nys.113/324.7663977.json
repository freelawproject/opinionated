Morrison (decided herewith) 113 N. Y. Supp. 322, and in addition that the defendants jointly and severally guarantee the conveyance of the 15-acre plot, or in default thereof the payment of the $3,500. The complaint in this action is therefore defective in fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ing to allege selection of the particular plot to be conveyed, and the overruling of the demurrer was error for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Another ground, however, is urged, which we deem untenable, and which it is proper for us to decide, and that is that it was incumbent upon plaintiff to allege that she had exhausted her remedy against the principal, Morrison, before resorting to the defendants as guarantors. The guaranty alleged is one of general performance and payment. A guaranty of payment or of performance is an absolute undertaking, imposing liability upon the guarantor immediately upon default of the principal, regardless of whether any steps are taken to enforce the liability of the principal debtor. Wood v. Tunnicliff, 74 N. Y. 38; 20 Cyc. 1450. It was not necessary, therefore, for the plaintiff to allege the exhaustion of remedy against Morrison, the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Because of the other defect, however, the interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer to the complaint must be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend upon payment of costs in this court and the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
