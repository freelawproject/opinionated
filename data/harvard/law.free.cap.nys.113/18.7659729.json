The plaintiff upon the trial was allowed to show, and the jury found in his favor upon disputed evidence, that he duly paid his fare as a passenger on defendant\u2019s train; that he was roughly and improperly ejected therefrom by defendant\u2019s servants; that he was arrested, taken through the streets as a prisoner, and imprisoned overnight, under a false and malicious charge made against him, without probable cause, by defendant\u2019s servants; and that he was honorably acquitted and discharged after a hearing before the police magistrate. The particular testimony tending to show the assault in the car and the slanderous abuse also in the car may be taken as offered in support of the cause of action for breach of contract, but the evidence in support of the cause of action for malicious prosecution was improperly allowed, as the Municipal Court has no jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>over such causes of action. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 1, subd. 14 (Laws 1902, p. 1489, c. 580). It is impossible to say how much damage the jury allowed for the breach of contract and how much for the malicious prosecution, and a new trial is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant ta abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
