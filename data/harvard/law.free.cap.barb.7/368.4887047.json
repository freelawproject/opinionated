The cause was originally tried before a justice of the peace. Miller, the plaintiff before the justice, declared against Stone in assumpsit for work, labor and services performed by the plaintiff\u2019s son, who was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>minor at the time, and for goods sold, &amp;c. and for money had and received, &amp;c. The defendant pleaded 1st. the general issue, and 2d, the pendency of a former suit before another justice, commenced by Stone against Miller, <em>in a plea of trespass on the case. </em>That issue was joined in that suit, which issue was pending and undetermined at the time of putting in this plea ; averring that in that suit the plaintiff set off against the demand of the defendant the same identical cause of action set forth in this action; which action remained to be determined. The plaintiff demurred specially to the second plea, and the justice sustained the demurrer,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">In a supplemental return, the justice stated that he was unable to set forth all the reasons assigned by the plaintiff as causes of demurrer, but among them was the following: <em>\u201c </em>The plaintiff objected to the dilatory plea, saying that it was too late after the general issue, and I so understood the law, and sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objection to such dilatory plea.\u201d The justice rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $25, which the county court affirmed. This writ of error was brought to reverse the judgment of the county court and that of the justice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-7\"><em>T.

The plea upon which the question arises was of matter in abatement, and was bad on general demurrer, as a plea in bar. It was nevertheless pleaded in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">2d. The first suit was an action of trespass on the case. This does not necessarily mean an action in which a set-off was admissible. It may have been trover or for fraud, or any other action on the case not including an action on a contract, Indeed an action on the case is not understood to include assumpsit, debt, or covenant, which are about the only actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sounding in contract, triable before a justice. If it was not founded upon a contract, a set-off would be inadmissible if objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
