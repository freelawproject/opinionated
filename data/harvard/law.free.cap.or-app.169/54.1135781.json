We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In August 1990, William Fox was killed in a staged auto accident in Coos County. Plaintiff, the personal representative of Fox\u2019s estate, appealed from judgments for defendants Country Mutual Insurance Co. and Northwest Farm Bureau Insurance Co. determining, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendants were not obligated to pay benefits to Fox\u2019s estate under the uninsured and underinsured (UM) coverage in Fox\u2019s automobile insurance policy. In our original opinion, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for defendants based on our conclusion that the incident that killed Fox was not \u201ccaused by an accident\u201d within the meaning of defendants\u2019 policy. <em>Fox v. Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>132 Or App 336, 888 P2d 111 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d and rem\u2019d </em>327 Or 500, 964 P2d 997 (1998). The Supreme Court reversed on that issue and remanded to us to consider defendants\u2019 alternative arguments for affirming summary judgment, as well as plaintiffs other assignments of error. On remand, we conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment for defendants on plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief, because the vehicle in which Fox was killed was neither uninsured nor underinsured. Additionally, as explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and intentional interference with an economic relationship. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We recounted the material facts and procedural history in our previous opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\"><em>\u201cDuring the </em>summer of 1990, Tim Vincent, one of Fox\u2019s close friends and a high school classmate, decided to intentionally wreck his Nissan pickup so that he could collect the insurance proceeds and purchase a Toyota pickup. Fox and Vincent discussed Vincent\u2019s plans, and Fox agreed to participate, initially, as a look-out for oncoming traffic. On the night of August 27,1990, Vincent, with Fox as a passenger, not a look-out, intentionally drove his Nissan off Seven Devils Road near Bandon. Vincent survived the wreck, but Fox did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cAt the time of the wreck, Vincent was a named insured under a $500,000 automobile liability policy from North Pacific Insurance Co. Fox was a named insured under his family\u2019s UM coverage, which defendants issued with a limit of $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201cFor more than a year following the wreck, Vincent falsely maintained that he accidentally drove off the road because he was blinded by the headlights of a \u2018phantom\u2019 oncoming car as he came around a sharp curve. However, in December 1991, Vincent finally confessed to intentionally causing the wreck to collect insurance proceeds and subsequently pleaded no contest to criminally negligent homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cIn January 1992, plaintiff sued Vincent for wrongful death. Because plaintiff feared that Vincent\u2019s insurer, North Pacific, might deny coverage, based on Vincent\u2019s intentional and fraudulent conduct, he contacted defendants\u2019 agent, Jack Waters, to ask about his family\u2019s UM coverage at the time of the wreck. Waters erroneously told plaintiff that the policy limit was $100,000, not $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cIn April 1992, North Pacific filed an action against Vincent [and plaintiff, the personal representative of Fox\u2019s estate], seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify [Vincent] because of his intentional and fraudulent conduct. Despite the pendency of that action, North Pacific and plaintiff began negotiating a settlement of the wrongful death action. In June 1992, plaintiff wrote to defendants, giving them notice of North Pacific\u2019s declaratory judgment action, advising them of a potential settlement with North Pacific, and demanding arbitration to determine coverage under the UM policy. Defendants did not reply. Thereafter, and without receiving defendants\u2019 consent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff accepted $150,000 from North Pacific in settlement of the wrongful death action against Vincent. In July 1992, North Pacific dismissed without prejudice its declaratory judgment action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cIn August 1992, plaintiff brought a product liability suit against Nissan, alleging that the truck had a defective seat belt system. Nissan, in turn, impleaded Vincent causing North Pacific to revive its declaratory judgment action. On August 13,1993, the court entered a judgment declaring Vincent\u2019s liability policy void because of his intentional and fraudulent conduct. <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Vincent and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Nissan Corp., </em>Coos County Circuit Court Case No. 92CV-1026. That judgment was never appealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">\u201cIn November 1992, while North Pacific\u2019s revived action was pending, defendants informed plaintiff that the UM policy limit at the time of Fox\u2019s death was $500,000, not $100,000. Plaintiff then sued defendants, seeking a declaration of coverage under the UM policy and asserting further claims of breach of contract for nonpayment of UM benefits, and intentional interference with plaintiffs settlement with North Pacific.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the breach of contract and intentional interference claims under ORCP 21 A(8) and entered summary judgment against plaintiff on the declaratory judgment claim. Plaintiff then moved to set the judgment aside so that he could amend his complaint to allege fraud. When the court denied that motion, plaintiff filed a second action against defendants alleging fraud. The court dismissed that action as barred by <em>res judicata.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Plaintiff then appealed the judgments in both of his actions against defendants, and those appeals were consolidated for our review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our original opinion, we addressed only plaintiffs first assignment of error, which asserted that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief. Defendants responded that the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for them was correct for the three separate, alternative reasons that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>offered in support of their motion for summaiy judgment. We affirmed on defendants\u2019 first proffered ground, that Fox\u2019s death was not \u201ccaused by accident\u201d and, thus, was not within the coverage of the UM policy, and we therefore did not reach the other grounds. <em>Fox, </em>132 Or App at 340. That conclusion, in turn, obviated any consideration of plaintiffs other assignments of error. <em>Id. </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">On review, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded to us, concluding \u201cthat the Court of Appeals erred in sustaining summary judgment for defendants on the theory that Fox\u2019s death was not \u2018caused by accident\u2019 under the coverage required by ORS 742.504(l)(a).\u201d <em>Fox, </em>327 Or at 516-17. The court explained that, because \u201cthe Court of Appeals did not address plaintiffs other assignments of error and defendants\u2019 responsive arguments, * * * we must remand this case * * * for further consideration.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On remand, plaintiff raises four assignments of error: (1) The trial court erred in dismissing his breach of contract claim against defendants for nonpayment of benefits under Fox\u2019s UM policy. (2) The court erred in dismissing his claim for intentional interference with his alleged \u201ceconomic relationship\u201d with Vincent\u2019s liability insurer, North Pacific. (3) The court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment, <em>i.e., </em>in determining that there was no entitlement to UM benefits under the Fox policy. (4) The court erred in denying plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment on his request for a declaration of coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Plaintiffs first, third, and fourth assignments of error all ultimately turn on the same legal issue: Was the Vincent vehicle \u201cuninsured\u201d or \u201cunderinsured\u201d for purposes of triggering the UM coverage in Fox\u2019s insurance policy with defendants? That is so because plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment on his entitlement to UM coverage and his claim that defendants breached their UM policy agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>by not paying UM benefits are ultimately two sides of the same coin. If the Vincent vehicle was uninsured or underinsured, plaintiff was entitled to declaratory judgment on his entitlement to benefits under the UM policy, and defendants\u2019 failure to provide that coverage was a breach of that agreement. Conversely, if the Vincent vehicle was <em>not </em>uninsured or underinsured, plaintiff was <em>not </em>entitled to a declaration of his entitlement to coverage under the UM policy, and defendants\u2019 failure to pay UM benefits was <em>not </em>a breach of contract. Given that common, and ultimately dispositive, question, we begin by addressing plaintiffs third assignment of error, which most cogently presents the issue of whether the Vincent vehicle was uninsured or underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In moving for summary judgment against plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief, defendants argued that the UM policy did not cover claims arising from Fox\u2019s death because (1) Fox\u2019s death was not \u201ccaused by accident\u201d; (2) the Vincent vehicle was neither uninsured nor underinsured; or (3) even if Fox\u2019s death were otherwise covered, plaintiffs settlement with Vincent\u2019s insurer, North Pacific, without defendants\u2019 consent barred recovery under the UM policy. As we explained in our original opinion, the trial court\u2019s judgment did not specify its grounds for granting summary judgment. <em>Fox, </em>132 Or App at 340 n 4. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of defendants\u2019 first argument, which underlay our original holding, we proceed to address defendants\u2019 alternative grounds for affirmance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As explained below, we conclude that, as a matter of law, the Vincent vehicle was neither \u201cuninsured\u201d nor \u201cunderinsured\u201d and, on that basis, affirm the entry of summary judgment against plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In seeking declaratory relief, plaintiff asserted that he was entitled to benefits under the UM policy either because the Vincent vehicle was \u201cuninsured\u201d or because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>even if the Vincent vehicle was insured, it was \u201cunder-insured.\u201d Defendants argue, and we agree, that the Vincent vehicle was neither \u201cuninsured\u201d nor \u201cunderinsured.\u201d Although \u201cuninsured\u201d and \u201cunderinsured\u201d are related terms, <em>see Wright v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>152 Or App 101, 110-11, 952 P2d 73 (1998), <em>rev allowed </em>328 Or 275 (1999) (explaining relationship of terms), they involve different statutory provisions and are analytically distinct. Accordingly, we address each issue in turn, beginning with whether the Vincent vehicle was \u201cuninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u201cUninsured motorist coverage\u201d (UM) is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\u201ccoverage ** * * insuring the insured, the heirs or legal representative of the insured for all sums which the insured or they shall be legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d ORS 742.500(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Because ORS 742.504 requires all auto insurance liability policies to provide UM coverage that \u201cin each instance is no less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary\u201d than if the statutory coverage provision were reproduced in the policy, the terms of defendants\u2019 UM policy are dictated by statute. <em>See Fox, </em>327 Or at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">ORS 742.504(2)(d)(A) defines \u201cuninsured vehicle\u201d as a vehicle for which there is \u201cno collectible automobile bodily injury insurance\u201d <em>or </em>a vehicle for which there was a liability policy in place at the time of the accident, but the insurer \u201cdenies coverage thereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants argued that the Vincent vehicle, in which Fox was killed, was not \u201cuninsured\u201d because, on the date of the accident, the Vincent vehicle had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>an applicable liability policy with a limit of $500,000. Therefore, defendants argued, plaintiff was not entitled to benefits under Fox\u2019s UM policy, and they were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because, even though there was an applicable liability policy at the time of the accident, North Pacific subsequently denied coverage, thereby rendering the Vincent vehicle \u201cuninsured\u201d within the meaning of ORS 742.504(2)(d)(A). Specifically, plaintiff argues that North Pacific \u201cdenied\u201d coverage within the meaning of ORS 742.504(2)(d)(A) in April 1992, when it filed the declaratory judgment action against Vincent and plaintiff asserting that its policy with Vincent was void due to Vincent\u2019s fraudulent and intentional acts. <em>See </em>169 Or App at 56-58 (quoting <em>Fox, </em>132 Or App at 338-40) (procedural history). Plaintiff contends that \u201cthere would have been no reason for North Pacific to file the declaratory judgment proceeding if it were not denying coverage, [because] an insurance company which accepts coverage merely pays the claim.\u201d According to plaintiff, \u201cunder any reasonable interpretation of the facts, North Pacific denied coverage for this accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Defendants respond to plaintiffs \u201cdenial\u201d argument by asserting that North Pacific\u2019s filing of a declaratory judgment action against plaintiff was not a \u201cdenial\u201d but simply an acknowledgment that a controversy existed. Defendants highlight that North Pacific did, in fact, hire defense counsel for Vincent, enter into settlement negotiations with plaintiff on Vincent\u2019s behalf, and ultimately settle plaintiffs wrongful death claim for $150,000. Thereafter, North Pacific dismissed its declaratory judgment action against Vincent and plaintiff. Defendants argue that, in light of North Pacific\u2019s ultimate settlement of plaintiffs claim, North Pacific did not deny coverage and the Vincent vehicle was therefore not \u201cuninsured.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Jurisdictions that have considered this question have uniformly concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u201c[u]nder an uninsured motorist policy defining an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 to include a vehicle for which the potential insurer denies coverage, the insured\u2019s acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of a settlement offer from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier precludes recovery of uninsured motorist benefits, notwithstanding the liability carrier\u2019s continued denial of coverage.\u201d Lee R. Russ, 9 <em>Couch on Insurance 3d, </em>\u00a7 123:41 (3d ed 1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">For example, in <em>Rister v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>668 SW2d 132 (Mo App 1984), the Missouri Court of Appeals considered whether a liability insurer \u201cdenied\u201d coverage for purposes of a UM policy when it initially denied coverage but subsequently extended a settlement offer that the plaintiffs accepted. The court concluded that the vehicle was not uninsured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cA legal right to recover under the uninsured motor vehicle insurance and a legal right to recover against the liability carrier cannot coexist. They are mutually exclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the [UM] statute is to give uninsured motor vehicle insureds coverage parallel to that they would have had if the accident had been caused by a vehicle that had the required liability coverage. It is not the purpose of the statute to require dual coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u00b0 * :{c * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">\u201cWhen a liability insurer, after an initial denial of coverage, extends an offer in settlement, it may be said it has only conditionally withdrawn its denial. However, when such an offer is accepted, the liability insurer no longer denies coverage. In this case, when the $35,000 was offered and accepted, American Casualty no longer denied liability coverage. It paid $35,000 by reason of that coverage. The plaintiffs were not entitled to recover upon the uninsured motor vehicle insurance in the State Farm policies.\u201d <em>Rister, </em>668 SW2d at 136-37 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\"><em>See also Jones v. Sentry Ins. Co., </em>462 NW2d 90, 91-92 (Minn Ct App 1990) (despite liability insurer\u2019s continued denial of coverage, UM insurer was no longer potentially liable after UM insured accepted a settlement from liability insurer: \u201cThis result is consistent with the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage, to give the victim injured by an uninsured motorist coverage which a victim would potentially receive if an insured motorist caused the accident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>We find the reasoning in <em>Rister </em>and <em>Jones </em>persuasive. It is well-established that the basic purpose of UM coverage in Oregon is \u201cto protect [the] policy holder against risk of inadequate compensation for injuries caused by [a] financially irresponsible tortfeasor, <em>i.e., </em>to place [the] policyholder in [the] same position as if [the] tortfeasor had liability insurance.\u201d <em>Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Key, </em>131 Or App 130, 134, 883 P2d 875 (1994), <em>rev den </em>320 Or 567 (1995) (citing <em>Peterson v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>238 Or 106, 111-12, 393 P2d 651 (1964)). Given that, we conclude that, regardless of whether North Pacific\u2019s filing of a declaratory judgment action against plaintiff constituted an initial denial of coverage, its subsequent offer of settlement and ultimate payment of $150,000 to plaintiff cannot be characterized as a \u201cdenial of coverage\u201d within the meaning of ORS 742.504(2)(d)(A). Thus, North Pacific\u2019s filing of the declaratory judgment action did not render the Vincent vehicle \u201cuninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Plaintiff also argues that the Vincent vehicle was \u201cuninsured\u201d within the meaning of the statute because, by failing to intervene or otherwise challenge the Coos County Circuit Court\u2019s judgment in the second declaratory judgment action between North Pacific and Vincent (which held that there was no coverage under the policy because Vincent\u2019s conduct was \u201cintentional\u201d), <em>see </em>169 Or App at 57-58 (quoting <em>Fox, </em>132 Or App at 338-40), defendants waived any argument that they did not deny coverage. Put another way, plaintiff argues that defendants are bound by the Coos County court\u2019s unappealed determination that the accident was not covered by Vincent\u2019s liability policy with North Pacific, even though defendants were not parties to that action and even though that holding is wrong in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent holding in <em>Fox.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">That argument fails. The Coos County judgment was entered pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, ORS chapter 28, which provides that \u201call persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d ORS 28.110. Defendants were not parties to that judgment and, consequently, cannot be bound by its holding, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of the fact that they did not ask to be joined or otherwise challenge the propriety of the judgment. <em>See Nolan v. Jackson National Life Ins. Co., </em>155 Or App 420, 430, 963 P2d 162 (1998), <em>rev den </em>328 Or 275 (1999) (\u201cThat requirement [ORS 28.110] has been held to be jurisdictional; failure to join an interested party renders any judgment void.\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the Coos County judgment has no preclusive effect <em>vis-a-vis </em>defendants. In sum, the Vincent vehicle was not \u201cuninsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">We turn then to plaintiffs alternative argument that the Vincent vehicle was \u201cunderinsured.\u201d ORS 742.502(2)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cUninsured motorist coverage larger than the amounts required by ORS 806.070 shall include underinsurance coverage for damages or death caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle that is insured for an amount that is less than the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. <em>Underinsurance benefits shall be equal to uninsured motorist coverage benefits less the amount recovered from other automobile liability insurance policies.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Plaintiff asserts that, under ORS 742.502(2)(a), he is \u201centitled to underinsurance benefits of $350,000 ($500,000 minus $150,000)\u201d because Fox\u2019s UM limits with defendants were $500,000 and he recovered only $150,000 in his settlement with North Pacific. According to plaintiff, the emphasized language in the statute and <em>Vega v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>323 Or 291, 918 P2d 95 (1996), together stand for the proposition that a vehicle is \u201cunderinsured\u201d within the meaning of the statute if the sums actually paid to the injured party by the liability insurer are less than the injured party\u2019s UM policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Defendants respond that, because both Vincent\u2019s liability policy with North Pacific and Fox\u2019s UM policy with defendants had policy limits of $500,000, the Vincent vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Relying on <em>Lunsford v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>118 Or App 308, 846 P2d 1206, <em>rev den </em>317 Or 162 (1993), defendants assert that the first quoted sentence of ORS 742.502(2)(a) provides that a vehicle is underinsured <em>only </em>if the injured party carries higher amounts of UM coverage than the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage. In defendants\u2019 view, the second quoted sentence of ORS 742.502(2)(a) (\u201c[underinsurance benefits shall be equal to uninsured motorist coverage benefits less the amount recovered from other automobile liability insurance policies\u201d) only comes into play to calculate the <em>amount </em>of underinsurance liability owed when a vehicle meets the definition of \u201cunderinsured.\u201d We agree with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><em>Lunsford </em>is dispositive. There, the plaintiff, who had $50,000 in UM coverage, was injured in an accident caused by Peterson, whose liability insurance had a $50,000 per accident limit. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against Peterson for $25,000 but received only $17,500 because there were multiple claims against his policy. The plaintiff then sued the defendant, her own insurer, for $7,500 in underinsurance benefits. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant and we affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cThe sole issue is whether <em>former </em>ORS 743.789(2) (renumbered ORS 742.502(2)), requires defendant to pay \u2018underinsurance coverage\u2019 on plaintiffs claim. It does not. <em>Under the statute, defendant is required to provide under-insurance coverage only if plaintiffs coverage exceeded Peterson\u2019s liability coverage at the time of the accident. </em>Plaintiff acknowledges that her coverage limits were identical to Peterson\u2019s.\u201d <em>Lunsford, </em>118 Or App at 309 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Thus, our determination that Peterson\u2019s vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d turned on a comparison of his liability policy limits with the plaintiffs UM policy limits, not on whether the amount the plaintiff actually recovered from the liability insurer was less than her UM policy limits. Indeed, had the focus, of our determination been the latter, we would have reached the opposite result, because the plaintiff actually recovered only $17,500 and her UM policy limit was $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Here, the parties agree that Vincent\u2019s liability policy limit and Fox\u2019s UM policy limit are identical: $500,000. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>applying <em>Lunsford, </em>we conclude that the Vincent vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured\u201d within the meaning of ORS 742.502(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><em>Vega, </em>which plaintiff invokes, is not to the contrary. Indeed, nothing in <em>Vega </em>supports plaintiffs assertion that under ORS 742.502, \u201cthe insurer\u2019s liability is reduced only by any sums actually paid to the insured from another source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In <em>Vega, </em>the plaintiffs were injured in an accident caused by Galluci. 323 Or at 293. Galluci had liability insurance with policy limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. The plaintiffs\u2019 UM policy limits were $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The plaintiffs sued Galluci for negligence, but Galluci died while that action was pending. The plaintiffs never amended their complaint to name the personal representative of Galluci\u2019s estate as a defendant, and the trial court consequently dismissed their complaint with prejudice. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a claim for underinsurance benefits against their UM insurer. The trial court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed, arguing that the plaintiffs were precluded from recovering under their UM policy because they has failed to \u201cexhaust\u201d the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability, as required by a provision in their UM policy. <em>Id. </em>at 294. Thus, the question in <em>Vega </em>was whether the \u201cexhaustion\u201d requirement in the plaintiffs\u2019 UM policy was unenforceable because it was \u201cless favorable\u201d to the insured than \u201cif the [statutory provisions] were set forth in the policy.\u201d We affirmed the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for the plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On review, the Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the UM policy\u2019s \u201cexhaustion\u201d clause could not bar the plaintiffs from recovering UM benefits because it was \u201cless favorable\u201d to insureds than the statutes, under which the <em>only </em>basis for reducing the amount of UM benefits paid on an accident involving an \u201cunderinsured\u201d vehicle was that found in ORS 742.504(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThe policy term authorizes the wholesale denial of coverage unless the limit of a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance has been exhausted. ORS 742.504(7)(c)(A) only requires that the insurer\u2019s insurance liability be reduced by any sums <em>actually paid </em>to the insured from another source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cConsequently, the exhaustion provision violates the \u2018no less favorable\u2019 requirement at ORS 742.504.\u201d <em>Vega, </em>327 Or at 302 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Thus, the only issue in <em>Vega </em>was whether the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to recover from Galluci\u2019s liability insurer could bar them from receiving underinsurance benefits to which they were otherwise entitled. The Supreme Court\u2019s observation on which plaintiff relies refers only to the <em>amount </em>of available benefits and not to the qualitatively distinct threshold issue of <em>entitlement to </em>coverage. Consequently, <em>Vega </em>is inapposite, and we adhere to Lunsford: Because Vincent\u2019s liability policy and Fox\u2019s UM policy had the same limits, the Vincent vehicle was not \u201cunderinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We thus conclude that the Vincent vehicle was neither \u201cuninsured\u201d nor \u201cunderinsured.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s allowance of summary judgment against plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief. We similarly, and necessarily, affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs claim for breach of contract and its denial of plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment on the declaratory relief claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We turn finally to plaintiffs second assignment of error, which asserts that the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claim for intentional interference with an advantageous economic relationship. Count Three of the complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\u201c25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 conduct of failing to disclose the $500,000 coverage for uninsured and underinsured motorist protection for William Daryl Fox was conduct which prevented Plaintiff from realizing the full value of his wrongful death claim against Vincent in the following particulars:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201c(a) Defendants knew Plaintiff herein would settle for any amounts over $100,000, the amount of uninsured/ underinsured coverage Plaintiff was led to believe was provided by Defendants\u2019 policies herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201c(b) Defendants knew that any settlement without their consent would absolve Defendants from their obligation to provide any uninsured/underinsured coverage benefits to plaintiff herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201c26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 interference with the economic advantages and relations contained in the lawsuit of Fox v.

ORCP 21 A(8). The trial court granted that motion without explanation. In reviewing dismissal of a claim pursuant to ORCP 21 A(8), we accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and give plaintiff the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be drawn from the facts alleged. <em>Granewich v. Harding, </em>329 Or 47, 51, 985 P2d 788 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">To state a claim for intentional interference with economic relations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a plaintiff must allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201c(1) the existence of a professional or business relationship (which could include, <em>e.g., </em>a contract or a prospective economic advantage); (2) intentional interference with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>relationship or advantage; (3) by a third party; (4) accomplished through improper means or for an improper purpose; (5) a causal effect between the interference and the harm to the relationship or prospective advantage; and (6) damages.\u201d <em>Allen v. Hall, </em>328 Or 276, 281, 974 P2d 199 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that plaintiffs complaint was otherwise sufficient, we conclude that plaintiff did not allege the existence of a protected \u201cbusiness relationship\u201d or \u201cprospective economic advantage\u201d for purposes of the tort of intentional interference with economic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Before focusing on whether the relationship plaintiff alleged is protected by the tort of intentional interference with economic relations, we must first define the exact nature of the alleged relationship. In that regard, it is helpful to review the events surrounding the alleged \u201cinterference\u201d by defendants, as described in plaintiffs complaint. Plaintiff, the personal representative of Fox\u2019s estate, was litigating a wrongful death claim against Vincent, the driver of the truck in which Fox was killed. Vincent\u2019s insurer, North Pacific, was representing Vincent in that litigation. North Pacific had also initiated a declaratory judgment action against both Vincent and plaintiff, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that its policy with Vincent was void due to Vincent\u2019s fraudulent and intentional acts. Plaintiff had not yet filed a claim against defendants for UM coverage. However, because plaintiff feared that North Pacific might either deny coverage or prevail in its declaratory judgment action, plaintiff contacted defendants to inquire about Fox\u2019s UM. coverage at the time of the accident. At that time, defendants told plaintiff that Fox\u2019s UM policy limit was $100,000, when in fact it was $500,000. Thereafter, plaintiff and North Pacific began negotiating a settlement of the wrongful death claim. Plaintiff advised defendants that he was considering settling with North Pacific for $150,000, but defendants did not reply. Plaintiff then accepted North Pacific\u2019s settlement of the wrongful death claim for $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Thus, the gravamen of plaintiffs intentional interference claim is that defendants, by misrepresenting the amount of Fox\u2019s UM coverage, caused plaintiff to settle rather than go to trial against Vincent and North Pacific (or to settle with North Pacific for an amount less than plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>would have obtained had plaintiff known the true limits of the UM coverage). Implicit in that assertion is the notion that, had plaintiff known of the $500,000 limit on Fox\u2019s UM policy, he would have approached the North Pacific litigation more aggressively: He would have known that, even if he rejected settlement with North Pacific and ultimately lost the North Pacific litigation because the occurrence was not deemed to be an \u201caccident\u201d within the liability coverage, he could then seek to recover up to $500,000 in UM coverage on the ground that the Vincent vehicle was uninsured.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, armed with the knowledge that the UM limits were $500,000, not $100,000, he might have obtained a richer settlement or judgment against North Pacific. Instead, plaintiff contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">\u201cPlaintiff, not knowing a $500,000 uninsured motorist policy was in effect to cover the wrongful death of Billy Fox, was faced with an economic decision. Settle for the $150,000 offered by Vincent\u2019s carrier prior to a declaration that there was no coverage for Vincent\u2019s acts or proceed to trial, obtain a dry judgment against Vincent, and thereafter, collect $100,000 from these Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">With that background in mind, we return to consider the nature of the relationship that was the object of the alleged interference. Plaintiffs complaint, as quoted above, alleges that: \u201cDefendants\u2019 interference with <em>the economic advantages and relations contained in the lawsuit of Fox v. Vincent </em>is wrongful beyond the fact of the interference itself.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, as pleaded, the \u201ceconomic relationship\u201d with which defendants\u2019 conduct allegedly interfered was the <em>ongoing litigation between plaintiff and North Pacific, </em>Vincent\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs brief characterizes his \u201ceconomic relationship\u201d with North Pacific as one in which \u201cplaintiff (the estate of the deceased) was the potential third-party beneficiary of a contract for automobile insurance between North Pacific and Vincent.\u201d However, as detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>above, plaintiffs complaint does not allege interference with any contractual relationship, much less a third-party beneficiary relationship arising from the liability policy. Rather, the object of the alleged interference is explicitly described as \u201cthe economic advantages and relations contained in the lawsuit of <em>Fox v. Vincent.\u201d </em>In reviewing a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we limit our review to the \u201cface of the complaint.\u201d <em>Chaney v. Shell Oil Co., </em>111 Or App 556, 567, 827 P2d 196, <em>rev den </em>313 Or 299 (1992). Accordingly, the question before us is limited to whether the economic relationship alleged in plaintiffs complaint, <em>viz., </em>\u201cthe economic advantages and relations contained in the lawsuit of <em>Fox v. Vincent,\u201d </em>is a business relationship or expectancy for purposes of the tort of intentional interference with economic relations. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Under Oregon law, a party may recover damages for wrongful interference with a contract. <em>Wampler v. Palmerton, </em>250 Or 65, 439 P2d 601 (1968). The interest protected by the tort is \u201cthe interest of the individual in the security and integrity of the contractual relations into which he has entered. Economic relations are controlled by contract and the public also has an interest in maintaining the security of such transactions.\u201d <em>Wampler, </em>250 Or at 73. Moreover, in appropriate circumstances, a third-party\u2019s interference may be actionable \u201ceven though the arrangement interfered with does not rise to the dignity of a contract.\u201d <em>Luisi v. Bank of Commerce, </em>252 Or 271, 275, 449 P2d 441 (1969); <em>see, e.g., Aylett v. Universal Frozen Foods Co., </em>124 Or App 146, 861 P2d 375 (1993) (potato growers could bring action for intentional interference with their relationship with a prospective buyer). <em>See also McGanty v. Staudenraus, </em>321 Or 532, 535, 901 P2d 841 (1995) (describing the tort of intentional interference with economic relations as protecting a \u201cprospective economic advantage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Most recently, in <em>Allen, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court held that \u201can intentional interference with a prospective inheritance may be actionable under a reasonable extension of the well-established tort known as intentional interference with economic relations.\u201d 328 Or at 280. In <em>Allen, </em>the plaintiff <em>i </em>alleged that, but for the defendants\u2019 interference, they wo fid have inherited certain property from the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>George Putman. The plaintiffs were not named beneficiaries of Putman\u2019s will, but they alleged facts that demonstrated that they almost certainly would have been were it not for the defendants\u2019 interference.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On certification from the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for intentional interference with economic relations, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">\u201cAlthough, heretofore, this court has applied [the tort of intentional interference with economic relations] only to contractual and business relationships and prospects, we are persuaded that the tort also may, by a reasonable and principled extension, be made applicable to some <em>noncommercial </em>relationships and prospects, such as the one alleged by plaintiffs in the present case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201c[B]efore we attempt to relate the allegations in the present complaint to the elements of [the tort of intentional interference with economic relations], we must explain why the tort may, by a reasonable and principled extension, be made applicable to a prospective inheritance \u2014 typically a noncommercial expectancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cThe answer lies in the very close analogy that exists between an expectancy of inheritance and those other interests to which this court has already extended the protections of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Although an expectancy of inheritance is, by definition, purely prospective, so are many of the commercial interests that have been associated with and are protected by the tort. <em>See McGanty, </em>321 Or at 535 (noting that tort protects prospective economic advantage in addition to existing contracts and business relationships). Moreover, prospects of inheritance long have been recognized as interests that are worthy of common-law protection. Ultimately, an expectancy of inheritance is an interest that fits by logical extension within the concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>underlying the tort of intentional interference with prospective advantage and, absent some legitimate reason for excluding it, may be deemed to be covered by the theory of recovery.\u201d 328 Or at 280-81 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Thus, the court has recognized that the tort of intentional interference with economic relations may be \u201cmade applicable to some <em>noncommercial </em>relationships and prospects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281 (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, it is a question of first impression whether a civil lawsuit constitutes the kind of noncommercial relationship and prospective economic advantage protected by the tort of intentional interference with economic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We recognize at the outset that a civil lawsuit represents a prospective economic advantage. In any civil action for damages, the plaintiffs claim represents an expectancy in a monetary recovery that is the object of the litigation. And, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Allen, </em>many of the commercial interests that have been associated with, and are protected by, the tort of intentional interference with economic relations are purely prospective in nature. 328 Or at 281. Indeed, at least with respect to the nature of the economic advantage at issue, an expectancy in a settlement or judgment in a civil lawsuit is no different from an expectancy in an inheritance or a prospective commercial arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Notwithstanding that similarity, there are material distinctions between a civil lawsuit and other relationships and interests to which the Supreme Court has extended the protections of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Because of those dissimilarities, we decline to extend the tort into this context:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\"><em>First, </em>the essential purpose of the tort is to protect the integrity of, and expectancies in, voluntarily created economic relationships. Conversely, a civil lawsuit is an involuntary relationship that is adversarial in nature. In its earliest and most basic form, the purpose of the tort was to protect \u201cthe interest of the individual in the security and integrity of the contractual relations in which he has entered.\u201d <em>Wampler, </em>250 Or at 73 (discussing evolution of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>from ancient Roman law). As courts expanded the tort to protect prospective relations, it encompassed \u201cany prospective contractual relations * * * which would be of pecuniary value to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>see Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 766B comment c (1974), and which were uniformly voluntary in nature. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIncluded are interferences with the prospect of obtaining employment or employees, the opportunity of selling or buying land or chattels or services, and any other relations leading to potentially profitable contracts [including] a continuing business or other customary relationship not amounting to a formal contract.\u201d). Thereafter, courts began to recognize \u201cintentional interference with inheritance or gift,\u201d considering it as an \u201cextension of the principle found in liability for intentional interference with prospective contracts.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 774B comment a (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Thus, while courts have expanded the tort to protect additional types of relationships, its purpose has been constant: To protect the integrity of voluntary economic relationships, both commercial and noncommercial, that would have very likely resulted in a pecuniary benefit to the plaintiff but for the defendant\u2019s interference. We further observe that the relationships protected by the tort are, by virtue of their \u201cvoluntariness,\u201d the products of the parties\u2019 free and voluntary actions as autonomous individuals. Thus, in the abstract, the tort serves the essential purpose of protecting the basic right of the individual to conduct his or her economic affairs autonomously, <em>viz., </em>without interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Protection of a prospective interest in the outcome of civil litigation does not comport with that essential purpose. A lawsuit is, by its nature, an involuntary relationship. In fact, the only basis for the relationship between opposing parties in a lawsuit is a dispute. The integrity of an actual or putative mutually voluntary relationship is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>Second, </em>courts have not historically afforded prospective interests in the outcome of civil litigation the same level of common-law protection extended to prospective contracts or prospective inheritances. <em>Cf. Allen, </em>328 Or at 281 (\u201cProspects of inheritance long have been recognized as interests that are worthy of common-law protection.\u201d). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>interests in litigation are certainly afforded some comm on - law protection, <em>e.g., </em>legal malpractice, we have found no reported decision from any jurisdiction in which a court has extended the tort of intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage to protect civil litigation. <em>Cf. Blank v. Kirwan, </em>39 Cal 3d 311, 216 Cal Rptr 718, 703 P2d 58, 70 (1985) (a person\u2019s expectancy in the outcome of a government licensing proceeding is not protected against outside interference because the tort of intentional interference with economic relations has not traditionally protected whatever expectancies may be involved in the governmental licensing process).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><em>Allen </em>represents our Supreme Court\u2019s furthest extension of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Unlike in <em>Allen, </em>the relationship and resulting prospective interest here was not voluntary and, thus, the alleged interference did not implicate the tort\u2019s essential purpose. Unlike in <em>Allen, </em>where other courts had traditionally and consistently protected expectancies in inheritance, no reported decision has extended the tort to apply in this context. Given those distinctions, we decline to go further.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In so concluding, we emphasize the precise and limited nature of our holding. We decide only that plaintiff failed to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. That holding is based on the peculiar character and requisites of that tort. We do not address, much less purport to preclude, the availability of other tort causes of action, including fraud, in analogous circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs claim against defendants for intentional interference with his litigation with North Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u201c2 Plaintiffs policy provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201c We do not provide coverage * * * for bodily injury sustained by anyone * * * if, without our consent, the bodily injury or death claim is settled or is resolved by a judgment in a court of law.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u201c3 The gravamen of plaintiffs tortious interference claim was that, by misrepresenting the amount of the UM coverage, defendants caused plaintiff to settle for an amount less than plaintiff would have, had plaintiff known the true limits of his own UM coverage.\u201d <em>Fox, </em>132 Or App at 338-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\"> Plaintiffs supplemental brief on remand, which \u201ctotally replaces the prior appellant\u2019s brief filed in this case,\u201d does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his action for fraud.
