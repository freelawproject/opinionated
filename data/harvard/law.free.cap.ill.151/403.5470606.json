Appeals\u2014review of questions of fact. The question whether the plaintiff has performed his part of the contract in suit, and whether there has been an unreasonable and vexatious delay of payment by the defendant, so as to authorize a recovery of interest on an open account, is conclusively settled by the affirmance of the judgment of the trial court by the Appellate Court, and can not be considered by this court.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-11\" pgmap=\"415\">2. Practice\u2014misconduct of attorneys with jury after trial. After a jurjr had signed and sealed their verdict they left the court-room and met the attorney of the plaintiff, who took several of them to a saloon,, where he and an attorney for the defendant treated them to cigars and' intoxicating liquors: Held, that the conduct of the attorneys and the offending jurors was deserving of the severest condemnation, but as the, attorneys were equally guilty of misconduct, the verdict would not be, set aside.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b415-12\" pgmap=\"415\">3.

The contention on the part of the defendant, the appellant here, was that that was not done. The judgment of the Circuit Court was for plaintiffs, the appellees here, for the sum of $3,662.70. That judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Court for the First District, and the questions of fact are settled by those adjudications.</p> <p id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">The first question of law presented by this appeal is that a recovery could not be had under the declaration in this case on the facts presented by this record. We do not feel \u25a0called upon to discuss the sufficiency of the declaration. On a careful examination of the record, it does not appear that any objection on that ground was made to the introduction of evidence, and no motion to exclude was made, on the contrary, from the record the case was tried on the theory that the declaration was sufficient. It does not appear that that question was raised in the Appellate Court. There is neither objection and exception or motion in the record on which that question can be raised here. Neither \u2022can it be raised for the first time in this court. It is also insisted by appellant that the judgments of the Appellate and Circuit Courts should be reversed, because interest was allowed on an open account, which could not be done unless payment thereof has been unreasonably and vexatiously delayed. That question, like that as to whether the contract was performed on the part of appellees, was a question of fact, which we are, by the statute, precluded from determining.</p> <p id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419(140) 420(363)\">The instructions to the jury, given by the court, made a correct application of the law, and there was not error in the refusal or modification of instructions, neither was there error in the rulings of the court in the admission or exclusion of evidence. Appellant assigned, among other causes why the motion for new trial should have been allowed, that some of the jurors were guilty of improper \u2022conduct and were improperly tampered with, and numerous affidavits were filed on the part of appellant as well as counter-affidavits on the part of appellees on this question. It appears the jury retired in charge of an officer to consider of their verdict but a short time before the hour for adjournment for the day, and were instructed to render a .sealed verdict. After the court adjourned a sealed verdict was returned and delivered to the officer or clerk, and the jury were to return the next morning. After the jury were discharged for the day, and on the same evening, as they were leaving the court-house, as a result of some remark from one of the jurors to one Ludden, an attorney who represented plaintiffs, he, Ludden, invited those present, being most of the jurors, to have a cigar, and entered a saloon near, and there found one Moore, one of the attorneys who represented the defendant. Ludden, with several of the men Avho were on the jury, went to an adjoining room, where they were joined by Moore, and both Ludden and Moore treated several times to cigars and intoxicants, and there engaged in telling anecdotes, etc., the chief burden of paying the bills falling on Ludden. No motion or suggestion was made the next morning in open court as a suggestion or motion in the case, but an effort seems to have been made by Moore to make a confidential communication to the judge, to which the judge replied: \u201cI do not care to hear confidential communications.\u2019 \u2019 The verdict was announced, and the attention of the court first called to the matter by the motion and affidavits. No condemnation allowed by law for such impropriety could be too severely visited on Ludden, Moore, and those members of the jury who were guilty of the improper conduct. Nor Avould we hesitate to set the verdict aside if Ludden alone had been the offending party with the jury, but from a careful reading of the affidavits it would seem that Moore\u2019s position is not superior to Ludden\u2019s. Whilst condemning the action of both Ludden and Moore, we are, with all the facts appearing, not disposed to give either side any benefit or advantage because of the improper action of the other. The other question raised as to the improper actions of the jury when in the jury-box, should have been called to the attention of the trial court. It is not of that character for which Ave are disposed to disturb this verdict. The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AUe\" pgmap=\"420\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
