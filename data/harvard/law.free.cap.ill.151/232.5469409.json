Negligence\u2014action for damages\u2014due care of plaintiff. In am action to recover \u00edor a personal injury, no recovery can be had unless the person injured used ordinary care to avoid the injury. But whether the person exercised such care, is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-17\" pgmap=\"244\">2. Same\u2014instruction as to the time due care is used. In an action to recover for a personal injury to the plaintiffs intestate, the court, in instructing the jury in regard to the degree of care required of the deceased, used this language: \u201cIf the jury further believe from the evidence that the said O. (the deceased), at the time of the injury, was exercising due and proper care and means to foresee and prevent such injury,\u201d etc.: Held, that the words \u201cat the time of the injury\u201d could not be held to restrict the exercise of due care to the moment of the injury, but that they had reference to the whole transaction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-18\" pgmap=\"244\">3. Same\u2014rate of speed of trains\u2014question of fact for the jury. In the same case, after the court had read the instructions, one of the jurors asked the court: \u201cHow as to the rate of speed?\u201d and the court then instructed the jury in writing, \u201cthat the rate of speed is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d The main question before the jury was whether the deceased lost his life through the negligence of the defendant, and in arriving at a solution of that question, the rate of the speed of the train, was a fact, in connection with others, which the jury might properly consider: Held, no error in the instruction, and that the jury could not be led to believe from it that they had the right to determine absolutely the rate of speed at which defendant\u2019s train might run at the street crossing.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-19\" pgmap=\"244\">4. Same\u2014a question of fact for the jury. The court can never be called upon to say to the jury that negligence has been established as a matter of law, unless the conduct of the injured person has been so clearly and palpably negligent, that all reasonable minds would so pronounce it without hesitation or dissent.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-20\" pgmap=\"244(20) 245(9)\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District; \u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County; the Hon.

Clifford, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\" pgmap=\"245\">On the 2d day of July, 1890, while Joseph Ouska was crossing the tracks of the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, on State street, near Sixty-third street, he was struck and killed by a passenger train coming from the East. This action was brought by his administratrix to recover for the death.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245\">The declaration contains two counts.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\" pgmap=\"245\">The first count alleges that appellant, by its servants, so&gt; carelessly and negligently drove and managed an engine and train that, by and through the neglect of the servants, of the defendant, an engine and train struck said Joseph Ouska and killed him while he was crossing State street, in Chicago.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\" pgmap=\"245\">The second count charges appellant with negligence in driving an engine upon State street (a public highway), and charging that, in so doing, no bell, of at least thirty pounds weight, or steam whistle placed on the engine, was rung or whistled eighty rods from said crossing, and kept ringing or whistling until the crossing was reached.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-9\" pgmap=\"245\">Each count contains an averment of next of kin.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-10\" pgmap=\"245\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, and on a trial before a jury plaintiff recovered a judgment of $5,000, which, on appeal, was affirmed in the Appellate Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-11\" pgmap=\"245(91) 246(132)\">Immediately south of Sixty-third street, State street, (which is a public street in the city of Chicago), was crossed in a southeasterly direction by twenty-five railroad tracks, twenty-two of which were owned and operated by the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway Company, the appellant, and three by the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago Railway Company. Ouska lived in the northern part of' the city, and worked, at that time, at Badenoch\u2019s planing mill, which was south of appellant\u2019s tracks, near Sixty-fourth street. He, therefore, necessarily crossed the tracks. in going to, and returning from, his work. At about fifteen minutes before seven o\u2019clock in the morning on the \u25a0day of the accident, Ouska, in company with five or six other men, arrived at the intersection of State street with these tracks. Here he was detained for some time by trains on the tracks. Finally, the seven o\u2019clock whistle at the shops, blew for the men to commence work, when Ouska, and those with him, made an attempt to cross the tracks, and as they were doing so a passenger train of appellant, known as the \u201cSouth Chicago Dummy,\u201d approached at a rate of speed estimated at thirty miles an hour, and as Ouska was \u25a0crossing the track on which this train was running, he was struck and instantly killed.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-4\" pgmap=\"246\">Messrs.

Smith, for the appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-5\" pgmap=\"246\">The facts connected w\u00bfth the deceased\u2019s injury being testified to by eye witnesses, the undisputed facts show a total want of care on the part of the deceased in reference to foreseeing and preventing his injury. There being a total want of evidence of due care on deceased\u2019s part, the trial \u25a0court erred in giving plaintiff\u2019s instructions presupposing \u25a0evidence of his care. Cothran v. Ellis et al., 125 Ill. 505.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\" pgmap=\"246\">The rule of law is clear, that one who (as did the deceased in this case, as we claim upon the evidence) runs, with a view of crossing a track of a railroad company, ahead of a locomotive moving in rapid motion thereon toward him, and who, miscalculating the distance, is injured in the attempt, is guilty of such contributory negligence that he can not recover for his injury.

C. P. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Lewis, 145 Ill. 67.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-4\" pgmap=\"247\">The instruction given at the instance of the plaintiff was faulty in allowing a recovery against the defendant, if at the particular moment of his injury deceased was exercising due and proper care to foresee and prevent his injury.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">This instruction in this case was also faulty, for these two reasons:</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247\">First. That the plaintiff averred that the deceased was himself in the exercise of due care during the entire time that he was walking upon and across said crossing on the public highway there being.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\" pgmap=\"247\">The instruction permitted the plaintiff to make one case by the declaration and another by the evidence, as to the time that the deceased was required to exercise care, as a basis of recovery.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\" pgmap=\"247\">Second. Because, in a case such as is the one at bar, the obligation of an injured party to observe due care should extend to all the circumstances connected with the act of crossing, and should not, as is done by this instruction, be restricted to the moment of deceased\u2019s injury.

In an action to recover for a personal injury, it is a well settled principle that no recovery can be had unless the person injured used ordinary care to avoid the injury. But whether the person injured exercised ordinary care to avoid the injury, is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. The same question arose in L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 135 Ill. 641, and it is there said:</p> <p id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">\u201cThe court can never be called upon to say to the jury that negligence has been established as a matter of law, unless the conduct of the injured party has been so clearly and palpably negligent, that all reasonable minds would so pronounce it without hesitation or dissent. Negligence can not be conclusively established by a state of facts upon which fair-minded men will differ. Unless the negligence of the plaintiff is proven by such conclusive evidence, that there can be no difference of opinion as to its existence upon the mere statement of facts, the jury must pass upon it. We have repeatedly held, that it is a question of fact to be determined by the jury from the evidence, and not a question of law, whether an injured party has exercised ordinary care for his safety and to avoid injury.\u201d See, also : C. &amp; E. I. R. R. Co. v. O\u2019 Connor, 119 Ill. 586; T. H. &amp; I. R. R. Co. v. Voelker, 129 id. 540; Penn. Co. v. Frana, 112 id. 398; C. &amp; I. R. R. Co. v. Lane, 130 id. 116.</p> <p id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249(50) 250(22)\">It may be conceded, that there is some evidence in the record which tends to prove that the deceased did not exercise that care and caution which a reasonably prudent person should have exercised to avoid the injury, but when all the facts and circumstances are considered and given due weight, we think there was enough evidence, tending to establish ordinary care, to submit the question of fact to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b250-4\" pgmap=\"250\">The court gave but one instruction for the plaintiff, and in regard to the degree of care required of the deceased, it contained the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b250-5\" pgmap=\"250\">\u201cIf the jury further believe from the evidence, that said Joseph Ouska, at the time of the injury, was exercising due and proper care, and was using duo and reasonable care and means to foresee and prevent said injury,\u201d etc.</blockquote> <p id=\"b250-6\" pgmap=\"250(278) 251(37)\">It is claimed by the defendant, that the words, at the time of the injury, restrict the exercise of due care on the part of the deceased to the moment of his injury. We do not concur in that view. The words, at the time of the injury, as used in the instruction, have reference to the whole transaction, and all that occurred from the time the deceased reached the tracks until he was killed. L. S. &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. v. Johnsen, 135 Ill. 653; C. &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Fisher, 141 id. 625. After the court had read the instructions to the jury, one of the jurors asked the court this question, \u201cHow as to the rate of speed?\u201d And the court then instructed the jury in writing, as follows: \u201cThe rate of speed is a question of fact for the jury.\u201d It is contended that the instruction is erroneous. The main question before the jury, was whether the deceased lost his life through the negligence of the defendant, and in arriving at a solution of that question, the rate of speed of the train was a fact, in connection with other facts, which the jury might properly consider. There was no doubt what the court intended by the instruction, and for that purpose we do not regard it erroneous. We do not think the jury could be led to believe, that under the instruction they had the right to determine absolutely the rate of speed at which defendant\u2019s train might run at the crossing, or that they had the right to find any speed negligence that they might see proper. If the instruction would bear such a construction, it might be held erroneous, but we do not think it could be construed in that way. The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AA4\" pgmap=\"251\">T 7 , \u201e 1 Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
