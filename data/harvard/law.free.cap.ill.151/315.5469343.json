Foreclosure\u2014proof of execution of notes. Where there is no denial of the execution of the notes secured by mortgage, in a bill to foreclose, the production of the notes on the hearing is sufficient evidence of their execution.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-16\" pgmap=\"327\">2. Trust Deed\u2014application by cestui que trust to file bill to foreclose. Where a deed of trust provides, that on default of payment the legal bolder of the notes secured may apply to the trustee to file a bill to foreclose, the fact that the cestui que trust joins with the trustee in a bill to foreclose, is evidence of his application to the trustee to file the bill.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-17\" pgmap=\"327\">3. Same\u2014right to declare whole debt due without notice. Where a trust deed provides, that if default be made in the payment of the notes, or either, or any part of them, the whole of the notes shall, at the option of the legal holder of them, become immediately due and payable, but makes no provision for notice of the exercise of such option, neither the mortgagor, nor those claiming under him, can be permitted to insist upon notice of the exercise of the option as a condition precedent to the right of the mortgagee to file a bill to foreclose for the whole debt.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-18\" pgmap=\"327\">4. Where no formula or particular form of expression is made necessary to declare the maturity of the whole indebtedness, the formation of an intention in the mind of the person who has the option to declare the entire debt due, accompanied by any affirmative act or declaration evincing such determination, will be sufficient. The preparation of a bill to foreclose, and authorizing the same to be filed, is sufficient evidence of the intention to exercise the option.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b327-19\" pgmap=\"327\">5. The extension of the time of payment of the first of a series of notes secured by deed of trust, until another note and the interest on other notes mature, will not, after the expiration of such extension, deprive the legal holder of the notes of the right of declaring the whole indebtedness due and foreclosing the deed of trust.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-4\" pgmap=\"328\">6. Mortgage\u2014rights of purchaser of undivided part of equity of redemption. It is well settled in this State, that a purchaser of part of mortgaged premises can not redeem the part' purchased by him by paying a proportion of the mortgage debt. The mortgagee is entitled to retain his lien upon every part of the mortgaged premises until the whole of the mortgage debt is paid. He will not be compelled, in equity, to release a portion of the premises upon payment of a proportionate part of the incumbrance upon the whole.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-5\" pgmap=\"328\">7. Same\u2014-foreclosure as against purchaser of part of the equity of redemption. A court of equity, in the absence of equities arising between the purchaser of the equity of redemption and the mortgagee, before attempting an apportionment, or requiring the sale in undivided interests, will require it to be shown that the mortgagee will not be prejudiced thereby.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-6\" pgmap=\"328\">S. Same\u2014sale on foreclosure in the inverse order of alienation of the equity of redemption. On bill to foreclose a mortgage, it appeared that the mortgagor sold his equity of redemption to A., who assumed the payment of the mortgage debt; and that A. sold an undivided one-fifth of the equity of redemption to B., who assumed to pay one-fifth of the mortgage debt. The court, by its decree, ordered sale of the entire premises, refusing to so apportion the indebtedness upon the land that B. could redeem a part of the premises by paying a pro rata share of the incumbrance, or to require the four-fifths interest of A. to be first sold. 16 was not alleged by the pleadings that the undivided four-fifths, if sold separately, would bring enough to satisfy the four-fifths of the indebtedness and costs remaining after the payment of one-fifth by B., or that it would bring as much proportionately when thus sold as it would if the land was sold together: Held, that there was no error in the decree.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-7\" pgmap=\"328\">9. In such case it was insisted, that the court should have marshalled the securities, and subjected the portion of the land retained by A. to the payment of the mortgage debtbefore applying to the undivided interest of B. therein, but it was held, that the insistence could not be sustained, for the further reason that'no equities existed in favor of the latter, that the entire debt should be paid by A., or that his interest in the land should constitute a fund for the extinguishment of the lien upon the interest held by B.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b328-8\" pgmap=\"328(100) 329(19)\">10. The rule requiring the sale of land in the inverse order of alienation, and treating the portion of land retained by the mortgagor as the primary fund out of which to satisfy the mortgage debt, rests upon the reason that the mortgagor sells a part of the mortgaged premises relieved of the incumbrance, and retains a part himself; that, as between the mortgagor and such grantee, the part held by the mortgagor, inequity and good conscience, should be first subjected to the payment o\u00a3 the mortgage debt. The same principle will apply as between a pur\u25a0chaser of the equity of redemption, subject to the mortgage, as A. purchased, and a purchaser from him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b329-5\" pgmap=\"329\">11. The right to compel resort to the interest of the mortgagor presupposes that the debt has remained his, and that he is primarily liable for its payment. Hence, when he has paid it, either voluntarily, or his interest in the land has been thus applied, he will he entitled to no contribution from the portion of the land he has aliened.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\" pgmap=\"329\">Writ of Error to the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014heard in that court on writ of error to the Superior Court of Cook County; the Hon. Philip Stein, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329\">This was a bill in the Superior Court of Cook county, brought July 30, 1892, by appellees, to foreclose a trust deed on twenty-five acres of land, specifically described, in Sec. 6, T. 39 N., R. 13 E., in said county, executed by appellant Brown to Alexander McKay, trustee, to secure the payment of three certain promissory notes of $6,666.66, -each, dated December 4, 1890, and payable in one, two and three years, respectively, to the order of said John A. McKay, with interest at six per cent per annum, payable semiannually, and evidenced by coupons attached to said notes. The mortgagor conveyed the premises to one Reynolds, subject to the mortgage, which the latter agreed to pay, who, in turn, sold an undivided one-fifth thereof to one Hans P. Johnson, the conveyance to Johnson being in trust for himself and others, naming them, and all these persons were made parties defendant to the bill.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\" pgmap=\"329(98) 330(50)\">The cestui que trust joined with the trustee as complainant in the bill. The trust deed provided, that if default should be made in the payment of said notes, or any part thereof, or of the interest thereon, or any part thereof, at the time -and in the manner specified, then the whole of said principal sum and interest secured by said three notes should, at the option of the legal holder thereof, become immediately due and payable; and, on the application of the legal holder of said notes, the grantee might file a bill, etc:, for foreclosure and sale of the whole, or any part of said premises, and out of the proceeds of such sale, to pay the costs of suit, including reasonable fees and commissions to the executor of the trust, and $500 attorney\u2019s and solicitor\u2019s fees, and the principal and interest of said notes.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">The bill alleged, and it appeared, that at the time of filing the bill, $2,266.66 of the note first falling due, and a large amount of interest upon all of said notes was due and unpaid; and, it is alleged, that for the default in payment of balance of said first note, and interest on said balance, and the semi-annual interest on the other two notes, etc., said John A. McKay has elected to and has declared the whole principal sum of the three notes, and interest thereon,, due and payable. It is then alleged, that the sum of $500 is due for attorney\u2019s fees, under the conditions of said mortgage. Prayer of the bill is for a receiver, that a guardian ad litem be appointed for minor defendants, for an accounting, and that the defendants, or such of them as may be liable, be adjudged to pay whatever sum is found due, with solicitor\u2019s fees and costs, etc., that the mortgage be foreclosed, and in default of payment, sale be made, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\" pgmap=\"330\">Joint and several answer of the defendants, Hans P.

Numerous points are made in appellant\u2019s brief, but we shall only notice such of them as merit discussion. Among other things it is insisted, that there was no evidence that the cestui que use applied to the trustee to commence the suit, the provision in the trust deed being, that on application of the lawful holder of the notes, it should be lawful for the trustee to file a bill. The bill in this case was brought by the cestui que use himself, jointly with the trustee. The objection is, as a matter of course, without merit.</p> <p id=\"b335-8\" pgmap=\"335\">II. It is next objected, that there was no evidence of the execution of the notes. There being in this direct proceeding no denial of the technical execution of the notes, their execution was proved by their production in evidence. It, however, may be said that,the complainant testified, that the notes were given by Brown, as a consideration for the. purchase of the mortgaged premises.</p> <p id=\"b335-9\" pgmap=\"335(82) 336(163)\">III. It is next objected, that the option to declare the whole sum due given by the trust deed to the cestui qua use was not sexercised before the filing of the bill. It is provided in the trust deed, that if default be made in payment of the notes, or of the interest, or any part thereof, in the time and manner specified, the whole of the principal sum and interest secured by said notes shall, at the option of the legal holder thereof, become immediately due and payable. It is to be observed, that no notice is required to be given to the debtor, of the exercise of the option to declare the whole of the indebtedness due. He, and all persons claiming under him, after the recording of the trust deed, were required to know that the whole sum might, at any time, be declared due, after there was default in payment, according to the terms of the trust deed. Not having provided in the deed for such notice, he, nor those claiming under him, with notice of the right of election, can be permitted to insist upon notice of the exercise of the option as a condition precedent to the right to file the bill. Princeton L. &amp; T. Co. v. Munson, 60 Ill. 375; Heath v. Hall, id. 344; Harper et al. v. Ely, 56 id. 179; 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 1182.</p> <p id=\"b336-5\" pgmap=\"336\">The option to declare the whole indebtedness due upon default in payment, is given to the legal holder or holders of the notes, to be exercised in their discretion, and without notice to the mortgagor. No formula is to be observed, nor particular form of expression necessary to be used for the purpose of declaring the maturity of the whole indebtedness. The formation of an intention in the mind of the person who has the option to exercise his election to declare the entire debt matured, accompanied by any affirmative act or declaration evincing such determination, will be sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b336-6\" pgmap=\"336(97) 337(172)\">The evidence is not entirely satisfactory, but tends to show, that McKay, the legal holder of the notes, had on several occasions expressed a determination to declare the entire amount due and to foreclose the trust deed therefor, and gave notice thereof to the defendants, or some of them. And the point made could, perhaps, be determined upon this evidence adversely to appellants. But it is unquestionable, that, before the filing of the bill, McKay had determined to and did exercise his option to declare the whole indebtedness, secured by the trust deed, immediately due and payable, by the preparation of the bill and authorizing the same to be filed. By the bill filed at his instance, he \u25a0not only alleges that he has declared the entire debt due and payable, but that it is, because of the default, due and payable. No notice of the election being required to be given, it can not be material that any particular time should elapse between the declaration and the filing of the bill. It could serve no purpose to require, that the declaration should be made a month, a week, or an hour before proceeding to foreclose the security. It therefore follows, that we are of opinion, that the determination on the part of the holder of the notes to file a bill for the foreclosure of the trust deed, for the entire indebtedness, and causing the same to be prepared and filed, in pursuance of such determination, was a sufficient election to declare the whole sum due, and to entitle him to maintain his bill.</p> <p id=\"b337-5\" pgmap=\"337\">IV. It is next insisted, that there was an extension of the time of payment, after the indebtedness became due, and there was thereby a waiver of the right to accelerate the maturity of the notes. It appears, that on December 4, 1891, when the first principal note became due, McKay extended the time of payment of that note until June 4, 1892, when another installment of interest would become due upon all of the notes. No fair construction of the evidence even tends, as we think, to show an extension beyond that time, for payment of the interest falling due at the latter date. So that, if it should be held that McKay had waived his right to accelerate the maturity of the last two notes, because of default in payment of the first note, there was clearly no such waiver of default in payment of the interest falling due June 4, 1892. When all the evidence is considered, it satisfactorily appears, that it was not understood by the parties that any delay in payment was to be granted beyond the latter date.</p> <p id=\"b337-6\" pgmap=\"337(21) 338(120)\">V. It is also urged, that the court erred in not decreeing that the indebtedness be so apportioned that an equitable part of it should fall upon the undivided one-fifth of the land purchased by Johnson; and, it is said, that the decree should have so provided, or that a sale should have been ordered, in the inverse order of alienation. That is to say, that the indebtedness should have been so apportioned that the Johnsons might release their undivided fifth of the premises upon payment of one-fifth of the incumbrance; or, that the four-fifths in the hands of Reynolds should, have been treated as the primary fund, for the payment and discharge of the mortgage lien, and resort had to the fifth, in the equity of redemption, held by Johnsons, only after the exhaustion of the four-fifths remaining in Reynolds.</p> <p id=\"b338-5\" pgmap=\"338\">It is alleged in the bill, that the purchasers of the equity of redemption purchased subject to the trust deed and assumed the indebtedness. That is, that Reynolds, on his purchase- from Brown, the mortgagor, assumed the whole of it, and that Johnson, in his purchase from Reynolds of an undivided one-fifth of the equity of redemption, took subject to the trust deed, agreeing with Reynolds to pay a pro rata share of the incumbrance. This is admitted in the answer of adult defendants, and is expressly conceded in this court by counsel on both sides. The purchasers of the equity of redemption were required to know that every part of the land was subject to the lien of the trust deed. And it is well settled in this State, that a purchaser of a part of mortgaged premises can not redeem the part purchased by him by paying a proportion of the mortgage debt. The mortgagee is entitled to retain his lien upon every part of the mortgaged premises until the whole \u25a0 of the mortgage debt is paid. Meacham v. Steele, 93 Ill. 135; Davis v. Dresback, 81 id. 393. He will not be compelled, in equity, to release a portion of the premises upon payment of a proportionate part of the incumbrance upon the whole.</p> <p id=\"b339-4\" pgmap=\"339\">It is not shown or pretended, that any equities arose in favor of the Johnsons, under any contract with the McKays, \u2022or because of any conduct on their part, by which the John-sons were induced to purchase from Reynolds. It does not appear, therefore, that they have any superior equities, entitling, them to the relief asked.</p> <p id=\"b339-5\" pgmap=\"339\">Moreover, the rule seems to be, that a mortgagee of an entire interest in land can not be required to make sale of it in undivided interests. 2 Jones on Mort., 1617; Frost v. Bevin, 3 Sandf. Ch. 188. Without, however, entering on this subject, or discussion of the reasons on which the rule is based, it is manifest that a court of equity, in the absence of equities arising between the purchaser of the equity of redemption and the mortgagee, before attempting an apportionment, or requiring the sale in undivided interests, would require it to be shown, that the mortgagee would not be prejudiced thereby. No evidence was offered showing, or tending to show, that the undivided four-fifths, if sold separately, would bring sufficient to satisfy the four-fifths of the indebtedness, and costs remaining after the payment of one-fifth by Johnson; or, that it would bring as much proportionately, when thus sold, as it would if the land was sold altogether. It is clear, therefore, in any view of the case, that the court decreed correctly, in sustaining the demurrer to the cross-bill of the Johnsons, and in refusing to so apportion the indebtedness upon the land, that the Johnsons could redeem a part of the premises, by paying a pro rata share of the incumbrance. And it follows, necessarily, from the same considerations, that the court decreed correctly, in not requiring the undivided interest retained by Reynolds to be first sold in satisfaction of the entire mortgage indebtedness.</p> <p id=\"b339-6\" pgmap=\"339(38) 340(52)\">YI. The insistence, that the court should have marshalled the securities and subjected the portion of the land retained by Reynolds to the payment of the mortgage debt, before applying to the undivided interest of the Johnsons therein, can not be sustained, for the reason, also, that no equities existed in favor of the latter, that the entire debt should be paid by Reynolds, or, that his interest in the land should constitute a fund for the extinguishment of the mortgage lien upon the interest held by the Johnsons.</p> <p id=\"b340-5\" pgmap=\"340\">The rule requiring the sale of land in the inverse order of alienation, and treating the portion of land retained by the mortgagor as the primary fund, out of which to satisfy the mortgage debt, rests upon the reason, that where the mortgagor sells a part of the mortgaged premises, relieved of the incumbrance, and retains a part himself, as between the mortgagor and such grantee the part held by the mortgagor, in equity and good conscience, should be first subjected to the payment of the mortgage debt. And the same principle would apply as between a purchaser of the equity of redemption, subject to the mortgage, as Reynolds here purchased, and a purchaser from him.</p> <p id=\"b340-6\" pgmap=\"340(188) 341(19)\">But, as said in Briscoe v. Powers, 47 Ill. 447, it is evident that this reasoning has no application to a case like the present, where the first purchaser, insisting upon the rule, has taken subject to the mortgage. As we have-already seen, the court was powerless to apportion the debt and require the four-fifths remaining in Reynolds to be sold for four-fifths of the debt, and there were no equities existing, as between Johnson and Reynolds, that would require the latter\u2019s interest to be sold for the whole debt, and thereby release Johnson\u2019s interest from the lien of the mortgage., The right to compel resort to the interest of the mortgagor, presupposes that the debt has remained his, and that he is primarily liable for its payment. Hence, when he has paid it, either voluntarily, or his interest in the land has been thus applied, he would be entitled to no contribution from the portion of the land he had aliened. It is- manifest, that that would not be so here, for, under the conceded facts, if the interest of Reynolds was taken to pay the entire mortgage indebtedness, he would be entitled to a pro rata contribution from the Johnsons.</p> <p id=\"b341-5\" pgmap=\"341\">Without extending the discussion, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court decreed correctly, and the judgment of the Appellate Court will, accordingly, be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b341-6\" pgmap=\"341\">Judgment affirmed. *</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
