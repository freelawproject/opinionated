Thomas argues that although the district court originally imposed a sentence well below his advisory range under the Sentencing Guidelines, the court should have further reduced his sentence following the amendment of the Guidelines relative to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); U.S.S.G. supp. to App. C, amend. 706 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237. A district court is under no obligation to reduce a \u00a7 3582 movant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010) (No. 09-8939). Further, the court is not required to provide reasons for denying a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 298 (5th. Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The district court noted that Thomas brought his \u00a7 3582 motion based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines and, thus, impliedly considered the sentencing disparity between cocaine and crack cocaine offenses. Further, the court did not disregard the arguments advanced by Thomas in support of his motion, but rather determined that they did not outweigh the leniency already afforded Thomas when he received a sentence that was substantially lower than both his original and his amended guideline imprisonment range. No abuse of discretion has been shown. Accordingly, we need not consider Thomas\u2019s argument concerning the extent of a reduction that was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
