The district court denied Hill\u2019s motion because he had breached the settlement agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">R.A.M., Ford, and Hill settled a contractual dispute in the district court. The settlement agreement required Ford to execute a promissory note payable to a trust account for Hill and required Hill to relinquish his ownership interest in R.A.M. The written agreement \u201cand the Other Agreements\u201d of the parties \u201ctogether constitute[d] the entire understanding of the parties.\u201d The written agreement provided that \u201call ... agreements made prior to, contemporaneously with, and/or concurrently with the execution and delivery of [the Settlement] Agreement are merged into this written document and are of no further force and effect.\u201d The written agreement also provided that any \u201cdocuments [that] are required or permitted to be executed in order to effectuate\u201d the settlement had to be \u201cexecute[d] ... within three business days of receipt of such request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">Ford executed a promissory note to pay Hill $45,000. After Ford paid 19 of the 36 installment payments, Ford notified Hill that he had breached the written agreement \u201cby failing to deliver the documents required to effectuate the transfer of his membership interests in R.A.M.\u201d and that breach \u201crelieve[d] ... Ford\u2019s remaining obligations under the note.\u201d One month later, Hill notified Ford that he had failed to make two installment payments and, unless he cured the default, Hill would \u201cproceed to obtain a Final Judgment\u201d for the balance of the promissory note. Ford made no further payments on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-19\">Hill moved for enforcement of the settlement agreement and a final judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>against Ford for the balance of the promissory note, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. Ford responded that Hill had breached the settlement agreement by failing to relinquish his interest in R.A.M. In reply, Hill argued that his alleged violation of the settlement agreement was \u201cirrelevant\u201d because the promissory note stated that, if Ford defaulted on the note, Hill could demand payment and obtain \u201cfinal judgment ... of the then unpaid balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The district court denied Hill\u2019s motion. The district court ruled that \u201cthe promissory note and transfer of Hill\u2019s interest in R.A.M. were integral pieces of\u2019 one transaction. The district court concluded that, because the obligations were interdependent, \u201cit would be unjust to excuse Hill\u2019s breach, while enforcing the promissory note\u2019s default provision against\u201d Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hill\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement agreement. Settlement agreements are interpreted under the law of the forum state. <em>Schwartz v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>807 F.2d 901, 905 (11th Cir. 1987). \u201cA settlement agreement is a contract,\u201d <em>id., </em>and under the law of Florida, \u201c[cjontracts are to be construed in accordance with the plain meaning of the words contained therein.\u201d <em>Ferreira v. Home Depot/Sedgwick CMS, </em>12 So.3d 866, 868 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2009). The settlement agreement provided that Ford and Hill had concomitant obligations. <em>See Murphy v. Chitty, </em>739 So.2d 697, 698 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1999). Because Hill failed to relinquish his ownership interest in R.A.M., Ford was entitled to cease paying the promissory note. <em>See Toyota Tsusho Am., Inc. v. Crittenden, </em>732 So.2d 472, 477 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1999) (\u201cWhen a nonbreaching party to a contract is confronted with a breach by the other party, the nonbreach-ing party may stop performance, treating the breach as a discharge of its contractual liability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The denial of Hill\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement agreement and obtain a final judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
