James (\u201cJames\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Fiesta Food Mart, Inc., (\u201cFiesta\u201d) on James\u2019 Title VII claims of employment discrimination. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">Fiesta, a regional grocery chain, hired James, an African-American male, as a nighttime shelf stocker at one of Fiesta\u2019s stores in Dallas, Texas, in July 2008. During James\u2019 tenure at Fiesta, the company maintained written rules and policies that described, among other things, the perks available to Fiesta\u2019s stackers and the company\u2019s standards for workplace harassment. Fiesta permitted stackers to consume certain items from the store shelves for free; other items were available for consumption at cost. Fiesta provided its employees, including James, with a list of the available free items, and Fiesta warned that disciplinary action could result if an employee consumed items not on the free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>list without paying for them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fiesta also maintained an anti-harassment policy which directed employees who felt victimized by harassment to contact certain personnel to file grievances. Fiesta defined harassment as including verbal racial slurs but made clear that employees had to report harassment complaints to the proper persons within the company. James signed a form acknowledging he received training on Fiesta\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">While employed at Fiesta, James alleges co-workers \u201ccasually\u201d used the term \u201cnig-ga,\u201d and he voiced his dislike for its use \u201cthree or four times,\u201d citing the specific dates in his complaint. James asserts that at least one of the workers using the term was his immediate supervisor and that others were various \u201clead persons,\u201d \u201cforemen,\u201d and \u201cshift leaders.\u201d Fiesta does not deny that some of these co-workers held such informal titles, but it asserts that no individual James identified as using the offensive term was either a manager or official. James asserts in his complaint that he told an \u201celderly white haired cau-casion\u201d [sic] manager, later identified in James\u2019 summary judgment evidence as Mike Mayo, about his problems with the word\u2019s use in his presence on February 15, 2009, but claims Mayo took no action. James admitted he never complained to other management officials about the treatment. On February 22, 2009, Le May terminated James after discovering that James consumed a food item that was neither paid for nor listed as a free item. James knew the item was not on the free item list but insists he would have paid for it. James\u2019 affidavit states that Hispanic coworkers were permitted to consume non-free items but were not disciplined for such consumption. When James confronted Le May during his firing about why the Hispanic employees were not punished for their consumption in the same manner, James alleges that Le May laughed and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t catch them all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Fiesta disputes James\u2019 allegations that anyone who used \u201cnigga\u201d was either a manager or an official of the company. Fiesta also sought during summary judgment to strike certain portions of James\u2019 evidence pertaining to his co-workers, alleging that James did not sufficiently identify those individuals to put Fiesta on notice of his claims. Le May stated in his declaration that he had no knowledge of harassment nor any complaints James had about the work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In April 2009, James, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed this discrimination/retaliation action under Title VII against Fiesta in the district court. After a brief period of discovery, Fiesta moved for summary judgment in October 2009. On January 14, 2010, the district court granted Fiesta\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ordered that James take nothing, and denied the motion to strike as moot. James filed a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Sanders-Burns v. City of Plano, </em>594 F.3d 366, 380 (5th Cir.2010). Movants bear the initial burden of demonstrating an absence of material fact issues. <em>Forsyth v. Barr, </em>19 F.3d 1527, 1533 (5th Cir.1994). If the movant meets that burden, however, the nonmoving party must then identify evidence in the record which creates a material fact issue for which it would bear the burden of proof at trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). \u201c[A] dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 ... if the evidence is such that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">James\u2019 complaint focuses primarily on his termination for theft, which James claims was either racially discriminatory or retaliatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst an individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), created a burden-shifting framework for Title VII discrimination claims which rely on circumstantial evidence. The factors necessary to establish a prima facie case include: (1) membership in a protected class; (2) qualification for the position at issue; (3) subjection to an adverse employment action; and (4) treatment that was less favorable than similarly situated persons outside the protected class.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Bryan v. McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc., </em>375 F.3d 358, 360 (5th Cir.2004). Once a prima facie case has been established, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a non-discriminatory reason for the discharge \u2014 the employer\u2019s burden is one of production, not persuasion. <em>Patrick v. Ridge, </em>394 F.3d 311, 317 (5th Cir.2004). The plaintiff can still prevail if he can demonstrate that the proffered reason was a pretext for the discriminatory motive, <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), or if the employer had \u201cmixed motives\u201d for the adverse action, one of which was discriminatory, <em>Smith v. Xerox Corp., </em>602 F.3d 320 (5th Cir.2010). To show pretext, a plaintiff may prove that the reason proffered by the employer for termination is unworthy of credence, or that the employer\u2019s decision was more likely motivated by discriminatory reasons. <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 257, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">James is a member of a protected class who was terminated by Fiesta, and Fiesta does not contest his qualifications for a stocker position. Fiesta contends that James has failed to produce summary judgment evidence showing more favorable treatment to co-workers. We agree. James claims that his Hispanic co-workers received preferential treatment from Fiesta because they were allowed to consume non-free items without adverse action. However, James has failed to identify with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>particularity any actual person who meets this vague description. Nor did he properly allege \u2014 much less produce evidence showing \u2014 that any relevant management officials from Fiesta knew about the alleged actions taken by James\u2019 Hispanic coworkers. Without more, James has failed to carry his initial burden in making out a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that James has made out a prima facie case, Fiesta provided a valid, non-diseriminatory reason for his firing \u2014 theft of a non-free food item. James counters that the reason for the discharge was pretextual based on his summary judgment evidence that Hispanic co-workers were not disciplined for the same infraction of corporate rules. This argument fails for the same reason: James\u2019 general statement is non-specific and does not identify the particular Hispanic co-workers he is referring to.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">James also argues that his discharge came in retaliation for his harassment complaints. Retaliation claims are also subject to the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must establish that: (1) he participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) his employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>McCoy v. City of Shreveport, </em>492 F.3d 551, 556-57 (5th Cir.2007). James alleges that his complaint to manager Mike Mayo about the use of racial slurs in the workplace was not acted upon, and that five days later he was terminated for theft even though Hispanic employees were not punished for engaging in the same activity. Thus James has shown he engaged in a protected activity through his complaint of discriminatory conduct, and he suffered an adverse employment action upon termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">For purposes of a prima facie case, the timing of the adverse decision and its proximity to protected activity can establish an inference of causal connection. <em>Gee v. Principi, </em>289 F.3d 342, 346 n. 3 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>see also Evans v. City of Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 356 (5th Cir.2001) (five day proximity can establish prima facie evidence of causal connection for retaliation claim). We assume <em>arguendo </em>that James therefore established a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge by alleging a five day gap between his complaint to Mayo and his firing by Le May. Once an employer produces evidence of a valid reason for the adverse action, however, our decision in <em>Strong v. Univ. Healthcare Sys., L.L.C., </em>482 F.3d 802, 808 (5th Cir.2007), makes clear that a plaintiff cannot rely solely on suspicious timing to carry his burden at the pretextual stage of the burden-shifting framework. In the face of evidence of a non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action, a plaintiff must show that retaliatory motives were the but-for cause of that action. <em>Id. </em>James has produced no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Le May filed a declaration unequivocally stating that he had no actual knowledge of any of James\u2019 complaints prior to his termination. This unrebutted evidence also supports Fiesta\u2019s argument that the termination was not connected with James\u2019 harassment complaints. <em>See Manning v. Chevron Chem. Co., </em>332 F.3d 874, 883 (5th Cir.2003) (holding that plaintiffs cannot establish causal link when decision-makers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>were unaware of protected activity). James simply has not made a contrary showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\">. Fiesta's policies also listed theft as grounds for immediate termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. James also appeals summary judgment on a Title VII hostile work environment claim based on the racial slurs used by his coworkers. While racially offensive terms certainly have no place in civilized society, we cannot say that his allegations regarding \"casual\" use of the term which he complained about \"three or four times\u201d arise to the level of severity or pervasiveness necessary to sustain his claim. <em>See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (requiring severe or pervasive conduct that creates objectively hostile work environment, not simple epithets that engender offensive feelings, to implicate Title VII). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AP4\">. Some cases discuss another factor which required that in discriminatory discharge cases a plaintiff have been replaced by a worker outside plaintiff\u2019s protected class. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). However, this circuit has eliminated that factor as a prerequisite for liability. <em>See Williams v. Trader Publ'g Co., </em>218 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. This vague, non-specific allegation regarding his Hispanic co-workers contrasts markedly with James' ability to identify specific coworkers who allegedly used racial slurs on specific dates in the workplace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b251-20\">. James seeks to sanction counsel for Fiesta for alleged unreasonable delay of this matter's resolution for their failure to expeditiously serve James with their appellate brief, which James claims caused his reply brief to be untimely filed. Instead of immediately seeking sanctions, James\u2019 proper remedy would have been to request an extension in order to file his reply brief. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 26.2. Accordingly, the motion for sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
