In the first appeal, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation challenged a preliminary injunction that prohibited it from enforcing noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants executed by Mohr and Sawyer during the sale of their investment management business to Mellon Corporation. We ruled that the restrictive covenants were enforceable, vacated the preliminary injunction, and remanded for the district court to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>reasonableness of the covenants. <em>Mohr v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Corp., </em>371 Fed.Appx. 10, 15-17 (11th Cir.2010). On remand, the district court preliminarily enjoined Mohr and Sawyer from soliciting the employees of Mellon Corporation, but refused to enjoin preliminarily Mohr and Sawyer from competing against Mellon Corporation or soliciting its customers. Because Mellon Corporation is entitled to a preliminary injunction that enforces the covenants not to compete and not to solicit, we reverse and remand with instructions to enter a preliminary injunction against Mohr and Sawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We included in our first opinion excerpts of restrictive covenants executed by Mohr and Sawyer that were relevant to determining the level of scrutiny to apply to those covenants. <em>Id., </em>at 11-14. In this opinion, we include excerpts of the non-competition and nonsolicitation covenants that are material to our inquiry about whether those covenants are reasonable. We repeat only those facts necessary to resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In the Purchase Agreement and employment agreements, Mohr and Sawyer covenanted not to compete against the Mellon Corporation. Section 5.10 of the Purchase Agreement provided that Mohr and Sawyer would not compete against Mellon Corporation within 50 miles of any city listed on an attached schedule for twelve months after termination or resignation. <em>Id., </em>at 11-13. The schedule listed 27 cities in Georgia and South Carolina and 16 cities in 12 other states. In the event Mellon Corporation ended its business activities in a particular city, the covenant stated that city would be eliminated from the schedule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">(c) [Mohr and Sawyer] hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event [Mellon Corporation] (or any Successor) ceases to carry on the business of the Company or a like or similar business to that of the Company in a portion of the Restricted Territory, this Section 5.10 shall be deemed to expire only with respect to that portion of the Restricted Territory and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the remainder of the Restricted Territory....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">The noncompetition covenant stated that its time, scope, and geographic area was reasonable and integral to the contemporaneous sale and employment transactions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A76\">(c) The parties acknowledge that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of this Section 5.10 have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and agree that (i) all such provisions are reasonable under the circumstances of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) are given as an integral and essential part of the transactions contemplated and (iii) but for the agreement of [Mohr and Sawyer] in this Section 5.10, [Mellon Corporation] would not have entered into or consummated the transactions contemplated hereby. [Mohr and Sawyer] have independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects concerning the reasonableness and propriety of the covenants contained herein, with specific regard to the business to be conducted by the Company and its Affiliates, and represent that this Section 5.10 is intended to be and shall be fully enforceable and effective in accordance with its terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">The employment agreements' cross-referenced the noncompetition covenant in the Purchase Agreement and stated that the restrictive covenant was part of the consideration for the purchase of The Arden Group and employment of Mohr and Sawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>3.10 <em>Noncompetition. </em>Employee agrees to be bound by the noncompetition provisions set forth in Section 5.10 of the Purchase Agreement. Employee acknowledges that the time, scope, geographic area and other provisions of Section 5.10 of the Purchase Agreement have been specifically negotiated by the parties and agrees that (a) all such provisions are reasonable under the circumstances of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, (b) are given as an integral and essential part of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and (c) but for the agreement of Employee in Section 5.10 of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser would not have agreed to the acquisition of the assets of the Seller and the [Mellon Corporation] would not have entered into this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The employment agreements also contained a covenant not to solicit the customers of Mellon Corporation. The restrictive covenant prohibited Mohr and Sawyer from soliciting either the customers of The Arden Group and Mellon Corporation or prospective customers that Mohr and Sawyer had contacted on behalf of Mellon Corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">3.05 <em>Solicitation of Clients. </em>Employee recognizes and acknowledges that it is essential for the proper protection of Confidential Information that Employee be restrained from soliciting business of or doing business with Customers (as defined below) for any business purpose, other than Mellon\u2019s own business purpose. During the Restricted Period, Employee shall not, in any capacity, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit the Asset Management Services (as defined below) business of any Customer for any other person or entity, (ii) divert, entice, or otherwise take away from the Company the Asset Management Services business or patronage of any Customer, or attempt to do so, or (iii) solicit or induce any Customer to terminate or reduce its business relationship with the Company with respect to Asset Management Services. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cAsset <em>Management Services </em>\u201d shall mean providing investment advisory or investment management services, or any Fiduciary Services (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement), to individual or institutional customers. For purposes of this Agreement, <em>\u201cCustomer\u201d </em>shall mean any person or entity (a) who (1) received Asset Management Services from the Seller at any time during the two (2) year period immediately preceding the Effective Date and (2) received Asset Management Services from the Seller, the Company or an affiliate of the Company at any time during the two (2) year period immediately preceding the date of termination of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company, or (b) who Employee contacted, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, on behalf of Company to provide Asset Management Services within the two (2) year period immediately preceding the date of termination of Employee\u2019s employment with the Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">After Mohr and Sawyer worked in the Atlanta, Georgia, office of the Mellon Corporation for about six years, they resigned and accepted employment in the Atlanta office of a competitor, Wilmington Trust Company. <em>Mohr, </em>371 Fed.Appx. at 13-14. Two days after their resignation, Mohr and Sawyer filed a complaint that requested a declaratory judgment that the restrictive covenants were \u201cinvalid and unenforceable ... under Georgia law\u201d and an injunction to prevent Mellon Corporation from enforcing the covenants. <em>Id., </em>at 13-14. Mellon Corporation counterclaimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and requested both a declaratory judgment that the restrictive covenants were enforceable and a temporary restraining order to prevent Mohr and Sawyer from violating the covenants. <em>Id., </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The district court enjoined Mellon Corporation from enforcing the restrictive covenants, but this Court vacated the preliminary injunction. <em>Id., </em>at 17. We held that the restrictive covenants were executed ancillary to the sale of Mohr and Sawyer\u2019s business, and we remanded for the district court to examine the reasonableness of the covenants. <em>Id., </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On remand, Mellon Corporation again moved for a preliminary injunction. Mellon Corporation argued that Mohr and Sawyer had breached both the noncompet-ition and nonsolicitation covenants. Mellon Corporation submitted evidence that Mohr and Sawyer had breached the covenants in three ways: Mohr and Sawyer had contacted indirectly some of their former customers; Sawyer had solicited two employees of Mellon Corporation; and some customers of Mohr and Sawyer had moved their business to Wilmington Trust. Mohr and Sawyer responded that the restrictive covenants were overbroad and were not \u201cenforceable with or without blue penciling.\u201d Mohr and Sawyer also argued that Mellon Corporation could not prove that the restrictive covenants had been breached or that it had suffered irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court preliminarily enjoined Mohr and Sawyer from soliciting employees of Mellon Corporation, but the district court refused preliminarily to enjoin Mohr and Sawyer from competing against or soliciting customers of Mellon Corporation. The district court stated that Mellon Corporation was unlikely to prevail on the merits because \u201cit [was] not clear ... what\u201d the company was \u201cpurchasing when [it] bought the assets of The Arden Group and attained a no-compete, no-solicitation agreement\u201d; the court was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that Mellon Corporation \u201cha[d] suffered or [would] suffer irreparable injury\u201d; and Mellon Corporation had not \u201cshown that the balance of the harms favor[ed] issuing a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">\u201cThe ultimate decision to grant or deny a prehminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion, but the determinations of law the district court makes in reaching that decision are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Bailey v. Gulf Coast Transp., Inc., </em>280 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2002). We review related findings of fact for clear error. <em>Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 1167, 1171 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">We remanded this case for the district court to review the restrictive covenants for reasonableness, but it failed to do so. That inquiry turns on whether \u201cthe restricted activity protected] the ... legitimate business interests\u201d of Mellon Corporation. <em>Mohr, </em>371 Fed.Appx. at 17 (quoting <em>Drumheller v. Drumheller Bag &amp; Supply, </em>204 Ga.App. 623, 420 S.E.2d 331, 335 (1992)). Under Georgia law, restrictive covenants are judged \u201c \u2018in terms of [their] limitations on time and territory and ... description of the prohibited activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hicks v. Doors By Mike, Inc., </em>260 Ga.App. 407, 579 S.E.2d 833, 836 (2003) (quoting <em>Carroll v. Ralston &amp; Assocs., P.C., </em>224 Ga.App. 862, 481 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1997)); <em>Drumheller, </em>420 S.E.2d at 335. Reasonableness is context-specific: restrictive covenants \u201care considered in light of the specific factual situation and the nature of the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the covenant.\u201d <em>Annis v. Tomberlin &amp; Shelnutt Assocs., Inc., </em>195 Ga.App. 27, 392 S.E.2d 717, 721 (1990). Because Mohr and Sawyer executed the noncom-petition and nonsolicitation covenants \u201cancillary to the sale of [their] business,\u201d the covenants are \u201csubject to much less scrutiny.\u201d <em>Am. Control Sys., Inc. v. Boyce, </em>303 Ga.App. 664, 694 S.E.2d 141, 145 &amp; n. 17 (2010) (citing <em>Dalrymple v. Hagood, </em>246 Ga. 235, 271 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1980), and <em>Ins. Ctr., Inc. v. Hamilton, </em>218 Ga. 597, 129 S.E.2d 801, 804-05 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Mellon Corporation argues that the district court erred when it refused to enjoin Mohr and Sawyer from competing against or soliciting the customers of Mellon Corporation. Mellon Corporation argues that the noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants survive the low level of scrutiny applied to covenants executed ancillary to the sale of a business and that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction. We address each covenant in turn and then address whether Mellon Corporation is entitled to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">\n<em>A. The Covenant Not to Compete is Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Because the noncompetition covenant was the product of an arms\u2019 length negotiation between Mellon Corporation and Mohr and Sawyer, the covenant is entitled to \u201csubstantial protection and latitude.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>579 S.E.2d at 835 (quoting <em>Attaway v. Republic Servs. of Ga., LLP, </em>253 Ga.App. 322, 558 S.E.2d 846, 848 (2002)). A restrictive covenant in the sale of a business may be drafted broadly. <em>Annis, </em>392 S.E.2d at 721. Mohr and Sawyer argue that the scope of the noncompetition covenant, which prohibits them from \u201cengaging] ... in any capacity\u201d in another business that has \u201cactivities, products or services ... similar to providing investment advisory or investment management services,\u201d is overbroad, but the two businessmen \u201cspecifically negotiated\u201d the terms of the covenant and agreed it was \u201creasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>See Am. Control Sys., </em>694 S.E.2d at 143 n. 3, 145 (finding reasonable a covenant not to \u201cdirectly, or indirectly ... be connected with or concerned in any business enterprise or employment which shall be in competition with the business of\u2019 the purchaser). The limitation on Mohr and Sawyer is permissible under the \u201cmuch lesser scrutiny afforded sale of business contracts.\u201d <em>Habif Arogeti &amp; Wynne, P.C. v. Baggett, </em>231 Ga.App. 289, 498 S.E.2d 346, 353 (1998) (citing <em>Dalrymple, </em>246 Ga. 235, 271 S.E.2d 149).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The district court ruled that the territorial restriction in the noncompetition covenant was too vague to enforce, but we disagree. Mohr and Sawyer agreed not to compete with Mellon Corporation within a 50-mile radius of specific cities, and Georgia courts have upheld similar territorial restrictions. <em>See Annis, </em>392 S.E.2d at 721-22 (50-mile radius \u201cfrom the Company\u2019s principal place of business in Augusta, Georgia\u201d); <em>Hicks, </em>579 S.E.2d at 835-36 (50-mile radius of Conyers, Georgia); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Settlement Assocs. of Ga., Inc. v. Creel, </em>256 Ga. 329, 349 S.E.2d 177, 179-80 (1986) (upholding under strict scrutiny a covenant not to compete within a 200-mile radius of Atlanta, Georgia). Georgia law \u201c \u2018does not require exact precision; it forbids unreasonably broad territorial coverage,\u2019 \u201d <em>Reardigan v. Shaw Indus., Inc., </em>238 Ga.App. 142, 518 S.E.2d 144, 147 (1999) (quoting <em>Sysco Food Svcs. of Atlanta, Inc. v. Chupp, </em>225 Ga.App. 584, 484 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1997)), and Mohr and Sawyer can determine where they may compete against Mellon Corporation. Although the district court stated that it was \u201cpretty silly\u201d to \u201cdefine the geographic scope of the non-compete agreement\u201d based on business interests of Mellon Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>poration in 2003, territorial restrictions defined at the time of a sale give sellers fair notice and the \u201cability to determine with certainty the prohibited territory\u201d while allowing purchasers to prevent the \u201cpossible unfair appropriation of contacts\u201d and \u201ccustomer relationships\u201d that they pay to acquire, <em>Habif, </em>498 S.E.2d at 351. Mohr and Sawyer argue that the substantial growth of Mellon Corporation eliminates the need for the territorial restrictions, but prosperity provides all the more reason to protect clientele.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Although Mohr and Sawyer may not have contacts in all the cities listed in the schedule, the reasonableness of territorial restrictions in the sale of a business is determined by \u201cthe territory served by the <em>employer, </em>not by the <em>employee.\u201d Id. </em>at 352; <em>see Chaichimansour v. Pets Are People Too, </em>226 Ga.App. 69, 485 S.E.2d 248, 249 (1997) (a covenant not to compete can \u201cpreclude[] competition with respect to clients with whom the employee had not had contact while working for the employer\u201d). The Arden Group and Mellon Corporation had business interests in the named cities, and Mohr and Sawyer agreed expressly that the \u201cgeographic area\u201d was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201can integral and essential part of\u2019 the sale of their business and their employment with Mellon Corporation. <em>See Rash v. Toccoa Clinic Med. Assocs., </em>253 Ga. 322, 320 S.E.2d 170, 174 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">If the schedule of cities is stale, the noncompetition covenant provides a remedy. The covenant states that if Mellon Corporation ends its business in a particular city, that city is \u201cdeemed to expire.\u201d The district court need only \u201cblue pencil\u201d any cities in which Mellon Corporation no longer does business. <em>See New Atlanta Ear, Nose &amp; Throat </em>Assocs., <em>P.C. v. Pratt, </em>253 Ga.App. 681, 560 S.E.2d 268, 273 (2002) (a court may \u201cblue pencil\u201d to \u201climit an area, thus making it reasonable\u201d). That the list may be reduced does not invalidate the covenant; \u201cindeed, the narrowing aspect of the covenant only work[s] to the .\u25a0.. advantage [of Mohr and Sawyer], as the maximum number of locations covered by the covenant [is] set and immovable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\n<em>B. The Covenant Not To Solicit Clients is Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Mohr and Sawyer argue that the nonsolicitation covenant is overbroad because it lacks a territorial restriction and because they were prohibited from soliciting all customers of Mellon Corporation, but these arguments fail. The restrictive covenant was tailored.to prevent Mohr and Sawyer from pirating customers they had sold to, obtained for, or contacted on behalf of Mellon Corporation. Mellon Corporation purchased \u201cthe Customers of [The Arden Group]\u201d and the \u201cgoodwill associated with [The Arden Group] and [its] future prospects,\u201d <em>Mohr, </em>371 Fed.Appx. at 11, and the nonsolieitation covenant protects those interests. <em>See Hicks, </em>579 S.E.2d at 836 (nonsolicitation covenant was \u201creasonable and essential to protect the value of the business ... purchased as well as the good will of its customer base\u201d); <em>Carroll, </em>481 S.E.2d at 902 (affirming decision to enjoin accountant from soliciting customers he had sold to purchaser). Because Mohr and Sawyer agreed they would not solicit their former and prospective customers, \u201c \u2018there is no need for a territorial restriction expressed in geographic terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Palmer &amp; Cay of Ga., Inc. v. Lockton Cos., </em>280 Ga. 479, 629 S.E.2d 800, 804 (2006) (quoting <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Mouyal, </em>262 Ga. 464, 422 S.E.2d 529, 533 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">\n<em>C. Mellon Corporation Is Entitled To a Preliminary Injunction to Enforce the Restrictive Covenants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">To obtain a preliminary injunction, Mellon Corporation had to satisfy a four-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>part test. Mellon Corporation had to establish a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success on the merits,\u201d it would suffer an \u201cirreparable injury ... unless the injunction issues,\u201d its injury outweighs any damage to Mohr and Sawyer, and the injunction would \u201cnot be adverse to the public interest.\u201d <em>Ferrero v. Associated Materials Inc., </em>923 F.2d 1441, 1448 (11th Cir.1991). Mellon Corporation satisfied its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The district court ruled that Mellon Corporation could not prevail on the merits because the restrictive covenants are vague and overbroad, but the covenants are reasonable. The covenants protect the \u201clegitimate business interests\u201d of Mellon Corporation. <em>Drumheller, </em>420 S.E.2d at 335. Mellon Corporation established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The district court also ruled that Mellon Corporation would not suffer irreparable harm without an injunction and the balance of harms favored Mohr and Sawyer, but we disagree. The record establishes that Mellon Corporation paid handsomely to acquire the goodwill and wealthy clientele that Mohr and Sawyer had cultivated for The Arden Group. Mellon Corporation employed Mohr and Sawyer to retain that customer base. Mellon Corporation was deprived of the benefit of its bargain when Sawyer and Mohr left and enticed former customers to transfer their business to Wilmington Trust. <em>See Ins. Ctr., </em>129 S.E.2d at 805 (\u2018Where the goodwill [of a business] is sold and [the seller] is permitted to solicit and take the business, the goodwill is destroyed.\u201d). \u201cAlthough economic losses alone do not justify a preliminary injunction, \u2018the loss of customers and goodwill is an irreparable injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell-South Telecomms., Inc. v. MCIMetro Access Transmission Servs., LLC, </em>425 F.3d 964, 970 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Ferrero, </em>923 F.2d at 1449); <em>see Bijou Salon &amp; Spa, LLC v. Kensington Enters., Inc., </em>283 Ga. App. 857, 643 S.E.2d 531, 534 (2007) (in-junctive relief appropriate when sellers violate noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants); <em>Carroll, </em>481 S.E.2d at 902. Mohr and Sawyer argue that monetary losses suffered by Mellon Corporation are not sufficiently \u201cdramatic\u201d to justify in-junctive relief, but \u201cthis Court has held \u2018specious\u2019 [the] argument suggesting that, in deciding this element of the preliminary injunction calculus, the court ought to compare the actual losses sustained to the size of the company.\u201d <em>Ferrero, </em>923 F.2d at 1449.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Mohr and Sawyer do not face serious injury. Mohr and Sawyer might have to relocate their offices, but they will retain their positions with Wilmington Trust. During the brief interim in which they must abide by the restrictive covenants, Mohr and Sawyer can continue to conduct business outside the restricted territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">A preliminary injunction also serves the interests of the public. Because Mohr and Sawyer agreed that the restrictive covenants constituted \u201ca significant part of the consideration for the purchase of the business,\u2019 \u201d the covenants should be given \u201csubstantial protection and latitude.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>579 S.E.2d at 835 (quoting <em>Attaway, </em>558 S.E.2d at 848). Mohr and Sawyer argue that customers will lose their preferred money managers, but Mohr and Sawyer may advise any former customer they do not solicit to move their investment accounts to Wilmington Trust. That customers might not be aware of Mohr\u2019s and Sawyer\u2019s resignations will not trump \u201cthe law\u2019s interest in upholding and protecting freedom to contract and to enforce contractual rights and obligations,\u201d <em>Rash, </em>320 S.E.2d at 174, particularly when the two businessmen \u201cspecifically negotiated\u201d and agreed to the restrictive covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We REVERSE the denial of a preliminary injunction to prevent Mohr and Sawyer from competing against or soliciting the customers of Mellon Corporation, and we REMAND with instructions for the district court to enter a preliminary injunction that Mohr and Sawyer not compete against or solicit the customers of Mellon Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
