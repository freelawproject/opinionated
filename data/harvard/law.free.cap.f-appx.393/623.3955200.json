The district court found that Florida\u2019s long-arm statute precluded the exercise of personal jurisdiction over VEL. After careful review, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">L Background</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">This dispute between VHC and VEL is one of several that have played out in different forums concerning the parties\u2019 respective rights to use the term \u201cVirgin Health\u201d and its cognates in various marketing contexts. VHC, a Florida corporation, has provided home health care services in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties since at least November 2005. VEL, an English corporation, is part of the Virgin conglomerate based in London. VEL\u2019s sole function is licensing the use of the Virgin name to hundreds of subsidiaries that reveal the breadth of the conglomerate\u2019s interests: entertainment, aviation, tourism, cellular phones, and \u2014 most relevant to this case \u2014 health-related enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">In February 2005, VEL filed applications with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office to register its interest in the service mark \u201cVIRGIN\u201d for a number of business enterprises, among them health insurance and medical evaluation services. In late 2007, VEL sent VHC a letter asking it to cease using the name Virgin Health Corp., and to cease using the Internet domain name virginhealth.net, in connection with health care services. VEL noted that its licensee Virgin HealthMiles, Inc. was operating its own website, virginlifecare.com. VEL asked VHC to transfer the domain name virginhealth.net to VEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The conflict moved into the federal courts. In January 2008, VEL sued VHC and other defendants in New York, alleging trademark infringement and cybers-quatting. VEL subsequently dismissed those claims against VHC. In September 2008, VHC filed the instant declaratory judgment action against VEL in the Southern District of Florida. The action sought relief in the form of three declarations: (1) VHC had not infringed VEL\u2019s trademarks in violation of Florida.common law and the Lanham Act; (2) VHC had not cyber-squatted in violation of the Lanham Act; and (3) VHC had not violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. VHC also filed oppositions to VEL\u2019s pending applications with the federal trademark office, but it later moved for a stay in the trademark proceedings in order to prosecute its declaratory judgment claims in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">VHC served VEL in London. VEL moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On February 11, 2009, the district court entered an order dismissing VHC\u2019s case for lack of personal jurisdiction over VEL.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>United Techs. Corp. v. Mazer, </em>556 F.3d 1260, 1274 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). The plaintiff bears the initial burden of alleging sufficient jurisdictional facts to make a prima facie case; if the defendant rebuts with contrary affidavit evidence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>plaintiff reassumes the burden. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The plaintiff establishes a prima facie case if it \u201cpresents enough evidence to withstand a motion for directed verdict.\u201d <em>Consol. Dev. Corp. v. Sherritt, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). A federal court typically applies a two-step test when analyzing personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant: whether the exercise of jurisdiction (1) comports with the long-arm statute of the forum state; and (2) does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(l)(A); <em>Mazer, </em>556 F.3d at 1274 (citation omitted). The reach of the Florida long-arm statute is a question of Florida law; therefore, we must construe it as we believe the Florida Supreme Court would. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In the absence of authority from the Florida Supreme Court, we look to the Florida district courts of appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1274-75 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">On appeal, VHC alleges that VEL is subject both to specific and general jurisdiction in Florida. VHC further asserts that VEL\u2019s licensees are its agents capable of subjecting VEL to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. Upon reviewing the first prong of the personal jurisdiction inquiry, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that VHC failed to meet the requirements of Florida\u2019s long-arm statute. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the second prong, constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">VHC\u2019s argument for specific jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(1), Fla. Stat., which requires that VHC\u2019s claims \u201caris[e] from\u201d VEL\u2019s acts, rests on the cease-and-desist letter that VEL mailed from New York to VHC in Florida. VHC claims this letter qualifies VEL as \u201ccarrying on a business\u201d in Florida under \u00a7 48.193(l)(a), Fla. Stat. We disagree. While sending a letter into Florida could invite specific jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(l)(b) if the letter itself is tortious, <em>Wendt v. Horowitz, </em>822 So.2d 1252, 1260 (Fla.2002), the act of sending the letter, by itself, does not mean that VEL is doing business in Florida for purposes of \u00a7 48.193(l)(a). <em>Nida Corp. v. Nida, </em>118 F.Supp.2d 1223, 1228 (M.D.Fla. 2000); <em>Insight Instruments, Inc. v. A.V.I.Advanced Visual Instruments, Inc., </em>44 F.Supp.2d 1269, 1272 (M.D.Fla.1999). While a demand letter frequently precedes a lawsuit, the letter here cannot be said to have given rise to VHC\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">As for general jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(2), Fla. Stat., VHC has not refuted VEL\u2019s proffer that VEL has no office, employees, real property, bank account, mailing address, or telephone number in Florida; and that it has not engaged in business or made any contracts in Florida. Nor does general jurisdiction apply to VEL because it filed an infringement suit in the Southern District of Florida in 2006. <em>See Gibbons v. Brown, </em>716 So.2d 868, 870-71 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">VHC also contends that VEL\u2019s licensees, including Virgin HealthMiles, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Virgin Entertainment, Virgin Mobile, and Virgin Vacations, are VEL\u2019s agents capable of subjecting VEL to personal jurisdiction in Florida. VHC relies on the reference to an \u201cagent\u201d in \u00a7 48.193(1), Fla. Stat. To support a finding of agency, Florida courts require (1) acknowledgment by the principal that the agent will act for him; (2) acceptance by the agent; and (3) control by the principal over the actions of the agent. <em>Goldschmidt v. Holman, </em>571 So.2d 422, 424 n. 5 (Fla.1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">VHC fails to satisfy this standard. Although VHC notes that VEL (1) negotiates licenses with licensees; (2) monitors the use of the licenses; (3) applies for and defends service marks; and (4) polices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>against infringement of marks, none of this activity, nor the activity of the licensees as evidenced through screenshots of their online activity, demonstrates that the licensees are the agents of VEL. VHC\u2019s conclu-sory assertion that VEL has contractual veto power over the quality of its licensees\u2019 goods and services likewise fails to satisfy the test that would impute the licensees\u2019 activities to VEL for purposes of finding personal jurisdiction. Therefore, VHC has failed to show that the Florida long-arm statute permits the district court\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over VEL.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore do not reach the second question of the personal jurisdiction analysis: whether such an exercise of jurisdiction would be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">VHC has failed to show that Florida\u2019s long-arm statute permits personal jurisdiction over VEL; therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. In an order dated November 13, 2009, this panel remanded the case to the district court to determine whether its docket showed that VHC filed its notice of appeal within the thirty-day jurisdictional window of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A). On December 28, 2009, the district court entered its order correcting the docket. D.E. 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. VHC pleaded, and the district court analyzed, the question of personal jurisdiction here as implicating Florida's long-arm statute. But VHC might have argued personal jurisdiction under the so-called \"federal long-arm\u201d statute, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2). <em>Oldfield v. Pueblo De Bahia Lora, S.A., </em>558 F.3d 1210, 1218 &amp; n. 23 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). The federal long-arm statute can reach a foreign defendant that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state, as long as the plaintiff\u2019s claim arises under federal law and the exercise of personal jurisdiction would not offend Fifth Amendment due process. <em>Id. </em>at 1218-19 (citing <em>Consol. Dev. Corp. v. Sherritt, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2000)). VEL could have defeated this theory by identifying a U.S. state in which it was subject to personal jurisdiction in a state court, <em>id. </em>at 1218 n. 22, or by showing that its aggregated contacts with the United States as a whole were insufficient, <em>United States v. </em>Swiss <em>Am. Bank, Ltd., </em>191 F.3d 30, 41 (1st Cir.1999). Since the plaintiff bears the burden of pleading jurisdiction, we will not substitute our own theory for its. Moreover, our general rule is not to review a theory that was not raised in the district court. <em>Wright v. Hanna Steel Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-23\">.
