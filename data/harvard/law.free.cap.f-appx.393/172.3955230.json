As a special condition of supervised release, the district court, in its written judgment, ordered Turpin to participate in mental health and anger management programs \u201cas deemed necessary and approved by the probation officer.\u201d When imposing sentence orally, the district court merely stated that Turpin would be subject to conditions of supervision including \u201canger management\u201d and \u201cmental health,\u201d and said nothing about the probation officer\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">Turpin contends on appeal that the district court impermissibly delegated its judicial authority and committed plain error by requiring participation in the mental health and anger management programs \u201cas deemed necessary and approved by the probation officer.\u201d There is currently a circuit split on this issue. The Third, Fourth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that imposing a sentence, including conditions of probation, is a strictly judicial function that may not be delegated. <em>United States v. Pruden, </em>398 F.3d 241, 251 (3d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>48 F.3d 806, 808 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he imposition of a sentence, including any terms for probation or supervised release, is a core judicial function\u201d); <em>United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Djelegating to the probation office the authority to decide whether a defendant \u25a0will participate in a treatment program is a violation of Article III.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">However, the Eight and Ninth Circuits have held that, as long as a judicial officer retains ultimate authority and responsibility for approving conditions of probation, limited authority regarding the details of supervised release may be delegated to probation officers. <em>United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050, 1057 (8th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>175 Fed.Appx. 834, 838 (9th Cir.2006) (unpublished) (finding that delegating limited authority to probation officer to recommend whether or not defendant should have unsupervised visits was permissible, because \u201cif the probation officer arbitrarily or unfairly denies [defendant] a favorable recommendation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>[defendant] is free to seek relief from the district court....\u201d). The Sixth Circuit has held that, although \u201cfixing the terms and conditions of probation is a judicial act which may not be delegated,\u201d delegating such things as the schedule of restitution payments is permissible. <em>Weinberger v. United States, </em>268 F.3d 346, 359-61 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Whitehead v. United States, </em>155 F.2d 460, 462 (6th Cir.1946)). The Fifth Circuit has not yet decided whether it is permissible for a court to delegate to a probation officer the determination of whether mental health treatment will be required as part of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">However, we need not reach the delegation issue in Turpin\u2019s appeal, because Turpin also argues that the case should be remanded for clarification. Turpin contends that the district court\u2019s intent as to the probation officer\u2019s role is unclear, and we agree. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Muxtay, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 964, 965-66 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (vacating and remanding for resentencing when the written judgment and oral sentencing conflicted). As in <em>Lopez-Muxtay, </em>the written judgment is unclear regarding \u201cwhether the district court intended to grant [the appellant's probation officer the authority not only to implement the condition but to determine whether [the appellant] should or should not undergo mental health treatment while on supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965. Accordingly, this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
