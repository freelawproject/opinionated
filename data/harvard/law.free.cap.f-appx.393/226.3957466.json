The district court denied Whitehead\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the ground that Whitehead failed to assert that he was prejudiced by any of his counsel\u2019s behavior. We granted Whitehead a certificate of appealability as to whether the district court prematurely denied Whitehead\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without allowing him the opportunity to state his claims more precisely than he did on the \u00a7 2255 form he filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, this court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Cavitt, </em>550 F.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThere is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 404 (5th Cir. 2008) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a movant must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A movant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be stated with specificity; conclusory allegations are insufficient to raise a constitutional issue. <em>Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). A movant\u2019s claim will fail if he does not establish both deficient performance and prejudice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Whitehead alleged in his \u00a7 2255 motion that his counsel was ineffective before trial for failing to interview and subpoena potential defense witnesses Hugh Masters and George Whitehead; failing to call potential alibi witness Lisa Wright; failing to hire a DNA expert to conduct independent analysis to impeach the Government\u2019s DNA expert testimony; and failing to obtain the suppression of Whitehead\u2019s statement to police about the gloves and ski mask; and because counsel had an unspecified conflict of interest. He argued that counsel was ineffective at trial for failing to request a hearing to investigate the conduct of a juror who communicated with a Government witness; failing to impeach Edward Crain, an unindicted cocon-spirator, or bring forth prior exculpatory statements made by Crain; and failing to call alibi witness Wright because counsel believed he would obtain a judgment of acquittal without her testimony. He contended that counsel was ineffective at sentencing for failing to review his prior convictions and relevant caselaw to argue for mitigation; failing to address the issue whether his prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing purposes; and failing to object to the application of the career offender guideline in light of the sentence imposed on Crain. He asserted that counsel was ineffective on appeal for failing to raise any issues arising from his second trial; failing to raise juror misconduct; and failing to raise prosecutorial misconduct because the Government false<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ly told the jury that Crain would be prosecuted by federal \u25a0 authorities despite knowing that charges against Crain would be dismissed. Although Whitehead failed to allege prejudice with any specificity, he did allege that <em>Strickland </em>governed his claim. Six days after Whitehead filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court summarily dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Habeas applications filed by pro se prisoners are entitled to liberal construction, and pleading errors do not bar consideration of the claims of pro se habeas applicants. <em>Guidroz v. Lynaugh, </em>852 F.2d 832, 834 (5th Cir.1988); <em>see also Haines v. Ker-ner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Furthermore, <em>\u201cStrickland </em>requires that prejudice be proved, not pleaded.\u201d <em>Petty v. McCotter, </em>779 F.2d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>181 F.3d 627, 628-29 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that the defendant\u2019s conclusory assertion that he told his counsel he wanted to testify, but that counsel failed to call him as witness was insufficient to require a hearing or a response from government, but the defendant should have been allowed an opportunity to state his claim with greater specificity). We VACATE and REMAND so that Whitehead can state with greater specificity his complaints regarding ineffective assistance. If he is unable to provide more than his present conclusory statements, summary dismissal of his petition will be appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
