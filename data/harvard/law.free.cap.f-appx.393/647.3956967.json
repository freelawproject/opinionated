The district court, however, failed to address Middleton\u2019s assertion that he did not receive his case file from his attorney until January 2001. In light of that omission, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further consideration. We do so without implying any view on how the tolling issue should be decided on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
