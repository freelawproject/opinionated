Johnson was provided with the trailer for temporary emergency housing following Hurricane Katrina.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">\u201cA preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should only issue if the movant shows: (1) a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted; (3) the threatened injury outweighs any harm that will result to the non-movant if the injunction is granted;, and (4) the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\u201d <em>Ridgely v. FEMA, </em>512 F.3d 727, 734 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cThe [district court\u2019s] ultimate decision to grant a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">Even liberally construing Johnson\u2019s pleadings, the district court found that he had not made the requisite showing for injunctive relief, determining that Johnson had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. We find no error and, accordingly, no abuse of discretion in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">Johnson has not shown any likelihood of success on the merits; FEMA\u2019s decision to provide housing assistance is discretionary. See <em>Ridgely, </em>512 F.3d at 736 (\u201c[A]lthough [the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121] and the regulations set out eligibility criteria for the receipt of continued rent assistance, they contain no \u2018explicitly mandatory language\u2019 that entitles an individual to receive benefits if he satisfies that criteria.\u201d). As in <em>Ridgely,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-18\">Plaintiffs argue that FEMA must pro-vid[e] assistance on a continuing basis for as long as disaster-related needs exist. But this argument reads too much into what is essentially a hortatory statement of purpose for the entire Stafford Act. [The relevant provision] contains no mandatory language compelling FEMA to provide continuing payments of rental assistance to all eligible appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>cants on an ongoing basis.... [T]his provision cannot support a statutory entitlement to a stream of continued rent assistance payments when the specific statute and regulations that implement the rental assistance program contain no such directive and leave the questions of what type of assistance to provide and how and when to provide it to FEMA\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 739; <em>accord St. Tammany Parish ex rel. Davis v. FEMA, </em>556 F.3d 307, 324-25 (5th Cir.2009) (determining that language in the Stafford Act that \u201cFederal agencies <em>may ... </em>provide assistance .... \u201d was \u201ccast in discretionary terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We need not reach the other conjunctive elements necessary for preliminary injunc-tive relief because Johnson has shown no likelihood of success on the merits. <em>See La Union Del Pueblo Entero v. FEMA, </em>608 F.3d 217, 220 (5th Cir.2010) (reversing grant of preliminary injunction, without considering all elements, because movant failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits). We will not consider Johnson\u2019s other arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006) (per cu-riam). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s requests for preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
