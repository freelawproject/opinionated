He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence, claiming it was improperly obtained pursuant to a wiretap. His argument is threefold: The affidavit submitted in support of the wiretap application did not establish probable cause; the affidavit failed to make the required showing of necessity; and the government failed to minimize the interception of non-relevant communications as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">With respect to probable cause, Johnson contends that information from a confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d) was unreliable. Specifically, he maintains that the OS\u2019s statements that Johnson was a crack distributor and that he and others had picked up five kilograms of cocaine, converted it to crack, and distributed it were based only on the OS\u2019s knowledge from \u201cthe street.\u201d Johnson also argues that there was insufficient information regarding the OS\u2019s reliability and veracity and that information from certain law enforcement officers regarding Johnson\u2019s role and the roles of other targets as drug distributors was similarly unsupported and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">In deciding whether there is probable cause, a court must look to the totality of the circumstances, keeping in mind that deficiencies in some parts of a source\u2019s information may be compensated for by corroborating information or other indicia of reliability. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 232-33, 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). There were numerous facts that corroborated or otherwise indicated the reliability of the challenged statements. These include two sales of crack by Johnson to the CS for a total of $5,200; the OS\u2019s history of providing reliable information; interviews with various sources of information, including a person who \u201ccooked\u201d crack cocaine and offered information about Johnson\u2019s activities; and multiple sources of information regarding the roles of Johnson and the other targets in crack distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">We reject Johnson\u2019s assertion that the CS was not reliable because he was unnamed and should thus be viewed skeptically. Johnson relies on the law relating to anonymous tipsters or their equivalent, but this CS does not fall into that category. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>486 F.3d 855, 862 (5th Cir.2007). Also, there are no deficiencies in the affidavit regarding the CS\u2019s past reliability and veracity. <em>See United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 904-05 (5th Cir.1992). In sum, in light of the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit sets forth facts sufficient to find probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">We next turn to Johnson\u2019s necessity argument. Before a wiretap may be authorized, the government must show, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and the court must find, that \u201cother investigative procedures have been tried and failed\u201d or that \u201cthey reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c), (3)(c). Contrary to Johnson\u2019s assertions, the affidavit gave specific reasons why physical surveillance, trash pulls, and the use of cameras would risk compromising the investigation because of the geographic layout of the area and would be unlikely to provide information about the scope of the operation or Johnson\u2019s supplier. Similarly, using the CS to make more purchases would pose dangers and would not likely produce information about other members of the operation or Johnson\u2019s source.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The government is not required to show that it has exhausted every conceivable option before a wiretap can be approved. <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>140 F.3d 596, 605 (5th Cir.1998). We have sustained wiretap orders under similar circumstances. <em>United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1425 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>734 F.2d 1048, 1054-55 (5th Cir.1984). There is no reason not to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Finally, the district court rejected Johnson\u2019s conclusional arguments that the government failed to minimize the monitoring of conversations that were not subject to interception. We agree. <em>See United States v. de la Fuente, </em>548 F.2d 528, 534 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
