Cohran argues that her sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Cohran pleaded guilty to defrauding her former employer, Action Commodities. Over a five or six year period, Cohran abused her position as the office manager and bookkeeper by diverting into a personal account checks payable to Action Commodities and reconciling the company accounts to conceal her fraud. An audit revealed that Cohran stole about $750,549.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">The presentence investigation report discussed Cohran\u2019s crime and stated that she suffered from a \u201cthyroid condition and high blood pressure\u201d and had \u201creported] a history of gambling.\u201d With a total offense level of 20 and a criminal history of I, the report provided an advisory guideline range of 33 to 41 months of imprisonment. Cohran faced a maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">The district court varied upward from the advisory guideline range and sentenced Cohran to 85 months of imprisonment. The district court \u201cconcluded that the guideline range [was] not adequate to address the gravity of [Cohran\u2019s] criminal conduct and the impact that [her] conduct ... had on the lives of the victim and the community.\u201d The district court stated that Cohran committed an \u201cextraordi-nar[il]y serious offense\u201d by stealing \u201can enormous amount of money\u201d and \u201cdestroy[ing] [the victims] financially.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">Cohran\u2019s sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court considered the sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and explained that an upward variance was necessary to \u201creflect the seriousness of [Cohran\u2019s] offense, ... promote respect for the law, ... provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>just punishment for [her] offense, ... afford adequate deterrence of criminal conduct,\u201d and \u201cprotect the public from further crimes.\u201d <em>See United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008). Coh-ran argues that the district court failed to consider her acceptance of responsibility, physical conditions, and addiction to gambling, but this information was included in the presentence report that the district court \u201cconsidered\u201d before imposing Coh-ran\u2019s sentence. We will not disturb a sentence unless \u201c \u2018we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)). Cohran stole more than three quarters of a million dollars from Action Commodities and caused its owners significant financial hardship. Cohran\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We AFFIRM Cohran\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
