On appeal, construing his brief liberally, Brutus argues that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to comply with court orders. He also reiterates the substantive arguments in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">While we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), this obligation \u201cis not the equivalent of a duty to re-write [a complaint] for [the plaintiff],\u201d <em>Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted). In addition, we may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>Trotter v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>535 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 767, 172 L.Ed.2d 758 (2008). \u201cBefore we consider the merits of [an] appeal, we must address [the] threshold issue of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Cintas Corp., </em>425 F.3d 1313, 1316 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">We review a dismissal under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cDiscretion means the district court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Rule 41(b) provides that, \u201c[i]f the plaintiff fails ... to comply with ... a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b). In interpreting this provision, we have held that the district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a case under Rule 41(b). <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2005). <em>Sua sponte </em>dismissal is appropriate \u201cto prevent undue delays in the disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of pending cases and to avoid congestion in the calendars of the District Court.\u201d <em>Equity Lifestyle Props., Inc. v. Fla. Mowing &amp; Landscape Serv., Inc., </em>556 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">In order to justify dismissal with prejudice as a sanction under Rule 41(b), \u201c[tjhere must be both a clear record of willful conduct and a finding that lesser sanctions are inadequate.\u201d <em>Zocaras, </em>465 F.3d at 483. This is true because dismissal with prejudice is \u201ca sanction of last resort, applicable only in extreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Even so, a dismissal under Rule 41(b) \u201cupon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989). Moreover, we <em>normally apply </em>\u201ca less stringent standard of review to a ... dismissal of a suit without prejudice, because the plaintiff would be able to file his suit again.\u201d <em>Boazman v. Econ. Lab., Inc., </em>537 F.2d 210, 212-13 (5th Cir.1976). When a dismissal is without prejudice under Rule 41(b) and the plaintiff elects not to amend, we treat the order as an adjudication on the merits. <em>Robinson v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortgage Ass\u2019n, </em>673 F.2d 1247, 1249 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Assuming <em>argmndo </em>that Brutus has preserved his challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling, any claim that the court abused its discretion by dismissing his federal claims under Rule 41(b) lacks merit. By filing the instant complaint without permission, Brutus violated an order and a permanent injunction \u2014 which he has not challenged \u2014 that the court previously entered in light of his history of filing numerous incomprehensible lawsuits, and which required him to obtain leave before filing any lawsuit and to accompany any submission with a motion for leave to file. Because the court reminded him of these restrictions on multiple prior occasions, and because the dismissal without prejudice allowed him to seek permission to refile, the court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the federal claims in the instant complaint for failure to comply with court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
