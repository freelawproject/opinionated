On appeal, Hussain argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen based on changed country conditions in Pakistan since 2006. Conceding that' his motion to reopen was untimely, .Hussain nonetheless asserts that the country conditions in Pakistan have changed since 2006, in that he will likely be persecuted as a Shia Muslim. Hussain argues that his fears are compounded by the fact that he has lived in the United States most of his life, and Travel Warnings indicate an increased possibility of violence against Westerners.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">We review the BIA\u2019s dismissal of an appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Judicial review for an abuse of discretion is \u201climited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">A party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). A motion to reopen generally must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). However, an exception applies if the motion (1) seeks to reopen the proceedings for the petitioner to apply for asylum or withholding of removal, and (2) is based on \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality ..., if such evidence is material and was not available ... at the previous proceeding.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4). The movant \u201ccannot circumvent the requirement of changed coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>try conditions by demonstrating only a change in ... personal circumstances.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319-20 (explaining that the birth of a child is a change in personal circumstances, while more stringent enforcement of China\u2019s family planning policy is a change in country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, an alien who attempts to show that the evidence is material bears a heavy burden and must present evidence satisfying the BIA that, if the proceedings were reopened, the new evidence likely would change the result in the case. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hussain\u2019s untimely motion to reopen because he failed to demonstrate that the country conditions in Pakistan underwent material changes since 2006 in terms of discrimination and sectarian violence against Shia Muslims and Pakistani expatriates from the United States. Notably, Hussain failed to submit evidence on Pakistan\u2019s conditions in 2006. Thus, he provided no evidence as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) to enable the BIA to make a valid comparison between conditions in Pakistan in 2006, when Hussain\u2019s motion to reopen removal proceedings would have been timely, and 2009, when he actually filed the motion. In fact, contrary to Hussain\u2019s assertion of changed conditions, the record shows that problems such as general sectarian violence and terrorist attacks on Shia Muslims were ongoing complications and, thus, predated his 2006 hearings. Hussain also cannot support his petition for rehearing by relying on the murder of his uncle in 2009, because it is unclear whether his uncle was indeed killed for being a practicing Shia Muslim, and in any event similar killings and sectarian violence against Shia Muslims existed before 2006. <em>See Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319-20 (noting that change in personal circumstances is insufficient to satisfy requirement of showing changed country conditions). Finally, the 2009 U.S. Department of State travel warning does not support Hussain\u2019s claim of change of country conditions because it was directed at American citizens in Pakistan, and Hus-sain is not an American citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Based on a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Hussain\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">DENIED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">.
