We find that it did and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The arbitration provision at issue requires the parties to arbitrate all disputes before the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). Specifically, it states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">You and we agree that any and all claims, disputes, or controversies ... <em>shall </em>be resolved by binding individual (and not class) arbitration by and under the Code of Procedure of the National Arbitration Forum.... This agreement to arbitrate all disputes <em>shall </em>apply no matter by whom or against whom the claim is filed. Rules and forms of the NAF may be obtained and all claims <em>shall </em>be filed at any NAF office, [or by contacting the NAF via the internet, phone, or mail].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">(emphasis added). At the time of the dispute, however, the NAF had ceased to handle the type of consumer claims that Ranzy had brought against Defendants. In other words, the contractually designated arbitration forum was no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The district court, Judge Miller, in a very well-reasoned decision, identified that the dispositive inquiry was whether the parties\u2019 designation of the NAF as the sole arbitration forum was an integral part of the arbitration agreement. The court found that it was because the \u201cmandatory, not permissive\u201d plain language of the arbitration provision \u201cevinces a specific intent of the parties to arbitrate before the NAF.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel arbitration <em>de novo. In re Mirant Corp., </em>613 F.3d 584, 588-89 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Defendants acknowledge that the NAF is no longer an available forum,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but they contend that, under Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 5, the district court should have appointed a substitute arbitration forum. Section 5 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">If in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, or <em>if for any other reason there shall be a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or in filling a vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case may require, </em>who shall act under the said agreement with the same force and effect as if he or they had been specifically named there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>in; and unless otherwise provided in the agreement the arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Section 5 does not, however, permit a district court to circumvent the parties\u2019 designation of an exclusive arbitration forum when the choice of that forum \u201cis an integral part of the agreement to arbitrate, rather than an ancillary logistical concern.\u201d <em>Brown v. ITT Consumer Fin. Corp., </em>211 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also In re Salomon Inc. S\u2019holders\u2019 Derivative Litig., </em>68 F.3d 554, 561 (2d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Iranian Oil Co. v. Ashland Oil, Inc., </em>817 F.2d 326, 333-34 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 943, 108 S.Ct. 329, 98 L.Ed.2d 356 (1987)). In order to determine whether the designation of the NAF as the sole arbitration forum is an integral part of the arbitration agreement, \u201cthe court must employ the rules of contract construction to determine the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Joyce, </em>199 F.3d 790, 793 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Here, the arbitration agreement plainly states that Ranzy \u201cshall\u201d submit all claims to the NAF for arbitration and that the procedural rules of the NAF \u201cshall\u201d govern the arbitration. Put differently, the parties explicitly agreed that the NAF shall be the exclusive forum for arbitrating disputes. In <em>National Iranian, </em>we explained that, where the parties\u2019 agreement specifies that the laws and procedures of a particular forum shall govern any arbitration between them, that forum-selection clause is an \u201cimportant\u201d part of the arbitration agreement. 817 F.2d at 334 (\u201cNot only did NIOC choose Tehran as the site of any arbitration, but the contract also provides that Iranian law governs the interpretation and rendition of any arbitral awards.... The l\u00e1nguage of the contract thus makes self-evident the importance of Iranian law and Iranian institutions to NIOC.\u201d). Thus, a federal court need not compel arbitration in a substitute forum if the designated forum becomes unavailable. <em>See id. </em>at 333-35. Applying this rule, the Second Circuit, in <em>In re Salomon, </em>held that the district court properly declined to appoint a substitute arbitrator under \u00a7 5 and then compel arbitration because (1) the parties had contractually agreed that only the New York Stock Exchange could arbitrate any disputes between them and (2) that forum became unavailable. <em>See </em>68 F.3d at 561. We agree with the Second Circuit\u2019s application of <em>National Iranian, </em>and we also find this case to be indistinguishable from <em>In re Salomon. </em>Therefore, we hold that the district court properly denied the motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
