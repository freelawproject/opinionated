In the plea agreement, he stipulated that he was subject to the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and both parties agreed that a sentence of 37 months \u2014 within the guidelines range of 37 to 46 months \u2014 was appropriate. Kollar also waived his right to appeal his sentence on all grounds, with the reservation that he could appeal (a) any sentence exceeding the statutory maximum, and (b) a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel affecting the validity of the waiver. The district court sentenced Kollar to 37 months in prison in accordance with the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Kollar now appeals, arguing that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the use of Kollar\u2019s prior Texas robbery conviction as a predicate conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1. The Government argues that the appeal is barred by the waiver, that the record is not sufficiently developed to entertain an ineffective assistance claim, and that the application of \u00a7 4B1.1 was proper in light of existing precedent. Thus, the Government moves for dismissal, summary affir-mance, or an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We conclude that the appeal is barred by the plain terms of the waiver, <em>see United States v. White, </em>307 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2002), and that Kollar has offered no valid reason that it should not apply. Kol-lar\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Self, </em>596 F.3d 245, 247-50 (5th Cir.2010), is misplaced. The district court\u2019s order at sentencing that the special assessment was due immediately was not inconsistent with Kollar\u2019s obligation to pay the assessment before sentencing. There was none of the piecemeal rejection or modification of the agreement that we held was improper in <em>Self </em>Absent any valid argument for disregarding the waiver, we will hold Kollar to his bargain. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Even without the waiver, we would decline to entertain Kollar\u2019s appeal, as we do not have a sufficiently developed record to determine whether counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient or based on a sound strategy. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion to dismiss or for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the co.urt has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
