On appeal, he argues that the district court improperly dismissed his motion and characterized it as a successive motion to vacate filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-27\">Whether a district court has jurisdiction is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>or plenary review. <em>See, e.g., United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that a district court\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction to resentence a defendant is subject to plenary review). We may review a district court\u2019s jurisdiction <em>sua sponte. See United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1008 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Federal courts may \u201cignore the legal label that a <em>pro se </em>litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize the motion in order to place it within a different legal category.\u201d <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381, 124 S.Ct. 786, 791, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). \u201cThey may do so in order to avoid an unnecessary dismissal, to avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, or to create a better correspondence between the substance of a <em>pro se </em>motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 124 S.Ct. at 791-92 (internal citations omitted). However, before recharacterizing a motion as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court must provide the defendant with notice of its intended recharacterization and an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 384, 124 S.Ct. at 793. According to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court ... claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A federal prisoner who wishes to file a second or successive motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence is required to move the Court of Appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider such a motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), <em>cross-referencing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">However, an action brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is the proper vehicle to challenge the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). It is the appropriate means by which an inmate may challenge the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) calculation and execution of his sentence. <em>See Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1304 n. 14 (11th Cir.2000). Unlike \u00a7 2255 motions, motions made pursuant to \u00a7 2241 must be brought \u201conly in the district court for the district in which the inmate is incarcerated.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (11th Cir.1991); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Kinsey did not contest the validity of the district court\u2019s order of restitution or underlying conviction in his motion. Indeed, were he to raise such a challenge under either \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2255, it would be foreclosed. <em>See Arnaiz v. Warden, Fed. Satellite Low, </em>594 F.3d 1326, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Instead, he contests the administration of a concededly valid order. His motion does not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 2255, but it is an attack on the BOP\u2019s execution of his sentence, under \u00a7 2241. <em>See, e.g., Bishop, </em>210 F.3d at 1304 n. 14 (considering the BOP\u2019s administration of service credits under \u00a7 2241, per 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The Southern District of Florida is not the appropriate venue for Kinsey\u2019s motion because Kinsey was incarcerated at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta when he filed his motion. Petitions under \u00a7 2241 may be brought only in the district in which the inmate is incarcerated. <em>Fernandez, </em>941 F.2d at 1495; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). Therefore, the District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Southern District of Florida did not have jurisdiction to entertain a \u00a7 2241 motion for Kinsey. <em>See Fernandez, </em>941 F.2d at 1495; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). If Kinsey is still incarcerated in Atlanta, the appropriate venue for his motion would be the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On remand, the district court may, in its discretion, consider transferring the case to the appropriate venue, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. <em>See Dobard v. Johnson, </em>749 F.2d 1503, 1507 (11th Cir. 1985); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand the case with instructions to proceed consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
