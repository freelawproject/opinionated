(\u201cthe father\u201d) and H.M. (\u201cthe mother\u201d) are the unmarried parents of E.P. (\u201cthe child\u201d) who was born prematurely on April 22, 2015. Hospital employees contacted the Calhoun County Department of Human Resources (\u201cDHR\u201d) to report that the mother had had no prenatal care, that the mother had uncontrolled diabetes, that the mother had tested positive for marijuana the day before the child was bom, that the child had been experiencing feeding difficulties, that the child was suffering from neonatal hypoglycemia, that the parents had displayed \u201clower mental functioning,\u201d and that the mother had alleged and then denied \u201cdomestic-violence issues\u201d to hospital employees. Amy Estell, a professional counselor employed by DHR, administered a parenting assessment and concluded that the parents \u201cwere not mentally capable of caring for this baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-18\">One month later, while the child was still in the hospital, DHR filed a complaint in the Calhoun Juvenile Court in which it alleged that the child was a \u201cdependent child\u201d as defined by to \u00a7 12-15-102(8), Ala. Code 1975. DHR requested a pick-up order. The juvenile court appointed a guardian' ad litem for the child, an attorney for the mother, and an attorney for the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-19\">A shelter-care hearing was held, after which the juvenile court awarded pendente lite custody of the child to DHR. On June 29, 2015, the juvenile court ordered the father to submit to a paternity test. On June 30, 2015, the juvenile court appointed, in addition to their separate attorneys, a separate guardian ad litem for each parent. At that time, the father was 36 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>A dependency hearing was held on September 23, 2015. On September 24, 2015, the juvenile court entered a judgment, determining that the child was dependent, that reasonable efforts to reunite the family had failed, that placement with the parents was not in the child\u2019s best interests, that reasonable efforts to reunite the family would continue, and that the father is the \u201clegal and biological father\u201d of the child. The juvenile court awarded custody of the child to DHR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">On October 7, 2015, the father filed a postjudgment motion, arguing that the evidence presented was insufficient to support the judgment. On October 15, 2015, the juvenile court entered a judgment in which it corrected certain omissions in its September 24, 2015, judgment but did not alter its determinations. On October 22, 2015, the father filed a timely notice of appeal seeking this court\u2019s review of whether sufficient evidence supports the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">\u201cThe juvenile court heard ore tenus evidence regarding dependency; therefore, its judgment is accorded a strong presumption of correctness.\u201d A.M.W. v.

T.M., 140 So.3d 950, 959 (Ala.Civ.App.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-15\">At the time of the dependency hearing, the child had been in the custody of DHR since her release from the hospital following her premature birth. Neither parent testified or presented witnesses. Testimony presented by DHR demonstrated that, unlike healthy infants, the child had required weekly medical appointments for a suspected genetic disorder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Estell testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>fied that the father might not remember to transport the child to her weekly medical appointments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Estell testified that the patents did not know how to care for themselves, much less a medically fragile infant; that there had been time to counsel the parents only five times since the child was born; and that the only parenting skills'that the parents had grasped were how to prepare a bottle and how to change a diaper. - As aptly noted by the child\u2019s guardian ad litem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-3\">\u201cThis is not a termination of parental rights; this is dependency; the state will have plenty of time to work with these parents to see if they have the ability to take care of [the child].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">When asked whether the father was able to care for the child, Estell testified that the father had displayed an inability to grasp the basic concepts of caring for an infant and that she would expect him to continue to struggle in light of the child\u2019s complex medical needs. Estell said that the father, who had no other children, had had little time to prepare to parent the child because the mother had not known that she was pregnant during the majority of her pregnancy. Thus, through no fault of his own, the father, who had displayed appropriate effort, had been afforded neither the time to complete a series of parenting classes nor the opportunity to participate in the child\u2019s medical appointments. Regardless, Estell testified that, until the father, successfully completed a series of parenting classes, and addressed his potential mental-health issues, she would remain, concerned- that the father was unable \u2018to meet the needs of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"anx-dedup-2\">Estell testified that the father had submitted to mental-health treatment until he was approximately 21 years old and that he had once been committed to an inpatient mental-health facility for, according to the father, depression and anxiety; however, Estell testified that the. father was unsure of his diagnosis. The following colloquy occurred between the child\u2019s guardian ad litem and Estell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-8\">\u201cQ. What are your concerns specifically about [the father]?-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaOG\">\u201cA, Just that he do\u00e9sn\u2019t follow through with his own mental health care at the mental- health- center; he\u2019s missed a lot of appointments,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-11\">\u201cQ. Now, hold on before you continue on. T think it was two appointments that he missed at mental health; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-12\">\u201cA, Two or three. And now he\u2019s just .now starting his intake process this month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-13\">\u201cQ. And the only reason he was going to \u2022 mental health was because DHR asked him to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-14\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-15\">\u201cQ. That he has gone for more than 10 years, almost 20 years without any mental health treatment because he didn\u2019t .need it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-16\">\u201cA. He thinks his problems are managed, like the problems he had before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amib\">\u201cQ. So the mental health treatment, that\u2019s one oflyour concerns about [the father]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aui-dedup-2\">\u201cA, Uh-huh,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYnO\">\u201cQ. What ar\u00e9 your others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>\u201cA. The others are the same that I said before, parenting, learning how to parent, learning about what is going on with his child, what her needs are. Because they are just learning about the genetic issue. It would have been employment, but now he\u2019s employed apparently. My concerns about him would be no different than, the concerns about [the mother]. He still seems to have a very difficult time grasping information, retaining, he\u2019s trying. He\u2019s trying, I just think he still has a lot to learn. \u201cQ. And specifically what is your cpn-cern [regarding what] would happen to this child if the child went home to him today?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">Estell answered that she was not concerned that the father would fail to feed or diaper the child. However, Estell said: \u201cMy main concern is making sure that they have retained how to care for the child.\u201d Estell identified specific parenting responsibilities that the father had not yet retained and could not yet discharge. She said that the father did not yet know \u201cbasic things\u201d like an infant\u2019s developmental milestones, how to bathe an infant, how to safely install and buckle a child-restraint seat, when, to introduce certain foods, when it is safe to leave an infant alone in a room, or how to recognize when an infant needs something or is not feeling well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">The record also demonstrates that the father had displayed an inability to care for himself. The juvenile court had appointed a guardian ad litem for the father, the father had failed to keep all his counseling and medical appointments, the father did not manage his own finances, and a third party received the mother\u2019s disability check. Estell said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-6\">\u201cI think they need to continue in counseling. I know that it was discussed in the [individualized-service-plan meeting] that they have recently beg[u]n working with FOCUS to work with them on specific parenting needs. I would think they would need to do that. I\u2019m going to be addressing substance abuse with them now that FOCUS is in the home [\u2014a]nd then for [the father] to meet all his doctor, appointments at mental health.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">Finally, we note that the-juvenile court adjudicated the child dependent as to the mother and the father and that the mother did not file a notice of appeal. Because the unmarried parents live together, it appears likely that, 'if the father had custody, the child would be left in the care of the mother when- the recently employed father is at work; thus, the child would potentially be in the care of a noncustodial parent who is unable or unwilling to parent the child. \u201cObviously, if a- parent is unable or unwilling to discharge his or her parental responsibilities to and for the child or the' parent\u2019s conduct or condition is such that the parent cannot render proper care for the child, it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to be removed from the custody of the parent.\u201d J.C. v. State Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 986 So.2d 1172, 1210 (Ala.Civ.App.2007). Estell said that DHR could not provide a person to be in the house for an extended period every day and that, even if DHR was present in the home for two hours \u201cevery single day,\u201d she would still be \u201c.very nervous\u201d about leaving the child in the care of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">The record contains ample clear and convincing evidence to support a finding that, however willing he might be, the father was simply unable to properly care for or supervise the child at the time of the adjudication of her dependency. See C.O. v. Jefferson Cty. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 206 So.3d 621 (Ala.Civ.App.2016)(concluding that sufficient evidence supported a finding of dependency when a mother struggled with an addiction to pain medication, had.been seen intoxicated, and was incar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>cerated at the time of trial); T.C. v. Y.R., 162 So.3d 920, 925 (Ala.Civ.App.2014)(con-cluding that sufficient evidence supported a finding of dependency when a parent displayed instability, frequent moves, violent romantic relationships, and refusal to submit to mental-health counseling); and Ex parte T.L.L., 597 So.2d 1363, 1364 (Ala.Civ.App.1992)(concluding that sufficient evidence supported a finding of dependency when the parents displayed a history of instability and inattentiveness to the needs of the child).

See Ex parte Floyd, 550 So.2d 982 (Ala. 1989); and Ex parte R.E.C., 899 So.2d 272, 279 (Ala.2004). This burden properly rests with [the Department of Human Resources] because of the fundamental constitutional right to family integrity. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). A state may deprive a parent of custody of a child only when a compelling governmental interest, such as the protection of the child, exists. See L.B.S. v. L.M.S., 826 So.2d 178 (Ala.Civ.App.2002); and R.S.C. v. J.B.C., 812 So.2d 361 (Ala.Civ.App.2001) (plurality opinion). Therefore, the burden should rest with the state, as the party claiming the right to interfere with the integrity of the family, to prove the existence of the compelling circumstances warranting its intrusion.

Accordingly, a juvenile court may find a child to be dependent and, on that basis, withhold custody of a child from his or her parents only if the grounds contained in Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-102(8), are proven by clear and convincing evidence. See Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-310(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">DHR basically asserted that the father lacked the mental faculties to properly parent the child such that the father is \u201cunable or unwilling to discharge his or her responsibilities to and for the child.\u201d Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 12-15-102(8)a.6. \u201c[T]he law presumes that a custodial parent is fit in every respect to care for his or her children.\u201d T.J. v. Calhoun Cty. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 116 So.3d 1168, 1175 (Ala.Civ.App.2013). \u201cThe law ... does not place the burden on a parent to prove his or her mental-health fitness to the State in order to sustain his or her custody rights.\u201d Id. at 1174. The law totally, and rightfully, rejects any contention that the State can withhold custody of a child until DHR has \u201cplenty of time to work with the[] parents to see if they have the ability to take care of [the child],\u201d as the guardian ad litem inaptly stated. \u201cIn order for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>State to intrude into the solicitude of a family and to alter the custodial rights of a parent, the State bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is unfit to care for the child.\u201d Id. at 1175.

DHR did not submit' the assessment into evidence. Estell did not testify as to.the specific results of that assessment. Although Estell did testify that the father had' \u201cstruggled\u201d to grasp some \u201cprinciples,\u201d the record contains no clear , evidence indicating that the father currently suffers from any mental deficiency.. Although Estell alluded to substance-abuse and mental-health problems, her testimony remained vague on those points and DHR did not clarify whether those problems currently affected the father,</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-3\">More pointedly, the evidence does not establish that the father lacks the ability to meet the minimum requirements to adequately parent the child. The evidence suggests that the child may have a \u201cgenetic\u201d disease requiring special medical care, but DHR presented no evidence of the specific care required or that the father necessarily would not be able to provide that care. Estell acknowledged that the father could feed the child and change diapers. Estell criticized both parents for \u201clearning as they go,\u201d but she admitted that many new parents-also do not know certain developmental milestones and that parents generally depend on advice from pediatricians in that regard. Estell repeatedly stated that she \u201chad concerns\u201d as to.whether the father could adequately parent the child; however, Estell did. not identify any specific parenting responsibility that the father could not discharge. Whatever information caused Estell \u201cconcerns,\u201d DHR failed to elicit that information so that the juvenile court reasonably could determine whether her concerns were valid and proved the inability of the father to care for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">DHR charged the father with such intellectual dysfunction that he could not safely parent the child. Through its questioning of Estell it should have proven not only the existence and severity of that alleged mental disability, but also its necessary- impediment to the father\u2019s discharge of ordinary parenting skills and to those specific parenting skills required by the special needs of the child. Estell hinted at each of those facts, but she did not disclose-any specific information' to support- her conclusory opinions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXKW\">\u201cIt must appear to all, that if the facts as they are charged, actually exist, there could be but little difficulty in establishing the same -by evidence, which would be perfectly satisfactory in its character; but that disclosed by the record, produces no such conclusion\u2014the examination of the witnesses was evidently conducted by those unskilled in the art, or not aware of the importance of presenting' facts for the consideration of the Court, and although enough is disclosed to induce the belief that the witnesses knew more, and could perhaps have stated facts, which, if disclosed, might have established the material allegations of the bill\u2014yet it would be highly dangerous, as well as manifestly illegal, for any Court to act on facts which might, but which have hot, been established by testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Richardson v. Richardson, 4 Port. 467, 474 (Ala.1837). Estell\u2019s ill-defined and almost totally conclusory testimony,.the only evidence upon which the juvenile court could have rested its determination, does not satisfy our exacting standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">A natural parent has a fundamental right to care for his or her'child, and the State may infringe upon that right only in cases of clear and convincing evidence of unfitness. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 760, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). A judicial determination that a child is dependent authorizes the State to assume the parental decision-making role and to delegate the physical care of a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>to third parties. That infringement upon parental autonomy and care, even if temporary, can be justified only in clear cases evincing the necessity for State intervention for the protection of the child. I join Judge Donaldson in concluding that evidence that a new parent will need to learn how to perform his or her parenting duties, that the parent may struggle while in that learning process, and that the State has some unexplained concerns about that parent does not satisfy such a high eviden-tiary and substantive standard. Hence, I dissent from the court\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">DONALDSON, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">. The main opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1243-9\">\"Hospital employees contacted the Calhoun County Department of Human Resources ('DHR') to report that the mother had had no prenatal care, that the mother had uncontrolled diabetes, that the mother had tested positive for marijuana the day before the child was born, that the child had been experiencing feeding difficulties, that the child was suffering from neonatal hypoglycemia, that the parents had displayed \u2018lower mental functioning,\u2019 and that the mother had alleged and then denied \u2018domestic-violence issues\u2019 to hospital employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">222 So.3d at 1178, That excerpt summarizes the allegations in the dependency petition filed by DHR, most of which were not substantiated by any evidence at trial. In analyzing the evidence to determine whether it supports the judgment, I do not consider any unproven allegations in the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1245-5\">DONALDSON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AmeU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">I respectfully dissent. No matter how benevolent the intent, the extraordinary power of the government, acting through the judicial branch, to intrude into the parent-child relationship may be invoked only when clear and convincing evidence is presented compelling such action. Government intrusion cannot be based on speculation, conjecture, or value judgments regarding the relative worth of the parent. As we have previously explained, \u201ca parent has a fundamental right to the custody, care, and control of his or her child and ... a parent and a child share a fundamental right to family integrity.... These rights are accorded strong constitutional protection against State interference.\u201d M.E. v. Shelby Cty. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 972 So.2d 89, 102 (Ala.Civ.App.2007); see also J.C. v. State Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 986 So.2d 1172, 1203 (Ala.Civ.App.2007)(Moore, J., concurring in the result)(\u201c[T]he fundamental constitutional rights of the parents demand proof of dependency to assure that the parental relationship is not subjected to undue state interference.\u201d). The erosion of fundamental rights appears to often begin with the best of intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">In a dependency proceeding, the evidence must clearly and convincingly establish that the child is dependent at the time of the disposition. See R.F.W. v. Cleburne Cty. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 70 So.3d 1270, 1272 (Ala.Civ.App.2011); see also K.B. v. Cleburne Cty. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., 897 So.2d 379, 389 (Ala.Civ.App.2004) (Murdock, J., concurring in the result) (\u201c[I]n order to make a disposition of a child in the context of a dependency proceeding, the child must in fact be dependent at the time of that disposition.\u201d). In this case, the evidence indicated that the 36-year-old father had received mental-health treatment during his youth, possibly for depression and anxiety; that he had stopped receiving treatment between the ages of 18 and 21; and that he had not received treatment since that time because he felt his problems were under control. There is no evidence indicating that, at the time of the trial, the father was suffering from a mental condition that rendered him unwilling or unable to care for the child. Furthermore, there were only unsupported and unspecified \u201cconcerns\u201d expressed by a counselor related to the first-time father\u2019s ability to recognize age-appropriate behavior, his ability to understand the child\u2019s unspecified medical condition, and his ability to transport the child to medical appointments that had not yet been scheduled. The record indicates that the child\u2019s medical condition was still unknown at the time of the dependency hearing; that the parents had a plan in place to transport the child- to medical appointments; that the father knew how to hold, feed, and diaper the child; that the father could obtain age-specific information from the pediatrician; and that the father had been receiving counseling for parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Dependency determinations are within the juvenile court\u2019s realm of discretion only when there is substantial evidence in the record from which the juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>could be clearly convinced of the existence of dependency before the government usurps the parent-child relationship. When that evidence is not presented to the juvenile court, there is no discretion to be exercised and the dependency petition must be dismissed. K.C.G. v. S.J.R., 46 So.3d 499, 501-02 (Ala.Civ.App.2010). From my review of the record, the finding of dependency here was based on the child\u2019s undetermined and unspecified medical condition and on a speculative assessment of the father\u2019s potential strengths and weaknesses. No matter how laudable the intent, the evidence was insufficient to make a dependency finding. As such, the petition should have been dismissed, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
