On May 7, 1906, Heifer, defendant in error and plaintiff below, gave Spunner, plaintiff in error and defendant below, who is an attorney at law, a note for collection. The note was for $390, dated January 1, 1904, bearing six per cent, per annum interest and payable in two years. It was signed J. Frank Bichardson, payable to the order of M. C. McIntosh and endorsed only as follows: \u201cI hereby agree to collect the within note including interest and principal, for one per cent, commission. M. C. McIntosh.\u201d When the note was left for collection Spunner told Heifer he must let him, Spunner, use his own judgment in the matter of the collection, to which Heifer acceded. At that time Spunner gave Heifer a receipt for the note as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">\u201cLake Zurich, May 7, 1906.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">Beceived from Herman Heifer, McIntosh note for $390 and interest. Original note $350. Same for collection. $50 if I collect; nothing if I don\u2019t. Two months to make collection.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467\">(Signed) Gr. W. Spunuer.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\" pgmap=\"467\">On January 8, 1908, Heifer brought suit against Spunner in the Municipal Court for the value of that note. A jury was waived and, upon trial before the court, Heifer recovered a judgment for $300 and costs. In his praecipe Heifer had placed his damages at that amount. Spunner prosecutes this writ of error to reverse that judgment.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\" pgmap=\"467(148) 468(56)\">There is no conflict of fact in the case. It appears that Spunner, in the course of his efforts to collect the note, took from McIntosh fourteen notes for $25 each and, when that was done, McIntosh tore off the signature of J. Frank Bichardson to the original note and let it remain with Spunner. These fourteen notes were taken payable to the order of Spunner. Subsequently $55 was collected by Spunner upon the fourteen notes. Spunner says he did what he thought was for the best interests of Heifer and did not intend to convert the note to his own use. He has never disputed Heifer\u2019s ownership of the money and the new notes received. When Heifer came to Spunner with reference to the collection, Spunner offered him the money and the remaining $25 notes, but Heifer refused and insisted upon receiving all cash. Plaintiff in error offered, at the trial, to show that no such person as J. Frank Richardson existed and that the original note was worthless. But the court would permit no evidence in that behalf, to which ruling an exception was preserved. Some evidence appears in 1 the record tending to show the note was worthless.</p><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">Hayden N.

Both sides are equally strenuous in their respective contentions. Important rights, of the one party or the other, even to the extent of a question of deprivation of a party\u2019s personal liberty under the judgment to be rendered, frequently depend upon the election of the remedy or form of action. But, under the view we take of the case at bar, it is immaterial' upon what theory of action the suit was prosecuted. In this state it is established beyond question that an attorney may not compromise his client\u2019s claim or receive anything but money in payment, without the client\u2019s assent. Nolan v. Jackson, 16 Ill. 273; Danziger v. Pittsfield Shoe Company, 204 Ill. 145. The arrangement made by Spunner with McIntosh, unauthorized by Heifer, did not bind or in any wise affect Heifer. His rights against McIntosh or Richardson remained, after Spunner\u2019s arrangement, precisely the same as they were before. The only difference in Heifer\u2019s situation was that the note was mutilated by Richardson\u2019s signature being torn off. This in nowise affected the validity of the note; it only created some difficulty in making proof of the note. The mutilation would have to be explained and it might be harder to prove the signature. As a matter of law, McIntosh could not set up the settlement against Heifer and neither could Eichardson. Therefore, Spunner did not deprive Heifer of the note by what he did. \"When Heifer learned of what Spunner had done he had the option of repudiating his action and proceeding, as he, Heifer, might see fit, upon his original cause of action, which Spunner\u2019s act had not deprived him of, or he could adopt and ratify the act of his attorney. \"Whichever course he adopted the present judgment against Spunner cannot be sustained.</p> <p id=\"b469-4\" pgmap=\"469\">The judgment of the Municipal Court is therefore reversed and the cause is not remanded.</p> <p id=\"b469-5\" pgmap=\"469\">Reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
