As a result, the trial court erred in granting defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">The undisputed facts which are relevant to the issues raised on appeal are as follows. On January 30, 1994, appellant Judy Opial\u2019s husband, John, became ill. Judy, a registered nurse, suspected that her husband was having a heart attack and summoned the Rossford Emergency Medical Service (\u201cEMS\u201d) unit. Ross-ford EMS personnel were unable to revive John through cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and he died. The parties agree that the EMS unit was not equipped with a defibrillator, a device which sends electric shocks to the heart to revive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">On January 30,1995, appellants filed the complaint herein against appellees the city of Rossford; the Mayor of Rossford, Mark G. Zuchowski; city Councilpersons Robert Watrol, Walter Fedal, Pat Carson, Molly Jukubec, and James Richards; and \u201cJohn or Jane Doe,\u201d in which they alleged that (1) John Opial\u2019s death was proximately caused by appellees\u2019 \u201creckless, negligent and/or willful acts\u201d of not equipping the EMS vehicle with a defibrillator; (2) appellees made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cfalse and misleading representations\u201d that the Rossford EMS unit would respond promptly with \u201cadvanced life saving equipment sufficient to properly handle a cardiac arrest\u201d; and (3) appellees\u2019 failure to equip the EMS unit with a defibrillator violated R.C. Chapter 1345, the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. On March 16, 1995, appellees filed an answer in which they asserted as an affirmative defense that appellants\u2019 claims \u201care barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 2744.01, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On December 7, 1995, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment and memorandum in support thereof, in which they argued that (1) \u201c[a]ll decisions regarding the acquisition of equipment were made in good faith,\u201d and (2) they are immune from suit pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A). In support thereof, appellees relied on the affidavit of Robert P. Watrol, President of the Rossford City Council, in which he stated that (1) appellees never \u201caffirmatively made a decision not to acquire defibrillators\u201d; (2) appellees relied on the recommendations of the city fire chief and city medical director in deciding what equipment to purchase for the Rossford EMS; (3) at the time of John Opial\u2019s death, the Rossford EMS unit \u201cwas not licensed for Advanced Life Support\u201d; and (4) appellees made \u201call decisions regarding the acquisition of equipment for the EMS * * * in good faith and not for any malicious purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On January 5,1996, appellants filed a \u201cBRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO [APPELLEES\u2019] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\u201d and a memorandum in support thereof, in which they argued that (1) appellees are not immune because R.C. Chapter 2744 is inapplicable in this case; (2) appellees had a \u201cpublic duty\u201d to equip the Rossford EMS unit with defibrillators; (3) even if R.C. 2744.02(A) applies, appellees\u2019 actions are excepted from immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(4); and (4) alternatively, appellees are not immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A) because then-actions constituted \u201cwillful and wanton misconduct.\u201d In support thereof, appellants attached the affidavits of Judy Opial and attorney Frank I. Zygela. In her affidavit, Opial stated that she had attended several meetings of the Rossford City Council, at which it had refused to purchase a defibrillator for the EMS unit. In his affidavit, Zygela stated that he is appellants\u2019 attorney and that attached to his affidavit are \u201ctrue copies\u201d of (a) a transcript of portions of the October 23, 1995 radio broadcast of \u201cAll Things Considered,\u201d (2) two articles published by the Institute for Critical Care Medicine containing information on defibrillation, and (3) \u201crelevant portions of an article on early defibrillation that appeared in the August 1990 edition of the ASTM Standardization News.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On January 23, 1996, appellees filed a \u201cMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO [APPELLANTS\u2019] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND MOTION TO STRIKE,\u201d in which they argued that (1) they have immunity for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201cgovernmental function\u201d of deciding whether or not to purchase a defibrillator for the EMS unit pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A), and (2) the documents attached to Zygela\u2019s affidavit should be stricken because they \u201cconstitute inadmissible hearsay,\u201d Zygela is not competent to testify as to their authenticity, and Zygela has no personal knowledge as to their contents. On January 29,1996, appellants filed a \u201cBRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO [APPELLEES\u2019] MOTION TO STRIKE AND SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF IN OPPOSITION TO [APPELLEES\u2019] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT,\u201d and, on the same day, a hearing was held at which the parties\u2019 attorneys presented oral arguments to the trial court in support of their respective motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">On March 8, 1996, the trial court filed a \u201cJUDGMENT ENTRY\u201d in which it found, as to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that they are protected by sovereign immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(a), 2744.02(A), and 2744.03(A), and \u201cthe public duty rule is not applicable to this case\u201d; and as to appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, that \u201c[fjrom the evidence offered by [appellants] the Court cannot conclude that reasonable minds can come to one conclusion on the proximate cause of Mr. Opial\u2019s death and therefore] [appellant] is not entitled to summary judgment.\u201d As to appellees\u2019 motion to strike the materials attached to Zygela\u2019s affidavit, the trial court found that the issue was moot. Accordingly, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. On April 5, 1996, appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Appellants assert in their sole assignment of error that appellees are not immune from liability. In support thereof, appellants argue that (1) R.C. 2744.02(A) provides immunity only for the \u201chands-on\u201d provision of EMS services and not for the \u201cdecision-making underlying the determination not to supply the [Rossford EMS] department with defibrillators\u201d; (2) even if R.C. 2744.0(A) does apply to appellees, R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) provides an exception to immunity because appellees made the decision \u201cnot to purchase defibrillators on government grounds, i.e., the Rossford Town Hall, or wherever they meet\u201d; (3) R.C. 2744.03 is inapplicable in this case because appellees\u2019 acts were done with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, [and] in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d; and (4) alternatively, appellees are not immune pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 \u201cbecause at issue is not the <em>decision </em>to create an EMS unit (which is arguably subject to immunity), but, instead, the improper <em>implementation </em>of that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Appellees respond that R.C. 2744.02 is <em>\u201cobviously </em>applicable\u201d in this case because (1) emergency medical services are not restricted solely to the \u201chands-on\u201d emergency services provided by EMS personnel; (2) \u201clegislative decision-making and discretion\u201d such as deciding whether to provide defibrillators to EMS units \u201chave consistently been protected under Ohio\u2019s doctrine of sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>immunity\u201d; (3) the decision not to equip the EMS unit with a defibrillator was a discretionary decision and not a \u201cfaulty implementation\u201d of the \u201cmore general decision to create an EMS\u201d; (4) none of the exceptions to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B) applies to appellees; (5) even if one or more of the exceptions to liability did apply, appellees are still immune from liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.03; and (6) even if appellees are not immune pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744, \u201cappellants] failed to demonstrate that the City Council\u2019s decisions regarding equipping the Rossford EMS was the <em>proximate cause </em>of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Appellants reply that the act for which appellees are to be held liable is the decision not \u201cto provide defibrillators of any kind, contrary to accepted national standards\u201d; appellees\u2019 decision not to provide defibrillators constitutes \u201cwillful and wanton misconduct\u201d; and \u201cit is self-evident that reasonable minds could find that the failure to equip an EMS unit with defibrillators could directly and proximately result in death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">This court notes at the outset that in reviewing a summary judgment, we must apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198, 199-200. Summary judgment will be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cFor the purposes of this chapter, the functions of political subdivisions are hereby classified as governmental functions and proprietary functions. Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">R.C. 2744.01 lists specific examples of \u201cgovernmental functions\u201d including, but not limited to, \u201c[t]he provision or nonprovision of police, fire, emergency medical, ambulance, and rescue services or protection.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The blanket immunity granted in R.C. 2744.02(A) is qualified by five specific exceptions set forth R.C. 2744.02(B). R.C. 2744.02(B)(4), the relevant section in this case, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201c(4) Political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The exceptions to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B) are further subject to specific immunity defenses enumerated in R.C. 2744.03, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c(5) The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss to persons or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In their first argument, appellants seek to hold appellees liable for performing a governmental \u201cdecision-making\u201d function as opposed to a proprietary function and do not allege that appellees\u2019 conduct fell within any of the exceptions to immunity except the one set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, this court finds preliminarily that (1) R.C. 2744.02(A) provides immunity for <em>all </em>governmental and proprietary functions of a political subdivision, unless one of the exceptions set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B) applies; and (2) the examples of a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d set forth in R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(a) do not distinguish between the \u201cdecision-making\u201d and \u201chands-on\u201d aspects of the provision of EMS services.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As to appellants\u2019 second argument, this court has previously interpreted the exception set forth in 2744.02(B)(4) to mean that political subdivisions are liable for the negligence of their employees only if the injury caused by such negligence actually occurs \u201cwithin or on the grounds of buildings used in connection with governmental functions.\u201d <em>Amborski v. Toledo (1990), 67 </em>Ohio App.3d 47, 50, 585 N.E.2d 974, 976. In addition, Ohio courts have held that the language of R.C. 2744.02(B) \u201csupport[s] the conclusion that subsection (B)(4) only applies to the maintenance of governmental property\u201d and not to the decision-making which may take place on such property. <em>Doe v. Jefferson Area Local School Dist. </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 11, 13, 646 N.E.2d 187, 188, citing <em>Zellman v. Kenston Bd. of Edn. </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 287, 593 N.E.2d 392,</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">As to appellants\u2019 third argument, it is undisputed in this case that (a) appellees exercised their discretion not to acquire a defibrillator for the Rossford EMS unit and (b) appellees are not liable for any injury which results from that decision unless it was made with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The term \u201cmalice\u201d has been defined as the \u201cwillful and intentional design to do injury, or the intention or desire to harm another.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 448, 453, 602 N.E.2d 363, 367. The term \u201cbad faith\u201d \u201cimports a dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>nature of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 602 N.E.2d at 367, citing <em>Slater v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 148, 21 O.O.2d 420, 187 N.E.2d 45, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that willful conduct \u201cimplies an act done intentionally, designedly, knowingly, or purposely, without justifiable excuse,\u201d and that a wanton act is \u201can act done in reckless disregard of the rights of others which evinces a reckless indifference of the consequences to the life, limb, health, reputation, or property of others.\u201d <em>State v. Earlenbaugh </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 19, 21-22, 18 OBR 16, 18, 479 N.E.2d 846, 849. An individual acts \u201crecklessly\u201d when \u201c \u2018he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 104-105, 559 N.E.2d 705, 708, quoting 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 587, Section 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">As to appellants\u2019 fourth argument, in <em>Enghauser Mfg. Co. v. Eriksson Engineering, Ltd. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 31, 6 OBR 53, 451 N.E.2d 228, which was decided before the enactment of R.C. Chapter 2744, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that, while immunity is a complete defense to an action for an act or omission involving a high degree of official discretion, once that decision has been made, the political subdivision is liable for its negligence in implementing it. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 6 OBR at 57, 451 N.E.2d at 232-233. In <em>Leach v. Dayton </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 467, 648 N.E.2d 895, the Montgomery County Court of Appeals stated that the exception to immunity set forth in <em>Enghauser </em>\u201cwas in effect codified in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3),\u201d which provides a political subdivision with immunity if the \u201caction or failure to act\u201d by an employee \u201cthat gave rise to the claim of liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy-making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.\u201d <em>Id., </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 470, 648 N.E.2d at 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">It is undisputed in this case that the applicable statute is R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), which provides for conditional immunity in cases where a political subdivision exercises its discretion in deciding how to acquire and allocate resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">This court has reviewed the entire record of proceedings before the trial court and upon consideration thereof, our preliminary findings above, and the law, finds that (1) the exception set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) does not apply to appellees\u2019 decision not to purchase defibrillators for the Rossford EMS unit; (2) appellants have not shown that appellees acted with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner\u201d when they decided not to purchase defibrillators; (3) the distinction between governmental decision-making and implementation of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>decision made by the Supreme Court in <em>Enghauser </em>is inapplicable in this case; and (4) there remains no genuine issue of fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in appellants\u2019 favor, reasonable minds can only conclude that appellees are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice has been done the parties complaining, and the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed. Court costs of these proceedings are assessed to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b629-7\">Melvin L.
