McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Plaintiffs-appellants, Randall and Lisa Winkhart (hereinafter referred to singularly as \u201cappellant\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), appeal the decision of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court that granted summary judgment to defendant-appellee, State Farm Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The undisputed facts relevant to this appeal are as follows: On July 10, 1994, appellant sustained serious injuries when the motorcycle he was driving was struck by an automobile operated by Trade Tackett. Tackett qualified as an insured under a policy issued by Progressive Insurance Company. This policy carried \u201cper person\u201d liability coverage limits of $12,500, which amount was duly paid to appellant on behalf of the tortfeasor. Also at the time of the accident, appellant was insured under two separate but identical policies issued by State Farm that provided underinsured-motorist coverage. Each policy insured different vehicles and provided \u201cper person\u201d liability coverage limits of $100,000. Furthermore, each policy contained the following antistacking provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">\u201cIf There Is Other Similar Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">\u201c1. If Other Policies Issued By Us To You Apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">\u201cIf two or more motor vehicle liability policies issued by us to <em>you </em>providing uninsured motor vehicle coverage apply to the same accident, the total limits of liability under all such policies shall not exceed that of the policy with the highest limit of liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">State Farm paid appellant $87,500, which represented one policy\u2019s \u201cper person\u201d liability limit of $100,000 less the $12,500 already paid by Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that, pursuant to his underinsured-motorist coverage, he was entitled to each policy\u2019s $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d limit, for a total award of $200,000, exclusive of the $12,500 already paid by Progressive. State Farm moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Appellant timely appeals and assigns the following errors for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee State Farm Insurance Company, as defendant-appellee State Farm is not entitled to set off from its policy limits those amounts tendered to plaintiff-appellants by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee State Farm Insurance Company, as plaintiff-appellants are entitled to collect the full $200,000.00 limits of the underinsured motorist policies issued to them by defendant-appellee State Farm Insurance Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s decision. \u201cA court reviewing the granting of a summary judgment must follow the standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C) * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civ.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that \u201c(1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from such evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and, viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to the party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court improvidently granted State Farm summary judgment because State Farm is not entitled to set off its payment to appellant by $12,500, the amount paid by Progressive. Relying on <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut Ins. </em>Co.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellant contends that an insurer\u2019s right to setoff is against the total damages sustained by the injured party and not the policy coverage limits. State Farm, on the other hand, maintains that <em>Savoie </em>neglected to address the effect of R.C. 3937.18(A)(2), which specifically provides a right of setoff from the limits of the underinsured-motorist coverage. State Farm further contends that neither <em>Savoie </em>nor its progeny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>overruled <em>James v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or <em>In re Nationwide Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decisions that specifically upheld the right of setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Issues affecting underinsured-motorist coverage have been considered and reconsidered in a plethora of cases emanating from the Supreme Court of Ohio in recent years. In an attempt to resolve the issue that arises when an injured party, seeking recovery pursuant to his underinsured-motorist coverage, suffers damages that exceed his policy limits after he has been partially compensated for those injuries by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer, the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Cole v. </em>Holland<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reaffirmed <em>Savoie </em>and held that insurers must set off proceeds received by their insured from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer against the insured\u2019s <em>damages, </em>rather than against the written limits of the insured\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">While State Farm acknowledges that this court is bound to and has followed the syllabus law of <em>Savoie,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it argues that <em>Savoie </em>neglected to address the effect of former R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) and, therefore, setoff is permissible pursuant to this statutory provision. To the contrary, in reaffirming <em>Savoie, </em>the <em>Cole </em>court specifically referred to R.C. 3937.18 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">\u201cWe hold that pursuant to <em>former R.C. 3937.18, </em>an underinsurance claim must be paid when the individual covered by an uninsured/underinsured policy suffers damages that exceed those monies available to be paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carriers. In determining the amount of underinsurance coverage to be paid in a situation involving an accident governed by former R.C. 3937.18, the underinsurance provider is entitled to set off the amounts actually recovered from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carriers <em>against the insured\u2019s total damages, rather than against its policy limits.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">State Farm further argues that neither <em>Savoie </em>nor its progeny expressly overruled or otherwise limited the holdings of <em>James v. Michigan Mut. Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or <em>In re Nationwide Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>both of which provide a right to setoff. While not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>specifically overruling either case, the <em>Cole </em>court expressly disapproved these cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Finding State Farm\u2019s arguments to be without merit and the decision in <em>Cole </em>controlling, we hold that State Farm is not entitled to set off the amount paid by Progressive against the proceeds appellant is entitled to receive pursuant to his underinsured-motorist coverage with State Farm. Consequently, appellant is entitled to the full underinsured-motorist coverage of $100,000,</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">In his second assignment of error, appellant contends he is entitled to collect the full underinsured-motorist coverage of both insurance policies because, while <em>Savoie </em>concluded that an insurer can include antistacking language so as to bar intrafamily stacking, State Farm has not demonstrated that appellant received a discount for purchasing the two policies. Appellant argues that, absent such evidence, the antistacking provision is contrary to <em>Savoie </em>and, therefore, unenforceable. State Farm, on the other hand, maintains that the discount language in <em>Savoie </em>is dicta and that, even if it were not dicta, State Farm did provide evidence that appellant received a discount through the affidavit of Mary Ellen Price, Underwriting Operations Superintendent for State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">In holding that an insurer can contractually preclude intrafamily stacking, the <em>Savoie </em>court rationalized its decision by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">\u201cIn intrafamily stacking situations, insurers can provide reduced premiums for clients who purchase multiple uninsured/underinsured policies for separate vehicles. If the premium has been reduced, it logically follows that benefits can be restricted. However, the injured individual in an interfamily stacking scenario seeks to combine the limits of two policies for which premiums have not been reduced because of their mutual existence. Because insurers are attempting to prevent the full payment of two policy limits resulting from the full, unadjusted premium payment of two unrelated insurance policies, the contractual preclusion of interfamily stacking is unconscionable. We do not believe that the legislature intended to sanction such a practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">It is undisputed that the policies appellant is attempting to stack are intrafamily policies and that, pursuant to the second syllabus of <em>Savoie, </em>an insurer may contractually preclude intrafamily stacking. What is disputed is whether <em>Savoie </em>requires evidence that the insured received a premium discount for purchasing multiple policies in order for the antistacking provisions to be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>While State Farm is correct that the reduced premium language is not part of the syllabus law of <em>Savoie, </em>it is clear from that opinion that the court\u2019s decision was premised on the insurer\u2019s ability to offer reduced premiums in exchange for a restriction of benefits. Consequently, this court is persuaded that <em>Savoie </em>requires evidence of a reduced premium in order for an insurer to contractually preclude intrafamily stacking.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It therefore becomes necessary to look at the policies issued to appellant and the evidence provided by State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Both parties concede that appellant purchased two identical insurance policies, each policy covering a different vehicle.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, State Farm has offered the affidavit of its Underwriting Operations Superintendent, Mary Ellen Price, wherein she avers that appellant received multi-car discounts resulting in reduced premiums for both policies issued to him. As State Farm has complied with the identical rationale of <em>Savoie </em>in providing evidence of reduced premiums, State Farm is entitled to enforce the intrafamily antistacking provisions of appellant\u2019s policies; therefore, appellant is not entitled to stack the two policies. Consequently, the trial court did not err in granting State Farm judgment in its favor as a matter of law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b833-8\">Blackmon, P.J., and Dyke, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-13\">.
