O\u2019Neill, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">On November 27, 1990, Bill S. Wall, the appellant, an employee of the Youngstown Street Department, was a passenger in a city truck.- Hershel Fordham, a fellow employee, backed the truck into a pole, allegedly causing the appellant to be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On January 29,1993, the appellant signed a Workers\u2019 Compensation Form C-3, an Application for Payment of Medical Benefits and, then, on February 10, 1993, the appellant signed a Workers\u2019 Compensation Form C-l, an Application for Payment of Compensation and Medical Benefits. His claims were denied throughout the administrative process as not being timely filed. The appellant pursued an appeal to the common pleas court, which court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees. A timely notice of appeal was filed, directed to that final judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The first assignment of error contends that the trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment for the reason that the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 4123.85 was extended by failure of the city to file a report required by R.C. 4123.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">R.C. 4123.85 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\u201cIn all cases of occupational disease, or death resulting from occupational disease, claims for compensation or benefits shall be forever barred unless, within two years after the disability due to the disease began, or within such longer period as does not exceed six months after diagnosis of the occupational disease by a licensed physician or within two years after death occurs, application is made to the industrial commission or the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation or to the employer in the event the employer has elected to pay compensation or benefits directly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Very obviously, appellant\u2019s claims for compensation and benefits were not filed within two years after the alleged disability arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">R.C. 4123.28 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-12\">\u201cEvery employer in this state shall keep a record of all injuries and occupational diseases, fatal or otherwise, received or contracted by his employees in the course of their employment and resulting in seven days or more of total disability. Within a week after acquiring knowledge of an injury or death therefrom, and in the event of occupational disease or death therefrom, within one week after acquiring knowledge of or diagnosis of or death from an occupational disease or of a report to the employer of the occupational disease or death, a report thereof shall be made in writing to the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation upon blanks to be procured from the bureau for the purpose. The report shall state the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>and nature of the business of the employer, the location of his establishment or place of work, the name, address, nature and duration of occupation of the injured, disabled, or deceased employee and the time, the nature, and the cause of injury, occupational disease, or death, and such other information as is required by the bureau.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\u201cThe employer shall give a copy of each report to the employee it concerns or his surviving dependents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">\u201cNo employer shall refuse or neglect to make any report required by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201cEach day that an employer fails to file a report required by this section constitutes an additional day within the time period given to a claimant by the applicable statute of limitations for the filing of a claim based on the injury or occupational disease, provided that a failure to file a report shall not extend the applicable statute of limitations for more than two additional years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In his motion for summary judgment, at no point did the appellant establish that Youngstown had ever had knowledge that he had, during the two-year period, suffered seven days or more of total disability. There is no question but that he was injured in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The appellant filed two motions for summary judgment in the trial court. The first motion carried with it various attachments, none of which could be considered by the trial court. The second motion carried with it various attachments, none of which could be considered by the trial court. In a summary judgment proceedings, the trial court may consider only \u201c * * * the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action * * *. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">In the motion for summary judgment, filed by the defendants, there was attached as a part of that motion the deposition of the defendant-appellant. The appellant insists that, at different times, his absences due to his alleged injury were well in excess of the seven-day reporting period. However, in his deposition, it was firmly established that he did not inform defendant Youngstown that his absences were due to his injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">\u201cQ When you took off 36 and a half days in 1991, 28 days in 1992, and 35 days in 1993, according to your answer to Interrogatory No. 8, were you asked to supply any doctor slip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\">\u201cQ Or medical excuse or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cA No. In fact, all the way up until the time that I filed Workmen\u2019s Comp, the City never had a problem on the days that I took off, because they knew what it was for. Once I took off, and I was provided with the paperwork, filing for a claim number on my own, the City had informed me that if I wouldn\u2019t have jumped the gun \u2014 and this is the way that they put it \u2014 if you wouldn\u2019t have jumped the gun, we would have got it straightened out and paid your medical bills. I told them I could not continue to work any longer. I was going to do permanent body damage to myself, possibly death, and they said, well, now, you\u2019ve got to suffer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The plaintiff-appellant went on to further testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">\u201cQ Up to July of \u201993, whenever you called off, you called off to a security guard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cQ Rather than to Mr. Dundee, Mr. Olenick or anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201cA Right, you didn\u2019t have to call in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cQ Right. I\u2019m not asking what you had to do and what you did do, and what you did do was call the security guard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">\u201cQ And you were directed to do so, or you understood that that was the required or requested procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">\u201cA That was the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-14\">\u201cQ All right. But you never had a conversation with Mr. Dundee [appellant\u2019s supervisor] in which you said, I\u2019m calling you to let you know I\u2019m off and I\u2019m off due to the injury I suffered on 11/28/90?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-15\">\u201cA Not since the time of the original accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-16\">\u201cQ Okay. So you had one conversation with him the day of or the day after the accident, in which you may have advised him that you may need time off in the future. And the next time you discussed taking off with him was in 1993?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-17\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-18\">\u201cQ And in between, you talked to security guards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-19\">\u201cA That\u2019s what I was instructed to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-20\">\u201cQ And you\u2019ve identified them to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-21\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-22\">\u201cQ Are any of them management, employees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-23\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>It is evident from the matters submitted in the summary judgment proceedings that at no time did defendant Youngstown have knowledge that the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s injury resulted in seven days or more of total disability. R.C. 4123.28 is clear and unambiguous and does not call for interpretation. Very specifically, that statute requires that an employer keep a record of all injuries and occupational diseases received by its employees in the course of their employment which result in seven days or more of total disability. If an injury does not result in seven days or more of total disability, the employer is not required to keep a record. However, a further review of R.C. 4123.28 results in a conclusion that within a week, after an employer acquires knowledge of an injury, the report thereof must be made in writing to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation upon blanks which can be procured from the bureau for that purpose. It was clearly established in the summary judgment proceedings that the appellant, on the day of his alleged injury and on the day following his alleged injury, reported his injury to one of his supervisors. As a part of the appellant\u2019s deposition, the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cQ On your answer to No. 23 of the interrogatories are the names of some people that you notified \u2014 which you say you notified on November 28, 1990. And you mentioned John Olenick\u2019s name, which you told me about, and you mentioned Bill Dundee\u2019s name also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cA Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\u201cQ You didn\u2019t tell me earlier that you had spoken with Bill Dundee. You didn\u2019t mention his name at all\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201cA I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cQ \u2014until we got to this accident report. Did you speak to him the very same day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201cA Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cQ When did you see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">\u201cA I saw him when I got finished with John Olenick. I was walking down the hallway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201cQ And what kind of discussion did you have about your accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cA I told him I was going to see my doctor today, and I was in an accident last night. He told me, well, did you fill in an incident report. I said, yes, I did. He said don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">As a part of this summary judgment proceeding, the affidavit of William Dundee, Building Commissioner and head of the Street Department for Youngstown, was filed. As a part of his affidavit, Dundee expressed that he had been advised, in late November 1990, that Bill Wall had reported an accident on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>November 28, 1990 involving a crew truck operated by an employee named Hershel Fordham. Dundee further stated in his affidavit that, to the best of his knowledge, Bill Wall did not miss any time for work as a result of the accident, nor did Dundee recall that Bill Wall had been placed on light duty following the accident because, to the best of his recollection, the street department did not have any light duty positions. Dundee went on to state that Bill Wall was absent from work on numerous occasions in 1991 and 1992 but that he was never advised by Bill Wall that any of the absences were alleged to be the result of the November 28,1990 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Thus, there arises an issue of material fact. The appellant contends that he reported his injury to Dundee, his supervisor, on the date of the accident. Dundee states that he had no knowledge that Wall was injured in the accident until March 12, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u201cSummary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u201cSections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d R.C. 4123.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings according to law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-10\">Gene Donofrio, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b118-11\">Cox, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b118-12\">Cox, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">The material fact in this matter concerns whether Youngstown had knowledge that appellant was injured resulting in seven days or more of total disability. Taking appellant\u2019s testimony as the only evidence, it is still apparent that although he informed his supervisor at the time of the accident, he did not seek medical treatment until the next day. He then went on \u201clight duty.\u201d However, neither of the supervisors knew about the \u201clight duty.\u201d His absences were never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>recorded as being injury-related. The trial court was correct in its ruling and I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
