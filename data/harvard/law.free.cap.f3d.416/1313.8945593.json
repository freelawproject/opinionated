White argues on appeal that this sentence violated his rights in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm White\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment, charging White and other codefen-dants with conspiracy to commit theft of goods in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 659 (\u201cCount 1\u201d); and theft of goods in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 659 (\u201cCount 2\u201d). Following trial, a jury convicted White of both of these' offenses. In November 1999, the district court sentenced White to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release, with conditions of release including that he refrain from committing further criminal offenses and not illegally possess a controlled substance. On direct appeal, White only challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, some of the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, and the court\u2019s denial of his request for an adjustment in his guideline offense level for his minor role in the offense. We affirmed White\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">In April 2001, White\u2019s three-year term of supervised release commenced. In March 2004, the government charged White with violating a term of his supervised release by being arrested for committing the state offenses of (1) possession with intent to sell cocaine, and (2) selling cocaine within 1,000 feet of a convenience store. In April 2004, at White\u2019s preliminary hearing on these violations, he admitted to possessing drugs, without conceding that he intended to sell the drugs. Absent any objections, the court accepted White\u2019s admission and found him guilty of violating his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-20\">On June 25, 2004, at sentencing on these violatiohs, the probation officer proffered that White\u2019s state arrest had involved the sale of $1,000 worth of cocaine base to a confidential informant, which was a Grade A violation, with a resulting recommended guideline range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> White again admitted to violating a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>tion of his supervised release, but he argued that his admission to possessing the drugs only supported a finding that he committed a Grad\u00e9 B violation and, thus, had a \u00a7 7B1.4(a) recommended guideline range of only 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">Agreeing with White that the offense was a Grade B violation, the court explicitly discussed the factors that it had considered, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\u00a9, in determining what sentence to impose. In doing so, the court acknowledged that the probation officer had stated that White had stable employment, and that there was no evidence that White was using drugs. On the other hand, the court noted that the offenses forming the basis for his new arrest were serious, and that White had a \u201chistory of involvement with drugs.\u201d The court also stated that \u201cMr. White needs to understand that he simply cannot have involvement with drugs. Drugs, I think, are what are a problem to him.\u201d The court ultimately revoked White\u2019s term of supervised release and sentenced him, without objection, to 12 months\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by 24 months\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">In a brief White filed prior to the Supreme Court issuing its decision in <em>Booker, </em>he argues for the first time that the district court violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely, </em>by sentencing him to additional terms of imprisonment and supervised release after determining that he violated a term of his supervised release. White specifically contends that, assuming the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>was applicable to the federal guidelines, the law governing the imposition and revocation of supervised release, which was part of the \u201cpackage\u201d of sentencing reforms enacted in 1984, also is unconstitutional. White, thus, argues that (1) his original term of supervised release was unconstitutionally imposed and could not support the violation at issue in this case, and (2) the court\u2019s ultimate sentence following revocation of supervised release was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent White is attempting to challenge the district court\u2019s original imposition of three years\u2019 supervised release, a defendant may not challenge, for the first time on appeal from the revocation of supervised release, his sentence for the underlying offense. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 317-18 (11th Cir.1993). We explained in <em>Almand </em>that \u201c[a] sentence is presumed valid until vacated under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. We also have determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.2005). The scope of our review, therefore, is limited to White\u2019s challenge of the court\u2019s sentence following the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">Because White did not raise his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objections in the district court, we review them only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.) (reviewing a newly raised <em>Blakely/Booker </em>challenge to the federal guidelines for plain error), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>L.Ed. 866 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial' rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). \u201c \u2018If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631, 122 S.Ct. at 1785).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, arid proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Before White\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant </em>.... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">Applying these principles, the Supreme Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the sentencing court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2534-38. In a footnote, however, the Court explicitly remarked that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-11\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d, in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 749-51. Thus, the Supreme Court determined in <em>Booker </em>\u201cthat the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a \u2022 mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-56) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-12\">Post <em>-Booker, \u25a0 </em>we have distinguished between two types of errors under <em>Booker: </em>(1) Sixth Amendment, or constitutional, error based upon sentencing enhancements in a mandatory guidelines system when the enhancements neither are admitted by the defendant, nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>der a mandatory guideline system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court explained <em>pre-Booker </em>that, while certain Fifth Amendment due process protections apply in revocation proceedings, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is not applicable. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1800, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (holding that conduct giving rise to a supervised release violation \u201cneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard\u201d). However, neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has addressed in a published opinion whether <em>Booker </em>applies to a sentence imposed after the revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">Regardless, even if we were to decide that <em>Booker </em>was applicable, we have determined that there is no Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker </em>where the defendant has admitted to facts later used by the district court to enhance his sentence. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330. Because White admitted during his preliminary hearing and at sentencing that he violated a term of his supervised release by possessing drugs, which is a Grade B violation, there was no Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">In determining whether the court committed a statutory <em>Booker </em>error, upon finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court, after considering factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), may, among other options, revoke a term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). One of the factors a court must consider in sentencing following revocation is \u201cthe kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission ....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B). Moreover, one of the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the federal guidelines \u2014 the section that governs violations of supervised release \u2014 provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">However, \u201c[t]he Sentencing Commission has not yet promulgated any binding probation revocation guidelines; instead, the Sentencing Commission has opted for the flexibility of advisory policy statements, which are nonbinding on the courts.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A review of the sentencing transcript also does not reveal that the district court believed that White\u2019s guideline range of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment was mandatory as opposed to advisory. Accordingly, White\u2019s sentence was not increased under a mandatory guideline system, and no statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurred. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298; <em>cf. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31 (holding that the district court plainly erred when it sentenced defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme and the defendant established that this error affected his substantial rights).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>Furthermore, an error cannot meet the \u201cplain\u201d requirement of the plain error rule if it is not \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]here neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that, we need not determine under plain-error review, in the absence of precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court, whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)((2) provided the maximum term of supervised release for a defendant sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)\u00a9)). Thus, even if we were to conclude that error occurred, neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has determined whether <em>Booker </em>was applicable to a defendant\u2019s sentence following a revocation of supervised release, and any error was not \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing White upon .revocation of his supervised release. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">. The criminal history category to be used in determining the applicable advisory guideline range of imprisonment in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a) is the category determined at the time the defendant originally was sentenced to the term of supervision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>comment, (n.l).
