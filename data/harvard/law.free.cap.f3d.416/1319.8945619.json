United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005). We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rivers\u2019 petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. The Supreme Court then vacated our decision and remanded the case to us for consideration in light of <em>Johnson. Rivers v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1822, 161 L.Ed.2d 714 (2005) (mem.). Because <em>Johnson </em>dictates that Rivers failed to exercise due diligence in attacking the state conviction that was used to enhance his federal sentence, we again affirm the denial of his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">In 1996, Rivers pled guilty to one .count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. The Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assessed five criminal history points against Rivers: three points for a 1987 state court drug conviction; and two points for committing the federal offense while on parole for that state conviction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). With five criminal history points, the PSI placed Rivers in Criminal History Category III. At sentencing, the district court adjusted Rivers\u2019 offense level, but adopted the PSI\u2019s findings regarding Rivers\u2019 criminal history category, imposing a sentence of 135 months. The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on February 6, 1997. Because Rivers did not pursue a direct appeal, his conviction became final on February 17,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">On April 16, 2001, four years after his federal conviction became final, Rivers filed a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Fulton County Superior Court (the \u201cstate court\u201d), seeking to vacate the 1987 drug conviction that served as the basis for his federal sentence enhancement. The state court granted Rivers\u2019 petition on May 3, 2002, vacating the conviction that the district court relied upon to enhance his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">Rivers then filed a federal habeas motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, in the district court on September 23, 2002. Because this circuit had not yet ruled on the timeliness of such petitions, the district court adopted the reasoning in <em>Brackett v. United States, </em>270 F.3d 60, 68 (1st Cir.2001), which held that the one-year \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(4) limitations period begins to run on the date when the defendant learned or should have learned the facts supporting his claim to vacate the state conviction\u2014 not the date on which the defendant learned that his state convictions were vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">We granted a certificate of appealability on the question of whether Rivers\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion was time-barred. Before we issued an opinion in the case, however, another panel of this court decided <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2003). The panel in <em>Johnson </em>agreed with <em>Brackett\u2019s </em>reasoning, and .held that the vacatur of a state conviction is not a \u201cfact supporting the claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(4). <em>Id. </em>at 1226. Recognizing that we were bound by the <em>Johnson </em>panel, we affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that Rivers\u2019 petition was time-barred. <em>See Rivers v. U.S., </em>91 Fed.Appx. 655 (11th Cir.2004). Rivers then filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which the Supreme Court granted, vacating our opinion and remanding the case for consideration in light of their opinion in <em>Johnson. See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number><em>Rivers, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1822, 161 L.Ed.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">Habeas petitions brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255 are subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6. In relevant part, that limitations period runs from \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(4). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that the vacatur of a state conviction does qualify as a \u201cfact\u201d under \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(4), and that the limitations period thus begins to run on the date on which the petitioner received notice of the state court vacatur. <em>See Johnson, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1579-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">However, <em>Johnson </em>also requires that \u00a7 2255 petitioners show due diligence in <em>obtaining </em>the vacatur of their predicate state court conviction in order to rely on the Paragraph Four limitations period. <em>See id. </em>at 1580-81. Diligence is shown by the petitioner\u2019s prompt filing of a state habeas petition, as measured from the date that judgment was entered on the enhanced federal sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1581. Where the petitioner in <em>Johnson </em>filed his state habeas petition more than three years following entry of judgment, his actions \u201cfell far short of reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1582. Moreover, the Court held that Johnson\u2019s explanations for the delay (namely, his lack of sophistication and <em>pro se </em>status) did not excuse his dilatoriness. <em>Id. </em>With a delay greater than three years in seeking state court relief and without any excusable basis for the delay, Johnson\u2019s failure to exercise due diligence rendered his habeas petition untimely under \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(4). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">In Rivers\u2019 case, the state court vacated his prior conviction on May 3, 2002. <em>Johnson </em>dictates that this qualified as a \u201cfact supporting the [habeas] claim\u201d and that Rivers had one year from receiving notice of the vacatur to file his federal \u00a7 2255 petition. Because Rivers filed his petition on September 23, 2002, he has clearly satisfied Johnson\u2019s first requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">Nonetheless, like the petitioner in <em>Johnson, </em>Rivers has failed to satisfy <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>second requirement: the exercise of due diligence in seeking vacatur of the state court conviction. The district court entered judgment on Rivers\u2019 enhanced federal sentence on February 6,1997. Rivers did not file his state habeas petition until April 16, 2001 \u2014 more than four years after judgment was entered on his federal sentence. The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>held that where the petitioner waited more than three years after entry of judgment to file his state petition, he did not act with reasonable diligence. <em>See Johnson, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1582. Where Rivers\u2019 state vacatur filing suffered from an even longer delay, we are bound to conclude that he similarly failed to act with reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\"> In his supplemental brief, Rivers argues that no due diligence determination can be made without remanding the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing. On this point, Rivers argues that unspecified delays in the state clerk\u2019s retrieval of records necessary for his state habeas filing, along with his lack of education, excuse any delay. We agree that the individualized, factual nature of a due diligence determination will indeed often require <em>Johnson </em>cases to be remanded for factual development. <em>See Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (determination regarding party\u2019s diligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>is a finding of fact subject to review for clear error); <em>see also Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 712 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that \u201cthe due diligence inquiry is an individualized one that must take into account the [habeas petitioner\u2019s] conditions of confinement\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, Rivers\u2019 supplemental brief fails to set out just what efforts he made to obtain the necessary records or to explain what amount of time lapse is fairly attributable to the state clerk\u2019s delay. Moreover, while Rivers\u2019 lack of education may have delayed his efforts to vacate his state conviction, the <em>Johnson </em>court rejected similar grounds as an excuse for delay, reiterating that \u201cprocedural ignorance [has never been accepted] as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statute\u2019s clear policy calls for promptness.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1582.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">Although <em>Johnson </em>makes clear that Rivers properly filed his \u00a7 2255 petition within one year of receiving notice of the state court\u2019s vacatur of his prior conviction, Rivers\u2019 delay in seeking state habeas relief, along with his failure to set forth sufficient grounds that could excuse his delay, precludes a finding that he exercised due diligence. After consideration in light of <em>Johnson, </em>we thus affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rivers\u2019 petition based on Rivers\u2019 failure to exercise due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1349-7\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AICd\">concurring specially, in which WILSON, Circuit Judge, joins:</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\">I join the court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to address the government\u2019s argument that Rivers\u2019 appeal waiver precludes any collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">Rivers\u2019 plea agreement included a provision that waived his rights to appeal his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 or to appeal his sentence on any other ground. However, neither Rivers\u2019 plea agreement nor the district court\u2019s plea colloquy so much as mentioned Rivers\u2019 right to bring a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, much less included a waiver of such rights. I thus reject the government\u2019s contention that Rivers\u2019 appeal should be dismissed based on the presence of an appeal waiver, \u2022as Rivers did not expressly and knowingly waive his rights to collaterally attack his sentence. <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>32 F.3d 431, 432 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that \u201ca plea agreement does not waive the right to bring a \u00a7 2255 motion unless it does so expressly. The government gets what it bargains for but nothing more.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201ca waiver of collateral attack rights brought under \u00a7 2255 is generally enforceable where the waiver is expressly stated in the plea agreement\u201d); <em>see also Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that petitioner waived right to bring \u00a7 2255 motion where the plea agreement\u2019s plain language expressly informed him that he was waiving his right to bring a collateral attack).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
