The district court calculated Garcia\u2019s base offense level based on relevant conduct involving 48,651.7 kilograms of marijuana. Garcia argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court\u2019s drug quantity finding violated the Sixth Amendment and <em>United States v. </em>Booker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because he did not plea or admit to the relevant conduct and it was not found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-24\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Booker </em>struck down 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1), thus rendering the Guidelines advisory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-25\">Garcia did not expressly object in the district court based on <em>Booker </em>or the Sixth Amendment. Consequently, our review is for plain error only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We may correct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>error that the appellant failed to raise in the district court only if there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If these conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error only if \u201cthe error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The first two prongs of the plain error test are clearly met in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to satisfy the third prong, Garcia must demonstrate that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we have held that an appellant has a \u201cdifficult burden to establish that the error affected his substantial rights,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we are persuaded that Garcia has done so in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">At Garcia\u2019s sentencing, the court discussed at length the difficulties of long prison sentences and their affect on families. The court noted that Garcia was a husband and father of small children, and opined: \u201cYou [Garcia] are a young man and I would prefer to sentence you to a lesser sentence than required under the guidelines but I\u2019m going to follow the law and assess punishment appropriately based on the circumstances that are presented before me.\u201d The court then proceeded to sentence Garcia to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 at the very bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. We have held that this type of evidence indicates a likelihood that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, we find that Garcia has carried his burden under the fourth prong of the plain error test.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s sentence must be vacated and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">Because the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination requires resentencing, we do not reach Garcia\u2019s other claimed sentencing errors and leave to the district court\u2019s discretion whether it will impose the same sentence with the same departures or enhancements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Garcia\u2019s argument that a greater sentence at resentenc-ing would implicate ex post facto concerns is premature, and we do not address it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-15\">. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-29\">. <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-26\">.
