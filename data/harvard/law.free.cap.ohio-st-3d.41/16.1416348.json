In denying the writ of mandamus, the court of appeals determined that there was insufficient evidence that the board\u2019s decision was motivated, in whole or in part, by vindictive considerations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-19\">A writ of mandamus will not issue when the relator does not demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to the relief sought. <em>State, ex rel. Westchester Estates, Inc., </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42, 15 O.O. 3d 53, 399 N.E. 2d 81. The only evidence that supports appellant\u2019s argument is the fact that appellant did, in fact, file a lawsuit and the parole board did deny him parole thereafter, as alleged in his affidavit filed in support of the complaint in mandamus. However, nothing else in the record before this court demonstrates that a board member inquired as to the lawsuit or used that information<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in reaching the decision to deny parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Accordingly, appellant has failed to establish a clear right to the relief prayed for, and the judgment of the court of appeals; denying the writ, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.

There is substantial reason to believe that, due to the serious nature of the crime, the release of the inmate into society would create undue risk to public safety, or that, due to the serious nature of the crime, the release of the inmate would not further the interest of justice nor be consistent with the welfare and security of society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\" ** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">\u201c4.
