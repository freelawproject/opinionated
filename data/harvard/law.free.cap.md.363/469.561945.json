Thompson, Sr., was admitted in error, the Board of Law Examiners (the \u201cpetitioner\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d), recommends that this Court, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar, revoke the respondent\u2019s license to practice law. We shall accept the petitioner\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The respondent, then a member of the District of Columbia Bar, filed his Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire and Affidavit For Admission to the Bar of the State of Maryland on December 29, 1983. He took and passed the Summer 1985 Maryland Out of State Attorneys Bar Examination. Scheduled to be admitted to the Bar on December 12, 1985, he filed, on November 27, 1985, an updating oath with the petitioner, in which he certified that the information in his Questionnaire and Affidavit continued to be correct and that there had been no change. Two days before being admitted to the Bar, however, on December 10, 1985, in a telephone conversation with the Secretary of the Board, the respondent disclosed that he was the subject of disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia. He further advised that jurisdiction\u2019s Disciplinary Board had recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for six months, a decision that he had appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, whose decision was then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As a result, by letter to the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, dated December 11, 1985, the Board noted an exception to the respondent\u2019s admission. The respondent was not admitted, as he was advised he would not be. The Board Secretary also reported that he asked the respondent to obtain copies of the documents, including the complaint and subsequent pleadings or responses, on file with the District of Columbia Grievance Committee and the ultimate decision of the Committee. He requested that the respondent\u2019s entire file be returned to the Board for further action pending the disposition of the respondent\u2019s case by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>file was returned, but apparently no exception was noted on the Order Nisi at the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Subsequently, by letter dated April 1, 1986, the Board acknowledged the receipt from the respondent of certain documentation concerning the respondent\u2019s case and formally requested him to \u201cofficially advise this office regarding the disciplinary matter pending against you at such time when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reaches a decision in the case and furnish a full copy of the Court\u2019s Opinion.\u201d The respondent did not respond to the letter or supply the documentation requested. Moreover, the record does not reflect the disposition of the disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The record does reflect that the respondent was the subject of other disciplinary proceedings in the District of Columbia as a result of a representation between January 1986 and August 1987. <em>See In Re: Thompson, </em>583 A.2d 1006, 1009 (D.C.App.1990) (Appendix). He was disbarred by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, effective January 14, 1991. <em>Id. </em>at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on February 3, 1998. He did not file another Questionnaire and Affidavit, update the Oath of Out of State Attorney that he filed on November. 27, 1985, take another Bar examination or supply the information requested in the April 1,1986 letter from the Board. Rather, according to the respondent, he contacted the Board by telephone in January 1998 to inquire concerning the date that he successfully passed the attorneys\u2019 examination. When he was informed, he asked about the procedures for admission and was told that certain documents would be forwarded to him for completion. The letter the respondent received from the Clerk of the Court of Appeals indicated that his petition for admission had been approved by the Court of Appeals on the favorable recommendation of the Board. It also apprised the respondent of the mail-in procedure for being sworn and enrolled as an attorney: appear before a notary to complete the statutory oath of attorneys, a copy of which was enclosed, and return the oath, along with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>check or money order, payable to order of the Clerk of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">It was not until September 27, 2000 that the Board became aware of the respondent\u2019s disbarred status in the District of Columbia. At that time, Bar Counsel informed the Secretary of the Board of that fact. Subsequently, after speaking with the respondent and unsuccessfully urging him to consent to disbarment, the petitioner, in a report to the Court, contained in a letter dated November 2, 2000, conveyed to this Court the recommendation that is the subject of this opinion. In consideration of the report and recommendation of the Board, the Court, on November 15, 2000, issued an order for the respondent to show cause why his license to practice law should not be revoked. Thereafter, after consideration of the petitioner\u2019s answer to the Show Cause and the respondent\u2019s response, the Court, on January 5, 2001, immediately suspended the petitioner from the practice of law, pending a hearing before the Court. That hearing was held March 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Rule 13 (a) of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland addresses the eligibility of out-of-state attorneys for admission to the Maryland Bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201c(a) Eligibility for admission by attorney examination\u2014 Generally. A person is eligible for admission to the Bar of this State under this Rule if the person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2ln\">\u201c(1) is a member of the Bar of a state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201c(2) has passed a written bar examination in a state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u201c(3) has the professional experience required by this Rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201c(4) successfully completes the attorney examination prescribed by this Rule; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201c(5) possesses the good moral character and fitness necessary for the practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Thus, to be eligible for admission to the bar of this State, in addition to the other criteria prescribed by the Rule, an out-of-state attorney must be \u201ca member of the Bar of a state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-U\">The procedure by which a successful candidate for admission to the bar is recommended to the Court and his or her admission is ratified is prescribed by Rule 10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rule 13(n),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as to out-of-state attorneys. After receiving from the Board a report of the names of the successful candidates, along with the Board\u2019s recommendation for admission, <em>see </em>Rule 10(a), the Court shall enter, and publish in the Maryland Register at least once before ratification, an order, containing the names and addresses of all persons recommended for admission, including those conditionally recommended. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Court shall also fix a date at least 30 days after the filing of the report for ratification of the Board\u2019s recommendations. <em>See </em>Rule 10(b). This allows exceptions, which may be filed with the Court before ratification of the Board\u2019s report and, for good cause shown, thereafter and before the candidate\u2019s admission to the Bar, relating to any relevant matter. <em>See </em>Rule 10(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cOn expiration of the time fixed in the order entered pursuant to section (b) of this Rule, the Board\u2019s report and recommendations shall be ratified subject to the conditions stated in the recommendations and to any exceptions noted under section (c) of this Rule.\u201d Rule 10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The petitioner argues that the foregoing evidence is clear, the respondent was admitted to the Maryland bar in error, since he was not a member of the District of Columbia Bar or that of any State, an eligibility requirement for admission, <em>see </em>Rule 13(a)(1), at the time when he was admitted. Therefore, on that basis, it urges the Court to revoke the respondent\u2019s license to practice law. The petitioner relies on Rule 21, governing suspension or revocation of the license of attorneys ineligible for admission. That Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">\u201cIf an attorney admitted to the Bar of this State is discovered to have been ineligible for admission under circumstances that do not warrant disbarment or other disciplinary proceedings, the Court of Appeals may, upon a recommendation by the Board and after notice and opportunity to be heard, suspend or revoke the attorney\u2019s license. In the case of a suspension, the Court shall specify in its order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>duration of the suspension and the conditions upon which the suspension may be lifted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The respondent sees the matter quite differently. As he sees it, the critical times for purposes of Rule 13 eligibility are when the required petition for the attorney\u2019s examination is filed and when that examination is passed. He maintains that, \u201c[a] fair reading of Rule 13 in its entirety demonstrates that the provisions refer to the eligibility of an out-of-state attorney proving through a petition that he is qualified to take the examination through which he could be admitted as a member of the Maryland Bar.\u201d That the Rules Governing Admission to the Maryland Bar do not have any provisions requiring the updating of the application is, the respondent believes, supportive of that position. Moreover, the respondent stresses that he relied on the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, who sent him the oath and the petitioner, who recommended him for admission, for the legality of his admission. Acknowledging his disbarment in the District of Columbia, \u201can event which occurred in his professional life over seven years before his admission to the Maryland Bar and of which [he] is not proud, but for which he has suffered the consequences,\u201d he asks this Court not to treat this case as if it is one of reciprocal discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The respondent also questions whether there are any provisions in the Rules, noting that the petitioner has not pointed to any, that prevents a disbarred lawyer, who passed the examination prior to disbarment in another jurisdiction, from being admitted in Maryland. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cThe only theory advanced by the Board, is that the admission was in error. In the instant case, the Respondent was admitted almost thirteen years after passing the examination and over seven years after being disbarred in another jurisdiction. He made no representation to the Board, in order to induce the Board\u2019s recommendation to the Court of Appeals for his admission. The rules on their face are intended to prevent such an attorney, who files a petition after disbarment to take the attorney\u2019s examination, not an attorney similarly situated as the Respondent, who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>passed the examination prior to disbarment, and who is sworn in several years after disbarment without misrepresenting his status either orally or in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Finally, the respondent asserts that, rather than admitted in error, he was recommended for admission by the Board and that this Court has the discretion to consider the totality of the circumstances and decline to revoke his license, which he earnestly urges the Court to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Rule 13(a) is clear. It speaks in terms of eligibility and it enumerates five criteria, all of which must be met. Thus, to be eligible for admission to the Maryland Bar, it is necessary that a person applying comply with each of the eligibility requirements. Consequently, if a person fully complies with each of requirements (2) through (5), that person would still not be eligible for admission to the bar unless he or she also met criterion (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">And compliance must coincide with the time of admission. There is simply nothing in the rule to support the respondent\u2019s contention that eligibility need only exist when the application is filed and when the examination is passed. Indeed, just the opposite seems to be what the Rule contemplates. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Keehan, </em>311 Md. 161, 167, 533 A.2d 278, 281 (1987), for example, we commented on the purpose of the predecessor to Rule 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAB\">\u201cRule 14 is designed to afford a benefit to lawyers who have practiced lawfully for at least a minimum period of time. The benefit occurs because a lawyer who meets the Rule\u2019s practice requirements is excused from taking the comprehensive two-day bar examination normally required of those who seek admission to practice in Maryland. Instead, the out-of-state-attorney applicant needs to submit to a test of but three hours duration, with subject matter limited to practice and procedure and professional ethics. Board [of Law Examiners] Rule 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cThe reason for this privilege rests on the assumption that a lawyer who has regularly engaged in the practice of law, as a chief means of earning the lawyer\u2019s living over a period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>years, has sufficient legal knowledge to demonstrate at least minimum competence; hence, it is not necessary to apply the rigors of the full examination to make that determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We agree with the petitioner; when the respondent was admitted to the Maryland bar, he was ineligible for admission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was no longer a member of the District of Columbia Bar and, whether or not he met the professional experience prong of the qualifying criteria, it is arguable that he also does not have the requisite moral character. He was disbarred for violating District of Columbia Disciplinary Rules 9-103(A) (failure to preserve identity of client funds)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 1-102(A)(4) (dishonesty involving misappropriation of client funds).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is well settled in this State that misappropriation, by an attorney, of funds entrusted to his or her care \u201cis an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>infected with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 84, 710 A.2d 926, 934 (1998); (quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Williams, </em>335 Md. 458, 474, 644 A.2d 490, 497 (1994); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Casalino, </em>335 Md. 446, 644 A.2d 43, 46 (1994); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 417, 614 A.2d 955, 958 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 969 (1988)). We also agree with the petitioner that the appropriate remedy is the revocation of the respondent\u2019s license to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We are not persuaded by the respondent\u2019s arguments. To be sure, Rule 13 reaches the person who applies to take the out-of-state examination after disbarment. But in our view, it also applies to the person who applies to take the examination and passes it, but is disbarred before being admitted. In both cases, there is necessarily a failure at the time of admission of one of the essential requirements for admission, membership in the bar of a state, and, in both cases, there is a failure to disclose the material fact of the disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The respondent makes much of the fact that he sought the direction of the Clerk of the Court of Appeals and, when he received it, he did no more than follow it. He discounts, however, the role that his failure to disclose the material fact of his intervening disbarment played in the advice he was given. It is, of course, true, as we have seen, that neither Rule 10 nor any other of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Maryland imposes a time limitation on the viability of an admission recommendation by the Board. Nevertheless, had either the Clerk or the Board been informed, and thus made aware, of the respondent\u2019s intervening disbarment, it would not have been powerless to stop the respondent\u2019s admission. Indeed, it is safe to say that either would have \u201cexcepted\u201d to the respondents admission and brought the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>matter to the Court\u2019s attention, even though the time for excepting to the recommendation for admission had long since passed. The Court, pursuant to Rule 10(b), could, and undoubtedly would, have entertained the \u201cexception,\u201d for failure .to qualify for admission at the time of admission, certainly would seem to constitute \u201cgood cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The respondent has repeatedly stated that he was under no obligation, so far as the Rules prescribed, to update his application. As to whether the rules prescribed such an obligation, he may be right. As a matter of fact, however, it is clear that the respondent had such an obligation in this case. On November 27, 1985, the respondent executed an Oath of Out Of State Attorney. The form indicated that it was \u201c[rjequired for updating Application and Character Information.\u201d Moreover, execution of the oath was required, \u201c[f]ailure to comply will necessitate that you not be recommended to the Court of Appeals for admission after successfully passing the examination pursuant to Rule 14.\u201d Most important, labeled, <em>\u201cVery Important,\u201d </em>the form advises, \u201c[t]his Oath also is of a continuing nature. You are required to update the Oath if any changes occur between the date of its execution and the date of your admission to the bar.\u201d One of the matters as to which oath was made was \u201cthat all of the matters and facts contained in my Out of State Attorney Petition and Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire and Affidavit ... are still true and correct and no changes have taken place with respect to my personal situation which would reflect unfavorably on my qualifications to be admitted as a member of the Maryland Bar.... \u201d The respondent\u2019s petition and Questionnaire identified him as a member of the District of Columbia Bar. That change alone would have been required to be reported; it certainly reflected unfavorably on the respondent\u2019s qualifications to be admitted to the Maryland Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We do agree with the respondent that this Court has the discretion to consider the totality of the circumstances and determine whether to revoke the respondent\u2019s license. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>have done so and reached a different result than that urged by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF LAW EXAMINERS IS ACCEPTED.
