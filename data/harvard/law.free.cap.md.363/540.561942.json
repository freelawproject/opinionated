Dutta, had at least two insurance policies \u2014 one was an automobile policy with respondent, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), and the other was a health insurance policy with an HMO, NYLCare. After being involved in an automobile accident on March 27, 1997, petitioner received medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>treatment, which was initially paid for by NYLCare. Petitioner filed a claim against the third party driver\u2019s liability insurer. Upon receiving a settlement check for this claim, petitioner reimbursed NYLCare pursuant to the HMO\u2019s alleged right of subrogation included in petitioner\u2019s policy agreement with NYLCare. Petitioner then submitted a claim for the amount paid for his treatment under his Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage, which was subsequently denied by State Farm. Petitioner presented one question to this Court for which we granted certiorari. We rephrase the question in order to properly address the issues presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">Does the PIP coverage at issue require State Farm to pay for petitioner\u2019s medical treatment, even though petitioner\u2019s health care provider and/or a third party, tortfeasor, actually paid the medical bills?[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We answer the question in the affirmative. We hold that the Circuit Court erred in finding that the expenses arising out of the medical treatment petitioner received at Suburban Hospital, which were initially paid for by NYLCare, were not an incurred expense for which petitioner was entitled to recover from his Personal Injury Protection coverage. We hold that the expense was incurred. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">I. Facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">On March 27, 1997, petitioner was injured when his vehicle was involved in an accident in Washington, D.C. At the time of the accident, petitioner was insured by a personal automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>bile policy through State Farm, which included PIP coverage in the amount of $10,000. He was also a member of an HMO, NYLCare, through his employer, Howard University. Petitioner underwent examination and treatment for his injuries on the day of the accident in the Emergency Room at Suburban Hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon being treated at the hospital, he signed a \u201cConsent to Treat\u201d form, which included a clause entitled \u201cAgreement to Pay for Services.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Approximately one to two months prior to the automobile accident, petitioner had suffered a heart attack for which he had received medical treatment. Because of this prior treatment, Suburban Hospital had his HMO information already on record. Unbeknownst to petitioner, Suburban Hospital and the other medical providers offering services at Suburban Hospital, submitted a claim for payment to petitioner\u2019s HMO, NYLCare, in the amount of $941.84, which was subsequently paid by the HMO to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On or about May 8, 1997, petitioner filed a claim with State Farm for payment of expenses relating to the treatment he received at Suburban Hospital for injuries sustained by him in the accident. State Farm paid $1995.00, an amount that constituted the copayment owed by petitioner to NYLCare under his HMO membership agreement; however, it withheld reimbursement of $941.84, the amount in excess of his copay for the emergency room treatment at Suburban Hospital, because that amount had been paid by NYLCare pursuant to the terms of the HMO membership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>By letter dated December 12, 1997, Healthcare Recoveries, Inc. (Healthcare)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided petitioner\u2019s attorney with an \u201cupdated Consolidated Statement of the total benefits paid/incurred by [his] client\u2019s Health Plan to date.\u201d The statement attached to the letter indicated a balance due in the amount of $941.84, a claim for services provided when petitioner was treated at the Suburban Hospital emergency room on March 27, 1997. By letter dated December 19, 1997, petitioner\u2019s attorney again requested benefits from State Farm and forwarded State Farm a copy of the letter from Healthcare accompanied by an earlier letter dated September 2, 1997, in which Healthcare requested reimbursements from petitioner for payments made by NYLCare to Suburban Hospital. State Farm advised petitioner that it would not pay him the $941.84 under his PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Petitioner had also filed a claim against the third party driver\u2019s liability insurer with regard to his bodily injuries. That case was settled. In connection with the settlement against the third party driver, NYLCare notified petitioner\u2019s attorney of petitioner\u2019s alleged subrogation responsibilities under the Member Agreement. On December 29, 1997, petitioner, through his attorney, paid NYLCare $941.84 pursuant to the subrogation clause of the Member Agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On March 22, 1999, having never received any funds from State Farm in respect to PIP coverage and almost two years after the injuries giving rise to the treatment costs were incurred, petitioner filed an action against State Farm in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Montgomery County, alleging that State Farm had failed to comply with the Personal Injury Protection provisions contained in petitioner\u2019s policy. State Farm filed a Notice of Intention to Defend and Demand Proof denying liability. The District Court awarded judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>in the amount of $941.84 plus pre-judgment interest of $494.55 and costs of $28.20 in favor of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On January 13, 2000, State Farm filed a Notice of Appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-104 and this matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. State Farm filed a Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for Judgment in which it argued: (1) that NYLCare was statutorily prohibited from recovering medical expenses from its members in excess of deductibles or copays and, therefore, petitioner did not incur medical expenses; (2) that to require PIP insurers to provide benefits for covered services contravenes the express intention of the Legislature; and (3) that State Farm is not statutorily obligated to coordinate its benefits with HMOs. Petitioner filed a Response to the Motion to Dismiss or for Judgment as well as a Motion for Summary Judgment in which he argued that: (1) NYLCare was entitled to reimbursement; (2) State Farm was both contractually and statutorily required to pay petitioner for the expenses he incurred as a result of his payment to NYLCare; and (3) the Maryland Legislature, by enacting Senate Bill 903 in 2000, allowed for the HMO to recover, through subrogation, monies paid to petitioner by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On July 10, 2000, the Circuit Court granted the Motion for Judgment filed by State Farm. In doing so, the Circuit Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">Okay. I have had occasion to review all of the pleadings and to consider the arguments of Counsel, and while it does appear to me that it is somewhat unfair I have to say that I end up being more persuaded by the logic of Mr. Redmond\u2019s [State Farm\u2019s attorney] arguments in that I don\u2019t believe that the expense in this case was an expense that Dr. Dutta incurred within the meaning of the statute, and therefore, I do not believe that there is an obligation for the PIP carrier to pay it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>My sympathies are with you, but logic tells me that Mr. Redmond is probably correct and that this is what the legislature had intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">As we indicated earlier, we disagree and, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">To resolve the issue before this Court, we must ascertain whether the cost of the emergency treatment petitioner received while at Suburban Hospital was an incurred expense for which petitioner was entitled to recover from his PIP coverage through State Farm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our decision is controlled by Maryland Code (1995, 1997 Yol.), Title 19, subtitle 5 of the Insurance Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the express language of petitioner\u2019s State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">a. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Before discussing the issue at bar, we feel it is helpful to define the purpose behind the passage of PIP legislation in Maryland. PIP coverage was first enacted by the Maryland Legislature in 1972 in order \u201cto offer those injured in an \u2018incident\u2019 with an automobile to have \u2018quick\u2019 no-fault compensation for medical bills and lost wages up to a minimum amount, generally $2,500.\u201d Robert H.B. Cawood, <em>Personal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>Injury Protection </em>\u2014 A <em>Primer, </em>2 (MICPEL) (2000). We said in <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Guaranty Corporation, </em>313 Md. 518, 532, 546 A.2d 458, 465 (1988) \u201cthat one of subtitle 35\u2019s[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] fundamental aims is the speedy provision of PIP benefits without the lengthy delays entailed by tort litigation. Such prompt payment is a basic purpose of no-fault insurance generally.\u201d We have additionally noted on numerous occasions that \u201c[t]he primary purpose [behind requiring PIP coverage] is to assure financial compensation to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to the fault of a named insured or other persons entitled to PIP benefits.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Casualty Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734, 736 (1980); <em>see Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 393, 444 A.2d 1024, 1029 (1982) (\u201cThe purpose of [PIP legislation was] to put a limited amount of money in the hands of an injured individual under certain circumstances without regard to whether another person is liable for the injuries which the claimant sustained.\u201d); <em>see also Bishop v. State Farm, </em>360 Md. 225, 230, 757 A.2d 783, 785 (2000); <em>Clay v. GEICO, </em>356 Md. 257, 265-66, 739 A.2d 5,10 (1999); <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75-76, 517 A.2d 730, 733 (1986). Additionally, in <em>Insurance Commissioner, </em>313 Md. at 532, 546 A.2d at 465, we noted \u201c[t]his accent on rapid payment cannot be reconciled with an interpretation of section 512(a)[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] requiring an injured party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to exhaust third party liability claims before recovering any PIP benefits from PCIGC.\u201d PIP coverage, by its very design, attempts to avoid delays in providing monetary relief to automobile accident victims.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">b. Section 19-507</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Crucial to this analysis is section 19-507(a), which outlines when such PIP payments are payable. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAc\">(a) <em>When benefits payable. </em>\u2014 The benefits described in \u00a7 19-505 of this subtitle shall be payable without regard to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">(2) any collateral source of medical, hospital, or wage continuation benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">We start our analysis with a discussion of statutory construction. When attempting to discern the intention of the Legislature in enacting a particular statute, we recently said in <em>Edgewater Liquors, Inc. v. Liston, </em>349 Md. 803, 709 A.2d 1301 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cIn construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d Legislative intent generally is derived from the words of the statute at issue. \u201cWe are not constrained, however, by ... \u2018the literal or usual meaning\u2019 of the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>at issue.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, we do not read statutory language \u2018in isolation or out of context [but construe it] in light of the legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 807-08, 709 A.2d at 1303 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). We commented in an earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agj-dedup-0\">When we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code. We may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">... Thus, in <em>State v. One 1983 Chevrolet Van, </em>309 Md. 327, 524 A.2d 51 (1987), .... [although we did not describe any of the statutes involved in that case as ambiguous or uncertain, we did search for legislative purpose or meaning \u2014 what Judge Orth, writing for the Court, described as \u201cthe legislative scheme.\u201d____ <em>See also Ogrinz v. James, </em>309 Md. 381, 524 A.2d 77 (1987), in which we considered legislative history (a committee report) to assist in construing legislation that we did not identify as ambiguous or of uncertain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-9\"><em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987); <em>see Laznovsky v. Laznovsky, </em>357 Md. 586, 606-07, 745 A.2d 1054, 1065 (2000); <em>State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 717-19, 720 A.2d 311, 315-16 (1998); <em>see also Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 115-17, 753 A.2d 41, 48-49 (2000); <em>Riemer v. Columbia Medical Plan, </em>358 Md. 222, 235-36, 747 A.2d 677, 684-85 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The mandatory language of section 19-507(a) emphasizes that petitioner can recover from his HMO, NYLCare, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>well as PIP benefits from his automobile insurer, State Farm. \u201cThe benefits described in \u00a7 19-505 of this subtitle <em>shall be payable without regard to </em>... <em>any collateral source of medical, hospital, or wage continuation benefits </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Legislature could not have expressed its intent any clearer \u2014 an insurer must pay PIP benefits <em>regardless of any collateral source of benefits </em>\u2014 i.e., regardless of whether a health insurance provider, HMO, or other collateral source provides benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> NYLCare\u2019s coverage of petitioner\u2019s medical bills for his treatment at Suburban Hospital is exactly this \u2014 a collateral source of medical and hospital benefits. If the Legislature had meant to exclude members of HMOs that provide collateral benefits from PIP coverage, language to that effect would have been included in either section 19-505, section 19-507, or section 19-513. To interpret this language in any other way would render section 19-507(a)(2) meaningless. When we examine the plain meaning of the words of a statute, \u201c[o]ur examination of such words is guided by the principle that we should read \u2018pertinent parts of the legislative language together, giving effect to all of those parts if we can, and rendering no part of the law surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holman v. Kelly Catering, Inc., </em>334 Md. 480, 485, 639 A.2d 701, 704 (1994) (quoting <em>Sinai Hosp. v. Department of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382, 388 (1987)); <em>see Giant Food, Inc. v. Department of Labor, </em>356 Md. 180, 194, 738 A.2d 856, 863 (1999). State Farm\u2019s argument that petitioner cannot recover both PIP benefits and collateral medical and hospital benefits demonstrates complete disregard for the plain language of section 19-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Moreover, <em>State Farm v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>283 Md. 663, 392 A.2d 1114 (1978) involved facts that, with one important statutory exception, were remarkably similar to the facts at issue here. Patrick Morris, the insured in that case, was injured by a tortfeasor while he was driving his own vehicle at work. He sought, and received, \u201cworkmen\u2019s\u201d compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>benefits. Subsequently, Morris received a settlement from the negligent third party. Out of that settlement, he reimbursed the \u201cworkmen\u2019s\u201d compensation carrier. He then filed a claim for PIP benefits from State Farm. State Farm reduced the amount of his benefits by the amount he had reimbursed the compensation carrier. Morris argued that because he had reimbursed the carrier, \u201che had not \u2018recovered\u2019 workmen\u2019s compensation benefits within the meaning of \u00a7 543(d)[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 392 A.2d at 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">There we held, because of the express provisions in section 539(d) relating to workmen\u2019s compensation, Morris was <em>not </em>entitled to recover PIP benefits to the extent he had recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. In contrast, Title 19, subtitle 5 contains no exception for HMO benefits or reimbursements. The statute applicable to the case <em>sub judice </em>states that PIP benefits are payable \u201cwithout regard to ... any collateral source of medical, hospital, or wage continuation benefits.\u201d As evidenced by section 19-513(e), the Legislature has clearly demonstrated that it knows how to exempt certain benefits from the requirement for payment of PIP benefits. It has elected to do so in respect to worker\u2019s compensation benefits; however, it has not elected to do so in respect to HMO benefits. As we noted in <em>West American Insurance Company v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 475, 723 A.2d 1, 10-11 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqc-dedup-1\">This Court has consistently held that exclusions from statutorily mandated insurance coverage not expressly authorized by the Legislature generally will not be recognized. <em>See, e.g., Enterprise v. Allstate, </em>341 Md. 541, 547, 671 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>509, 512 (1996) (\u201cWhere the Legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute\u201d); <em>Van Horn v. Atlantic Mutual, </em>334 Md. 669, 686, 641 A.2d 195, 203 (1994) (\u201cthis Court has generally held invalid insurance policy limitations, exclusions and exceptions to the statutorily required coverages which were not expressly authorized by the Legislature\u201d); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hart, </em>327 Md. 526, 531-532, 611 A.2d 100, 102 (1992); <em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 622, 552 A.2d 889, 891 (1989); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. USF &amp; G, </em>314 Md. 131, 141, 550 A.2d 69, 74 (1988); <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., </em>313 Md. 701, 704, 548 A.2d 135, 137 (1988) (\u201cAs a matter of statutory construction, where the Legislature has required specified coverages in a particular category of insurance, and has provided for certain exceptions or exclusions to the required coverages, additional exclusions are generally not permitted\u201d); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 239, 528 A.2d 912, 915 (1987) (\u201cwe will not imply exclusions nor recognize exclusions beyond those expressly enumerated by the legislature\u201d); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees, </em>302 Md. 352, 358-359, 488 A.2d 166, 169 (1985) (\u201cwe will not insert exclusions from the required coverages beyond those expressly set forth by the Legislature\u201d); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. [721,] 730, 436 A.2d [465,] 471 (\u201cconditions or limitations in an uninsured motorist endorsement, which provide less than the coverage required by the statute, are void\u201d); <em>Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 160-161, 416 A.2d 734, 739 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The rules of statutory construction relating to statutory provisions that create exceptions or exemptions from other statutory provisions reinforces our view that no other exceptions were intended. It is not our proper function to add to the statute another class of exemptions. That is a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Payment of the medical expenses arising out of petitioner\u2019s automobile accident by NYLCare does not absolve respondent of its duty under the statute to provide PIP benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>petitioner. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>respondent was statutorily-mandated by section 19-507 to provide PIP benefits to petitioner regardless of the fact that he also received health insurance benefits from his HMO, NYLCare.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">c. Section 19-505 and State Farm\u2019s Policy</p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-0\">Section 19-505, titled \u201cPersonal injury protection coverage \u2014 In general,\u201d is also helpful in our analysis.

We disagree with this argument. <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>768 (6th Ed.1990) defines \u201cincur\u201d as \u201c[t]o become liable or subject to, to bring down upon oneself, as to incur debt, danger, displeasure and penalty, and to become through one\u2019s own action liable or subject to.\u201d Pursuant to this definition, expenses were incurred on petitioner\u2019s behalf at Suburban Hospital through treatment arising out of injuries sustained in an automobile accident when he received treatment at the hospital and/or, as we discussed, <em>supra, </em>he signed the agreement to pay for services and was subsequently provided medical care by Suburban Hospital.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See supra, </em>note 3. Looking at the precise wording of both section 19-505(b) and the State Farm policy \u2014 neither expressly defines <em>who </em>needs to incur the expense. Both merely express that an expense must be \u201cincurred.\u201d This language presents to us one of the primary issues of the case at bar, an issue of first impression for this Court<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 whether the statute requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>it be the <em>insured </em>who must pay the expense in order for the insured\u2019s PIP coverage to apply. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">A number of our sister states have had the opportunity to directly address whether the value of medical services provided by an HMO or other health care provider constitutes an \u201cincurred\u201d expense under the medical payments clause of a motor vehicle insurance policy. One leading case is <em>Kopp v. Home Mutual Insurance Company, </em>6 Wis.2d 53, 94 N.W.2d 224 (1959). In that case, Herman Kopp was injured in an automobile accident. He was hospitalized and his expenses were paid for by Blue Cross with whom he had a health insurance policy. He later submitted the equivalent of a PIP claim to Home Mutual, with whom he had automobile insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>anee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Home Mutual refused to pay Kopp based on the \u201cground that [Kopp] never incurred any expense for his hospitalization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 94 N.W.2d at 225. The court ultimately held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">The defendant contends that, under the above-quoted policy provisions, it is a condition precedent to the insured\u2019s right of recovery upon the policy for his hospitalization that he shall first have incurred a debt for the same. It is clear from the undisputed facts that no such debt was incurred by the plaintiff to pay for such hospitalization. However, a debt was incurred on the part of Blue Cross to pay such expense to Luther Hospital, and the plaintiff had paid quarterly premiums to Blue Cross as consideration for Blue Cross undertaking so to do. Thus expense was incurred for hospital services furnished <em>\u2018to or for\u2019 </em>the plaintiff insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">... However, where the injured person (in this case the insured) pays a consideration to have the expense of such medical or hospital services paid without liability to such injured person, it is our considered judgment that the injured person should be permitted to recover such expense under the policy clause in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 56-58, 94 N.W.2d at 225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">There are a number of cases which have followed the reasoning of <em>Kopp. </em>In <em>Feit v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company, </em>27 Cal.Rptr. 870, 209 Cal.App.2d Supp. 825 (1962), a Kaiser Foundation Health Plan member injured in an automobile accident was treated by Permanente physicians at a Kaiser Foundation hospital. As a pre-paying member of the Plan, the member was not required to, and did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>further pay specifically for the services provided. Nevertheless, the member sought to recover the value of the Kaiser services from his motor vehicle insurer under the PIP clause of his policy, and submitted with his claim a statement from Kaiser indicating the amount he <em>would have paid </em>had he not been a paying member of the Plan. His claim was denied by the insurer. On appeal, however, the Superior Court of San Francisco County (Appellate Department), found that the language contained in the medical payments clause failed to specify <em>\u201cwho </em>is required to incur the expense in order for the insured to recover for medical or hospital services supplied\u201d to an insured. <em>Id. </em>at 872, 209 Cal.App.2d Supp. at 828, quoting <em>Kopp, </em>6 Wis.2d at 57, 94 N.W.2d at 225 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The <em>Feit </em>court continued by contrasting the \u201cexpenses incurred\u201d language contained in the medical payments portion of the policy with the language contained in the liability portion of the policy, wherein the insurer agreed \u201cto pay on behalf of the insured all sums which [the insured] shall become legally obligated to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872, 209 Cal.App.2d Supp. at 828.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court observed that if the insurer had intended to limit its exposure for medical payments \u201cto such expenses as the insured should become legally liable to pay,\u201d the insurer would have employed the same language in the medical payment\u2019s portion as it employed in the liability portion. <em>Id. </em>The court deemed the insurer\u2019s deliberate use of different language in the medical payments portion of the policy to indicate that \u201cthe insurer intended to pay for medical expenses incurred, irrespective of by whom, and whether or not the insured was legally obligated to pay them.\u201d <em>Id; see State Farm v.

That rationale is no less relevant under the circumst\u00e1nces here present. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>section 19-505 and State Farm\u2019s PIP clause both fail to specify who is required to incur an expense before the insured is entitled to recover PIP benefits for medical or hospital services received as a result of an automobile acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>dent. State Farm\u2019s argument that petitioner is not entitled to PIP benefits because he did not \u201cincur\u201d expenses simply does not pass muster. We agree with the rationale provided by <em>Shanafelt v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>217 Mich.App. 625, 638, 552 N.W.2d 671, 676 (1996), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>564 N.W.2d 899 (1997), which astutely summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">The primary definition of the word \u201cincur\u201d is \u201cto become liable for.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1995). Obviously, plaintiff became liable for her medical expenses when she accepted medical treatment. The fact that plaintiff had contracted with a health insurance company to compensate her for her medical expenses, or to pay directly the health care provider on her behalf, does not alter the fact that she was obligated to pay those expenses. Therefore, one may not reasonably maintain that plaintiff did not incur expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Clearly, an expense was incurred on petitioner\u2019s behalf. We hold that in order to fall under the scope of section 19-505 and State Farm\u2019s policy, the expense need merely be incurred\u2014 regardless of whether it is the insured, the insured\u2019s health insurer, the insured\u2019s health maintenance organization, or any other collateral source of benefits, who ultimately pays the bill.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, State Farm was both statutorily mandated by section 19-505 and contractually obligated under its policy to provide petitioner with PIP benefits. State Farm\u2019s argument to the contrary can be seen as an attempt to avoid payment of-obligations, which it contractually agreed to pay. As <em>Feit, </em>27 Cal.Rptr. at 872, 209 Cal.App.2d Supp. at 829, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">The existence of pre-paid medical, hospitalization and funeral plans is a matter of common knowledge and is certainly known to the insurance industry. If an insurer does not wish to honor claims of the type involved here it should exclude them specifically so that an insured with additional medical or hospital coverage would know that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>is receiving less coverage for his premium dollar than some other insured who is without outside benefits.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We interpret the language of section 19-505 and the State Farm policy to require only for expenses to be incurred\u2014 there is no language mandating that it must be the insured who pays the bills.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that when petitioner was admitted to Suburban Hospital, received medical treatment and signed an agreement to pay expenses, an expense was incurred on his behalf upon which the granting of PIP benefits was both appropriate and mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">We hold that the Circuit Court erred in finding that the expenses arising out of the medical treatment petitioner received at Suburban Hospital, which was initially paid for by his HMO, were not an incurred expense by petitioner for which he was entitled to recover from his PIP coverage. Because the treatment and subsequent billing for his injuries arising out of the accident incurred within the three-year period, petitioner satisfied all of the requirements to be eligible for PIP coverage under sections 19-505, 19-507, and the express wording of the State Farm policy. In keeping with the language of the statutes and petitioner\u2019s policy with State Farm, under the facts of the case at bar: (1) an expense was incurred on petitioner\u2019s behalf at Suburban Hospital arising out of his automobile accident on March 27, 1997; (2) PIP benefits are to be paid by State Farm regardless of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>that NYLCare, as a collateral source of medical benefits, initially paid in respect to these expenses; and (3) State Farm is mandated to provide petitioner with such PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; RESPONDENT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">.

Both parties attempt to make this case more difficult and involved than it need be.

Title 19, subtitle 5 of the Insurance Article ... sets forth the kinds of primary coverages that motor vehicle insurers are required to offer in Maryland policies.

Therefore, State Farm\u2019s argument that it is not responsible to compensate for PIP benefits when the cost of treatment is covered by an insured\u2019s primary health coverage can be seen as contrary to public policy. As we discussed, <em>supra </em>and <em>infra, </em>the general statutory scheme behind sections 19-505 through 19-507 is to provide quick no-fault compensation without the delay of court proceedings. Under State Farm's rationale, a primarily liable PIP insurer might be tempted to delay in the provision of benefits in the hope that an FIMO or other health insurance provider will pay the claim, as petitioner\u2019s HMO did in the case at bar. Under respondent\u2019s view, this would relieve respondent of its obligation to pay PIP benefits. Because this practice could possibly lead to the delay of quick no-fault compensation to victims of automobile accidents, it is clearly contrary to the public policy favoring prompt payment of PIP benefits. <em>See Bishop v. State Farm, </em>360 Md. 225, 238, 757 A.2d 783, 790 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">. Except for worker's compensation benefits.

As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>other than the benefits expressly covered by the section, section 19-513 does not apply to \"any collateral source of medical, hospital, or wage continuation benefits\u201d such as the benefits provided by NYLCare in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\">.

Although we have not had an opportunity to directly address the meaning of the word \"incurred\u201d in the context of this statute, the position we took in respect to damages in a negligence case we decided in 1954 is instructive. In <em>Plank v. Summers, </em>203 Md. 552, 102 A.2d 262 (1954), three members of the United States Navy were injured in an automobile accident on U.S. Route 301 in Prince George\u2019s County. They were subsequently treated for their injuries at the National Naval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Hospital. Because they received medical treatment without charge due to their membership in the Armed Services, the trial court ruled that they \"could not recover compensatory damages for services for which they were not required to pay....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 102 A.2d at 263. At issue in <em>Plank </em>was \"whether the jury should have been allowed to consider and to award [Plank <em>et. all], </em>the reasonable value of the hospital and medical services rendered to them without charge or imposition of liability by a United States Navy hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 102 A.2d at 264. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">Here also it might well be considered that medical and hospital services supplied by the Government to these members of the United States Navy were part of the compensation to them for services rendered, and therefore that by their service in the Navy they had paid for these. If, by their services, the appellants paid for the medical and hospital expenses, certainly the value of these are proper items for the jury to consider in arriving at the amount of damages to be paid by the appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 562, 102 A.2d at 267. We ultimately held that a jury was entitled to consider, as an element of damages, the value of medical services furnished to the servicemen. It is significant that we noted that medical services supplied by the federal government to members of the armed forces could be considered part of a compensation package that servicemen receive in exchange for military service. We recognized that the medical services were not gratuitous, but rather paid for by the servicemen through their service to their country. Thus, the value of the medical services were a proper item for the jury to consider when assessing damages. In so holding, we recognized that even though the United States Navy technically covered the costs relating to the servicemen\u2019s emergency treatment, the costs were still incurred on their behalf. Similarly, although NYLCare paid the initial bill from Suburban Hospital, the costs were still incurred on petitioner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">. The medical payments clause in the insurance policy at issue in <em>Kopp, supra, </em>and several of the cases cited, <em>infra, </em>mirror the language of the clause included in State Farm\u2019s policy in the case at bar. In <em>Kopp, </em>6 Wis.2d at 56, 94 N.W.2d at 225, the policy read that the insurer agreed \"[t]o pay all reasonable expenses incurred within one year from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, X-ray and dental services, including prosthetic devices, and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing, and funeral services....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. The liability coverage of State Farm\u2019s insurance policy in the case <em>sub judice </em>mirrors the liability portion of the policy at issue in <em>Feit, </em>and obligates State Farm under its liability coverage, as contrasted to its PIP coverage, to \"pay damages which an <em>insured </em>becomes legally liable to pay.\u201d Given Maryland's strong policy that one of the purposes of PIP coverage is to provide prompt and speedy payment on a no-fault basis, whether \"legally liable to pay\u201d language as to PIP coverage would satisfy the requirements of the Maryland statute is doubtful. That issue, however, is not before us in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">. Other than Worker\u2019s Compensation Benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">. We recognize that, generally, in Maryland, State Farm could not exclude such claims without violating section 19-507, discussed, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">. Because neither the statute nor the policy pinpoint who must \"incur\u201d the expense, we do not need to determine who actually \"incurred\u201d the expense in this case, because it makes no difference. It seems more appropriate that the expense need be incurred on the insured\u2019s behalf or as the <em>Kopp </em>court stated \"to or for\" the insured. We do note, however, that upon accepting treatment, and also upon signing the Consent to Treat form with the agreement to pay clause, that petitioner personally assumed responsibility for the medical expenses and thus, if such an evaluation was necessary, personally incurred the expense at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
