We shall not reach any of Petitioner\u2019s other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">While on routine patrol the evening of 21 January 1999, two Maryland State troopers, Sergeant Michael Lewis and Corporal Gary Bromwell, observed three vehicles traveling southbound on Route 13 in Wicomico County, Maryland, approximately five miles from the Delaware state line, in what appeared to the troopers to be a procession. The troopers stopped the middle and end vehicles for following too closely for safe operation during inclement weather.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The troopers each attended to an automobile: Corporal Bromwell gave the driver of the end vehicle a warning and allowed him to continue on his way. The present case arises from the series of events that occurred during the interaction of mainly Sergeant Lewis with the driver, Kendrick Charity, Petitioner\u2019s co-defendant, and the passenger, Sean Julian White (Petitioner), of the middle automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">After informing Charity why he was stopped, Lewis requested his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. Charity provided a North Carolina license and registration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Observing that Petitioner was sitting in the front passenger seat, but not wearing a seat belt, Lewis asked Petitioner for his driver\u2019s license as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner proffered to Lewis a New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>driver\u2019s license. During this interaction, Lewis noticed a Chesapeake Bay Bridge tunnel toll receipt, with a date of 20 January 1999 and a time of 20:09 hours (8:09 PM), on the center console, and an overwhelming pine scent emitted by dozens<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of pine tree-shaped air fresheners hanging from the car\u2019s rear view mirror. Testifying that he \u201cstood near the driver\u2019s door for a very short period because [he] was literally having difficulty talking because of the overwhelming odor,\u201d Lewis asked Charity to step to the rear of the car. Once there, Lewis proceeded to question him about his immediate journey. Charity indicated that he and Petitioner had just spent a week \u201cup north\u201d and were on their way to Charlotte, North Carolina. Observing that Charity avoided eye contact with him, Lewis also remarked that he \u201ccould see [Charity\u2019s] carotid pulse pounding in his neck. His chest was palpitating. ... I could actually see his heart pounding through his shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Lewis testified that, while questioning Charity, he also took note of Petitioner\u2019s conduct as he sat in the car. Noticing that Petitioner rolled down his passenger-side window and left it open despite the heavy rain outside,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lewis ultimately approached Petitioner and asked about his and Charity\u2019s journey. Petitioner replied that they were coming from New York, where they had stayed for a few days, and that they were driving to Chesapeake, Virginia, to attend a relative\u2019s funeral.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner then pointed to clothing in the backseat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the car that he said he was going to wear to the funeral. During this interaction, Lewis observed that Petitioner looked straight ahead or at the side view mirror<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to watch Charity standing behind the vehicle, but not at Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Noting that both of the vehicle\u2019s occupants exhibited what Sergeant Lewis considered to be \u201cnervous\u201d behavior and that their stories were inconsistent with each other, as well as with the implication of the toll receipt, Lewis returned to speak with Charity. Wanting to continue the questioning in his patrol car because the rain storm was worsening,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lewis, as a precaution, asked Charity if he could conduct a pat-down. Charity agreed; during the pat-down, Lewis felt a suspicious object in one of Charity\u2019s pockets, leading Lewis to ask Charity what it was. In response, Charity emptied his pockets and removed, among other things, what Lewis thought to be a small bag of marijuana (later confirmed to be just that). Upon seeing the suspected drugs, Lewis, suspecting Petitioner and Charity were involved in criminal activity,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Charity that finding drugs \u201cauthorizes me to conduct a full-blown search of your vehicle.\u201d Lewis asked Petitioner to get out of the car and to stand at the rear of the vehicle alongside Charity and Corporal Bromwell<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> while Lewis searched the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Lewis searched both the passenger compartment and the trunk of Charity\u2019s car. While searching the passenger compartment, Lewis found the \u201cfuneral\u201d clothes that Petitioner had referred to earlier and two additional receipts: one, from The \u201cOriginal\u201d Guaranteed Used Tire Company, dated 20 January 1999; the other, from the Queens Mid. Tunnel, issued on 21 January 1999 at 18:20 hours (1:20 PM). While searching the vehicle\u2019s trunk, Lewis found two travel bags, one belonging to Petitioner and one to Charity, and a large, apparently factory-sealed box containing pots and pans. Lewis removed the box from the car so that he could continue to search the trunk. When he returned his attention to the box, he noticed that the factory packaging tape on the bottom of the box appeared to have been re-taped. Lewis removed the tape, opened the box, and found pots and pans in their original packaging. Upon closer inspection inside the box, however, Lewis found a large duct-taped package containing what proved to be 194 grams of cocaine. Lewis and Bromwell promptly arrested Charity and Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Petitioner was charged on 5 April 1999 with importation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>cocaine (count one),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute (count two),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> possession of cocaine (count three),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> conspiracy to import cocaine (count four),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute (count five),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and possession of paraphernalia (count six).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Petitioner was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>victed by a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County of counts one through five.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">On 29 September 1999, following sentencing, Petitioner appealed the trial court\u2019s judgments to the Court of Special Appeals. In his brief to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner raised three issues: whether the trial judge erroneously failed to strike two potential jurors for cause; whether Petitioner was unlawfully seized when the traffic stop of the vehicle in which he was riding was unconstitutionally protracted; and whether the evidence was legally sufficient to establish constructive possession on Petitioner\u2019s part of the contraband cocaine found in the trunk of the automobile in which he was riding. On 8 June 2000, finding no merit in White\u2019s argument, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the lower court\u2019s judgments. <em>White v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 640, 753 A.2d 578 (2000). Petitioner petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted on 11 September 2000. <em>White v. State, </em>360 Md. 485, 759 A.2d 230 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Petitioner, paraphrasing in his brief a question framed also in his petition for writ of certiorari, argues that his person was illegally seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Although in his brief he discusses meaningfully virtually no case law to support this assertion and concedes that he has no standing to challenge the search of Charity\u2019s vehicle because he had no possessory interest in it, Petitioner maintains that he was, nonetheless, the subject of an unlawful seizure of his person when Lewis asked him to exit Charity\u2019s vehicle. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>cause we shall decide this case on another ground, we need not decide this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In his brief, Petitioner melds issues two and three of his certiorari petition by asserting that the evidence in the record was insufficient to sustain convictions for importation, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, conspiracy to import, and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. Specifically, Petitioner submits that the State failed to meet its burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Petitioner \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessed, either actually or constructively, [194 grams of cocaine] in such a manner as to indicate his clear intent to exercise dominion and control over same .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Arguing that the State\u2019s evidence proved at most that he was a passenger in a vehicle owned by Charity, Petitioner finds support in the facts that the cocaine was located in a sealed box in the vehicle\u2019s trunk, out of plain view, and that there was no odor of drugs emanating from the trunk with which he could be charged with detecting. As to the \u201cdozens\u201d of air fresheners Lewis testified were inside the passenger compartment of the vehicle, Petitioner questions why those air fresheners, representing part of the circumstances that heightened Lewis\u2019s suspicions that the vehicle might be transporting controlled substances, were not submitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Arguing that there was sufficient evidence in the record to sustain Petitioner\u2019s convictions, the State finds succor in <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 701 A.2d 675 (1997), where we were asked to consider, among other issues, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the appellant\u2019s convictions of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute and possession of marijuana. In making this determination, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>[t]o prove control, the \u201c \u2018evidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited ... drug in the sense contemplated by the statute, <em>ie., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or direct influence over it.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 596, 463 A.2d 872, 874 (1983) (quoting <em>Garrison v. </em>State,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 272 Md. 123, 142, 321 A.2d 767, 777 (1974)); <em>see Taylor v.

State, </em>313 Md. 638, 651, 547 A.2d 1041, 1047 (1988). \u201c[S]uch knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence and by inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d at 685 (alterations in original). To prove that the record evidence supported the jury\u2019s rational inference that Petitioner possessed knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine in the trunk of Charity\u2019s vehicle, the State applies the factors utilized in <em>Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 705 A.2d 50 (1998), by the Court of Special Appeals when it determined that there was sufficient evidence to establish joint ownership of controlled substances and paraphernalia in a defendant\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">1) proximity between defendant and the contraband, 2) the fact that the contraband was within the view or otherwise within the knowledge of the defendant, 3) ownership or some possessory right in the premises or the automobile in which the contraband is found, or 4) the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the defendant was participating with others in the mutual use and enjoyment of the contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Hall, </em>119 Md.App. at 394, 705 A.2d at 58 (quoting <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 518, 275 A.2d 184, 189 (1971)). The State argues that the jury in White\u2019s ease could have drawn a reasonable inference of Petitioner\u2019s guilt from Lewis\u2019s testimony that he was overwhelmed by the odor of the air fresheners emanating from the passenger compartment of the vehicle; he believed Petitioner\u2019s statement as to the duration and purpose of the journey was inconsistent with Charity\u2019s response to the same inquiry and the toll receipts; and, he was aware that Route 13 was a \u201cmajor pipeline for criminal activity coming from. New York, which is the number one source city for cocaine traveling to other states.\u201d Brief of Respondent at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c \u2018it is not the function or duty of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d at 685 (citing <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994)). Our function is to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, <em>see id. </em>(quoting <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478, 649 A.2d at 337 (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979))), and to give \u201c \u2018due regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478, 649 A.2d at 337). While we do not re-weigh the evidence, we do determine whether the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, direct or circumstantial, which could convince a rational trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478-79, 649 A.2d at 337).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The State\u2019s case against Petitioner rested on circumstantial evidence that Petitioner was in joint and constructive possession of the cocaine found in the pots and pans box in the vehicle\u2019s trunk. <em>See id. </em>Although a conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone, a conviction may not be sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tained on proof amounting only to strong suspicion or mere probability. <em>See Taylor v. State, </em>846 Md. 452, 458, 697 A.2d 462, 465 (1997) (citing <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535-36, 573 A.2d 831, 834 (1990)). \u201c \u2018Circumstantial evidence which merely arouses suspicion or leaves room for conjecture is obviously insufficient. It must do more than raise the possibility or even the probability of guilt. [I]t must ... afford the basis for an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting 1 Underhill Criminal Evidence \u00a7 17, at 29 (6th ed.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cPossession shall mean the exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 277(s). As the State accurately noted, [t]o prove control, the \u201c \u2018evidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited ... drug in the sense contemplated by the statute, <em>i.e., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or direct influence over it.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d at 685 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 596, 463 A.2d 872, 874 (1983) (quoting <em>Garrison v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>272 Md. 123, 142, 321 A.2d 767, 777 (1974))); <em>see Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 457-58, 697 A.2d 462, 465 (1997). Moreover, Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court in <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988), concluded that \u201can individual would not be deemed to exercise \u2018dominion or control\u2019 over an object about which he is unaware. Knowledge of the presence of an object is normally a prerequisite to exercising dominion and control.\u201d <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 649, 547 A.2d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In <em>Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 697 A.2d 462 (1997), police, after smelling marijuana in a hallway, entered a motel room rented by Taylor and four friends. <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 455, 697 A.2d at 463. The police saw clouds of smoke, smelling like marijuana, wafting in the room and, while searching the room, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>discovered bags of marijuana and a packet of rolling papers inside two carrying bags. <em>Id. </em>Taylor, whom the police found lying on the floor asleep or feigning sleep, was charged with possession of the marijuana found in the bags. <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 456, 697 A.2d at 464. Taylor was convicted because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3P\">[t]he trial court found that Petitioner was in close proximity to the marijuana; that, because people were smoking marijuana in Petitioner\u2019s presence, Petitioner \u201cknew\u201d there was marijuana in the room; that, because he was on the premises asleep or pretending to be asleep, he had some possesso-ry right in the premises; and that the circumstances were sufficient to draw a reasonable inference that Petitioner was participating with others in the mutual enjoyment of the contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>Id. </em>We concluded, however, that the evidence did not justify any reasonable inference that Taylor knew about, and thus possessed, the contraband. Writing for the Court, Judge Raker explained that \u201c[m]ere proximity to the drug, mere presence on the property where it was located, or mere association, without more, with the person who does control the drug or property on which it is found, is insufficient to support a finding of possession.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 460, 697 A.2d at 466 (quoting <em>Murray v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 694, 696 (9th Cir.1969) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">There is a substantial question whether the evidence in this case establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner had knowledge of the presence of the cocaine hidden in a sealed box of pots and pans found inside the trunk of Charity\u2019s vehicle. Although Petitioner, by virtue of being a passenger in Charity\u2019s vehicle, was in close proximity to the cocaine, on this record he did not have a possessory right in, or control over, the vehicle. Additionally, Charity\u2019s behavior, when contrasted with Petitioner\u2019s, is distinguishable. Charity, who arguably knew that 194 grams of cocaine were in the trunk of his automobile,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was so nervous that Lewis claimed he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>see Charity\u2019s carotid artery pulsing in his neck and his heart pounding through his shirt. No such dramatic observations, however, were attributed to Petitioner, who claims ignorance as to the existence of the contraband. Although Lewis did state that Petitioner would not look at him during questioning, his compatriot, Corporal Bromwell, noted nothing unusual about Petitioner\u2019s behavior, and testified that Petitioner remained quiet or engaged in small talk while Lewis searched Charity\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there was evidence in the record sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the knowledge requirement for possession, we conclude nonetheless that there was not sufficient evidence establishing that Petitioner exercised dominion and control over the cocaine. In <em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 592, 463 A.2d 872 (1983), two brothers, Michael and Stephen Leach, were arrested for possession of a controlled substance (phencyclidine or PCP) and related paraphernalia found in Michael\u2019s one-bedroom apartment. The question before us was whether Stephen, who had a key to Michael\u2019s apartment, which address he provided to the Motor Vehicle Administration and the arresting officer as his home address, was guilty of joint possession of the PCP. <em>Leach, </em>296 Md. at 595, 463 A.2d at 874. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB1\">the fact finding that Michael was the occupant of the Premises precluded inferring that Stephen had joint dominion and control with Michael over the entire apartment and over everything contained anywhere in it. Even though Stephen had ready access to the apartment, it cannot be reasonably inferred that he exercised restraining or directing influence over PCP in a closed container on the bedroom dresser or over paraphernalia in the bedroom closet. If one assumes that the scales and magnifier found in plain view in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the kitchen at the time of the search were always kept there, still those items are intrinsically innocuous. They become significant by association with drugs or cutting agents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>Livingston v. State, </em>317 Md. 408, 409, 564 A.2d 414, 415 (1989), a state trooper, during a routine traffic stop for speeding on Interstate 95 at around midnight, spied two marijuana seeds on the front floor of the automobile. As a result of his visual acuity (aided by his flashlight), this discovery led the trooper to arrest the vehicle\u2019s driver and two passengers, and, during a search incident to the arrest, to the discovery of cocaine and marijuana in Livingston\u2019s, the backseat passenger, pocket. <em>Id. </em>Convicted for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, and possession of marijuana, Livingston appealed, questioning whether, relying solely on the contraband\u2019s proximity, the trooper had sufficient cause to believe that a backseat passenger with no possessory interest in the vehicle had dominion and control over the marijuana seeds found on the front floor of the automobile. <em>Id. </em>We determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">[mjerely sitting in the backseat of the vehicle, Livingston did not demonstrate to the officer that he possessed any knowledge of, and hence, any restraining or directing influence over two marijuana seeds located on the floor in the front of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">Without more than the mere existence of the two marijuana seeds located in the front of the car, we hold that the police officer lacked probable cause to arrest Livingston, a rear seat passenger, for possession of cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>Livingston, </em>317 Md. at 416, 564 A.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">After reviewing the record in White\u2019s case in a light most favorable to the State, we hold the circumstantial evidence upon which the State\u2019s case rested was insufficient as a matter of law to support, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Petitioner exercised dominion or control over the cocaine found inside the pots and pans box in the trunk of Charity\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>automobile. If the rational fact finder was not permitted to infer reasonably in <em>Leach </em>that Stephen exercised dominion and control over the PCP found in a closed container on a bedroom dresser in an apartment to which he had ready access, than a rational fact finder may not infer in the present case that Petitioner had dominion and control over the cocaine found in a sealed box in the trunk of a vehicle in which he apparently had limited access and no possessory interest. Having no such interest in the vehicle places Petitioner in a somewhat similar situation to that of the defendant in <em>Livingston, </em>for the mere existence of cocaine located in the trunk of Charity\u2019s vehicle was not sufficient to prove that Petitioner, a front seat passenger, exercised dominion and control over the contraband. Although Lewis\u2019s testimony regarding the air fresheners and the co-defendants\u2019s inconsistent stories might form the basis for a strong suspicion as to Petitioner\u2019s culpability, the evidence, and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, does not reach the standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Without more, we hold that the Petitioner\u2019s convictions for importation of cocaine, possession of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">When addressing the elements of conspiracy in <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990), we indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">Our cases have consistently defined criminal conspiracy as the combination of two or more people to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means. The gist of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement, which need not be spoken or formal so long as there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design. The crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is made; no overt act in furtherance of the agreement is necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em>Id., </em>321 Md. at 221, 582 A.2d at 528 (citing <em>Birchead v.

Having determined that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner exercised dominion and control over the cocaine in the trunk of Charity\u2019s car, we conclude that the evidence also is insufficient to prove that Petitioner knowingly entered into an unlawful agreement with Charity to import and possess cocaine with an intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In his brief, Petitioner advances a third issue: whether the trial court erred in failing to strike two jurors for cause. Although this contention was raised before the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>appellate court, Petitioner did not include it in his petition for writ of certiorari to us. Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b), governing our scope of review, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">(b) In Court of Appeals \u2014 Additional limitations. (1) Pri- or appellate decision. Unless otherwise provided by the order granting the wilt of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In light of Petitioner\u2019s failure to raise this issue in his petition for a writ of certiorari as required by Maryland Rule 8-131(b)(1), as well as our decision to reverse this case on another ground, we decline to consider Petitioner\u2019s third argument in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY.
