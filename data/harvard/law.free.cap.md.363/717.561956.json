Appellant\u2019s defense to the delinquency petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>was alibi. During his adjudicatory hearing, Appellant\u2019s father testified that his son had been with him all day, including at the time that the assault was alleged to have occurred. The question presented in this appeal is whether Appellant was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel\u2019s error in issuing subpoenas for five corroborating witnesses for the wrong date, when the witnesses would have testified to seeing Appellant with his father at different points throughout the day on which the assault was committed. We shall hold that, under the circumstances presented herein, defense counsel\u2019s failure to subpoena the witnesses for the correct day constituted deficient performance and prejudiced Appellant\u2019s defense; we shall, therefore, reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On the afternoon of April 27, 1999, Trenton Anton Morton was standing at the bus stop in front of his school, Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Temple Hills, Maryland, talking to friends who were on the school bus and getting ready to get on the bus to go home after school. Someone approached Morton from behind, punched him once on the right side of his face, and ran away. Morton attempted to chase the assailant, but eventually stopped when he was unable to catch up to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">On July 28, 1999, the State filed a delinquency petition against Appellant, Parris W., for assault and trespass. Appellant failed to appear at the first scheduled adjudicatory hearing on October 21, 1999. At the second scheduled adjudicatory hearing on December 23, 1999, Appellant\u2019s counsel requested a continuance on the grounds that the State had provided the wrong offense date in its discovery responses, so that counsel only discovered the actual date of the offense on the morning of the hearing, a date for which Appellant claimed to have an alibi defense. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested the continuance in order to summons the alibi witnesses and provide notice of alibi witnesses to the State pursuant to Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 263(d)(3). Appellant\u2019s counsel proffered, at that time, that Appellant had been with his father the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>day of the assault, accompanying him on his delivery route for work. The hearing was continued until January 20, 2000. On December 27, 1999, however, the court sent a scheduling notice to Appellant\u2019s counsel setting the hearing for January 21, 2000. On January 5, 2000, Appellant sent notice to the State of five alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">On January 21, 2000, Appellant\u2019s counsel again requested a continuance on the grounds that he had mistakenly believed that the hearing was still scheduled for January 20th and had subpoenaed a number of alibi witnesses in the case for the wrong day. He requested the continuance in order for the witnesses to be present. The witnesses were two employees of Faith Office Products, where Appellant\u2019s father, Mr. W., worked, one customer to whom Mr. W. made deliveries on the day of the assault, as well as two of Mr. W.\u2019s friends, Jeffrey Taylor and Diane Cary. Defense counsel told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">Your Honor, we would like to make a request for a continuance due to an error on counsel\u2019s part. That is me. I got the date wrong for today\u2019s hearing. I thought it was yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">I issued a number of subpoenas for yesterday to witnesses in this case. These folks, the ones we\u2019ve been able to contact, are not able to come in today. They were prepared to come yesterday. We would request a continuance so we can get those people in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">The people involved are Jeffrey Taylor from D.C., a Diane Cary, and a Tracy Robb from Faith Office Products in D.C., and a Florence Garrett at the same office. These are all adults. They\u2019re all working, and they could not make arrangements to get off today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The State opposed the continuance. Although the prosecutor conceded that his court jacket indicated that the continued hearing was set for January 20, 2000, he proffered that he had \u201cchecked the computer,\u201d which had indicated that the new hearing date was January 21, 2000, that all of the State\u2019s subpoenas had been issued for January 21st, and that the State\u2019s three potential witnesses were present. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>denied the continuance on the grounds that the matter had been scheduled several times and had been continued on a prior occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">At the adjudicatory hearing, Morton was the State\u2019s sole witness. He identified Appellant as the assailant and testified that he knew Appellant because he had been in a few of his classes. Morton testified that, although he did not see Appellant\u2019s face at the time of the assault, he saw Appellant running from behind, and he could identify him because he saw the side of his face as he turned the corner and because He recognized Appellant\u2019s clothing, which he had worn previously during the school year. Morton testified that, a few months before the incident that was the subject of the adjudication, Appellant had pulled a knife on him and that Morton had reported him to the principal, resulting in Appellant\u2019s expulsion from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The only witness called on Appellant\u2019s behalf was his father, Anthony W. Mr. W. testified that, on the day of the assault, he had brought his son back to school for a 9:00 a.m. meeting regarding the termination of his three-month expulsion, pursuant to a document from Thurgood Marshall Middle School requesting that Appellant report back to school on that date. Mr. W. said that the vice principal had refused to allow his son to return to school as scheduled because Mr. W. had failed to fill out some required community service paperwork, so he took his son with him on his delivery rounds. Mr. W. testified that he and his son left the school at 9:25 a.m., went to his office in northwest Washington, D.C. from approximately 10:00 to 10:30 and that, after that, he loaded several cases of copy paper into his van. He and his son then made a delivery to northeast Washington, D.C. and, immediately thereafter, they went to the house of a friend, Jeffrey Taylor, in southeast Washington, where they stayed from approximately 11:00 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. He testified that, after that, he and his son went to the apartment of a friend, Diane Cary, in Greenbelt, where they arrived at approximately 2:15 p.m. He said that Ms. Cary was not at home, but that he and his son went inside, and his son played video games while he talked to Ms. Cary on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the phone. Mr. W. testified that they were at Ms. Cary\u2019s apartment continuously for the rest of the day, until approximately 11:00 p.m. He testified that Ms. Cary arrived home around 4:80. Mr. W testified that his son never left his sight during the time that they were at Ms. Cary\u2019s apartment and that he did not drive him to Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Temple Hills, which he believed was about thirty miles away and would take approximately thirty to forty minutes to reach by car, depending on traffic. He was able to see his son in Ms. Cary\u2019s bedroom every time that he walked down the hallway, and his son was unable to drive a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">On cross-examination and later in closing argument, the State emphasized that Mr. W. was biased \u2014 that, as Appellant\u2019s father, he had an incentive to provide him with a false alibi for the assault. Ultimately, the court found that Morton was credible, based upon his recognition of Appellant from the side and of his clothing. The court further found that there was no reason presented why Morton would fabricate his testimony if the assault did not happen the way that he testified. The court, therefore, found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant had committed the assault as alleged. Appellant was placed under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice, released to the care and custody of his father, and ordered to serve five consecutive weekends at Cheltenham and to perform certain conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Appellant noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court issued a writ of certiorari before consideration in the Court of Special Appeals in order to determine whether claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, which are plain on the record, may be raised on direct appeal from a finding of juvenile delinquency and, if so, whether Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Appellant argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s failure to subpoena properly the necessary alibi witnesses for trial. He contends that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>testimony was critical to the success of his alibi defense and that his counsel\u2019s failure to produce them deprived him of a fair trial. Appellant argues that, because counsel\u2019s deficient performance was plain and confessed, this Court should reverse the judgment on direct review based on the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The State argues that Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not preserved for appellate review because it was not raised before the juvenile court and because there is an inadequate evidentiary record on direct appeal to support the claim. The State argues that Appellant must raise his claim pursuant to the Maryland Post Conviction Act, Maryland Code (1958, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 645A. On the merits, the State argues that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient and that Appellant was not prejudiced by the failure to subpoena the witnesses for the proper day because he was able to present his alibi defense through the testimony of his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">In <em>In Re: Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), the United States Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that, in all juvenile delinquency proceedings that may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile\u2019s freedom is curtailed, the child has a right to counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 41, 87 S.Ct. at 1451, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. It has long been recognized that the right to counsel includes the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 377, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2584, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>State v. Tichnell, </em>306 Md. 428, 440, 509 A.2d 1179, 1185 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Under <em>Strickland </em>and its progeny, in order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, the Supreme Court has stated that a petitioner must prove that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1511-12, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 768 A.2d 656 (2001); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 427, 578 A.2d 734, 739 (1990) (holding that, in order to establish prejudice, a petitioner must show that there is a substantial possibility that the result of the proceedings would have been different).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">To prove deficient performance, the defendant must identify acts or omissions of counsel that were not the result of reasonable professional judgment. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 78, 741 A.2d 1162, 1184 (1999). The standard by which counsel\u2019s performance is assessed is an objective one, and the assessment is made by comparison to prevailing professional norms. <em>See Morrison, 477 </em>U.S. at 375, 106 S.Ct. at 2582, 91 L.Ed.2d 305; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 78, 741 A.2d at 1184. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and there is a strong (but rebuttable) presumption that counsel rendered reasonable assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. <em>See Morrison, 477 </em>U.S. at 384, 106 S.Ct. at 2588, 91 L.Ed.2d 305; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689-90, 104 S.Ct. at 2065-66, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 78, 741 A.2d at 1184. As we indicated in <em>Redman, </em>363 Md. at 310, 768 A.2d at 662, \u201cthe inquiry has two foci: first, a performance evaluation under prevailing professional norms; and second, an inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>into whether the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of deficient performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In assessing the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance, the reviewing court should keep in mind that counsel\u2019s primary function is to effectuate the adversarial testing process in the particular case. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 698-99, 496 A.2d 1074, 1081 (1985). Nonetheless, a single, serious error can support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Morrison, </em>477 U.S. at 383, 106 S.Ct. at 2587, 91 L.Ed.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">It is the general rule that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised most appropriately in a post-conviction proceeding pursuant to Maryland Code (1958, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 645A. <em>See, e.g., Austin v. State, </em>327 Md. 375, 394, 609 A.2d 728, 737 (1992); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 434-35, 439 A.2d 542, 559 (1982). The primary reason behind the rule is that, ordinarily, the trial record does not illuminate the basis for the challenged acts or omissions of counsel. <em>See Johnson, </em>292 Md. at 434-35, 439 A.2d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The rule, however, is not absolute and, where the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to permit a fair evaluation of the claim, there is no need for a collateral fact-finding proceeding, and review on direct appeal may be appropriate and desirable. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>299 Md. 511, 517, 474 A.2d 890, 893 (1984); <em>see also United States v. Stevens, </em>149 F.3d 747, 748 (8th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>146 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Gwiazdzinski, </em>141 F.3d 784, 789 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Toms, </em>136 F.3d 176, 182 (D.C.Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Lightbourne, </em>104 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Fry, </em>51 F.3d 543, 545 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Gordon, 4 </em>F.3d 1567, 1570 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>967 F.2d 287, 290 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Virgin Islands v. Zepp, </em>748 F.2d 125, 133 (3rd Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Aulet, </em>618 F.2d 182, 185-86 (2nd Cir.1980); <em>Austin, </em>327 Md. at 394, 609 A.2d at 737; <em>Johnson, </em>292 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>435 n. 15, 439 A.2d at 559 n. 15; <em>People v. Tello, </em>15 Cal.4th 264, 62 Cal.Rptr.2d 437, 933 P.2d 1134 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The case before the Court falls within this exception. The trial record is developed sufficiently to permit review and evaluation of the merits of the claim, and none of the critical facts surrounding counsel\u2019s conduct is in dispute. Therefore, a collateral evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of counsel\u2019s performance is unnecessary to develop a complete record of the basis for the challenged acts or omissions, and our refusal to address Appellant\u2019s claim in this appeal would constitute a waste of judicial resources.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">That counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, even under the highly deferential standard of <em>Strickland, </em>seems clear. Appellant\u2019s counsel was sent a scheduling notice by the juvenile court indicating that Appellant\u2019s hearing was scheduled for January 21, 2000, and counsel does not deny receiving such notice. The prosecutor discovered the new hearing date by checking the court computer, and all of the State\u2019s subpoenas were issued for the correct trial date. In fact, defense counsel conceded that the scheduling error was his and that his mistake was the sole reason for the witnesses\u2019 failure to appear for the hearing. Based on these undisputed facts, it is clear that counsel\u2019s single, serious error of failing to subpoena the witnesses for the correct trial date did not constitute the exercise of reasonable professional judgment and that such failure was not consistent with counsel\u2019s primary function of effectuating the adversarial testing process in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Nonetheless, in considering an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, in addition to establishing deficient performance, in order to warrant relief, Appellant must establish prejudice, i.e., that there is a substantial possibility that, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>for counsel\u2019s error, the result of his proceeding would have been different. <em>See Redman, </em>363 Md. at 310, 768 A.2d at 662; <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 80, 741 A.2d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">At the adjudicatory hearing, the State never established the time at which the assault on Morton occurred, although the parties seem to have assumed that it occurred at 3:45 p.m.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result of counsel\u2019s error, only one witness testified at the hearing on Appellant\u2019s behalf. As indicated <em>supra, </em>the victim, Trenton Morton, testified as a witness for the State. He identified Appellant as his assailant and testified that he recognized Appellant from the side and back and by Appellant\u2019s clothing. Appellant\u2019s father, Anthony W., was the sole witness for Appellant. Mr. W. testified that Appellant had been with him throughout the entire day of the assault. The court found that Morton\u2019s identification of Appellant was credible and that there was no reason for Morton to fabricate his testimony. It was on the basis of these findings that the court found Appellant involved in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Although Appellant has characterized the improperly subpoenaed witnesses as \u201calibi\u201d witnesses, in reality, they merely would have corroborated portions of Appellant\u2019s father\u2019s testimony. \u201cAn alibi of an accused, proceeding as it does upon the idea that he was elsewhere at the time of the commission of the crime, does, of course, if thoroughly established, preclude the possibility of guilt.\u201d <em>Floyd v. State, </em>205 Md. 573, 581, 109 A.2d 729, 732 (1954). An alibi is not an affirmative defense, and a defendant does not bear the burden of proving that he or she was elsewhere during the commission of the crime. As this Court held in <em>State v. Grady, </em>276 Md. 178, 345 A.2d 436 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">\u201c[A]n alibi is not an affirmative defense, placing any burden upon a defendant beyond the self-evident one of attempting to erode the State\u2019s proof to a point where it no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>convinces the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt. Proof of an alibi, like any other defense testimony, is simply a means of controverting the State\u2019s effort to establish criminal agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 184, 345 A.2d at 439 (quoting <em>Robinson v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 450, 459, 316 A.2d 268, 272 (1974)). <em>See </em>Maryland State Bar Association, Inc., Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MPJI-CR) 5:00.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Nonetheless, the pertinent question for the purposes of prejudice analysis under <em>Strickland </em>is not whether the missing witnesses could have established an alibi for the defendant, but whether there is a substantial possibility that their testimony, which corroborated a large part of Mr. W.\u2019s alibi testimony, would have been sufficient, in conjunction with the other evidence, to create a reasonable doubt as to Appellant\u2019s involvement in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, and the trial court was not bound to accept Appellant\u2019s alibi testimony. <em>See Floyd, </em>205 Md. at 581, 109 A.2d at 732 (noting that all of the evidence is to be considered together and that the trier of fact is not to weigh merely the evidence relating to the alibi and determine from that alone whether there is a reasonable doubt of guilt). Nonetheless, there is a substantial possibility that, had the court heard the proffered testimony of the five subpoenaed witnesses, corroborating substantial portions of Mr. W.\u2019s testimony, the court might have harbored a reasonable doubt as to Appellant\u2019s involvement. This is particularly true in a case such as this where the evidence linking Appellant to the crime was solely the victim\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Appellant\u2019s father was not an unbiased witness. The first two corroborating witnesses that Appellant had intended to call were coworkers of his father, and a third was a customer on Mr. W.\u2019s delivery route. While none of the three could testify to Appellant\u2019s whereabouts in the afternoon when the assault was committed, they could all provide independent corroboration that Appellant accompanied his father on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>delivery route on the day of the assault, which in turn would have tended to strengthen Mr. W.\u2019s claim that Appellant was with him all day. While the fourth and fifth improperly subpoenaed witnesses were family friends, they were less interested parties in Appellant\u2019s proceedings than his father. Furthermore, it appears that the fifth witness, Diane Cary, may, in fact, have been able to provide proper alibi testimony, since it was proffered that she arrived at her home around 4:30 on the afternoon of the assault, which was approximately thirty miles from the scene of the assault, and that Appellant and his father were there when she arrived. Given the distance between Ms. Cary\u2019s home and the place where Morton was assaulted, and given the uncertainty surrounding the time of the assault, Ms. Cary\u2019s testimony alone may have been enough to create reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing judge had she been available to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">That is not to say that the judge would have had to disbelieve the complaining witness. Appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to create the possibility of misidentification in his cross-examination of Morton. If Ms. Cary had been present to testify that she had observed Appellant forty minutes away from the scene of the crime at 4:30 p.m., her testimony may have discredited Morton\u2019s identification of Appellant as his assailant. It is evident from the trial record that Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance in failing to subpoena the five corroborating witnesses for the correct trial date was deficient and that, as a. result of the deficient performance, Appellant was, prejudiced. Accordingly, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">This case is strikingly similar to that of <em>Griffin v. Warden, Md. Corr. Adjustment Center, </em>970 F.2d 1355 (4th Cir.1992). In that case, the appellant, Donald Griffin, had been identified by two security guards as a participant in an armed robbery that occurred on July 24, 1983 at 3:45 p.m. <em>See id. </em>at 1356. Griffin provided his trial attorney with a list of five alibi witnesses to testify regarding his whereabouts on the afternoon of the robbery: a friend who would testify to seeing Griffin between 3:00 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. on the day of the robbery; a second friend who would testify that she had seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Griffin on his front porch in his pajamas around 3:30 p.m.; two friends who would testify that Griffin arrived at their house at 4:00 p.m., where he remained until nightfall; and Griffin\u2019s mother who would testify that he was at home until he left to go to his friends\u2019 house shortly after 4:00 p.m. <em>See id. </em>at 1358-59. Unfortunately, Griffin\u2019s counsel failed to contact the witnesses or provide the state with notice of alibi. As a result, the trial court disallowed their testimony because of the lack of notice, and Griffin alone testified for the defense regarding his alibi. <em>See id. </em>at 1356. Griffin was convicted for the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus issue on the basis that Griffin was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court found that Griffin\u2019s attorney\u2019s performance was clearly deficient and concluded that \u201cno reasonable excuse for failing to notify the state of Griffin\u2019s alibi and to secure the attendance of alibi witnesses appears or is even suggested in the evidentiary record. Indeed, [defense counsel\u2019s statements at the bench conference are unambiguous admissions of unpardonable neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. The court also found that Griffin had been prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, specifically rejecting the district court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence would not have established an alibi because it did not cover the period of the robbery based on the full chronology that the witnesses established and the distance between Griffin\u2019s friends\u2019 house and the scene of the robbery. Emphasizing the state\u2019s use of the lack of corroboration for his alibi in closing argument, the court concluded that there was a reasonable probability that the result of Griffin\u2019s trial would have been different. The court explained: \u201cOur confidence in the outcome is very much undermined. Eyewitness identification evidence, uncorroborated by a fingerprint, gun, confession, or coconspirator testimony, is a thin thread to shackle a man for forty years. Moreover, it is precisely the sort of evidence that an alibi defense refutes best.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Appellant\u2019s case is also similar to <em>Montgomery v. Petersen, </em>846 F.2d 407 (7th Cir.1988). In that case, the Appellant, Carl Montgomery, was convicted of a burglary that was committed in Moultrie County, Illinois on September 9, 1988. <em>See id. </em>at 408. At trial, Montgomery\u2019s wife testified that she and her husband had spent the afternoon of the robbery shopping in Springfield, Illinois for a bicycle for their son\u2019s birthday and that Montgomery was at home for the rest of the day and evening, in direct contradiction to testimony by Montgomery\u2019s alleged coconspirators that they had spent the day committing burglaries. Twelve other witnesses, all relatives or close friends of Montgomery, also testified to observing him in Springfield on the day of the robbery, including at his son\u2019s birthday party that evening. Montgomery\u2019s trial counsel failed, however, to call the single disinterested witness who could have placed him in Springfield on the day of the burglary-the store clerk who remembered selling a child\u2019s bicycle to the Montgomerys that afternoon. <em>See id. </em>at 408-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">At the hearing on Montgomery\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, his trial counsel testified that his failure to investigate the potential alibi witness was inadvertent. <em>See id. </em>at 409-10. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of a writ of habeas corpus based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that counsel\u2019s inadvertent failure to investigate the potential alibi witness was unreasonable and that the failure prejudiced Montgomery, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">In this case, ... the petitioner has pointed to a specific witness whose missing testimony would have been exculpatory. In fact, the Sears witness\u2019 testimony was significant to the petitioner\u2019s defense in several respects. First, it directly contradicted the state\u2019s chief witness, who testified that he and the petitioner were together outside of Springfield from 9:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. that day.... Thus, the Sears clerk\u2019s testimony had a direct bearing on this witness\u2019 veracity, a witness upon whose testimony the state depended in order to secure a conviction. However, even more important than impeaching the testimony of the state\u2019s chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>witness, the Sears clerk\u2019s testimony also provided the petitioner with an unbiased alibi defense. As such, it did not merely raise doubts about the petitioner\u2019s guilt; if believed by the jury, it would have directly exonerated him of the crime. Finally, the jury might well have viewed the otherwise impeachable testimony of the twelve \"witnesses who were presented at the Moultrie County trial in a different light had the jury also heard the testimony of this disinterested witness. <em>Therefore, the Sears clerk\u2019s testimony may have transformed a weak case into a strong one merely by corroborating the testimony of these other defense witnesses. </em>In sum, ... \u201c[i]t is unrealistic to look at [the Sears witness\u2019] testimony as simply cumulative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 415 (internal citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). The court also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">[T]he state appears to question in its brief Judge Mills\u2019 classification of the Sears witness as an \u201calibi\u201d witness.... We think such an argument is particularly unconvincing in light of the fact that the state never contended ... that the petitioner could have purchased the bicycle at the Sears store in Springfield and still have committed the burglaries with [the coconspirator]. \u201cA defense that places the defendant at the relevant time in a different place than the scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party\u201d is an alibi defense.... Under [the coconspirator]\u2019s version of the crime, the petitioner spent the entire day with him <em>outside of Springfield </em>planning and executing the burglaries. Thus, the testimony of the Sears \"witness, if believed, rendered it impossible for the petitioner to be the guilty party under the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case, as presented through the testimony of the professed accomplice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 415 n. 6 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\"><em>Grooms v. Solem, </em>923 F.2d 88 (8th Cir.1991), is also instructive. In that case, William Grooms, was convicted of selling stolen Native American artifacts on the basis of the testimony of a police informant who was married to Grooms\u2019s ex-wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>with whom Grooms was engaged in a bitter custody battle over their three children. The incident at issue had occurred on May 15, 1984, in Scenic, South Dakota, between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. Grooms claimed to have spent that day with his wife and a friend in Rapid City, South Dakota, which is approximately fifty miles from Scenic, waiting for the transmission in his pickup to be replaced. He also claimed that the repair was not completed until dusk, well after the time at which the illegal sale was to have taken place. <em>See id. </em>at 89. Grooms\u2019s trial counsel did not check with the repair shop to establish whether anyone recalled repairing his truck on May 15th, although two employees of the repair shop could have corroborated Grooms\u2019s story by testifying that they had finished the transmission installation at approximately 7:00 or 7:30 p.m. <em>See id. </em>at 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that Grooms\u2019s trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective, finding that his failure to investigate Grooms\u2019s alibi or to request a continuance for further investigation constituted deficient performance. <em>See id. </em>at 90. On the issue of prejudice, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">Prejudice can be shown by demonstrating that the uncalled alibi witnesses would have testified if called at trial and that their testimony would have supported Grooms\u2019 alibi____ The testimony of [the two mechanics] at the state court\u2019s habeas corpus hearing established that they would have been available to testify if they had been called and that their testimony, if believed, would have supported Grooms\u2019 alibi defense. Thus, there is a reasonable probability that had these witnesses been called, the outcome of the trial ... would have been different, given the arguably plausible motivation [the informant] had to be less than a disinterested, objective witness against Grooms. Likewise, ... the alibi testimony could have raised a reasonable doubt about [the informantes veracity and credibility____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 91 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Likewise, in <em>Tosh v. Lockhart, </em>879 F.2d 412 (8th Cir.1989), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>found that the failure to call two corroborating alibi witnesses violated petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. In that case, the appellant, James Tosh, was convicted of aggravated robbery and theft of property for two campground robberies that took place at approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 5, 1981. Following the robberies, two victims identified Tosh as a member of the group of five to seven robbers. At trial, Tosh contended that, at the time of the robberies, he was with his girlfriend, Becky Lumpkin, several miles from the campground, which Lumpkin confirmed. Tosh also claimed that he had been confronted by Lumpkin\u2019s neighbor, David Nelson, at approximately 2:00 a.m. that night and that two other witnesses observed the fight. Nonetheless, Tosh\u2019s trial counsel did not call David Nelson or the other two witnesses at his trial, relying solely on Lumpkin to provide Tosh\u2019s alibi. At Tosh\u2019s habeas corpus hearing, Nelson corroborated Tosh\u2019s story regarding the fight and testified that no one could drive to or from Lumpkin\u2019s residence without being heard and that he had not heard anyone drive in or out during the time in question. Two other members of the Nelson family testified at the habeas corpus hearing in a manner consistent with David Nelson\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The court found that Tosh\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in not making reasonable efforts to produce the corroborating witnesses or asking for a continuance to ensure their presence. <em>See id. </em>at 414. The court found that this deficiency prejudiced Tosh, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">\u201cThe main fact remains untouched: four witnesses, three of them with no interest in the matter one way or the other, are willing to swear that petitioner was somewhere else at the time of the crime. But the jury only heard from one of these witnesses, and that witness was the one whose objectivity was most in doubt.\u201d ... [T]here is a reasonable probability that but for Tosh\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to call the Nelsons as alibi witnesses, the result of the trial would have been different.... Thus, Tosh has satisfied the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>component of the <em>Strickland </em>test and is entitled to habeas relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 414-15 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Appellant\u2019s case is also similar to <em>Johns v. Perini, </em>462 F.2d 1308 (6th Cir.1972). In that case, Frank Johns had been convicted of the possession and distribution of marijuana for an alleged sale that took place in a tavern on November 30, 1964 after 11:00 p.m. <em>See id. </em>at 1309-10. Two prosecution witnesses identified Johns as the seller of the marijuana. <em>See id. </em>at 1310. Johns claimed that he was at work by 11:00 p.m. on that evening, but Johns\u2019s counsel failed to investigate Johns\u2019s alibi or to give the statutorily required three-day notice of alibi. <em>See id. </em>at 1309. At trial, the prosecutor had no objection to Johns testifying about his employment, but he opposed vigorously any attempt to corroborate the alibi claim with employment records that were available to defense counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 1310. The trial court refused to admit the employment records, but allowed Johns to testify regarding his alibi. <em>See id. </em>at 1310, 1313-14. The records did not indicate which specific days of the week Johns worked, but did indicate that he had worked twenty-four hours over three days the week of the alleged drug sale and that his work schedule required him to be at work at 11:00 p.m. on the days that he worked. <em>See id. </em>at 1311. The United States District Court denied a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that defense counsel\u2019s failure to file the notice of alibi was harmless since the trial court\u2019s decision not to admit Johns\u2019s pay stubs was valid because they did not demonstrate that he had worked on the night of the marijuana sale. <em>See id. </em>at 1309 n. 1 &amp; 1313. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present Johns\u2019s alibi deprived him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.

In <em>In Re: Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), the Supreme Court, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, extended the right to counsel to juvenile delinquency proceedings that may result in commitment to an institution. <em>See id. </em>at 41, 87 S.Ct. at 1451, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. It did not do so by specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>incorporating the full spectrum of rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <em>See id. </em>at 61, 87 S.Ct. at 1461, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (Black, J., concurring).
