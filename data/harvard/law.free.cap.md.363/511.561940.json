Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion filed June 12, 2000, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner presents one question to this Court, for which we granted certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in not reversing Petitioner\u2019s conviction on the ground that the trial court precluded Petitioner from using a key State witness\u2019s Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) for any reason including to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection, on the ground that PSIs are confidential and privileged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We answer petitioner\u2019s question in the affirmative. We hold that the trial court should not have precluded petitioner from using a key State witness\u2019s PSI to refresh that witness\u2019s recollection. The confidentiality of a PSI is not absolute. The showing of a PSI to a witness who has a right to see it, in order to refresh that witness\u2019s recollection, is not prohibited by statute. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand with instructions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County and remand the case to that court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Petitioner and Mr. John Campbell (Campbell), two individuals incarcerated in the State of Maryland, shared cell 205 in D building, Bravo Wing of the Maryland House of Corrections Annex located in Jessup, Maryland. Sergeant Carlton L. Gibson, the officer in charge of the housing unit, testified that in early August 1998,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner and two other individuals had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>just come off of temporary housing into the D Building. Petitioner was given a choice of three bed spaces in which to move. Petitioner requested that he not be moved into a cell with anyone who was a smoker. After initially refusing the placement in the cell with Campbell, petitioner changed his mind and accepted housing in that cell. His decision to accept the housing was made, at least in part, on the assurances by Sergeant Gibson that they would move him out of the cell after a short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Petitioner testified that soon thereafter he made numerous requests to be moved from the cell he shared with Campbell because Campbell \u201csmoke[d] all the time,\u201d was HIV positive, and had sexually propositioned petitioner. However, Sergeant Gibson testified that \u201c[t]he only reason I had was \u2014 the only reason that was brought to my attention was the smoking. Because [petitioner] said \u2014 he stated that he had asthma and he couldn\u2019t move in with anybody that smoked cigarettes.\u201d Additionally, when asked whether petitioner ever complained about unwanted sexual advances by his cell mate, Sergeant Gibson responded that \u201c[s]exual advances [were] never brought to my attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">At approximately 11:25 p.m. on August 1, 1998, after being cell-mates for approximately two weeks, a fight broke out between the two inmates. The issue at petitioner\u2019s trial for this assault was not whether the assault occurred but whether petitioner was acting in self-defense. During the trial, the defense counsel argued that petitioner was acting in self-defense by warding off an unwanted, forced homosexual assault upon him by Campbell, who petitioner believed to be a homosexual, a convicted sex offender, and a HIV positive individual, while the State contended that the assault was simply an unprovoked attack by petitioner. The two inmates\u2019 versions of the assault are drastically different.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Campbell testified that at approximately 11:25 p.m., he walked to the door of the cell to smoke a cigarette. Before Campbell could light the cigarette, petitioner jumped out of bed and began hitting him in the back of the head. Initially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Campbell thought that petitioner was only punching him, but when he saw blood running down his face, he realized he was being stabbed. Campbell called out for a correctional officer. Officer Barbara Leonard responded to his call for help, called for a 10-10,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and waited for additional correctional officers to arrive. During this time, petitioner \u201cContinued stabbing [Campbell] in the neck, the shoulder, and down the right side of [Campbell\u2019s] back.\u201d Not until Officer Orice Custis arrived and sprayed pepper spray in the cell did petitioner stop attacking Campbell. Campbell testified and the medical report confirmed that he had \u201c104 stab wounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Contrastingly, petitioner maintained that on the night in question, he was acting in self-defense. He testified that Campbell, whom he believed was a homosexual, a convicted sex offender, and HIV positive, \u201ctried to approach [him] sexually.\u201d Petitioner testified that \u201c[Campbell] approached me about a sexual thing, and I told him that I was not a homosexual. And after I refused, he approached me. He tried to attack me.\u201d Petitioner explained that while he was laying on his bed and Campbell was standing in the cell, Campbell began touching him and fondling him in a sexual manner. Petitioner testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Mr. Campbell told me that he was a known sex offender to me. And I knew that he had AIDS. He was approaching me sexually, so that was an assault on my life. He wanted to have sex with me. I refused. He approached me, touching me. When I jumped down to try to get him to stop, he attacked me. And we fought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Petitioner then grabbed a knife, which he kept for protection, from its hiding place by the toilet and used it in his fight with Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Petitioner was seen hitting and stabbing Campbell by two correctional officers who responded to Campbell\u2019s calls. Officer Barbara Leonard testified that at approximately 11:25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>p.m. she heard someone calling \u201cCO, CO.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon arriving at cell 205, she found that Campbell \u201cwas bent down at the door and [petitioner] ... was just stabbing him repeatedly.\u201d She instructed petitioner to stop striking Campbell. When he ignored her, Officer Leonard \u201ccalled the code\u201d by reporting a \u201c10-10 on delta bravo,\u201d indicating that there was a fight between inmates on the bravo wing of Building D. Officer Orice Custis responded to her call and upon arriving at cell 205, ordered petitioner to stop striking Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">On the evening that the fight broke out between the two inmates, Officer Custis was the Officer in Charge of a housing unit in Building D. He testified that when he arrived at cell 205 he saw Campbell \u201cin the fetal position right by the door. There was another inmate [petitioner] on top of him stabbing him.\u201d Officer Custis instructed petitioner to stop striking Campbell. When petitioner ignored him, Officer Custis went to the control center, got a chemical agent, ran back to cell 205,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and ordered petitioner to stop striking Campbell. When petitioner continued to ignore Officer Custis\u2019s commands, Officer Custis \u201csprayed a short burst of chemical agent into the cell\u201d through a small slot in the cell door at which time petitioner \u201cdropped the weapon down and ran to the back of the cell.\u201d Officer Custis ordered petitioner to back up to the cell door to be handcuffed but he refused to cooperate. The two officers waited for more officers to arrive to the scene before they opened the door, handcuffed both petitioner and Campbell, and took them to Medical. Officer Leonard testified that the fight continued for approximately three minutes from the time she first responded to Campbell\u2019s cries for help. She also testified that she did not witness how the fight started.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>II. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>defense counsel\u2019s theory of the case was that petitioner was acting in self defense by warding off an unwanted, forced sexual assault upon him by Campbell, who petitioner believed to be a homosexual, a convicted sex offender, and a HIV positive individual. On cross-examination, Campbell denied being a homosexual and stated that if he made any sexual advances toward petitioner while they were cell mates, that he did not remember making them. He further testified on cross-examination that, although he remembered pleading guilty to two second degree sex offenses and he was serving a forty-year sentence, he did not recall the specifics of the charges. It was clear that whether Campbell was a person who made sexual attacks against members of the same sex was proffered as material to the credibility of both Campbell and the defendant. On recross-examination, defense counsel again tried to elicit the specifics behind Campbell\u2019s convictions for two second degree and one third degree sexual offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">BY MR. GUNNING:[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">Q. Mr. Campbell, the victim of your sexual offense was an 11-year-old boy; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\">MR. PAONE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">MR. GUNNING: Your Honor, may we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">THE COURT: No. I am going to overrule. He can answer the question. You opened the door. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">BY MR. GUNNING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-12\">Q. You don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-13\">A. I don\u2019t remember nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-14\">Q. You don\u2019t recall pleading guilty to sodomizing an 11-year-old boy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>A. I remember pleading guilty to second degree sex offense. That\u2019s all I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">Q. And you don\u2019t recall the second second degree sex offense with the same 11-year-old boy as part of that plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">A. No. I remember pleading guilty to two second degree sex offenses. That was all I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">Q. And you also pled guilty to a third degree sex offense which entailed fondling the penis of that little boy, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">Q. And you just don\u2019t remember any of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">A. I don\u2019t remember none of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Shortly thereafter, the following discussion took place at a bench conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">MR. PAONE: Your Honor, defense counsel has just shown me a copy of what appears to be a PSI for the defendant.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] I can only assume he is going to cross-examine him about the contents of that PSI. I am going to object before we get into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-13\">THE COURT: What\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">MR. GUNNING: Initially I am going to use it to refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">MR. PAONE: A PSI is confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">THE COURT: How\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-17\">MR. GUNNING: That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t use it to refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-18\">THE COURT: This report is for official Court use only. It is saying here it is confidential and protected. Where did you get this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-19\">MR. GUNNING: Through subpoena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-20\">MR. PAONE: His base file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>THE COURT: I think it is confidential. It says this report \u2014 public inspection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">MR. GUNNING: All that means is that I can\u2019t go into a courthouse and say give me the PSI for this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">THE COURT: Well, you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">MR. GUNNING: But now that I have gotten this PSI, I should be able to use the information in there to try to refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">THE COURT: He has already \u2014 -so I am going to sustain his objection. You have it on the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">MR. GUNNING: I could proffer to the Court that this document \u2014 -he admitted to \u2014 sexual offenses to an 11-year-old boy, and one would be by sodomy and the other one would be by having oral sex with him. He also fondled him. This information will be mainly to refresh his recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">THE COURT: Well \u2014 there is no need in going into the rest of it, for several reasons. One, it is confidential; two, it is already on \u2014 and the only purpose of the convictions are to show\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">MR. GUNNING: But, Your Honor, now we have the issue of credibility where he says he is not a homosexual. And if you ... sodomize an 11-year-old boy\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">THE COURT: If you have a conviction, you can tell them the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">MR. PAONE: Your Honor, I am going to renew my objection to all references to the specific facts of any case. I can\u2019t get into them on my cross-examination, and neither can defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">Your Honor, under these circumstances there are many reasons, psychological, psychiatric, any number of reasons, why the [witness] may not remember what exactly happened on these occasions. The clear implication to the jury has been that \u2014 there has also been no indication that [petitioner] knows any of the facts of these cases and therefore knows to be fearful of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-14\">It is grossly unfair. The State is not allowed to go into the facts of any convictions [petitioner] may have when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>takes the stand. I think the law is very clear that when it comes to credibility we have the conviction and the conviction alone. And that goes for both sides, the State and the defense.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">THE COURT: I \u2014 it is clear that this is a confidential document, and as part\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The record indicates that at this point the bench conference ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">a. The Confidential Nature of a PSI is Not Absolute</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The question before us is simply whether the trial court erred in refusing to permit petitioner\u2019s defense counsel to use Campbell\u2019s PSI to attempt to refresh his recollection on the sole basis that PSI\u2019s are confidential. It is helpful to our analysis to review the nature of PSIs and their role in the criminal justice process. A \u201cpre-sentence investigation\u201d is an \u201c[investigation of the relevant background of a convicted offender, usually conducted by a probation officer attached to a court, designed to act as a sentencing guide for the sentencing judge.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1184 (6th ed.1990); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>also </em>18 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 3552 (Presentence reports); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b) (Presentence Investigation and Report). Generally, a PSI is a tool offered to the sentencing court to assist it in reaching its goal of individualizing the sentence \u201cto fit \u2018the offender and not merely the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>308 Md. 162, 167, 517 A.2d 1081, 1084 (1986) (quoting <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)). \u201cThe principal function of the presentence report is to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Charmer Indus. Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1164, 1170 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Because a PSI is a tool generally utilized by a sentencing judge, the circumstances, which present themselves in the case <em>sub judice, </em>are unusual. In this case, the State\u2019s key witness, Campbell, was a convicted sex offender. During cross-examination and recross-examination, Campbell claimed that he could not remember the specifics of the crimes for which he had been convicted. Defense counsel, in an effort to strengthen petitioner\u2019s testimony that Campbell had been making unwanted sexual advances, fondling him, and sexually attacking him, attempted to utilize a PSI that was apparently prepared in respect to Campbell\u2019s sentencing on his convictions. Defense counsel received the PSI through subpoena and was attempting to use the PSI to refresh Campbell\u2019s memory as to the nature of his past convictions after Campbell asserted that he could not remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We continue our discussion with an analysis of the relevant statutes. Maryland Code (1999), section 6-112 of the Correctional Services Article<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u00a7 6-112. Presentence investigation report; other investigations and probationary services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(2) <em>Except on court order, </em>a presentence investigation report is confidential and is not available for public inspection.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>][Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">As the wording of section 6-112 clearly indicates, the confidentiality of a PSI is not absolute. It is confidential in that it is not available for general \u201cpublic inspection,\u201d <em>except on an order of a court. </em>It does not specifically prohibit the use of PSIs in official court proceedings \u2014 it is primarily designed to limit \u201cpublic inspections.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Some of the underlying purposes behind the PSI confidentiality requirement include: (1) to encourage individuals, including a defendant, who have relevant information to provide it candidly with the assurance of confidentiality, <em>see United States v. Greathouse, </em>484 F.2d 805, 807 (1973); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>454 F.2d 813, 820 (1972); (2) to consider the privacy interests of the victims and their families, <em>see Halacy v. Steen, </em>670 A.2d 1371, 1374 (Me.1996); (3) to consider the privacy interests of the defendant, <em>see United States v. Corbitt, </em>879 F.2d 224, 236 (7th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 823, 112 S.Ct. 86, 116 L.Ed.2d 58 (1991); (4) to protect the anonymity of confidential sources, <em>see United States v. Huckaby, </em>43 F.3d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1995); and (5) to consider that the report may include irrelevant and unsupported information, <em>see Halacy, </em>670 A.2d at 1374. We recognize that there are numerous compelling interests served by preserving the confidentiality of PSIs from \u201cpublic inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">These valid public policy justifications for confidentiality usually factor heavily against <em>out-of-court </em>disclosures to any party not involved in the sentencing or rehabilitation of the subject of the PSI. The United States Supreme Court stated in <em>United States Department of Justice v. Julian, </em>486 U.S. 1, 108 S.Ct. 1606, 100 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">[T]he courts have been very reluctant to give <em>third parties </em>access to the presentence investigation report prepared for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>some other individual or individuals. As the Government points out, one reason for this is the fear that disclosure of the reports will have a chilling effect on the willingness of various individuals to contribute information that will be incorporated into the report. A second reason is the need to protect the confidentiality of the information contained in the report. Accordingly, the courts have typically required some showing of special need before they will allow a third party to obtain a copy of a presentence report. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 12, 108 S.Ct. at 1613, 100 L.Ed.2d 1; <em>see Charmer Indus., </em>711 F.2d at 1171 (noting that \u201c[i]n order to ensure the availability of as much information as possible to assist in presentencing, the courts have generally determined that pre-sentencing reports should be held confidential.\u201d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">However, as we discussed, <em>supra, </em>despite the justifications for keeping a PSI confidential in respect to \u201cpublic inspection\u201d (which was not the use petitioner proposed in the case at bar), the confidentiality of a PSI even then is not absolute. Section 6-112(a)(2) plainly states that a PSI is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>confidential from \u201cpublic inspection\u201d \u201c[ejxcept on court order.\u201d Although, the determination as to whether to permit access to a PSI should be made with utmost care, it is still well within the authority of a court to make. As a United States District Court stated in 1996:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">This determination does not end the court\u2019s inquiry, however, for a presentence report\u2019s presumption of confidentiality is not absolute. A third-party[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] seeking access to a presentence report may overcome the report\u2019s confidentiality by demonstrating that disclosure will \u201cserve the ends of justice,\u201d <em>[United States v.] Schlette, </em>842 F.2d [1574,] 1579 [ (9th Cir.1988) ]; <em>[United States v.] McKnight, </em>771 F.2d [388,] 390 [ (8th Cir.1985) ], or by establishing a \u201ccompelling, particularized need for disclosure,\u201d <em>Huckaby, </em>43 F.3d at 138; <em>Corbitt, </em>879 F.2d at 239 [n. 5.] Applying this standard requires a fact specific inquiry in which the need for confidentiality is balanced against the desirability of releasing a presentence report.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] <em>Huckaby, </em>43 F.3d at 139; <em>Schlette, </em>842 F.2d at 1579, 1583; <em>Charmer, </em>711 F.2d at 1173. The showing required of the party seeking disclosure will vary with the degree to which the need for confidentiality is present in a particular case. <em>Schlette, </em>842 F.2d at 1583 (citing <em>United States Indus., Inc. v. United States Dist. Court, </em>345 F.2d 18, 21 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 814, 86 S.Ct. 32, 15 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965)). This determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Huckaby, </em>43 F.3d at 138; <em>Schlette, </em>842 F.2d at 1577.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\"><em>United States v.

State, </em>292 Md. 683, 441 A.2d 708 (1982), a case in which we decided whether a statement made by the accused to a probation officer conducting a presentence investigation was admissible in a subsequent trial for the purpose of impeachment. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">Hall\u2019s last contention is that admitting Monk\u2019s testimony was a violation of Maryland Code ([1957,] 1971 [Repl.Vol.], 1981 Cum.Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 124(b)[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] and Maryland Rule 771(b).[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] In pertinent part, section 124(b) provides that \u201cpresentence reports shall be confidential and not available for public inspection except upon court order or for use by any correctional institution.\u201d Maryland Rule 771(b) tracks section 124(b) and provides that a presentence report \u201cis not a public record and shall be kept confidential as provided in Article 41, \u00a7 124(b) of the Maryland Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">The short answer to this contention is that the report was not introduced nor was the substance of the report made public. The information provided the probation agent is the kind (such as name, age, home address) routinely and preliminarily ascertained in any interview and is not gathered for the purpose of incriminating the defendant. In our view this type of information was not intended by the Legislature to be protected by \u00a7 124(b) and thus we find no violation of either the spirit or the letter of \u00a7 124(b) or Rule 771(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">We hold, therefore, that Monk\u2019s testimony based on the presentence interview was admissible to impeach Hall\u2019s statement made on direct examination and, as limited, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>testimony did not violate the confidentiality requirements of Article 41, \u00a7 124(b) or Rule 771(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 692, 441 A.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In the posture of the case at bar, when the trial court denied defendant the use of the PSI, it was not proposed that it be admitted into evidence. It was merely to be used for recollection refreshing purposes. Generally, when appropriate in the first instance, there are no limitations on the nature of the relevant documents that may be used in the refreshing of a witness\u2019s recollection. Such documents are not being admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">As we have discussed, supra, in Maryland, the determination as to whether to disclose otherwise confidential information contained within a PSI is a question committed to the authority of the trial court. However, this exercise of authority has little role in the use of already obtained PSI documents to refresh recollection. The trial court in the case sub <em>judice </em>erroneously believed that it was mandatory to keep the information contained within a PSI confidential under all circumstances, even though the PSI was already in the defendant\u2019s possession. When faced with defense counsel\u2019s assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>he was entitled to use the generally confidential PSI to refresh Campbell\u2019s recollection, the trial court repeatedly relied solely on the document\u2019s status as \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cfor official Court use only.\u201d The trial court failed to recognize that the confidentiality requirement related primarily to \u201cpublic inspection\u201d and would not apply to showing it to the subject for whom it was prepared, a person who had the right to see it. Additionally, the trial court failed to perceive any difference in respect to its use in official court proceedings to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection, and making it available for \u201cpublic inspection.\u201d In other words, the trial court erroneously concluded that it had no authority to allow the disclosure of the contents of the PSI because such information was always confidential. That is simply incorrect. The trial court\u2019s failure to permit defendant to utilize the PSI to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">b. Refreshing Recollection</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Whether a witness\u2019s recollection may be refreshed by a writing or by other means depends on the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. As we said in <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">While it is true that in many circumstances, an examining attorney must first establish that a witness\u2019s memory is exhausted before refreshing the recollection of that witness, <em>see </em>6 L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 612.1 (and cases cited therein), laying such a foundation is not an absolute prerequisite. Instead, the question of whether a witness\u2019s recollection may be refreshed by a writing or some other object depends upon the particular circumstances.... <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Publicker Industries, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 1361, 1363 (2d Cir.1981) (\u201cThere is no required, ritualistic formula for finding exhaustion of memory.\u201d) <em>State v.

Verodi, </em>150 Cal.App.2d 137, 150-51[,] 309 P.2d 568, 576-77 (2d.

McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 9 at 33-34 (4th ed. 1992) (\u201cThe witness may believe that she remembers completely but on looking at the memorandum she would be caused to recall additional facts.

It seems eminently a matter for discretion, rather than rule.\u201d); 3 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 765 at 145 (Chadbourn rev.

Anderson, </em>264 Md. 446, 453, 287 A.2d 270, 274 (1972); <em>Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 354-55, 667 A.2d 999, 1003-04 (1995); <em>Baker v.

Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 534-35, 673 A.2d 1117, 1129 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We also recognize the large amount of freedom that an attorney has when choosing an object with which a witness\u2019s recollection can be refreshed. It is important to note the distinction between the admission of a memorandum into evidence as past recorded recollection and a memorandum or other item used only to revive present recollection. The limitations and concerns present for past recollection recorded have little bearing on present recollection revived. As the Court of Special Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">When dealing with an instance of Past Recollection Recorded, the reason for the rigorous standards of admissibility is quite clear. Those standards exist to test the competence of the report or document in question. Since the piece of paper itself, in effect, speaks to the jury, the piece of paper must pass muster in terms of its evidentiary competence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">Not so with Present Recollection Revived! By marked contrast to Past Recollection Recorded, no such testimonial competence is demanded of a mere stimulus to present recollection, for the stimulus itself is never evidence. Notwithstanding the surface similarity between the two phenomena, the difference between them could not be more basic. <em>It is the difference between evidence and non-evidence. </em>Of such mere stimuli or memory-prods, McCormick says, at 18, \u201c[T]he cardinal rule is that they are not evidence, but only aids in the giving of evidence.\u201d When we are dealing with an instance of Present Recollection Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>vived, the only source of evidence is the testimony of the witness himself. The stimulus may have jogged the witness\u2019s dormant memory, but the stimulus itself is not received in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><em>Baker, </em>35 Md.App. at 598-99, 371 A.2d at 702-03 (footnotes omitted) (alterations in original). Generally, an attorney is given wide latitude with choosing the item to be used to refresh a witness\u2019s memory. This is because the item is not admitted into evidence \u2014 the memory that is triggered, and ultimately testified about, is the admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In respect to notes taken of statements made by a person deceased at the time of trial, the attorney was permitted to refresh his recollection in our early case of <em>Waters v. Waters, </em>35 Md. 531 (1872), even though the notes themselves may not have been admissible. We said: \u201c[I]t cannot be understood as deciding that the notes of the testimony taken by a Judge or counsel are <em>per se </em>evidence. Such notes are mere memoran-da, which may be used to refresh the memory of the witness who took them; but are not of themselves evidence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540; <em>see also Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, 377, 247 A.2d 530, 538 (1968) (where a witness used a written, but not signed, confession to refresh his recollection \u201c[w]e [found] no merit in the appellant\u2019s contention that it was error to permit the State\u2019s witness to refresh his recollection.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds by, </em>408 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 2851, 33 L.Ed.2d 747 (1972); <em>Askins v.

Rappy, </em>157 F.2d 964 (2d Cir.1946), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">When a party uses an earlier statement of his own witness to refresh the witness\u2019 memory, the only evidence recognized as such is the testimony so refreshed; and the party may not put the statement in evidence, although the other side may do so, and apparently the jury may call for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>it, sua sponte.... Anything may in fact revive a memory: a song, a scent, a photograph, and allusion, even a past statement known to be false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 967 (footnote omitted); <em>see State v. Souza, </em>708 A.2d 899, 903 (R.I.1998) (\u201c[A]ny writing or object may be used in an effort to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection.\u201d); <em>see also Wilson v. State, </em>511 N.E.2d 1014 (Ind.1987); <em>Maryfield Plantation, Inc. v. Harris Gin Co., </em>116 Ga.App. 744, 159 S.E.2d 125 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">While we have not addressed the issue, the fact that a document used to refresh recollection might not otherwise be admissible, or even that it was obtained improperly, has been held by other jurisdictions to be no bar to its being used to refresh recollection. In <em>State v. Poirier, </em>694 A.2d 448, 450 (Me.1997), the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held: \u201c[A]t the very most, the notes were used to refresh the memory of the witness. In such circumstances, <em>the fact that a document is not admissible </em>does not prevent its use as a means of refreshing the recollection of a witness .... [t]he only question is whether a document ... is generally calculated to revive the witness\u2019s memory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey in <em>State v. Carter, </em>91 N.J. 86, 449 A.2d 1280, 1299 (1982), <em>aff'd in part, dismissed in part on other grounds by Carter v. Rafferty, </em>826 F.2d 1299 (3d Cir.1987), permitted letters that had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, to be used to refresh recollection. In respect to the defendants\u2019 assertion that the letters could not be used, even for memory refreshment, because they were unconstitutionally obtained, the New Jersey court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">This [the defendants\u2019] rationale ignores the established distinction between a document that is evidential and one used to refresh a witness\u2019s recollection. Once a proper foundation has been laid, a witness may examine any document to refresh his memory. The oft-quoted statement of Lord Ellenborough in <em>Henry v. Lee, 2 Chitty, </em>124, 124 (1814), sets forth the general rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">[I]f upon looking at any document he can so far refresh his memory as to recollect a circumstance, it is sufficient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and it makes no difference that the memorandum is not written by himself, for it is not the memorandum that is the evidence but the recollection of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">Preliminarily the trial court must decide whether the memorandum does refresh the witness\u2019s recollection. It may decline to permit its use where the danger of undue suggestion outweighs the probable value of the evidence. In making this decision the trial court may consider the nature of the memorandum and the witness\u2019s testimony, including cross-examination, by which counsel may test the witness\u2019s credibility that his memory has been revived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">The admissible evidence is the recollection of the witness, and not the extrinsic paper. The test is whether the witness puts before the court his independent recollection and knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 122-23, 449 A.2d at 1299-1300 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Documents, otherwise confidential, have been held to be permitted to refresh the recollection of a witness. The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 231-35, 60 S.Ct. 811, 848-49, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940) in reference to use of grand jury testimony to refresh recollection, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to permit defense counsel to inspect the transcript of grand jury testimony used to refresh the recollection of certain witnesses called by the government....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">... As once stated by Judge Hough, \u201cThe bald fact that the memory refreshing words are found in the records of a grand jury is not a valid objection.\u201d Normally, of course, the material so used must be shown to opposing counsel upon demand, if it is handed to the witness.... Grand jury testimony is ordinarily confidential. But after the grand jury\u2019s, functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>If the record showed that the refreshing material was deliberately used for purposes <em>not material </em>to the issues but to arouse the passions of the jurors, so that an objective appraisal of the evidence was unlikely, there would be reversible error. Likewise there would be error where under the pretext of refreshing a witness\u2019 recollection, the prior testimony was introduced as evidence. But here the grand jury testimony was used simply to refresh the recollection on <em>material facts </em>....

Presentence reports vary in scope and focus, but typically contain at least the following items: (1) complete description of the situation surrounding the criminal activity; (2) offender\u2019s educational background; (3) offender\u2019s employment background; (4) offender's social history; (5) residence history of the offender; (6) offender\u2019s medical history; (7) information about environment to which the offender will return; (8) information about any resources available to assist the offender; (9) probation officer\u2019s view of the offender\u2019s motivations and ambitions; (10) full description of the defendant\u2019s criminal record; and, (11) recommendation as to disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">.

During recodification, section 6-112 was moved from Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Article 41, section 4-609 into the newly created Correctional Services Article by 1999 Maryland Laws, Chapter 54 \"without substantive change.\u201d Prior to this recodification, section 4-609(b) stated in relevant part, \u201d[t]he presentence reports are confidential and not available for public inspection <em>except upon court order.\" </em>(emphasis added).

Prior to 1972, the correlating statute did not include language concerning presentencing reports or their confidentiality from \"public inspection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. For a general discussion on the underlying purposes behind PSI confidentiality, <em>see Baltimore Sun v. Thanos, </em>92 Md.App. 227, 236-37, 607 A.2d 565, 569-70 (1992) in which a newspaper sought to gain access to a PSI for possible use in articles to be published to the general public. In <em>Thanos, </em>the Court of Special Appeals noted \"[c]learly <em>'publication </em>of the contents of a presentence report [to third persons] would tend to discourage full disclosure\u2019 to the sentencer from its best sources....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 607 A.2d at 570 (emphasis added) (alteration in original). In the case at bar, actual publication to the general public was never an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">. In the case at bar, petitioner's attorney received Campbell\u2019s PSI via subpoena. Whether such granting of Campbell\u2019s PSI to petitioner\u2019s attorney was appropriate is not before this Court. As we noted in footnote 11, section 6-112(a)(3) makes a PSI available to a defendant (the subject of the report) upon request. Some of the reasons for keeping a PSI confidential would not even apply in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">We note, nonetheless, that the fact that we do not address the appropriateness of the method by which defense counsel obtained the PSI in this case should not be construed as an approval of that method by this Court, nor as any authority for obtaining such reports in this fashion. That issue is not before us. We note further that, generally, administrative entities should not release PSI reports to anyone not specifically permitted by statute or rule to receive them, except upon an express order of court signed by a judge. Normally, consideration by a court may be accomplished by the administrative entity responding to a demand or request by filing a motion to quash, the filing of responsive pleadings by the requesting party, and the holding of any required hearings. In the responsive pleading and in the hearing, if any, the requesting party would have the burden of establishing a particularized need for the report, and the trial court would need to exercise its discretion by balancing the relative interests of the parties before arriving at its decision on whether to quash the request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. The only \"third party,\u201d petitioner, already had the PSI. The person to whom he was going to show the PSI, Campbell, is specifically permitted by statute or rule to see it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. The PSI was not proffered for \u201crelease\u201d to \u201cpublic inspection,\u201d nor was it, at the time the court ruled that it could not be used, proffered into evidence, but it was proposed, by a person who already had it, to be shown for memory refreshing purposes to a person who had an absolute right to see it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">. In <em>Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 602 A.2d 1247 (1992), a case in which a criminal defendant requested disclosure of his victim\u2019s confidential educational school records in order to impeach her credibility, we provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">In cases in which access to confidential and/or sensitive records is sought by a defendant and which will be resolved based on credibility considerations, because of which, the trial court determines the \"need to inspect\u201d threshold has been crossed, the court may elect to review the records alone, to conduct the review in the presence of counsel, or to permit review by counsel alone, as officers of the court, subject to such restrictions as the court requires to protect the records\u2019 confidentiality. Which option the court chooses must depend on various factors, including the degree of sensitivity of the material to be inspected; the strength of the showing of the \"need to inspect\u201d; whether the information sought is readily identifiable; considerations of judicial economy, etc. The greater the \"need to inspect\u201d showing, <em>i.e., </em>as here, where it is self-evident, and the less sensitive the information, for example, the more likely the records will be reviewed jointly by the court and counsel or by counsel as officers of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 87, 602 A.2d at 1263-64. This standard would be consistent with our treatment of third party requests to breach grand jury confidentiality set out in <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 437, </em>316 Md. 66, 82-83, 557 A.2d 235, 243 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\">. Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol., 1981 Cum.Supp.), Article 41, section 124(b) is now section 6-112(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. Maryland Rule 771 is now Maryland Rule 4-341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\">. Additionally, when the court is required to confront the issue of access to a PSI, an issue not before this Court in this case, the court can limit the disclosure of the information contained in the PSI to be only as broad as necessary. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it appears that the defense counsel merely wanted to refresh the recollection of the witness who was the subject of the PSI, to the specifics of the crimes he committed. The PSI was not being admitted into evidence. It, so far as we can discern from the record, was not being submitted to a jury, and the information defense counsel wanted to refresh Campbell\u2019s memory with was merely concerned with Campbell\u2019s past admissions. As stated in <em>United States v. Schlette, </em>842 F.2d 1574, 1581 (9th Cir.1988), \"if the reasons for maintaining [confidentiality] do not apply at all in a given case, or apply only to an insignificant degree, the party seeking disclosure should <em>not </em>be required to demonstrate a large compelling need.\u201d (alterations in original). In the case at bar, it can be argued that few, if any, of the reasons for confidentiality as to prohibiting \"public inspection\u201d exist when the report was to be shown only to the subject of the report to refresh his recollection. Moreover, as we have reiterated, access to the PSI was not the issue in this case. The defendant already had it; the witness was entitled, by statute, to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. <em>And see Plotkin v.
