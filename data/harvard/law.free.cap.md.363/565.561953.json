Section 27-2 of the County Code creates the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission and. provides for its jurisdiction. The County\u2019s general anti-discrimination policies, as well as the administration and duties of the Commission, are set out in \u00a7\u00a7 27-1 through 27-7B. The remainder of Chapter 27 is divided into four parts, namely, discrimination in places of public accommodation (\u00a7\u00a7 27-8 through 27-10), discrimination in real estate (\u00a7\u00a7 27-11 through 27-16C), discrimination in employment (\u00a7\u00a7 27-17 through 27-26), and intimidation (\u00a7\u00a7 27-26A through H).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The two cases before this Court concern the third division, employment discrimination. Section 27-17 declares that it is Montgomery County\u2019s public policy \u201cto foster equal employment opportunity for all without regard to race, color, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, sex, marital status, age, handicap, or sexual orientation and strictly in accord with their individual merits as human beings.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 27-19 provides in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\u201cSection 27-19. Unlawful Employment Practices.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice to do any of the following acts because of the race, color, religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>creed, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, marital status, handicap, or sexual orientation of any individual or because of any reason that would not have been asserted but for the race, color, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, marital status, handicap, or sexual'orientation of the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">(1) For an employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">(a) To fail or refuse to hire or fail to accept the services of or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">(2) For a religious corporation, association or society to hire and employ employees of a particular religion <em>to perform purely religious functions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The State Legislature, in Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 42, has authorized a circuit court civil action for damages or other relief by \u201ca person who is subjected to an act of discrimination prohibited by the [Montgomery] county code.... \u201d The present cases were brought pursuant to Art. 49B, \u00a7 42.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in these cases were employees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Montrose Christian School, and they claimed that they were terminated by the school\u2019s principal on the basis of their religious creed in violation of the County\u2019s employment dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>crimination law. The issues before us concern the monetary liability of the school and the principal under Art. 49B, \u00a7 42, and \u00a7 27-19 of the County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">This opinion encompasses two cases; consequently, we shall set forth the facts and procedural history of each case separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\n<em>A. No. 147, Montrose Christian School, et al. v. Carver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Montrose Christian School Corporation is a private, religious school affiliated with the Montrose Baptist Church in Montgomery County, Maryland. The school and the church operate on the same grounds for which only one sign, \u201cMont-rose Baptist Church,\u201d is displayed. The school provides education to children from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Enrollment is not limited to students whose families are members of the church or to students who are Baptist. The majority of students attending the school are not members of the church. Students belonging to a variety of religions and denominations attend the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">According to the school\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Church Board of Deacons elects the School Board, all of whom are required to be members of the Church. The Pastor of the Church is an \u201cex officio\u201d member of the School Board and is the supervisor of the school\u2019s principal. The Bylaws provide that the \u201cPrincipal shall carry out the administration of the school under the direction of the Pastor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Pastor Ray Hope became the new Pastor of the Church in February 1996. In June 1996, the school promoted defendant Gregory Scheck, formerly vice principal, to principal of the school. Changes in administrative policy at the school followed the change in pastors. All employees of the school who were not members of the Montrose Baptist Church, with the exception of two janitors, were discharged from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The plaintiff Barbara Anne Carver began working for the school as a teacher\u2019s aide in 1990. At the time she was hired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the school knew that she was not a member of the church and was not a Baptist. Carver\u2019s position required her to perform tasks such as copying, typing, grading papers, and generally assisting school staff and teachers in administrative ways. Carver is not a certified teacher, does not have a teaching degree, and has never been employed as a teacher. Carver was fired by the defendant Scheck in June 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Carver filed a charge of employment discrimination with the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission, and more than 45 days passed without resolution of the charge. Carver then filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against the school and Scheck alleging employment discrimination and seeking both damages and injunctive relief. Specifically, Carver alleged that the defendants fired her for the sole reason that she was not a member of the church and that firing her for that reason violated \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of their religious creed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In response, the defendants contended that their action fell within the exceptions to the employment discrimination law and, farther, that they were immune from liability under the doctrine of charitable immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants also assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ed that the application of Montgomery County\u2019s employment discrimination law to the school and Scheck violated the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the guarantee of freedom of association under the First Amendment, and Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Moreover, the defendants argued that the County\u2019s law was preempted because the local law impermissibly conflicts with state law prohibiting employment discrimination. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl. Yol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 18. Montgomery County intervened in the lawsuit for the purpose of defending the local law on constitutional and preemption grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The Circuit Court resolved the action for damages in Carver\u2019s favor following a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts. The court held that the defendants had engaged in an unlawful employment practice in violation of \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code when they terminated Carver\u2019s employment because of her religious creed. The court determined that none of the statutory exceptions in \u00a7 27-19 applied to the defendants\u2019 conduct. The court further held that Montgomery County\u2019s employment discrimination law does not impermissibly conflict with state law. The Circuit Court also held that the application of \u00a7 27-19 to the defendants did not violate the First Amendment or the Maryland Constitution. Finally, the court ruled that the defendants were not entitled to the defense of charitable immunity. Judgment was entered awarding Carver $15,000.00 in damages and awarding $16,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, for a total of $31,000.00. The court denied the request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The defendants filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before argument in the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Montrose Christian School v. Carver, </em>358 Md. 162, 747 A.2d 644 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>B. No. 144, Montrose Christian School, et al. v. Walsh, et al.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In 1979, the plaintiff Mary Lou Jones began working at the school as the bookkeeper and the principal\u2019s secretary. The school hired the plaintiff Sharon M. Walsh in 1982 'for a secretarial position handling registration-type duties and general administrative tasks. The plaintiff Helen E. Poole was hired as a cafeteria worker in 1989. Poole\u2019s duties included planning menus, ordering food, preparing meals, and cleaning up. The three plaintiffs are not members of the church and are not Baptists. Scheck terminated the employment of each of the plaintiffs in June 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Montgomery County Human Relations Commission charging the school and Scheck with employment discrimination based on religious creed in violation of \u00a7 27-19. More than 45 days passed without resolution of the administrative complaint, and the plaintiffs then filed an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking damages and injunctive relief against the school and Scheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 discrimination claims, the defendants asserted the same defenses described in the <em>Carver </em>case discussed above. Also, as in the <em>Carver </em>case, Montgomery County intervened in the Circuit Court for the purpose of defending the validity of the Montgomery County law.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on the exceptions under the Montgomery County Code, the constitutional issues, the question of preemption by conflict, and charitable immunity. The Circuit Court denied the summary judgment motion. The court did grant a motion by the plaintiffs to exclude evidence relating to the \u201cbona fide occupational qualification\u201d and \u201cundue hardship\u201d exceptions in the local law, thus preventing the defendants from asserting those defenses at trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-19(d)(l) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>After the presentation of evidence relating to the reasons for terminating the plaintiffs\u2019 employment, the jury found that each of the plaintiffs had been terminated by the school and by Scheck because of their religious creed. Compensatory damages were awarded to each of the three plaintiffs. Subsequently, the Circuit Court filed an opinion holding that the local law did not conflict with state law and that the application of \u00a7 27-19 to the conduct of the defendants did not violate the Establishment Clause, the Free Exercise Clause, or the guarantee of freedom of association under the First Amendment. The court further held that there was no violation of Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In rejecting the constitutional defenses, the court stated that it was persuaded by the evidence which indicated that \u201cthe duties of the plaintiffs were not the formulation or implementation of policy nor were they educational or instructive in nature, but rather administrative and ministerial.\u201d The court did hold that the school was entitled to charitable immunity but that such immunity did not extend to Scheck. In accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts, judgments for compensatory damages, in various amounts, were rendered for each of the three plaintiffs against Scheck. The court denied the request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Both the defendants and the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to argument in the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>appellate court, the plaintiffs filed in this Court a petition for a writ a certiorari and the defendants filed a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted both the petition and the cross-petition. <em>Walsh v. Montrose Christian School, </em>357 Md. 481, 745 A.2d 436 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The parties in both cases present substantially the same issues for appellate review. We restate the three principal questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">I. Whether \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code is in conflict with, and thus preempted by, Maryland Code (1957,1998 RepLVoL), Art. 49B, \u00a7 18;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">II. Whether the doctrine of charitable immunity precludes the award of damages against the school and Scheck;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">III. Whether \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">If the defendants prevail under either the first or the second of the questions set forth above, it would not be necessary for us to reach the constitutional issues in the third question. Consistent with the \u201c \u2018principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we shall first consider the conflict and charitable immunity issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Montgomery County has charter home rule under the Home Rule Amendment, Article XI A of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>357 Md. 237, 246-249, 743 A.2d 748, 753-755 (2000); <em>Haub v. Montgomery County, </em>353 Md. 448, 450, 727 A.2d 369-370 (1999); <em>McCrory v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 16, 570 A.2d 834, 835 (1990). The Home Rule Amendment enables those counties adopting a home rule charter to enjoy a significant amount of self-governance by transferring the General Assembly\u2019s power to enact many types of public local laws to the home rule counties themselves. Nevertheless, under Article XI-A, \u00a7 1, \u201c[a] local government ordinance which conflicts with a public general law enacted by the General Assembly is preempted and thus is invalid.\u201d <em>Coalition v. Annapolis Lodge, </em>333 Md. 359, 379, 635 A.2d 412, 422 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The defendants in the instant cases argue that \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code is preempted by Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 18, because the County\u2019s employment discrimination law does not provide a broad exemption from coverage for religious organizations such as is afforded under state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Specifically, the defendants assert that \u00a7 27-19 of the County Code, prohibiting religious organizations from discriminating in employment on the basis of religious creed, fatally conflicts with state law which contains no such prohibition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The State\u2019s employment discrimination law is codified at Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14 through 18. In contrast to the Montgomery County Code, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>state law exempts religious organizations from the prohibition against religious creed discrimination. Art. 49B, \u00a7 18, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cThis subtitle shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside of the State, or to a religious corporation, association, educational institution or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution or society of its activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The state statute was modeled after the federal anti-discrimination law, <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 632, 672 A.2d 608, 614 (1996), providing the same broad exemption for religious organizations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>Thus, the state law, like its federal counterpart, does not prohibit discrimination by religious organizations based on religious creed. According to the defendants, this exemption in the state statute means that the local law and state law are in conflict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The controlling Maryland principle in determining preemption by conflict was set forth in <em>Talbot County v. Skipper, </em>329 Md. 481, 487 n. 4, 620 A.2d 880, 882 n. 4 (1993), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201cA local ordinance is pre-empted by conflict when it prohibits an activity which is intended to be permitted by state law, or permits an activity which is intended to be prohibited by state law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\"><em>See Soaring Vista Properties v. Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>356 Md. 660, 741 A.2d 1110 (1999); <em>Holiday v. Anne Arundel, </em>349 Md. 190, 210, 707 A.2d 829, 839 (1998); <em>Coalition v. Annapolis Lodge, supra, </em>333 Md. at 380, 635 A.2d at 422; <em>Allied Vending v. Bowie, </em>332 Md. 279, 297 n. 12, 631 A.2d 77, 86 n. 12 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Although discrimination by religious organizations on the basis of religious creed is not covered by state law, this Court has held that noncoverage does not mean that such activity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>authorized by the state statute. In <em>Annapolis Lodge, </em>333 Md. at 380, 635 A.2d at 422, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">\u201c[O]ur cases have recognized a distinction between a state law which is intended to permit or authorize a particular matter and a state law which is simply intended to exempt the particular matter from its coverage. When a state law simply excludes a particular activity from its coverage, our cases have not attributed to the General Assembly an intent to preempt local legislation regulating or prohibiting that activity. Instead, in such situations supplementary local legislation has not been deemed to be in conflict with and preempted by the state statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>See Holiday v. Anne Arundel, supra, </em>349 Md. at 211 n. 6, 707 A.2d at 840 n. 6 (\u201cWhen state law simply regulates a matter to a limited extent, our cases have not ordinarily attributed to the General Assembly an intent to preempt local law regulating the matter to a greater extent\u201d); <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, supra, </em>341 Md. at 636, 672 A.2d at 615-616; <em>National Asphalt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>292 Md. 75, 80-81, 437 A.2d 651, 654 (1981); <em>City of Baltimore v. Sitnick, </em>254 Md. 303, 324, 255 A.2d 376, 385-386 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The state employment discrimination law simply excludes religious organizations from coverage of the religious creed anti-discrimination provision in the state statute. Instead of constituting an affirmative authorization to discriminate, Article 49B, \u00a7 18, merely removes religious organizations from the scope of the state law with regard to religious creed discrimination. Under the above-cited cases, there is no conflict between Art. 49B, \u00a7 18, and \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">As previously stated, the Circuit Court in No. 147 ruled that neither the school nor Scheck was entitled to the defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>charitable immunity with regard to their statutory liability for damages. In No. 144, however, the Circuit Court held that the defendant school was immune from liability because of charitable immunity. The court further held that the defendant Scheck could not avail himself of the defense of charitable immunity. In this Court, the defendants argue that both the school and Scheck are entitled to the defense of charitable immunity. The plaintiffs urge that the common law doctrine of charitable immunity is not a defense to liability imposed by statute, and that the Circuit Court erred in No. 144 by holding that the defense of charitable immunity protected the school. We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The doctrine of charitable immunity was first recognized in Maryland in <em>Perry v. House of Refuge, </em>63 Md. 20 (1885), and has been reaffirmed by this Court in a line of decisions. <em>See Abramson v. Reiss, </em>334 Md. 193, 197, 206-209, 638 A.2d 743, 744-745, 749-751 (1994), and cases there cited. This judge-made doctrine is intended to protect charitable organizations from tort liability. Under Maryland law, charitable immunity is premised on the trust fund theory, that is, because funds of the organization are impressed with a trust for charitable purposes, those funds should not be diverted to pay tort damage awards. <em>See Loeffler v. Trustees of Sheppard &amp; Enoch Pratt Hospital, </em>130 Md. 265, 100 A. 301 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the school is a bona fide charitable organization for the purpose of the doctrine of charitable immunity. <em>See Abramson v. Reiss, supra, </em>334 Md. at 200-201, 638 A.2d at 746-747; <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 336-337, 418 A.2d 1173, 1185 (1980). Nevertheless, the defense is not available to shelter the school or Scheck from liability imposed by the Montgomery County employment discrimination law and Art. 49B, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">As pointed out above, the charitable immunity defense applies only to tort actions.

Fear of potential liability might affect the way an organization carried out what it understood to be its religious mission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">\u201cAfter a detailed examination of the legislative history of the 1972 amendment, the District Court concluded that Congress\u2019 purpose was to minimize governmental \u2018inter-fer[ence] with the decision-making process in religions.\u2019 ...

The pre-1972 Title VII provision authorized religious organizations to employ persons \u201cof a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on\u201d of the employer\u2019s \u201creligious activities.\u201d Section 27-19(d)(2), however, only allows religious organizations to employ persons \u201cof a particular religion to perform purely religious functions.\u201d There is a difference between work \u201cconnected with the carrying on\u201d of religious activities and the narrower \u201cperform[ance]\u201d of religious functions.

The state may not intervene to protect employees from treatment that is merely arbitrary or unfair; the remedy for that is to resign or renegotiate the terms of employment. Modern labor legislation may have deprived secular employers of the fiduciary duty once owed them by their rank and file employees, but to deprive churches of that duty would be to interfere with an interest protected by the free exercise clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Turning to \u00a7 27 \u2014 19(d)(2) of the Montgomery County Code, it is obvious that the provision effectively contains no exemption allowing religious organizations to employ only persons of a particular religion. Although the first sixteen words of \u00a7 27-19(d)(2) ostensibly allow religious organizations \u201cto hire and employ employees of a particular religion,\u201d the next five words limit the authorization to the hiring of employees \u201cto perform purely religious functions.\u201d The limitation effectively nullifies the exemption. It is doubtful that any employees of religious organizations in Montgomery County perform <em>purely </em>religious functions. Even ministers, pastors, priests, rabbis, and other theological heads of religious organizations occasionally perform functions which would not ordinarily be characterized as \u201creligious.\u201d Many other employees of religious organizations, such as teachers, may perform both religious and non-religious functions. Nonetheless, as shown by the previously discussed cases, the constitutional free exercise guarantee restricts governmental interference with a religious organization\u2019s hiring and firing of employees who are involved in the religious activities of the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Apparently recognizing the constitutional problems with the \u201cto perform purely religious functions\u201d limitation in \u00a7 27-19(d)(2), Montgomery County argues that \u201cthe term \u2018purely religious functions\u2019 should be read to mean \u2018primarily ministerial duties.\u2019 \u201d (Montgomery County\u2019s brief in No. 147, at 14 n. 17). The County relies on the principle that a court should \u201c \u2018construe\u2019 \u201d a statute \u201c \u2018so as to avoid conflict with the Constitution....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14-15 n. 17). The plaintiffs suggest that the language should be construed to mean \u201csome significant functions\u201d that are religious. (Plaintiffs\u2019 brief in No. 144, at 16 n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The principle of statutory construction relied on by Montgomery County is that \u201c \u2018a construction of a statute, giving rise to doubts as to its constitutionality, should be avoided <em>if the language permits.\u2019 \u201d Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 377, 451 A.2d 107, 111 (1982), quoting <em>Baltimore County v. Mo. Realty, </em>219 Md. 155, 159, 148 A.2d 424, 427 (1959) (emphasis in the <em>Davis </em>opinion). <em>See also Becker v. State, </em>363 Md. 77, 767 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>816 (2001), and cases there cited. In <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>294 Md. at 378, 451 A.2d at 111, we declined to construe a state statute so as to avoid holding it unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because \u201c[t]he construction of [the statute] urged by the petitioner Davis ... is not permitted by the statutory language.\u201d In <em>Davis, </em>which involved a statutory exemption from the compulsory immunization law for pupils in elementary schools, the Court continued <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\u201cThe General Assembly expressly limited the exemption to members or adherents of a recognized church or religious denomination opposing immunization. To excise the phrase \u2018the tenets and practice of a recognized church or religious denomination of which he is an adherent or member,\u2019 and insert the phrase \u2018his religious beliefs,\u2019 as contended for by the petitioner, would be to re-draft the statute under the guise of construction. In the language of Justice Harlan dealing with a similar contention, it would be \u2018to assume an Alice in Wonderland world where words have no meaning,\u2019 <em>Welsh v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 333, 354, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970) (concurring opinion). This we decline to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Similarly, in the cases at bar, to substitute the phrases \u201cto perform <em>primarily </em>ministerial duties\u201d or \u201cto perform <em>some </em>religious functions\u201d for the statutory language \u201cto perform <em>purely </em>religious functions,\u201d would also \u201cbe to re-draft the [ordinance] under the guise of construction.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>294 Md. at 378, 451 A.2d at 111. The statutory phrase \u201cto perform purely religious functions\u201d clearly does not mean what is suggested by Montgomery County or by the plaintiffs. We decline to construe \u201cpurely\u201d as if it were \u201cprimarily\u201d or \u201csome.\u201d <em>See also, e.g., Wheeler v.

Under Maryland law, \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption that if a portion of an enactment is found to be invalid, the intent [of the legislative body] is that such portion be severed.\u201d <em>Board v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 245, 608 A.2d 1222, 1234 (1992). <em>See, e.g., Sugarloaf Citizens Assoc. v. Gudis, </em>319 Md. 558, 574, 573 A.2d 1325, 1333 (1990); <em>Porten Sullivan Corp. v. State, </em>318 Md. 387, 410, 568 A.2d 1111, 1122 (1990); <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 297, 554 A.2d 366, 387 (1989), and cases there cited. \u201cThis presumption has never been limited solely to bills enacted by the General Assembly, but has been applied to local ordinances,\u201d <em>Board v. Smallwood, supra, </em>327 Md. at 245, 608 A.2d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Moreover, with regard to \u00a7 27-19(d)(2), not severing the last five words of \u00a7 27 \u2014 19(d)(2), and invalidating all of \u00a7 27-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>19(d)(2), would present the identical constitutional infirmity which infected the ordinance in its original form. If all of \u00a7 27-19(d)(2) is invalidated, there will be no exemption for the employment practices of religious organizations. Under \u00a7 27-19, without subsection (d)(2), a church in Montgomery County could not discriminate, based on religious creed, in its employment of a minister or pastor. This would make \u00a7 27-19 unconstitutional as applied to religious organizations. In order for \u00a7 27-19 to be valid under the First Amendment and under Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, there must be some exception to the prohibition against religious creed discrimination for religious organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Consequently, we hold that the last five words of \u00a7 27-19(d)(2) are invalid and are severable from the remaining language of \u00a7 27-19(d)(2). Under the remaining language of \u00a7 27-19(d)(2), the defendants were entitled to employ only members of the Montrose Baptist Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED, AND BOTH CASES ARE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENTS FOR THE DEFENDANTS.

We pointed out in <em>McCrory </em>that \"the creation of new causes of action in the courts has traditionally been done either by the General Assembly or by this Court under its authority to modify the common law\u201d and that \"the creation of new judicial remedies has traditionally been done on a statewide basis.\u201d 319 Md. at 20, 570 A.2d at 838. We concluded in <em>McCrory </em>by holding \"that an ordinance attempting to combat employment discrimination by creating a new private judicial cause of action is not a \u2018local law\u2019 under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, and thus is not within the power of Montgomery County to enact.\" <em>See also Sweeney v.

A somewhat similar provision, Article 49B, \u00a7 43, authorizes a civil action in Baltimore County. The General Assembly does not appear to have enacted similar provisions applicable in the other counties or Baltimore City.
