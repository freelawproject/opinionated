Clark, Jr., Esquire,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the petition, Bar Counsel alleged that respondent violated Rules l:15(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by failing to file his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Maryland income tax returns in a timely manner, if at all, failing to pay trust fund income taxes withheld from his employees\u2019 wages and by failing to maintain a separate ledger account for withholding tax monies. This Court referred the matter to Judge Pamela L. North of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16 \u2014 709(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 16 \u2014 711(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, Judge North found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a), (b) and (c). The petitioner filed exceptions to Judge North\u2019s conclusions that respondent did not violate Rule 1.15(b) and Rule 8.4(d). Respondent did not take any exceptions. We sustain petitioner\u2019s exceptions and hold that respondent violated Rules 1.15(b), 8.4(a),(b),(c) and (d). In light of the mitigating factors present in this case, we shall suspend the respondent indefi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>nitely with an immediate right to reapply, subject to the conditions discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">This disciplinary action arose from respondent\u2019s failure to comply -with the income tax withholding requirements under Maryland law. Respondent employed Lola Robinson Ford as his secretary from June or July of 1991 to February 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As an employer, respondent was required to -withhold income taxes from his employees\u2019 salaries pursuant to \u00a7 10-906(a) of the Tax-General Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The respondent was required to maintain a separate account for the withholdings and hold them in trust for the State.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The respondent was also required to keep a ledger clearly showing the amount of tax -withheld and indicating that it was the property of the State.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In 1990, the Comptroller of the Treasury of the State of Maryland opened an employer\u2019s withholding tax account for respondent in the name of \u201cClark &amp; Clark, P.A.\u201d effective December 21, 1989. The respondent\u2019s withholding account was placed on a monthly filing and a quarterly payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>schedule for state income tax withheld from his employees\u2019 wages. Due to respondent\u2019s failure to file the required monthly withholding tax returns and to make quarterly payments, the Comptroller filed a Notice of Lien of Judgment for Unpaid Tax in the amount of $3,577.95 against Clark <em>&amp; </em>Clark, P.A. in the Circuit Court for Howard County on January 14, 1993.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In a Notice of Intent to Assess dated March 25, 1994, the Comptroller warned the respondent that unless he reported the actual amounts of delinquent tax he owed from September 1992-February 1994 within 10 days of the Notice, the amount would be estimated and he would be held responsible. Respondent did not supply the actual figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Respondent personally appeared at the Comptroller\u2019s Office on June 16, 1994, and paid $4,200 toward his outstanding balance, eliminating his tax liability (including interest and penalties) for 1991 and part of 1992. Respondent was credited $116.74, but was also notified that he was still delinquent for the period of September 1992-April 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On July 18, 1994, respondent again appeared in person to file his delinquent returns for the September 1992-May 1994 period and submitted a payment in the amount of $2,217.88. This money was applied to his outstanding tax debt (exclusive of penalties) from his September 1992, December 1992, and January-May 1994 returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On August 15, 1994, respondent made a payment in the amount of $3,433.45 which was applied to the tax from his January-December 1993 returns. On December 6, 1994, respondent made a payment in the amount of $400.00 which was applied to the outstanding interest and penalty for 1992 and 1993. On June 29, 1995, respondent filed his June-December 1994 and January-May 1995 withholding tax returns without making any tax payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The Comptroller filed a second Notice of Lien of Judgment for unpaid tax on June 25, 1996 against Clark <em>&amp; </em>Clark, P.A. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the Circuit Court for Howard County, claiming $6,990.74.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On August 23, 1996, the Comptroller posted an MW-508<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for tax year 1995 with attached W-2\u2019s totaling $2,773.86 and respondent\u2019s account was charged $207148 in order to balance his withholding tax account for 1995. Respondent did not pay the tax for the period of September-December 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Comptroller filed a third Notice of Lien Judgment for unpaid tax on December 23, 1996, against the respondent in the Circuit Court for Howard County claiming $7,281.74.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In a letter dated April 1, 1997, the Comptroller requested that respondent remit his total outstanding tax debt within ten days. On April 9, 1997, respondent filed his January 1996-May 1997 returns without payment of the appropriate tax, interest, and penalty, and requested to pay the Comptroller $350.00 for the months of May through July 1997, with the balance to be paid in August 1997. The Comptroller received payments from Respondent as follows: $700 on May 1, 1997,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> $250 on June 9, 1997,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and $500 on October 9, 1997.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Comptroller filed a fourth Notice of Lien Judgment on August 18, 1997, against respondent in the Circuit Court for Howard County claiming a lien for delinquent and unpaid tax in the amount of $11,244.82.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>On August 4, 1998, the Comptroller received from the respondent a payment in the amount of $325.96, which was applied to penalties for 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">On January 28, 1999, respondent filed his April 1997 though December 1998 returns without payment of the appropriate taxes, interest, or penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Comptroller\u2019s Office established an eighteen-month payment plan with the respondent to pay his balance of $12,410.85 on February 10, 1999. The agreement stipulated that respondent would make payments of $700.00 on the 15th of each month beginning on March 15, 1999 and would remain current on all future returns. Respondent made the first payment under the plan on March 11, 1999, but did not make the second payment which was due April 15, 1999. Since March 11,1999, respondent has made the following payments to the Comptroller: $1400 on May 11, 1999; $700 on June 18, 1999; $700 on July 30, 1999; and $700 on August 19, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In December 1999, the Comptroller\u2019s Office informed respondent that the payment arrangement was in default and that, therefore, the total withholding tax balance was due. Respondent paid $3,600 prior to the Inquiry Panel hearing on January 20, 2000 and $3,000 in August 2000, prior to the hearing before Judge North. According to the representations made by respondent, the remaining delinquent balance of $5,800 was paid by the time petitioner and respondent appeared before this Court on February 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In testimony before both the Inquiry Panel and Judge North, the respondent admitted that he knew he had a statutory duty to withhold taxes, accurately document his withholdings, and file and pay employee withholdings to the State. Respondent acknowledged that the W-2 forms he provided his employee indicated that money had been withheld for taxes, when in fact, the money had not been withheld for the sole purpose of remittance to the State. Respondent stated that his conduct was the result of both his lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>money and his inability to effectively manage money.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Respondent admitted to the allegations contained in the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s Petition for Disciplinary Action but denied that his actions violated MRPC 1.15 and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">II. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Judge North found that the petitioner had shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated \u00a7\u00a7 10-906(a) (c),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 10-817,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 13-1007<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> of the Maryland Tax-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>General Article. Respondent had filed Maryland withholding tax returns late or not at all and had failed to pay trust fund income taxes that he claimed were withheld from his employees\u2019 wages since January 1993. These facts are uncontested. The only factual finding requiring specific mention is Judge North\u2019s finding that while certain tax forms indicated that the respondent had withheld money, he never actually withheld money. Petitioner excepts to this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Judge North concluded that respondent violated Rules 8.4(a),(b), and (c). <em>See </em>Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4, <em>supra </em>note 3. By failing to comply with \u00a7 13-1007 of the Tax-General Article, respondent committed a criminal act, thus violating Rule 8.4(b). By misrepresenting to the Comptroller that monies were withheld, when in fact they were not, he violated Rule 8.4(c). Having found respondent in violation of these disciplinary rules, Judge North also found respondent in violation of Rule 8.4(a). Judge North found no violation of Rule 8.4(d) because it \u201c[could not] be said by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s conduct taken as a whole, has been \u2018prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u2019 \u201d explaining that the respondent had fully cooperated with the Attorney Grievance Commission throughout these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Judge North concluded that there was no violation of MRPC 1.15(a) because \u201cread strictly, Rule 1.15(a) requires the lawyer to hold \u2018property\u2019 of \u2018third persons <em>... in connection with a representation\u2019 </em>separately from the lawyers own property.\u201d Judge North stated that because Rule 1.15(a) specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>cally references an attorney\u2019s representation of a client, respondent\u2019s conduct did not seem to fall within the parameters of the Rule. With respect to Rule 1.15(b), Judge North concluded that significant statutory confusion surrounding the definition of \u201cthird person\u201d made it impossible to find by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated 1.15(b). The Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct do not define who is implicated by the phrase \u201cthird person,\u201d and thus, Judge North reviewed the definition of \u201cperson\u201d under the Tax-General Article<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the Maryland Rules<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to determine if the State could be considered a \u201cthird person\u201d to whom the respondent owed a duty to deliver property. Finding conflicting definitions, Judge North concluded that respondent could not be found in violation of Rule 1.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Petitioner filed exceptions to the conclusions that respondent did not violate Rule 1.15(b) or Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">As holder of original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings, the ultimate decision as to whether a lawyer has violated professional rules rests with this Court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16 \u2014 709(b); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 189, 711 A.2d 193, 200 (1998); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997) <em>(citing Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Joehl, </em>335 Md. 83, 88, 642 A.2d 194, 196 (1994)). Under an independent review of the record, this Court determines whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and convincing evidence. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 73, 753 A.2d 17, 26 (2000) <em>(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 189, 711 A.2d 193, 200 (1998)). The \u201chearing court\u2019s findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. (citing Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997)). The conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Briscoe, III, </em>357 Md. 554, 562, 745 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A. Exception Pertaining to Factual Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We sustain the petitioner\u2019s exception to Judge North\u2019s finding that respondent was guilty of the appearance of withholding which was made on certain tax forms but that no money was actually withheld. Because respondent admitted that he used monies withheld from Lola P. Ford-Robinson\u2019s salary for his own personal or business purposes, and that he used monies withheld from his salary for his own personal or business purposes, it is clearly erroneous to conclude that no money was actually withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">B. Exception Pertaining to Rule 1.15(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">This Court has not been called upon, until now, to determine whether the acts to which the respondent admits\u2014 failing timely to file withholding tax returns and/or to remit the taxes reportedly withheld and to hold in trust those taxes \u2014 fall within Rule 1.15(b). Judge North\u2019s conclusion that respondent did not violate Rule 1.15(b) was based solely on the perceived ambiguity of the definition of \u201cperson\u201d under that provision. If the State is a \u201cperson\u201d to whom the respondent owed a fiduciary duty, then the respondent violated Rule 1.15(b) by failing to \u201cpromptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive ...\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland RuleS of Professional Conduct 1.15(b), <em>supra </em>note 3. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct are set forth in the Appendix of the Maryland Rules pursuant to Rule 16-812,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the definition of \u201cperson,\u201d if ambiguous within the context of the MRPC Rule itself, should be construed under Maryland Rule l-202(r).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Maryland Rules define \u201cperson\u201d to include the State, and thus, the respondent was obligated to act as a fiduciary of the State\u2019s property (the withheld taxes) under MRPC 1.15(b).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This outcome is consistent with the purpose for which Rule 1.15 was enacted \u2014 to ensure the safekeeping of property not belonging to the attorney which he holds in trust for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Rule 1.15(a) and (c) are specific to a lawyer\u2019s duties \u201cin connection with a representation\u201d while Rule 1.15(b) refers generally to a lawyer\u2019s duty to act with the care of a professional fiduciary for <em>any </em>property held by an attorney on behalf of third persons. As articulated in the preamble to the Maryland Rules, \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer\u2019s business and personal affairs.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Preamble. As an officer of the court, the lawyer is a public servant; and as a public servant, the lawyer has a special responsibility to act in the public interest. Applying Rule 1.15(b) to the respondent\u2019s failure to file withholding tax returns and remit the taxes withheld to the State is consistent with these principles. We sustain petitioner\u2019s exception and find that respondent violated Rule 1.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">C. Exception Pertaining to Rule 8.4(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Judge North\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s cooperation with the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s investigation pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>eluded a finding of a violation of Rule 8.4(d) is incorrect. The standard for reviewing an 8.4(d) violation is not whether the attorney\u2019s post-event conduct is prejudicial to the administration of justice, but rather, whether the conduct which forms the basis of the Attorney Grievance Commission\u2019s charge was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Clearly an attorney\u2019s lack of cooperation with the Attorney Grievance Commission could, in and of itself, be a violation of Rule 8.4(d). The obverse does not follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The conduct which the Attorney Grievance Commission regarded as a violation of Rule. 8.4(d) was the respondent\u2019s failure to timely file withholding tax returns, to remit the taxes withheld and to hold the withheld taxes in trust, the very conduct which this Court has previously held to be \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Post, </em>350 Md. 85, 99, 710 A.2d 935, 942 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Baldwin, </em>this Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[An attorney\u2019s] willful failure to file withholding tax returns may seriously impair public confidence in the entire profession ... The lawyer, after all, is intimately associated with administration of the law and should rightfully be expected to set an example in observing the law. By willfully failing to file his tax returns, a lawyer appears to the public to be placing himself above that law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">308 Md. 397, 407-08, 519 A.2d 1291, 1297 (1987) (citing, in part, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Walman, </em>280 Md. 453, 464-65, 374 A.2d 354, 361 (1977)). Public confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice. Respondent\u2019s conduct, similar to that of Baldwin\u2019s, erodes public confidence, and thus, is prejudicial to the administration of justice. We sustain petitioner\u2019s exception and find that respondent violated Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">V. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">This Court is mindful that the purpose of the sanctions is to protect the public, to deter other lawyers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Hess, </em>352 Md. 438, 453, 722 A.2d 905, 913 (1999) <em>(quoting Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 678, 705 A.2d 1135, 1143 (1998)). We have stated that \u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Therefore, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 197-98, 711 A.2d 193, 204 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Post, </em>350 Md. at 101, 710 A.2d at 943, Chief Judge Bell, writing for the Court, addressed several mitigating factors which affected the ultimate sanction issued by this Court for an attorney\u2019s failure to file withholding income tax returns, to remit taxes withheld, and to hold withheld taxes in trust \u2014 the very charges before us today. Similar mitigating factors are present in this case as well, namely, that there had never been a finding of fraudulent intent on the part of the respondent, that the respondent, while often late, never sought to avoid his obligation to file returns or remit taxes, and finally, that, as of the time of oral argument before this Court, respondent was current on \u2014 or in this case, had completed \u2014 the payment plan with the Comptroller. While respondent\u2019s conduct consisted of inveterate violations of the Tax-General Article throughout the duration of Ford\u2019s employment, respondent did attempt to come into compliance with the withholding tax requirements on several occasions \u2014 an indication of his willingness to confront the financial and managerial problems before him. In addition to paying the Comptroller\u2019s Office the outstanding balance in its entirety, the respondent in this case has taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>several additional steps to ensure that such violations will not occur again. Respondent testified before Judge North that he made arrangements with his accountant to maintain a continuous relationship by granting him authority over his accounts and monies, that he established escrow and payroll accounts and that he no longer employs persons other than himself. In light of these mitigating factors, we believe the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension with immediate right to reapply. Prior to reinstatement, we order respondent to provide, to the satisfaction of Bar Counsel, written documentation from the Comptroller\u2019s Office that he is in good standing with respect to his tax obligations, and written documentation demonstrating the establishment of escrow and payroll accounts and the accountant\u2019s authority to oversee those accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.
