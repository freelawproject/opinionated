At the time relevant to this action, i2t offered several ways for its customers to play bingo: (a) they could play the traditional live bingo game; (b) they could purchase instant bingo tickets, also known as \u201cpull-tabs\u201d or \u201cpull-tab\u201d tickets, from employees, who walk around the hall with large reels of tickets; (c) they could purchase paper pull-tab tickets from a dispenser, either a machine known as \u201cPlay <em>&amp; </em>Win\u201d or a machine known as \u201cLucky Tab II,\u201d the latter of which displays a video image of the symbols contained on the inside of each pull-tab dispensed; or (d) they could purchase the electronic version of the pull-tab ticket, using a machine known as the \u201cOasis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>There is no dispute on this appeal as to the traditional bingo game, and the parties are in agreement as to how instant bingo works. As to the latter, the Agreed Statement of the Case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cInstant bingo tickets are often referred to as \u2018pull-tab tickets\u2019 or \u2018pull-tabs.\u2019 A customer purchases one or more instant bingo/pull-tab tickets from a \u2018game\u2019 or \u2018deal\u2019 of such tickets. All the tickets in a given deal are identical in their outward appearance; some of the tickets entitle the persons who purchase them to receive prizes of specified value. Winning tickets are those that contain symbols on the inside that match designated winning combinations of such symbols. The total number of instant bingo tickets in a deal is a large but finite number<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; that number is determined when the deal is created or \u2018constructed\u2019 and does not change thereafter. The number of winning tickets at each prize level in a deal is also determined and known in advance; the winning tickets are randomly placed in the deal at the time the deal is constructed. Thus, the chances of purchasing a winning ticket are precisely calculable for the deal as a whole. As tickets (including winning tickets) are purchased, the chances of purchasing a winning ticket from among the tickets remaining in the deal will vary, but because the number of tickets involved is large and the tickets are purchased by many different individuals over a period of time, it is a practical impossibility for customers to calculate or even estimate how the chances of winning have been affected by previous purchases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On this appeal, only the Lucky Tab II machine is at issue. Neither in the trial court nor in this Court has the legality of pull-tab tickets sold manually been challenged. The question in the trial court was whether any or all of the machines used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>to dispense pull-tab tickets are prohibited slot machines. The circuit court determined, with respect to the Play &amp; Win machine, that it was a simple pull-tab dispenser with no player enhancements and, therefore, a legal gaming device. By contrast, the court found both the Lucky Tab II and the Oasis machines illegal slot machines. It characterized the Oasis machine as \u201cexactly the type of machine that the Legislature has sought to prohibit,\u201d noting that it is \u201centirely electronic\u201d with a \u201cnumber of player enhancement^\u201d and a choice of games and concluding that the Oasis machine, rather than a pull-tab dispenser, was a machine which tracks a player\u2019s winnings and losses through \u201can internal credit system,\u201d such that the player is not responsible for identifying a winning ticket.\u201d The appellant appealed the ruling as to the Lucky Tab II machine, but not as to the Oasis machines, and the appellee has not sought review with respect to the Win and Play machines. Therefore, the correctness of those rulings is not now at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Turning to the Lucky Tab II, it is an electrically operated machine that dispenses paper pull-tab tickets from a roll of preprinted paper pull-tabs inserted in the machine by a Chesapeake Amusements employee. Like the tickets that are sold manually or dispensed by the Play <em>&amp; </em>Win machine, each ticket dispensed by the Lucky Tab II is part of a particular deal of outwardly identical tickets, in which the total number of tickets, as well as the number of winning tickets, were determined when the deal was constructed and printed. A deal of the Lucky Tab II pull-tab tickets consists of four rolls of tickets containing seven thousand five hundred tickets each, for a total of thirty thousand tickets in the deal, each having printed on it for accounting and control purposes, the serial number of that deal and a roll number and ticket number. The tickets dispensed consist of two strips of paper sealed together by the manufacturer when the ticket is printed. When the two strips are separated, certain symbols appear on the inside of the ticket and certain combinations of those symbols entitle the purchaser to a prize, the amount of which is also determined by those symbols. The front of the ticket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>indicates to the purchaser where to pull it open. A winning ticket is labeled as such on the inside. In addition, the combinations of symbols that entitle the customer to a prize and the amount of the prize associated with each winning combination are listed on the front of the Lucky Tab II machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The agreed statement of facts detail the actual operation of the Lucky Tab II machine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">\u201cA customer inserts money into the Lucky Tab II and pushes a button located on the front of the machine; a pull-tab ticket is then dispensed into a tray on the front of the machine. When a ticket is purchased from the Lucky Tab II, a bar code reading device in the interior of the machine reads the bar code on the back of the ticket as it is being severed from the roll of tickets and dispensed into the tray. The information from the bar code is used to create a video image of the symbols that appear on the inside of the ticket, and that image is then displayed on the video screen located on the front of the Lucky Tab II. The video image of the symbols on the inside of the ticket is displayed on the screen after a brief delay, which can vary from one machine to another and may be momentary or as long as six seconds after the ticket is dispensed. As in a retail store setting, the bar code reader also reads and records accounting information relating to the ticket purchase. The video display of a winning ticket is accompanied by a musical signal. Depending on the amount of money deposited into the machine by the customer, the dispensing button can be pushed again to dispense another ticket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">While a customer who purchases a pull-tab ticket from the Lucky Tab II may open the ticket manually and/or refer to the image on the machine\u2019s video screen to view the symbols on the inside of the ticket, the parties agree that it is only on the basis of the symbols that appear on the inside of the paper ticket that a winning ticket is determined. Thus, the symbols that are displayed on the video screen are not used to determine whether the customer is entitled to a prize. Moreover, the Lucky Tab II machine does not make any payment to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>record any credit on behalf of a customer as a result of a winning ticket. As is true with respect to manually sold tickets and those purchased from a Win and Play machine, a customer must take what he or she believes to be a winning ticket purchased from the Lucky Tab II to a Chesapeake Amusements employee to have the winning combination of symbols and the genuineness of the ticket verified before the prize associated with the symbols on the ticket may be awarded and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Although not entirely electronic as is the case with the Oasis machine \u2014 the paper ticket being necessary, even dispositive, for payment, the Circuit Court concluded that the Lucky Tab II too fell in the category of a prohibited slot machine, adopting the Attorney\u2019s General\u2019s characterization: it is \u201ca pull tab machine that reads the printed card and tells the player whether he or she has won, thus making the card unnecessary except as a voucher to get payment of winnings.\u201d It held that the operation of Lucky Tab II is prohibited by \u00a7 264B because it \u201centitles the player to \u2018receive or become entitled to receive any piece of money ... or other object representative of and convertible into money,\u201d one of the statutory criteria for a slot machine. Finally, relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. 657, 248 A.2d 479 (1968), the court determined that Lucky Tab II, as a \u201c \u2018machine that furnishes gratification or reward to a winning player other than further free plays,\u2019 \u201d was among those \u201cintended to be banned by the General Assembly in enacting Article 27, \u00a7 264B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We issued the writ of certiorari <em>sua sponte </em>to consider this important issue. We now reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The appellant argues that Maryland\u2019s statutory prohibition of slot machines is aimed at devices that award prizes as a result of an element of chance in their operations. That is reflected in \u00a7 264B. Pursuant to the plain language of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>statute, which defines a \u201cslot machine,\u201d such machines have three main elements, \u201cconsideration, chance, and reward,\u201d common to all gambling. <em>See State v. 158 Gaming Devices, </em>304 Md. 404, 412-14, 425-26, 499 A.2d 940, 944-45, 951 (1985). First, the machine must operate \u201cas a result of the insertion or deposit therein, or placing with another person of any piece of money, coin, token, or other object....\u201d Second, there must be an \u201celement of chance\u201d or other \u201coutcome of [the] operation [of the machine] unpredictable by [the user of the machine]\u201d that determines what the user receives as a result of operating the machine. Third, what the user \u201cmay receive or become entitled to receive\u201d as a result of (\u201cby reason of\u2019) the unpredictable operation of the machine, is \u201cany piece of money, coin, token or other object representative of and convertible into money____\u201d As applied to the question of whether a machine is a slot machine under the statute, the appellant argues, the element of chance \u201cmust be in the operation of the machine, and the possibility of a prize must result from the chance in such operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Next, the appellant contends that all three elements of gambling are present in connection with a pull-tab ticket, but not with respect to a dispenser of those tickets. It maintains that while consideration is present, the elements of chance and reward are lacking in a pull tab dispenser. As to chance, the appellant asserts that the dispenser\u2019s operation is invariable, it does not operate in an unpredictable way. Similarly, with respect to reward; while the paper ticket that is dispensed may turn out to be an \u201cobject representative of and convertible into money, that fact, the appellant points out, is not \u201cby reason of\u2019 any chance involved in the operation of the machine. Consequently, the appellant concludes, citing Maryland Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 237-240, 241, 242, and 244,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201c[i]f the sale of the pull-tabs that are in a dispenser ... is not authorized by law, then the dispenser is illegal, but not because it is a slot machine. Pull-tabs are a form of gambling, and Maryland\u2019s array of general anti-gaming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>statutes apply to their unauthorized sale, whether that is done manually or by means of a dispenser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Furthermore, the appellant argues, \u00a7 264B does not support the conclusion that the Lucky Tab II is a slot machine. It noted that, in its February 1996 letter, the Attorney General conceded that machines, including the Lucky Tab II, that merely dispense paper pull-tab tickets are not thereby rendered slot machines, where such a machine \u201cdoes not calculate odds, or pick the tickets sold randomly .... \u201d and concluded that \u201c[functioning in this way, the machines are comparable to a cashier or bartender who sells instant bingo cards from the top of a stack.\u201d The appellant rejects the Attorney General\u2019s further conclusion that the machine becomes a prohibited slot machine, and thus contraband <em>per se, </em>with the addition of \u201c \u2018player enhancement features\u2019 that enable the machine to tell the player that he or she has won.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In the appellant\u2019s view, no more chance exists with respect to the video image and audio signal (\u201cplayer enhancement features\u201d) than with the dispensing of the pull-tab ticket. Nor is it accurate, the appellant maintains, for the Attorney General and the Circuit Court to characterize the pull-tab ticket dispensed by the Lucky Tab II as a \u201cvoucher\u201d that is \u201cunnecessary except ... to get payment of winnings.\u201d The video image of the contents of the pull-tab and audio signal indicating a winning ticket are, the appellant argues, simply a byproduct of the dispensing function; they come into play only after a pull-tab ticket is dispensed. According to the appellant, this sequence refutes any argument that the player enhancement features make the Lucky Tab II a slot machine. It points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201c[w]hen a slot machine as defined in section 264B is operated, a prize determined as a result of the machine\u2019s unpredictable operation can only be delivered after that operation is completed. In the case of the Lucky Tab II, the pull-tab ticket is dispensed before the \u2018player enhancement features\u2019 begin, so there is no way that the pull-tab could be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u2018voucher\u2019 representing a prize determined by those features.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Moreover, the appellant submits, because a winning pull-tab ticket is predetermined before being placed in the machine for dispensing and the \u201cplayer enhancement features,\u201d indicating its contents, are activated only upon its dispensation, the test proposed by the Attorney General \u2014 \u201cif the player can tell whether he or she has won by looking at, and listening to, the machine, and needs the card only to collect winnings, then the game is being played on the machine ... \u201d \u2014 is simply inappo-site.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The appellant finds support for its arguments in the operation of the Win &amp; Play machine, found by the trial court to be a mere dispenser of pull-tab tickets, a decision that the State, as we have seen, did not appeal, and the Tab Force Validation Unit, determined by the Attorney General not to be a slot machine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the former, it points out that, but for the player enhancements, the operation of the two machines are identical. Like the Lucky Tab II, when the paper pull-tab is inserted into it, the validation unit will display the results and print a ticket, containing the result, for presenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion for payout. The appellant contends that everything about the validation unit, except how the pull tab is purchased,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is equally applicable to the Lucky Tab II, <em>i.e. </em>\u201c[t]he chance element is on the [pull tab ticket]. The winnings are known, or knowable without the machine, and the machine has no effect on the amount of the winnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">For the appellee, the central question in this case is whether the statutory provision prohibiting slot machines in Maryland permits a distinction to be drawn between pull-tab dispensing machines without player enhancement features and those machines with player enhancement features. The answer, it submits, turns on the interpretation of the element of \u201cchance\u201d under \u00a7 264B, particularly with respect from whose perspective it is viewed. According to the appellee, \u201cthe language of the statute supports an approach which measures the element of chance from the player\u2019s standpoint and specifically considers whether a machine\u2019s audio-visual features signal to the player that the element of chance is in the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Recognizing that its interpretation is somewhat expansive and the appellant\u2019s more restrictive, the appellee argues that the appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 264B is inconsistent with both this Court\u2019s cases broadly interpreting Maryland\u2019s slot machine law and the well-settled principle, stated in Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 246, that the general prohibition against slot machines is to be liberally construed. Noting that the legal slot machine is the exception, not the rule, the appellee points out that the General Assembly\u2019s authorization of slot machines, in limited circumstances by certain organizations in specific counties, has been expressly done. No such authorization has expressly been made in the case of Calvert County, it asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We are in agreement with the appellee that the critical question to be resolved is whether the statutory provision prohibiting slot machines in Maryland permits a distinction to be drawn between pull-tab dispensing machines without player enhancement features and those machines with player enhancement features. We also agree that the answer to the question lies in the interpretation of the \u201cchance\u201d element of the statute. This involves statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Repeatedly we have said \u201cthat the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000); <em>State of Maryland v. Crescent Jaycees Foundation, Inc., </em>330 Md. 460, 468, 624 A.2d 955, 959 (1993) <em>(citing State v.

In <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. of Maryland v. Dir. of Fin. for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 578-79, 683 A.2d 512, 517-18 (1996), this Court set out some of the well settled rules governing that search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">\u201c[W]e begin our analysis by reviewing the pertinent rules [of statutory construction]. Of course, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995); <em>Montgomery County v.

To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also. <em>Oaks, supra, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429; <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d at 451; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755; <em>Harris v.

(quoting Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). Moreover, whenever possible, a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory. <em>Buckman, supra, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d at 452; <em>Condon, supra, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 755.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Our cases are also clear that, \u201cin the interest of completeness,\u201d the legislative history of an unambiguous statute or other materials that may shed light on the fundamental issue of legislative goal or purpose may be consulted. <em>See e.g., State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731, 732 (1993); <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). We made clear in <em>Chase, </em>however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cWe ... look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account. ...

On these points \u00a7 264B is clear and unambiguous. It defines a slot machine as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">\u201c[A]ny machine, apparatus or device ... adapted for use in such a way that, as a result of the insertion or deposit therein or placing with another person of any piece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>money, coin, token other object, [it] is caused to operate or may be operated, and by reason of any element of chance or of other outcome of such operation unpredictable by him, the user may receive or become entitled to receive any piece of money, coin, token or other object representative of and convertible into money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The critical relationships are clear: the machine or device must operate \u201cas a result of\u2019 money or other objects, either inserted into the machine or device or given for that purpose to another person and the user\u2019s receipt or entitlement to receive money or other object representative of and convertible into money is \u201cby reason of any element of chance or of other outcome of such operation unpredictable by\u201d the user. In other words, there must be consideration supplied by the user on the possibility that he or she will receive a prize \u201cby reason of\u2019 the unpredictable operation of the machine. The Lucky Tab II machine does not meet this definition any more than the Play &amp; Win machine does.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Lucky Tab II machine does not pick the paper pull-tab tickets sold in a random fashion. Indeed, the agreed statement of facts indicates that such tickets are dispensed in sequence from the deal placed into it by the appellant\u2019s employee. Nor does it calculate odds. When a customer purchases a ticket from the Lucky Tab II, it is detached in sequence from the deal. The Attorney General opined in a February 19, 1993 opinion letter, that without player enhancements, the Lucky Tab II is \u201ccomparable to a cashier or bartender who sells instant bingo cards from the top of a stack.\u201d As that is being done, a bar code reading device in the interior of the machine reads the bar code on the back of the ticket. From the information encoded in the bar code, a video image of the symbols that appear on the inside of the ticket is created and, after the pull-tab has been dispensed and a brief delay up to six seconds, displayed on the video screen located on the front of the machine. When the pull-tab is a winner, the video display is accompanied by a musical signal. Thus, it is the purchase of the paper pull-tab that activates the player enhancement features. And, because the paper pull-tabs also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>determine the outcome of the game, it is with the paper pull-tabs with which the game is played. The player enhancement features, the video and audio, respond only to the information contained in the paper pull-tabs and, therefore, have no ability to affect the outcome of the game; the outcome of the game is set once the paper pull-tab is purchased non-randomly.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The appellee does not dispute this analysis directly. Rather, the appellee focuses on the chance element of the slot machine definition, and especially the fact that it is stated from the user\u2019s perspective. Then, noting Art. 27, \u00a7 246 and its requirement of liberal construction of the gambling and betting laws \u201cso as to prevent the mischiefs intended to be provided against,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the appellee posits that, rather than actual chance, all that the Legislature intended was \u201cthe sense of unpredictability as to whether the machine will dispense a winning ticket.\u201d From that premise it argues that the statute is entitled to a broad interpretation that will accomplish that goal. The appellee concedes that \u201cthis Court has not specifically considered \u00a7 264B\u2019s element of chance requirement in isolation, nor expressly examined the relationship between the player and the operation of an instant bingo or video pull-tab machine.\u201d Nevertheless, it relies on those cases that have interpreted \u00a7 264B in other contexts, <em>State v. 149 Slot Machines, </em>310 Md. 356, 362, 529 A.2d 817, 820 (1987); <em>State v. 158 Gaming Devices, </em>304 Md. at 437, 499 A.2d at 957; <em>Clerk v. Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. at 667, 248 A.2d at 484, pointing to the broad interpretations they have given it, and this Court\u2019s use of \u00a7 246 when interpreting other gaming provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Also persuasive to the appellee are out of State cases which have used the player\u2019s perspective to distinguish the Lucky Tab II dispensing machine from those without \u201cbells and whistles.\u201d <em>Major Mfg. Corp. v. Department of Revenue, </em>168 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Pa.Cmwlth. 577, 651 A.2d 204, 208 (1994), <em>appeal denied, </em>542 Pa. 637, 665 A.2d 471 (1995); <em>Diamond Game Enterprises, Inc. v.

Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>251 Md. at 667, 248 A.2d at 484, and other gaming provisions. <em>See also State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees Foundation, </em>330 Md. 460, 624 A.2d 955 (1993) (harmonizing \u00a7 255(b), which permitted certain gambling activities by charitable organizations, but explicitly prohibited individuals or groups of individuals from benefitting financially from that activity, and \u00a7 258B, permitting charitable organizations to conduct \u2018benefit performances,\u2019 denominated as \u2018casino nights,\u2019 where designated gaming events were allowed). Indeed, in <em>Gaither v. Cate, </em>156 Md. 254, 144 A. 239 (1929), we said of Md.Code (1939, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 257, the predecessor of \u00a7 246:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201c[W]e take it that section 257 is an expression by the Legislature of the policy of the State in respect to the construction of gambling statutes generally, and requires the courts to construe statutes prohibiting and penalizing the use of gambling devices liberally, so as to prevent the mischiefs which the Legislature sought to repress. By that section it was, in effect, stated by the Legislature to the courts that, whenever the Legislature enacted statutes having for their object the repression of gambling, in respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>such statutes the rule of strict construction should be reversed, and the courts should so construe them as to give validity not only to the word, but to the spirit of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aba\">156 Md. at 258-259, 144 A. at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In none of those cases was the issue that this case presents, the proper interpretation of the chance element of the statutory definition of slot machine, before the Court. In <em>149 Slot Machines, </em>the question presented was \u201cwhether the phrase \u2018any other gaming device\u2019 in \u00a7 255(b) encompasses slot machines otherwise prohibited by \u00a7 264B.\u201d 310 Md. at 357-58, 529 A.2d at 819. It was \u00a7 264B\u2019s prohibition of the location, possession, keeping, maintenance or operation of any slot machine in Maryland juxtaposed against \u00a7 255(b)\u2019s authorization of certain nonprofit organizations in certain counties to engage in gambling activities for fundraising purposes, using \u201cdevices as are commonly designated as paddle wheels, wheels of fortune, chance books, bingo, or any other gaming device ..., \u201d <em>id. </em>at 357, 529 A.2d at 817, that generated the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">At issue in <em>158 Gaming Devices, </em>304 Md. at 406, 499 A.2d at 941, were \u201ca number of devices seized as illegal \u2018slot machines\u2019 \u201d pursuant to \u00a7 264B. Some of the devices were inoperable, others were free-play devices without knock-off switches or meters, and still others were \u201cantique\u201d slot machines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 407, 499 A.2d at 942. The trial court found that the inoperable devices and free-play devices without knock-off switches were not slot machines and that the antique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cslot Machines\u201d were exempt. <em>Id. </em>In addition to affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the antique \u201cslot machines\u201d and the inoperable devices, this Court rejected the State\u2019s \u201ccontention that under \u00a7 264B a free play of itself, registered upon a device the operation of which involves the element of chance, is an object representative of or convertible into money because it is the \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of the coin or token otherwise necessary to activate the machine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 432, 499 A.2d at 954, holding, instead, that such devices are illegal only when \u201cequipped with odds mechanisms, or a meter for recording the number of free plays released, or other established indicia of a gambling device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 499 A.2d at 956-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><em>Chesapeake Beach Park </em>examined the effect of \u00a7 264B on local laws in Calyert County that authorized the possession of coin-operated mechanical and electrical \u201camusement\u201d devices, which awarded free plays that could be redeemed for merchandise, rather than cash pay-offs. This court, noting the liberal construction which \u00a7 246 requires be given to the gaming laws and after studying the legislative history of \u00a7 264B, held that possession of such machines was banned by \u00a7 264B; we determined that the General Assembly intended to ban \u201cany ... machines that furnished gratification or reward to a winning player other than further free plays.\u201d 251 Md. at 666, 248 A.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Liberal interpretation is a rule of construction. Like other rules of construction, its purpose is to construe an ambiguous statute, not to rewrite a clear one. In another context, involving another statutory scheme, Worker\u2019s Compensation, social legislation, which the General Assembly has determined to warrant liberal interpretation, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1999) \u00a7 9-102 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Balti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>more v.

Bayliner Marine Corp., </em>349 Md. 609, 616-17, 709 A.2d 1205, 1208-09 (1998) (citation omitted). In any event, the cases on which the appellee relies do not make the point. <em>Chesapeake Beach Park </em>comes closest. There, \u201cin the performance of our judicial duty to liberally construe gaming statutes to give effect to an ascertained legislative intent,\u201d the Court construed, \u201c \u2018representative of and convertible into money' to mean representative of or convertible into money.\u201d 251 Md. at 667, 248 A.2d at 486. We made clear, however, that the construction was derived from the words of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201cSection 264B provides that a winning player may receive or become entitled to receive money or some equivalent as a result of the operation of the machine brought about by the insertion or deposit therein, or placing with another person of any piece of money, coin, token or other object, (emphasis added) and, in addition, does not limit or restrict the manner or way in which a winning player may \u2018become entitled to receive\u2019 his award. The phraseology of the statute leads to the conclusion that evidence of the reward or the material reward itself may, without distinction and with the same consequences, come directly from the machine or from an attendant of the machine, and in every instance of material reward by chance the machine would be a slot machine,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az\"><em>id., </em>and that, quoting 2 Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 4923 (3rd Ed.1943):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201cThere has been ... so great laxity in the use of these terms (\u2018and\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019) that courts have generally said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the words are interchangeable, and that one may be substituted for the other, if to do so is consistent with the legislative intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Chesapeake Beach Park, </em>rather than conflicting with the construction urged by the appellant, is consistent. In fact, it is simply an example of the Court interpreting an ambiguous statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Nor are the out-of-state cases, on which the appellee relies, of any more assistance. The Pennsylvania statute construed in <em>Major Mfg. Corp., </em>differs significantly from \u00a7 264B. It defines \u201cGames of Chance\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cPunchboards, daily drawings, raffles and pull-tabs, as defined in this act, provided that no such game shall be played by or with the assistance of any mechanical or electrical devices or media other than a dispensing machine<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or passive selection device and further provided that the particular chance taken by any person in any such game shall not be made contingent upon any other occurrence or the winning of any other contest, but shall be determined solely at the discretion of the purchaser. This definition shall not be construed to authorize any other form of gambling currently prohibited under Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes (relating to crimes and offenses). Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize games commonly known as \u2018slot machines\u2019 or \u2018video poker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\">10 P.S. \u00a7 313.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">After describing the operation of the Lucky Tab II, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[u]nlike the [Lucky Tab I] model, however, the more highly advanced [Lucky Tab II] model has a bar code scanner which scans the exact contents of the pull-tab ticket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>then causes the image on the ticket to be displayed on video. The scanner \u2018is the interpreting network of the [video] display.\u2019 The display element of the device consists of a picture tube \u2018that displays the image that\u2019s on the ticket.\u2019 After the player inserts a dollar bill, the device\u2019s lights illuminate and the player has the option of next tab and pull. When the player is a winner, the top light illuminates. In addition, after the video display, the device emits a musical jingle from which the player can determine whether he is a winner or a loser. Therefore, on the basis of either the video display, lights or music, the player knows whether he is a winner or loser without ever having to open the pull-tab,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">the court, <em>id. </em>at 206, applied the statute, agreeing with the Pennsylvania Small Games of Chance Board that \u201ccomponents of the device assist in the play of the game,\u201d 651 A.2d at 205, and, so, the Lucky Tab II is not a mere dispensing device. <em>Id. </em>at 208. Rejecting the petitioner\u2019s argument that the proper test is whether the three elements of a game of chance are assisted, the court concluded that it is, rather whether the game is played by or with the assistance of mechanical or electrical devices, explaining \u201ca player may rely on the video display and discard the losing ticket without ever opening it ... [and], also without opening the ticket, a player may alternatively rely on the device\u2019s electronic sound or its lights in determining whether he is a winner.\u201d 651 A.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The inquiry under \u00a7 264B is quite different; it is whether the Lucky Tab II is a slot machine, which necessarily involves the question whether the element of chance is required by \u00a7 264B to be in the machine directly or simply perceived to be, as the appellee contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Diamond Game Enterprises, Inc. v. Reno, </em>9 F.Supp.2d 13 (D.D.C.1998) and <em>Sycuan Band of Mission Indians v. Roache, </em>54 F.3d 535, 543 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 912, 116 S.Ct. 297, 133 L.Ed.2d 203 (1995) were decided under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\u201cIGRA\u201d), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701-19.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> One of the questions in <em>Diamond Game </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>whether the Lucky Tab II was a Class II or a Class III gaming device as defined under that act. Class II gaming devices<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> include \u201celectronic, computer, or other technological aids\u201d to the traditional pull-tab game. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(7)(A)(i). Class III gaming devices are those that are \u201c[electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(7)(B)(ii). The District Court held that the Lucky Tab II was a facsimile, a Class III gaming device, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">\u201cWhen the participant plays the Lucky Tab II, she is not playing the pull-tabs inside the machine; she is engaging the machine that replicates the functions of the traditional pull-tab game. Indeed, the Lucky Tab II performs all of the functions that \u00e1 player of the traditional pull-tab game would have performed, including selecting a pull-tab ticket, disclosing the hidden symbols on the ticket and determining whether a particular pull-tab ticket is a \u2018winner.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Similarly, in <em>Sycuan, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the video pull-tab machine at issue in that case, the Auto Tab Model 101, was a Class III gaming device. <em>See </em>54 F.3d at 543. Like the <em>Diamond Game </em>court, the court believed that the video pull tab machine is integral to the play. It opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c[A]ny given player is faced with a self-contained machine into which he or she places money and loses it or receives winning tickets after the electronic operations are conduct-ed____In that sense, the gambler plays \u2018with the machine\u2019 even though not against it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">54 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Decided on the basis of different statutory language and an entirely different statutory scheme, these cases are certainly not directly on point and for those same reasons are not particularly persuasive with respect to the interpretation of \u00a7 264B. Indeed, the court in <em>Sycuan </em>commented, in refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to consider the rationale underlying the exclusion of facsimiles, that \u201cCongress has sufficiently dictated the result of this case in the statutory language it chose.\u201d 54 F.3d at 543. <em>Sycuan </em>is further undermined by the fact that the machine it analyzed was not the Lucky Tab II, but rather one akin to the Oasis, found by the trial judge to be a slot machine and not appealed by the appellant. It is undisputed, as the trial court held, that the Oasis is a wholly electronic pull-tab machine, unlike the Lucky Tab II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The District Court decision in <em>Diamond Game </em>has been overruled. <em>See Diamond Game Enterprises, Inc. v. Reno, </em>230 F.3d 365 (D.C.Cir.2000). While the statutory language and scheme continue to make this case inapposite, the appellate court\u2019s analysis of the Lucky Tab II\u2019s operation is interesting and, more to the point, reminiscent of the appropriate analysis in this case. Contrasting the Lucky Tab II with the video pull-tabs game at issue in <em>Cabazon Band of Mission Indians v. Nat\u2019l Indian Gaming Comm\u2019n, </em>14 F.3d 633 (D.C.Cir.1994),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cWe think the Lucky Tab II is quite different from the machine at issue in <em>Cabazon. </em>To begin with, the Lucky Tab II is not a \u2018computerized version\u2019 of pull-tabs. Although the Lucky Tab II has a video screen, the screen merely displays the contents of a paper pull-tab. Instead of using a computer to select patterns, the Lucky Tab II actually cuts tabs from paper rolls and dispenses them to players. In other words, the game is in the paper rolls, not, as in the case of the <em>Cabazon </em>machine, in a computer. Indeed, players using the Lucky Tab II often play a deal simultaneously with other players in the game hall who have chosen to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>pull-tabs from clerks. For players using the Lucky Tab II, the machine functions as an aid \u2014 it \u2018helps or support,\u2019 or \u2018assists\u2019 the paper game of pull-tabs. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 44 (1993). Without the paper rolls, the machine has no gaming function at all. It is, in essence, little more than a high-tech dealer. Viewed this way, the game played with the Lucky Tab II is not a facsimile of paper pull-tabs, it is paper pull-tabs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cAnother difference between the Lucky Tab II and the video machine at issue in <em>Cabazon </em>reinforces our belief that the Lucky Tab II should be classified as a Class II aid. The <em>Cabazon </em>machine plays the game of pull-tabs in its entirety, dispensing receipts for players to redeem winnings. By contrast, the Lucky Tab II dispenses actual paper pull-tabs that players must peel and display to a clerk before they can obtain prizes. Although the machine\u2019s scanner apparently commits few errors when reading paper pull-tabs, the fact remains that unlike the <em>Cabazon </em>machine, the Lucky Tab II is technically not final. It is, in other words, an aid to the game of pull-tabs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Also of interest to this case is the court\u2019s rejection of the distinction that the Government sought to draw between an electronic scanner, \u201cTab Force Validation System,\u201d classified by the National Indian Gaming Commission as a Class II gaming aid and found by the State, in an opinion of the Attorney General, not to be a slot machine, and the Lucky Tab II machine. Noting that with the \u201cTab Force Validation System,\u201d \u201cafter a clerk dispenses a paper pull-tab, instead of pealing off the top layer, the player inserts the pull-tab into the machine, which scans the bar code and displays the results on a video screen,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 370, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cWe see no principled difference between the Tab Force and the Lucky Tab II. Both devices electronically \u2018read\u2019 paper pull-tabs and display their contents on a screen, and neither can \u2018change the outcome of the game.\u2019 Unlike the machine in <em>Cabazon, </em>neither contains an interior computer that generates the game. Rather, both machines facilitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the playing of paper pull-tabs. They are thus Class II aids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This comparison applies equally well to the relationship between the Play and Win machine, which the trial court validated and the State has chosen not to challenge, and the Lucky Tab II. There simply is no principled basis for distinguishing the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Moreover, both sides agree that there is an element of chance whether the pull-tabs are dispensed manually or dispensed by a dispensing machine, such as the Win &amp; Play machine, or by a validation machine, such as the Tab Force Validation Unit. By agreeing that the Lucky Tab II dispenses the pull-tabs non-randomly and in sequence, they also have agreed, in effect, that the element of chance is in the pull-tabs themselves, and not in the operation of the machine. As we have seen, \u00a7 264B requires that, to be a slot machine, the element of chance must be in the operation of the device or machine. That requirement of the statute is not supplied by the player\u2019s perception. Nor does, or can, the legislative history of \u00a7 264B fill the gap, where, as here, the statutory requirements are clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

[could] be played utilizing vending machines equipped with a visual enhancement of the ticket actually purchased....\u201d By letter dated February 27, 1996, responding to a letter from Senator Lawlah, Assistant Attorney General Rowe opined that the \"player enhancement features\u201d of the Lucky Tab II machine made it a slot machine, and, therefore, illegal pursuant to \u00a7 264B. Relying principally on this letter, the State\u2019s. Attorney advised the appellant in 1997 that some or all of its instant bingo machines were considered by his office to be illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. Although permitted to do so, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 259A, Calvert County has not enacted ordinances or adopted regulations to supplement the statute\u2019s provisions with respect to commercial bingo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. As it did with respect to the Lucky Tab II machines, the Circuit Court for Calvert County ruled that the Oasis machines are illegal slot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>machines. That ruling has not been appealed and, thus, the legality of the Oasis machine is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\">. For example, a deal of the pull-tab tickets sold manually by Chesapeake Amusements employees on a regular basis contains approximately four thousand tickets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. In a letter, dated August 19, 1997, to Senator Edward J. Kasemeyer, in which she opined that the Tab Force Validation Unit was not a slot machine, Assistant Attorney General Rowe described the operation of the unit and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\"Under this system, the player buys a pull-tab from the cashier. The player opens the tab and can read it to see whether it is a winner, or can hand it to a cashier who can scan the bar code to determine [if] it is a winner, or, as a third option, the player can insert the pull-tab in the validation unit. If this option is used, the validation unit will display the results of the games that are on the card and will print a ticket with the results that can be given to the cashier for pay out. Under all three options, payout is made by the cashier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\"Under these facts, it is my view that the validation unit is not a slot machine. Consideration, chance, and prize, the three elements of gambling, exist in this instance completely separate from the machine. Payment is made to the cashier, not to the machine. While a thing that may have value is inserted in the machine, the machine returns something of identical value. The chance element is on the card. The winnings are known, or knowable without the machine, and the machine has no effect on the amount of the winnings. The third element, prize, is also separate from the machine.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. There is a further difference, the validation unit prints the ticket on which the pay out is made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">.
