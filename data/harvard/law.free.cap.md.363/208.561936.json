In this Court, Respondent excepted to Judge Friedman\u2019s conclusion that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>violated Rule 8.4. Bar Counsel took no exceptions to Judge Friedman\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Friedman filed a memorandum detailing her findings of fact and conclusions of law. We set forth Judge Friedman\u2019s memorandum below.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cThe Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) acting through Bar Counsel filed a Petition for Disciplinary Action against Jack A. Bernstein (\u201cRespondent\u201d), alleging misconduct relating to a checking account with Crestar Bank and the mishandling of client funds. The Court of Appeals referred this matter to this court for a fact finding hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u201cThe hearing began on July 28, 2000 and continued to September 5, 2000. Both Petitioner and Respondent filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon the evidence presented, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions upon clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">Findings of Fact and Conclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">\u201cRespondent, Jack Bernstein, is 45 years old and has been engaged in the practice of law since being admitted to the Maryland Bar on November 15, 1978. During the time relevant to this matter, he maintained an office for the practice of law at 5 Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland until April 1999 when he relocated to his current address at 110 St. Paul Street, Baltimore, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">\u201cRespondent graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law with a high grade point average. He passed the bar examination on his first attempt and during his undergraduate studies, he took and passed one introductory accounting course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">\u201cRespondent opened a checking account with Crestar Bank titled \u201cMaryland Legal Services, Jack A. Bernstein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Esq., IOLTA\u201d (\u201cthe account\u201d). On four separate occasions, the Petitioner received a notice of an overdraft from Crestar Bank as follows: September 11, 1997, September 15, 1997, January 29, 1998, and February 17, 1998. These notices brought about the investigation resulting in the Petition for Disciplinary Action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">\u201cThe overdrafts occurred as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">1. September 8, 1997, check number 811 in the amount of $90.00 to the order of the Circuit Court for Howard County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">2. September 9, 1997, check number 812 in the amount of $5.00 to the order of the Circuit Court for Howard County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">3. January 23, 1998, check number 900 in the amount of $885.90 to the order of Federal Express.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">4. February 10, 1998, check number 923 in the amount of $500.00. (This check never cleared; the payee is unknown.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">\u201cThere have been no further overdrafts with the account which Respondent closed. Respondent then opened an account with First Mariner Bank; there have been no overdrafts with that account to the date of the hearing before this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\n<em>Failure to Respond to Lawful Demand for Information and to Provide Adequate Information</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201cOn September 11, 1997, Melvin Hirshman, Bar Counsel (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d) sent a letter to Respondent notifying him of the first overdraft and requesting a full explanation. Bar Counsel further requested Respondent provide within 10 days his client ledger cards, deposit slips, canceled checks, and monthly bank statements for the period April through September 1997. Respondent received the letter on September 12, 1997, but did not respond within 10 days as required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">\u201cAfter the second notice of the overdraft was received, Bar Counsel sent to Respondent another letter dated September 15, 1997, which was received September 17, 1997. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>This letter requested a full explanation of the overdraft and that Respondent provide his client ledger cards, bank deposit slips, canceled checks and monthly bank statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201cOn September 25, 1997, Bar Counsel received a letter from Respondent. The correspondence included copies of bank statements for the period April through August 1997, but did not include canceled bank checks and bank deposit slips as requested. Respondent indicated in his letter that the overdraft occurred because he advanced court costs without depositing corresponding sums due to the unusual strain of activity caused by preparation for his daughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah on August 30,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cBy a letter dated September 29,1997, Bar Counsel again requested more information and documentation relating to the overdrafts. Specifically, Bar Counsel requested the September bank statement and the documents related to Respondent\u2019s explanation of the overdraft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cOn October 23, 1997, Bar Counsel received a response from Respondent, dated October 22, 1997, in which he repeated the same expl\u00e1nation given in his previous letter and included a copy of the September 1997 bank statement. The letter did not include any of the other requested documents such as canceled bank checks and bank deposit slips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">\u201cAt this point, Bar Counsel docketed a complaint, and on October 29,1997, notified Respondent by letter. Bar Counsel again requested copies of canceled checks, client ledger cards, bank deposit slips and any other information that would assist in identifying deposits and disbursements for the period April through September 1997. Respondent was asked to respond within fifteen (15) days of the date of the letter. Respondent did not respond to the letter of October 29,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201cOn November 26, 1997, Bar Counsel sent another letter to Respondent to provide the previously requested information within 10 days of the letter. Respondent failed to respond in a timely manner to the letter of November 26, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cOn December 17, 1997, the Petitioner received a letter dated December 22, 1997, but postmarked December 16, 1997, from Respondent in which he asked to meet to discuss the matter and indicated that the requests were overbroad and not focused on any issues raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">\u201cOn February 2, 1998, Bar Counsel sent another letter to Respondent which notified him of the third overdraft and requested documentation for the period August 1997 through January 1998. Respondent received the letter on February 3, 1998, but he did not respond in a timely manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cOn February 19, 1998, another letter was sent to Respondent, which notified him of the fourth overdraft and requested documentation of the period September 1997 through February 1998 within ten (10) days of the receipt of the letter. Respondent did not respond to the letter of February 19,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201cOn March 16, 1998, Assistant Bar Counsel, Delores O. Ridgell, (\u201cAssistant Bar Counsel\u201d) sent a letter to Respondent, which again requested a response within 10 days with an explanation for the overdrafts and documentation on the bank account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201cOn March 16, 1998, Bar Counsel received a letter from Respondent dated March 13, 1998. In this letter, Respondent requested a meeting and enclosed bank statements for January and February 1998. Respondent provided no other documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s explanation for the January 1998 overdraft was that he had been assured by a bank teller that it had . cle\u00e1red. His explanation for the February 1998 overdraft was that it was a cascade of the prior overdraft. Respondent did not identify the payee of check number 923 (the February overdraft) nor provide Bar Counsel with the reason for the issuance of this check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">\u201cAt trial, Respondent testified that check number 923 was paid, but the bank records through March 31, 1998 do not reflect payment of the check. Respondent has not provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>documentary evidence to corroborate that payment was made nor has he identified the intended recipient of the check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cOn March 17,1998, Bar Counsel sent a letter in response to Respondent\u2019s letter of March 13, 1998. This letter contained another request for records as previously requested in Bar Counsel\u2019s letter of March 16, 1998 to Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cOn March 27, 1998, Respondent met with Assistant Bar Counsel and Commission Paralegal John DeBone at the Attorney Grievance Commission office. Respondent brought no documents to the meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">\u201cIn response to a subpoena to Crestar Bank, Bar Counsel received canceled checks and deposit slips from the account. Neither the checks nor the deposit slips indicated a trust account. At the March 27 meeting, Respondent was shown summaries of the bank records. He was asked again to provide documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cDuring the March 27 meeting, Mr. DeBone provided Respondent with a hypothetical model of the records which should be kept for an attorney trust account. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 31.) Nevertheless, Respondent admitted that he took no corrective steps and continued to keep no records prior to the hearing conducted by the Inquiry Panel on December 7, 1999. At the Inquiry Panel Hearing, Respondent denied receiving this information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cOn May 15, 1998, Assistant Bar Counsel sent another letter to Respondent which requested information related to several transactions identified during the review of the bank records on March 27, 1998. He was asked to respond within fifteen (15) days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201cBy telephone, Respondent requested and was granted an extension until June 15, 1998. A response was not received by June 15, 1998, and on June 19, 1998, a letter was sent to Respondent which again requested a response. However, on July 6, 1998, by letter dated June 30, 1998, Respondent provided some of the requested bank records. Respondent, by his own admission, kept no records except a calendar of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>fees. He provided to Assistant Bar' Counsel only a few settlement sheets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201cOn July 10, 1998 and August 28, 1998, letters requesting the information not provided were sent to Respondent. Respondent did not provide a timely response to either the July 10 or August 28,1998 requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cOn October 28, 1998, Respondent again met with Assistant Bar Counsel and John DeBone. Respondent brought no documents and took no notes during the meeting. On November 10, 1998, Assistant Bar Counsel sent a letter to Respondent memorializing the meeting of October 28, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cThis Court concludes that Respondent failed to respond in a timely fashion to the reasonable inquiries by Bar Counsel to provide the requested documents and records and to provide adequate explanations of the overdrafts in violation of Rule 8.1(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201cThe Petitioner\u2019s requests were related to an investigation within the authority of the Attorney Grievance Commission and Bar Counsel. Respondent failed to provide the canceled checks requested by Bar Counsel and ealendar/cal-endars referred to at the Inquiry Panel as well as check stubs referred to at the hearing before this Court. Although he eventually provided a few settlement sheets and the creditors reports he filed for Cobb Financial (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 21 and 25), he did not respond in a timely fashion and only after several requests by the Petitioner. Respondent never identified the client matters which entitled him to the cash disbursements listed in Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 28, nor did he identify the source/sources of the cash deposits as requested at the meeting on October 28, 1998 and by letter dated November 10,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cIn his letter dated December 22, 1997, Respondent suggested that the requests were over broad, but at no time did he provide authority for this assertion. At the hearing before this Court, he stated that he did not provide the requested documents because he did not have them. Yet documents that he did maintain, such as monthly bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>statements and canceled checks, he did not produce in a timely manner. At the hearing, Respondent gave another reason for why he did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests: He stated, in so many words, that he did not perceive the Attorney Grievance Commission process as a prosecutorial proceeding, but rather one in which lawyers would receive assistance to achieve resolution of the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s explanation for the overdrafts was not satisfactory because the actual reason for the overdrafts was his failure to maintain proper records and his inadequate accounting system. Had he maintained the account properly, he would have known whether there were sufficient funds in the account to cover a withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\n<em>Failure to Communicate Contingent Fee Agreement in Writing</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cRespondent handled personal injury and collection cases and used contingency fee agreements in those matters. He deposited the settlement checks for those cases to the account. Respondent, by his own admission at the hearing before this Court, failed to communicate the terms of contingency fee agreements to his clients in -writing. He testified that he did not know he was required to have written contingency fees. Respondent admitted allowing fees earned in these contingency fee cases to accrue in the account for an indefinite period of time. There were no regular bank charges on this account which would require the deposit of Respondent\u2019s personal funds to the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201cThe Court concludes that Respondent failed to communicate the terms of contingency fee agreements to his clients in writing in violation of Rule 1.5 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. The fact that he was ignorant of the requirement is no excuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\n<em>Failure to Safekeep Property of Clients</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201cRespondent used the account in question to deposit funds he received in connection with the representation of his clients. He did not maintain a check register for the account. Moreover, he acknowledged that, although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>knew since 1983 that a trust account is required, it was not his practice to promptly withdraw fees earned following settlement of contingency fee matters and that he would allow his personal funds to accrue in the trust account for an indefinite period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">\u201cRespondent also failed to maintain this account as required by Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules and did not keep complete records of the client and/or third party funds deposited and disbursed from this account. He admitted that he kept no records regarding funds received and deposited into the account on behalf of a client identified as Cobb Financial, Inc. He asserted that he adopted the practices and procedures of several law firms with which he has been associated over the years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to keep an adequate balance in the account caused a delay in the receipt of funds to which Federal Express, the third party subrogee of Crystal Brown Barnes, was entitled. It was necessary for check number 900 to be presented a second time on January 30, 1998 in order for the third party to obtain payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cAlso, check number 859 payable to Litofsky, Brager &amp; O\u2019Brien LLC on behalf of clients identified as Deb and Roger Jones was not issued, according to the date on the check, until November 12, 1997. It was not presented until November 20, 1997, at which time it cleared. Respondent, however, waited almost two weeks after the other disbursements for these checks before he wrote check number 859. The other disbursements are dated October 30, 1997, and cleared the bank October 31 and November 4, 1997. The settlement sheet provided to these clients is dated October 28, 1997 and reflects the disbursement of payment to Litof-sky, Brager &amp; O\u2019Brien as well as the other disbursements. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 21.) Had check number 859 been presented prior to the deposit of $4,500 which was posted to the account on November 13, 1997, it would not have cleared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201cRespondent testified that it was his belief that check number 923 in the amount of $500, which failed to clear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>bank when first presented on February 10, 1998, was eventually paid. The bank records do not reflect the payment of this check through March 31, 1998, the point at which time the Petitioner\u2019s review of the bank records ended. Payment to the client or third party entitled to check number 923 was delayed approximately six weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cThe Court concludes that Respondent violated Rule 1.15(a) and Rule 1.15(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. He failed to keep clients\u2019 funds separate from his own and failed to keep complete records of such funds in violation of Rule 1.15(a). Respondent withdrew funds from the account and failed to provide an adequate explanation of the use of the funds in violation of Rule 1.15(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>Trust Account-Required Deposits</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amx-dedup-0\">\u201cRespondent made deposits to the account in the form of cash. Although he provided no explanation of these deposits, Petitioner presented no evidence that any of the deposits were funds other than those received in trust. This Court concludes that there is no violation of Rule 16-604 of the Maryland Rules regarding Attorney Trust Accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB_\">\n<em>Failure to Properly Name and Designate Account</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ5\">\u201cRespondent opened the account titled \u201cMaryland Legal Services, Jack A. Bernstein, Esquire, IOLTA.\u201d He used the account as a client funds/trust account. The checks and deposit tickets for the account bear only Respondent\u2019s name and the address of his office without any of the three required designations: \u201cAttorney Trust Account,\u201d \u201cAttorney Escrow Account,\u201d or \u201cClients\u2019 Funds Account.\u201d On the date of the hearing before this Court, his current account with First Mariner, by Respondent\u2019s own admission, was not titled properly. (See Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 30, 32 and 33.) Subsequently, by way of a Motion to Alter and Amend and a Notice of Filing Amended Answer to Discovery, Respondent submitted proof that the First Mariner account is now properly titled, \u201cJack A. Bernstein, Attorney, Escrow Account.\u201d The Court concludes that Respondent violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Rule 16-606 of the Maryland Rules regarding Attorney Trust Accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cThere is no evidence that Respondent charged unreasonable fees. The account records and Respondent\u2019s testimony show that the withdrawals for fees were approximately one-third of the settlement amount obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>Commingling of Personal and Client Funds in the Account</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cRespondent commingled personal and client funds in the account. Respondent acknowledged that he failed to withdraw promptly earned fees from settlement proceeds in personal injury cases and left the funds in the account for an indefinite period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cThis Court concludes that Respondent violated Rule 16-607 of the Maryland Rules regarding Attorney Trust Accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>Withdrawal of Funds from Trust Account Payable to Cash</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cBank records reveal that Respondent withdrew funds from the account by way of checks payable to \u201ccash.\u201d He received the proceeds of these checks and would usually deposit the checks to his personal bank account. Respondent testified that he received these funds as payment of fees, but he failed to identify the client matters to which the disbursements related. Likewise, he failed to identify the sources of funds deposited as cash into the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cThe Court concludes that Respondent withdrew funds from the account by check made payable to cash in violation of Rule 16-609 of the Maryland Rules regarding Attorney Trust Accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cRespondent failed to maintain in trust the funds he received on behalf of a client identified as Crystal Brown Banes. The third overdraft notice was issued when check number 900, in the amount of $885.90 (payable to the third party subrogee on behalf of this client) was presented by the payee, Federal Express.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cThis occurred at the time that Respondent was already under investigation as a result of prior overdrafts. He had also indicated in a letter dated October 10,1997, that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>reconciling the account twice a month. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 8.) This check, dated December 22,1997, was first presented January 23, 1998. On that date, the balance in the account was a little over $600. Respondent wrote checks to cash and received the proceeds of these checks while check number 900 was outstanding. Check number 900 eventually cleared the account on January 30, 1998 as the result of a deposit made in the amount of $3,000 on January 28, 1998. The deposit was an insurance check payable to another of Respondent\u2019s clients, Mary Bryant. Thus one client\u2019s obligation was paid from funds received on behalf of another client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cRespondent\u2019s explanation for the January 1998 overdraft is that he was told by a bank employee that there was money in the account and he believed that he was entitled to withdraw funds as payment of fees during this period of time. The disbursement which caused the account balance to fall below the trust obligation of $885.90 on January 22, 1998 was check number 918 written to cash in the amount of $450. Respondent produced no internal records on which he relied to determine that he was entitled to withdraw fees in this amount on that date. Nor was there a deposit prior to the disbursement of check number 918 which would have entitled Respondent to a fee on January 22, 1998. At the hearing, Respondent was unable to identify any client matter which would have entitled him to withdraw the funds he did in January 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cNor was this an isolated incident. The evidence demonstrated that the account balance fell below the trust obligations owed to clients identified as David Pistorio, in June 1997, and Deb &amp; Roger Jones, in November 1997. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 32 and 33.) The timing of the disbursements for the Joneses provides evidence that Respondent intentionally delayed paying the Jones\u2019 creditor for almost two weeks until after the deposit of a check received on behalf of another client had been made. For instance, the Jones\u2019 settlement checks totaling $3,200 were posted to the account on October 28, 1997. Respondent made three dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>bursements for these clients, one to the Joneses and two to medical care providers on their behalf. (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 21.) Although two of these disbursements are dated October 30, 1997 and cleared the account on October 31 and November 4, 1997, respectively, the third disbursement, check number 859 in the amount of $1,000, was written by Respondent on November 12, 1997. It was not presented until November 20, 1997. By then it cleared because a deposit of $4,500 was made on November 4 and posted to the account on November 13, 1997. The $4,500 deposit was an insurance check received on behalf of a client identified as Satterfield.

Yet he made no effort to correct his handling of trust money, continued to withdraw amounts from the accounts, and continued to claim he had no records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cThis Court concludes that Respondent\u2019s failure to hold funds owed to clients and third parties in trust was willful and in violation of the Business Occupations and Professional Article \u00a7 10-306.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u201cAt the Inquiry Panel December 7, 1999, Respondent testified that he did not know until the night before the Inquiry Panel hearing that he was supposed to have written fee agreements in contingency fee cases and did not know that writing checks to cash on a trust account was prohibited. The evidence shows that Assistant Bar Counsel addressed these matters with him during both the meetings on March 27, 1998 and October 28, 1998, with Mr. DeBone and Assistant Bar Counsel. Respondent also denied receiving this hypothetical model from Mr. DeBone during his March 27, 1998 meeting. At the hearing before this Court, Respondent reiterated that he did not recall receiving the hypothetical model. In his letters to Bar Counsel on September 25 and December 22, 1997, Respondent did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>reveal that some of the records being requested such as deposit tickets and client ledger cards did not exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201cRespondent failed to cooperate during the investigation, testified falsely at the Inquiry Panel hearing and failed to provide information and documents requested during discovery. This Court concludes that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct and that his conduct showed a disregard for the disciplinary process in violation of Rule 8.4(d) which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We turn first to Respondent\u2019s exception. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4 by failing to cooperate with Bar Counsel, testifying falsely before the Inquiry Panel, and failing to provide information and documents requested during discovery. The burden is on Respondent to prove factual matters in defense of his position by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17-18, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999). Other than a bare statement noting that he excepts to the finding with regard to Rule 8.4, Respondent has offered no reasons as to why the hearing judge was incorrect. Respondent has failed to meet his burden. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em>363 Md. 1, 12-14, 766 A.2d 1028, 1034 (2001); <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17-18, 741 A.2d at 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Judge Friedman considered the evidence presented by Respondent and Bar Counsel, and after observing and listening to the \"witnesses as they testified, she chose to believe the evidence of Bar Counsel. The trier of fact may pick and choose which evidence to rely upon. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 190, 711 A.2d 193, 200 (1998). The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are prima facie correct, and will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses first hand. <em>See id. </em>at 190, 711 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>A.2d at 200. We conclude that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous. The exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We now turn to the appropriate sanction. In so doing, we recognize that the purpose of disciplinary sanctions is to protect the public, to protect the integrity of the legal profession and to deter other lawyers from violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, not to punish the erring attorney. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Koven, </em>361 Md. 337, 343, 761 A.2d 881, 884 (2000). The facts and circumstances of each case will determine the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Tolar, </em>357 Md. 569, 585, 745 A.2d 1045, 1053 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Bar Counsel urges this Court to disbar Respondent. As support for this recommendation, Bar Counsel emphasizes that Respondent\u2019s actions were not the result of negligence and that the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings demonstrate that Respondent willfully misappropriated client funds. Bar Counsel argues that disbarment is the appropriate sanction where the attorney willfully misappropriates client funds. Respondent recommends a limited suspension as the appropriate sanction and notes that Bar Counsel has failed to produce any evidence of harm suffered by any person or entity other than the check drawn to Federal Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We have held consistently that \u201c[misappropriation of funds by an attorney is an act infested with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991). <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 417, 614 A.2d 955, 958 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 608-09, 541 A.2d 966, 969 (1988); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cockrell, </em>304 Md. 379, 393-94, 499 A.2d 928, 935 (1985). Such a sanction is justified because attorneys:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>must remember that the entrustment to them of the money and property of others involves a responsibility of the highest order. They must carefully administer and account for those funds. Appropriating any part of those funds to their own use and benefit without clear authority to do so cannot be tolerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 345, 587 A.2d 511, 516 (1991). In <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 519, 307 A.2d 677, 682 (1973), this Court asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2lH\">it is essential that all members of the legal fraternity be strongly and constantly impressed with the truism that in handling moneys and properties belonging to their clients or others that they accept them in trust and are strictly accountable for their conduct in administering that trust, so they dare not appropriate those funds and properties for their personal use. The misappropriation by an attorney of funds of others entrusted to his care, be the amount small or large, is of great concern and represents the gravest form of professional misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Judge Friedman concluded that Respondent willfully misappropriated client funds, noting that Respondent\u2019s client trust account fell below its trust obligation in January 1998 as the result of Respondent\u2019s withdrawal of funds payable to \u201ccash\u201d while issued checks were outstanding. Addressing Respondent\u2019s explanation for falling below his trust obligation \u2014 that he was told by a bank teller that there was money in the account, and Respondent believed he was entitled to withdraw fees \u2014 Judge Friedman noted that Respondent produced no records on which he relied to determine that he was entitled to any fees at that time. Nor did the account show a deposit that would entitle Respondent to fees prior to his withdrawal of those fees. Moreover, Judge Friedman found that Respondent was unable to identify any client matter that would have entitled him to withdraw the funds he withdrew in January 1998. Judge Friedman further highlighted one transaction, <em>i.e., </em>the Jones\u2019 account, where Respondent intentionally used the funds belonging to one client to pay the obligations of another client. These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We consider Respondent\u2019s failure to attempt to rectify his handling of the trust account as an aggravating factor. Judge Friedman found that Respondent was on notice of problems with the trust account as early as September of 1997, but made no attempt to correct his handling of trust money, continued to withdraw amounts from the account improperly, and continued to claim he had no records documenting the transactions. Respondent continued to operate his trust account in the same manner after receiving from Bar Counsel in March of 1998 a hypothetical model of the proper maintenance of a trust account. After receiving the model, Respondent had over eight months before the Inquiry Panel hearing commenced in which to institute the proper procedures for his trust account, but he failed to do so. Even absent such specific assistance, every attorney is deemed to know the Rules of Professional Conduct and is charged with the knowledge of how to operate and maintain a trust account. <em>See </em>Rule 16-601 <em>et seq. See also Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). We have made clear that neither ignorance of ethical duties nor ignorance of bookkeeping requirements is a defense in disciplinary proceedings, although a finding with respect to intent with which a violation was committed may have a bearing on the appropriate sanction. <em>See id. </em>In the instant case, Respondent acted intentionally, and not merely negligently. Respondent knew that he was invading client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Respondent\u2019s conduct is further aggravated by his failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel and his failure to produce records from the trust account to aid Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation. The failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel is a serious violation. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 255-56, 760 A.2d 1108, 1109 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Judge Friedman found that Respondent failed to respond to lawful demands of Bar Counsel on at least seven separate occasions. Further, Judge Friedman found that Respondent did not produce the canceled checks, calendars used to record fees, and check stubs he referred to throughout his testimony before the Inquiry Panel and the hearing judge. The <em>few </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>settlement sheets, bank statements, and canceled checks that Respondent provided to Bar Counsel were not provided in a timely fashion and only after several requests from Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">As mitigation, Respondent asserts that, other than the check payable to Federal Express that had to be presented twice, Bar Counsel has produced no evidence of harm suffered as a result of his conduct. This Court, however, has stated that the rule against misappropriation is \u201cconcerned with the risk of loss, not only the actual loss.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 489, 671 A.2d at 483. This is so because, <em>inter alia, </em>the failure to keep client funds separate subjects client monies to the claims of the attorney\u2019s creditors. <em>See id. See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 658, 441 A.2d 338, 342 (1982) (noting that although the attorney was fortunate that there was no actual loss to the client by virtue of the negative balances in the escrow account, the public must be protected).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Respondent willfully misappropriated funds from his client trust account and commingled his personal funds with those of his clients. We have stated time and again that misappropriation of client funds alone will result in disbarment in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 519, 704 A.2d 1225, 1241 (1998); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 417, 614 A.2d 955, 958 (1992). Respondent has not demonstrated any such compelling circumstances in this case. Additionally, the gravity of Respondent\u2019s conduct is compounded by other numerous rule violations: failing to properly name and designate the trust account, withdrawing funds payable to cash, failing to communicate the terms of his contingency fee agreement in writing, failing to respond to lawful demands of Bar Counsel, and giving false testimony before the Inquiry Panel. The appropriate sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The dissent asserts that Respondent\u2019s conduct does not amount to \u201ca willful misappropriation of client funds or even willful defiance of Bar Counsel\u2019s requests.\u201d Dissenting op. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>231, 768 A.2d at 619. Judge Friedman found willful misappropriation. Is the dissent concluding, <em>sub silentio, </em>that Judge Friedman\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous? The dissent ignores Judge Friedman\u2019s finding that Respondent <em>intentionally </em>delayed paying the clients creditors in order to use funds belonging to one client to pay another client\u2019s obligations. These actions unquestionably amount to the unauthorized use by an attorney of client funds that were entrusted to him. It makes no difference whether Respondent received a personal benefit from the use of the funds, whether he intended to restore the money, or whether he was under stress when he took money from one client to pay another client\u2019s obligations. He willfully misappropriated client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The dissent concludes that the sanction of disbarment in this case is \u201cmerely punitive.\u201d Dissenting op. at 232, 768 A.2d at 620. This is not so. We reiterate that the purpose of sanctions includes the preservation of public confidence in the legal profession and to make clear to the bar that such conduct will not be tolerated. Let the message be loud and clear: This Court will not tolerate invasion of client funds, misappropriation of client funds, or stonewalling requests of Bar Counsel for information about trust accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in discussing the impact on the public when an attorney steals client money, cogently noted that the court\u2019s treatment of such offenses affects public confidence much more than the offense itself. <em>See In re Addams, </em>579 A.2d 190, 194 (D.C.1990). \u201cArguments for lenient discipline overlook this effect as well as the overriding importance of maintaining that confidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Wilson, </em>81 N.J. 451, 409 A.2d 1153, 1154 (1979)).

With respect, I do most strenuously dissent, however, from the sanction of disbarment imposed by the Court. I agree that respondent\u2019s conduct was not only inappropriate but seriously so. He co-mingled funds and did not keep proper records and, as a result, allowed four overdrafts to occur in what should have been a trust account for client funds. He was also less than candid and forthcoming in response to Bar Counsel\u2019s legitimate requests for information and documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">All of that conduct was both wrong and inexcusable. I do not believe, however, that it amounted to the kind of willful misappropriation of client funds or willful defiance of Bar Counsel\u2019s request that was apparent in the cases cited and relied upon by the <em>Court</em>\u2014Attorney <em>Griev. Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>328 Md. 412, 614 A.2d 955 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ezrin, </em>312 Md. 603, 541 A.2d 966 (1988); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 307 A.2d 677 (1973); and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The co-mingling of client and attorney funds always creates the potential for misappropriation, even when there is no intent to misappropriate. A misappropriation necessarily occurs whenever the attorney withdraws funds from a co-mingled account for his or her own purpose and, as a result, leaves the account insufficient to cover all client funds, and such a misappropriation is never innocent. It is not necessarily willful, however, or for the conscious purpose of unlawfully taking funds held in trust for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">In those situations where the misappropriation <em>is </em>willful and <em>is </em>consciously done for an unlawful purpose, disbarment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>almost always the appropriate response, for the attorney is then, in effect, stealing the client\u2019s money. That is essentially what occurred in the cases cited by the Court. That is not what happened here, however. Disbarment in this setting is not warranted, but is merely punitive, which is not its purpose. Under all of the circumstances apparent here, I believe that an indefinite suspension would be satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Chief Judge Bell and Judge Eldridge have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
