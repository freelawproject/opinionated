Johnson (Respondent) and John F. McLemore.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this petition, Bar Counsel prosecuted a complaint against Respondent alleging violations of Rules 1.7(b) (conflict of interest), 3.3(a)(1) (candor toward the tribunal), 5.5 (unauthorized practice of law), 7.1 (communications concerning a lawyer\u2019s services), 7.5 (firm names and letterheads), and 8.4 (misconduct) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Court referred the matter to Judge Ann S. Harrington of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to make recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 16-711(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">After a three day evidentiary hearing, Judge Harrington filed a written Opinion on 13 November 2000, in which she found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.7(b), 3.3(a)(1), 5.5(a), 7.1, 7.5(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). In addition to filing exceptions to certain findings of fact and conclusions of law made by Judge Harrington, Respondent also excepted to specific evidentiary matters regarding one of the complainants, Mrs. Rebecca Bantug, and her testimony before the Inquiry Panel. Petitioner, who took' exception only to Judge Harrington\u2019s conclusion that Respondent did not violate Rule 7.5(d), recommends that, even should we overrule its exception, we disbar Respondent from the practice of law for his misconduct. Assuming we do not dismiss the petition or remand the matter for a new hearing as he asks, Respondent urges, as an appropriate sanction, a reprimand or a 30 day suspension, at worst.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">From the record before her, Judge Harrington made the following findings of fact pertaining to Respondent\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">A. <em>The Law Offices of McLemore and Johnson, P.C.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">1. Respondent was admitted to practice law in Virginia and the District of Columbia (D.C.) in June 1988. He is not and never has been licensed to practice law in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">2. In January 1997, Respondent and McLemore forged a professional association when they began sharing office space, equipment, support staff, and expenses in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">3. Respondent testified that he and McLemore maintained their own clients and files, with McLemore handling the Maryland cases and Respondent handling the Virginia and D.C. cases. He also claimed that, when his clients sought services in Maryland, he referred them to McLe-more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>4. Respondent and McLemore practiced under the firm name of \u201cLaw Offices of McLemore and Johnson, F.C.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\">5. Respondent admitted that he did not indicate his jurisdictional limitations on the firm\u2019s letterhead, which listed only a Maryland office. Respondent contended that he did not think he needed to list his jurisdictional limitations because he and McLemore maintained a single office in Maryland, not in multiple jurisdictions, and because they did not mix files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">B. <em>The Contract of Sale for the Bantugs</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Home</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">1. On 13 June 1996, Respondent entered into a contract with Arturo and Rebecca Bantug for the purchase of their Fort Washington, Maryland, home. The terms of the contract required Respondent to pay $6000 [to the Bantugs] and all debts accrued and accruing, including penalties, on the first and second mortgages held by Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation (Chase Manhattan) and Commercial Credit Corporation, respectively, in addition to securing [re]financing by 30 May 1997, the date after which the contract would terminate. The Bantugs were required by the contract not to contact either mortgage company to discuss the sale of the property without Respondent\u2019s prior knowledge and consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">2. Prior to [Respondent] entering into the contract for sale, Chase Manhattan retained counsel to initiate foreclosure proceedings [in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland] based upon the Bantugs\u2019 default on their first mortgage. Respondent was aware of this situation, and on 28 May 1996, he contacted Chase Manhattan\u2019s counsel to advise that the Bantugs had retained him to represent them in connection with the pending foreclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>sure and to propose that the Bantugs make double payments on the defaulted mortgage until the arrearage was satisfied. The [lender\u2019s] law firm rejected this proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">3. A distant relative of the Bantugs, a practicing attorney, assisted them with drafting the contract of sale. Although the Bantugs did not retain an attorney to represent them in conjunction with this sale, Respondent did not advise them that they might want to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">4. On or about 16 June 1996, approximately three days after signing the contract, the Bantugs relocated to the Phillippines, where they continue to reside. Respondent moved into the Fort Washington home in June 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">5. Respondent breached the terms of the contract by failing to bring the first or second mortgage current.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">6. On 10 July 1996, approximately one month after executing the contract of sale, Respondent again wrote to Chase Manhattan\u2019s law firm to advise that the Bantugs were still interested in bringing their account current. On 5 August 1996, Respondent sent the law firm yet another proposal for payment of the arrearage on the \u25a0 Bantugs\u2019 account along with a request that their loan be reinstated. Respondent attached a copy of a letter allegedly signed by Mr. and Mrs. Bantug, which explained that a family crisis had caused them to fall behind on their payments and that they desired to bring their loan current and to have their loan reinstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">7. Rebecca Bantug testified<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that she told Respondent of her and her husband\u2019s plans to sell their home because they were several months in arrears on both of the mortgages. According to Mrs. Bantug, Respondent of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>fered to purchase the home, which she indicated Respondent knew had been appraised, prior to the sale, for $250,000. She further testified that Respondent neither disclosed that his interest in the sale might be adverse to their interest nor advised her how to deal with the delinquent mortgages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">C. <em>The Bantugs \u2019 Petition for Bankruptcy</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">1. Mrs. Bantug testified that she returned to the United States in June 1997, one year after her departure. Retrieving her mail from her sister\u2019s house, which she used for her forwarding address, Mrs. Bantug discovered that Chase Manhattan\u2019s counsel had attempted to contact her regarding the foreclosure sale of the Fort Washington home. Upon consulting with an attorney, Mrs. Bantug contacted Chase Manhattan and Commercial Credit to obtain information regarding the status of her mortgages; she learned then that a petition for bankruptcy had been filed on the Bantugs\u2019 behalf. On referral, Mrs. Bantug retained an attorney more familiar with foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings to represent her and her husband in resolving the bankruptcy matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">2. On 23 May 1997, a voluntary petition for bankruptcy was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland, Greenbelt Division. The petition bears the purported signatures of the Bantugs and was allegedly filed by McLemore, whose signature also appears on the petition. On 9 June 1997, additional documents were filed in the case, including a statement of financial affairs, an individual debtor\u2019s statement of intention, and a Chapter 13 plan, all of which bear the Bantugs\u2019 purported signatures. On 26 June 1997, a motion to convert from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 was filed bearing McLemore\u2019s purported signature,.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">3. On 27 May 1997, a notice of bankruptcy was filed [in the foreclosure action] in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. The notice, stating that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>voluntary petition for bankruptcy had been filed on behalf of the Bantugs, bears MeLemore\u2019s purported signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">4. The Bantugs\u2019 counsel confronted McLemore and asked him why he had filed the bankruptcy petition without the consent or knowledge of the Bantugs. McLemore responded that he did not know the Bantugs; he did not represent them; he did not file the petition; and, that he did not authorize anyone else to sign their names or his own. Rather, he informed the Bantugs\u2019 attorney that it was his partner, Respondent, who represented the Bantugs in their bankruptcy matter. Although McLemore admitted that Respondent had requested that McLemore act as local counsel in connection with a Maryland bankruptcy claim, McLemore asserted that Respondent provided him with neither the names of the parties nor the details of the case. Moreover, he claimed that he never authorized Respondent to sign his name, and that Respondent never consulted with him before he affixed the signatures and filed the petition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">5. Respondent maintains that Mrs. Bantug, if not her husband, knew about the filing of the bankruptcy petition, for it was necessary to file the petition in order to stop the foreclosure sale on the Fort Washington home, which had been scheduled for 27 May 1997. Respondent also claims that he was unable to secure financing, as required under the terms of the contract of sale, because the true value of the home was significantly less than the appraisal value. He noted that he never intended to pursue the bankruptcy matter, but rather intended only to delay the foreclosure sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">6. Respondent admitted that he signed the Bantugs\u2019 and MeLemore\u2019s names to the bankruptcy petition without their express permission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He reiterates, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Mrs. Bantug knew about the petition. It is his contention that he and Mrs. Bantug were more than friends, and that hard feelings on her part may have precipitated her complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-4\">7. Mrs. Bantug testified<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that she never retained Respondent to represent her or her husband in a bankruptcy matter, and that she never even discussed filing for bankruptcy with Respondent. Confirming Respondent\u2019s admissions, she stated that she never signed her name to any of the bankruptcy-related documents. Her account differs from Respondent\u2019s, however, in that she also claims she never authorized Respondent to sign her name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">8. Chase Manhattan\u2019s counsel ultimately sold the Fort Washington home to McLemore at a foreclosure sale on 21 January 1998. McLemore purchased the home on Respondent\u2019s behalf because Respondent could not find anyone else to attend the sale. Although McLemore intended to purchase the home in Respondent\u2019s name, pursuant to an executed power of attorney, he actually purchased the home in his own name, with the intention of immediately substituting Respondent as the purchaser. This substitution was made shortly after the sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Based upon these findings of fact, Judge Harrington concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.7(b), 3.3(a)(1), 5.5(a), 7.1, 7.5(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Both parties except to some part or another of Judge Harrington\u2019s findings and/or conclusions. Respondent asserts that there was no conflict of interest created between the Bantugs and himself; that he did exhibit candor before the tribunal; and, that Judge Harrington and this Court have no jurisdiction over this matter. In this regard, Respondent specifically argues that, because he is not a member of the Maryland bar, he cannot be sanctioned by the Court of Appeals of Maryland. In a separate, evidentiary argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Respondent contends that it was error for Judge Harrington to declare Mrs. Bantug an unavailable witness and to accept into evidence her testimony before the Inquiry Panel. Moreover, he argues that Mrs. Bantug\u2019s attorney should have been compelled to divulge information regarding his client\u2019s relationship with Respondent because Mrs. Bantug waived her attorney-client privilege. Petitioner excepts to Judge Harrington\u2019s conclusion that Respondent did not violate MRPC 7.5(d). We address both parties\u2019 exceptions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">This Court has original jurisdiction over all attorney</p>\n<p id=\"AGr\">disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 473 (1996); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 16-709(b) (stating \u201c[c]harges against an attorney shall be filed on behalf of the [Attorney Grievance] Commission in the Court of Appeals\u201d). As to Respondent\u2019s exceptions to Judge Harrington\u2019s findings, \u201cwe [presently make] an independent, detailed review of the complete record with particular reference to the evidence relat[ed] to the disputed factual finding.\u201d <em>See Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152; <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 473 (quoting <em>Bar Association v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973)). In our review, \u201cwe must keep in mind that the findings of the [hearing] judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152; <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 473; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 674, 496 A.2d 672, 677 (1985); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Collins, </em>295 Md. 532, 548, 457 A.2d 1134, 1142 (1983) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 678, 431 A.2d 1336, 1349 (1981)). We note that the hearing judge \u201cmay elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon,\u201d <em>Kemp, </em>303 Md. at 675, 496 A.2d at 677, for she or he is in the best position to assess a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152. Therefore, we will not tamper with Judge Harrington\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>findings if they are grounded on clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Kahn, </em>290 Md. at 678, 431 A.2d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">We recently reiterated the definition of clear and convincing evidence in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 79, 753 A.2d 17, 35 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-5\">The requirement of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence does not call for \u201cunanswerable\u201d or \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. It has also been said that the term \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details there of narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">(quoting <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 320, 413 A.2d 170, 178 (1980) (quoting 30 Am.Jur. 2d Evidence \u00a7 1167) (citing Whi<em>tington v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 676, 679 n. 3, 262 A.2d 75, 77 n. 3 (1970))).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">A. <em>Respondent\u2019s Evidentiary Exceptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Respondent argues that Judge Harrington erred when she determined that Mrs. Bantug was an unavailable witness under Rule 5-804(a)(5)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and admitted into evidence, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Rule 5 804(b)(1),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> testimony that Mrs. Bantug gave to the Inquiry Panel over the telephone on 11 February 1999. Respondent makes several assertions in pursuing this argument. First, Respondent asserts that Bar Counsel did not avail itself of all reasonable means to insure Mrs. Bantug\u2019s ability to testify before Judge Harrington, for \u201cthe burden rested upon Bar Counsel to prove that there was no process, no act, no statute, no comity, literally nothing that would produce her presence with regard to \u2018other reasonable means\u2019 employed to get her to trial.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Respondent argued further that, because \u201cit is the cost of [his] doing business,\u201d Bar Counsel should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>have paid for Mrs. Bantug to fly from the Phillippines if the reason she could not attend the hearing was due to economic hardship.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, Respondent argued that Mrs. Bantug\u2019s \u201coral statement\u201d should not have been admitted because \u201cthere was no oath administered in the Phillippines.\u201d Third, Respondent asserted that he was given no advance notice that Mrs. Bantug would not be present before Judge Harrington.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Fourth and lastly, Respondent asserted that declaring Mrs. Bantug an unavailable witness and admitting her testimony given before the Inquiry Panel \u201cwas unfair and violates [his] due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-804(a)(5) requires that Bar Counsel be unable to secure Mrs. Bantug\u2019s availability at the hearing <em>either </em>by process <em>or other </em>reasonable means. The rule does not, as Respondent incorrectly contends, require that Bar Counsel go to any lengths \u2014 to exhaust every conceivable means \u2014 to procure Mrs. Bantug\u2019s attendance. As we stated in an analogous context in <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 222, 634 A.2d 464, 468-69 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">\u201cOther reasonable means\u201d require efforts in good faith and due diligence to procure attendance. If the declarant is so unavailable as a witness, former testimony bearing the indicia of reliability, given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding, may be admissible if the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. In such circumstances, the receipt in evidence of the prior testimony does not offend either the confrontation requirement or the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In <em>Breeden, </em>we held that the State\u2019s attempts at service of process were not sufficient to meet its burden to prove that an expert witness was unavailable, thus making the admission of the expert\u2019s prior testimony a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. 333 Md. at 227, 634 A.2d at 471. The witness in <em>Breeden </em>was located in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, which placed that <em>Breeden </em>witness within the scope of the court\u2019s subpoena power. 333 Md. at 222-25, 634 A.2d at 469-70.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>In the present case, Mrs. Bantug is a citizen of the Phillippines.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because she is a not a citizen of the United States or one of its territories, she could not be compelled, as Bar Counsel properly maintains, to attend Respondent\u2019s hearing by virtue of a Maryland judicial subpoena. \u201c[Ojther reasonable means\u201d requires a good faith effort on Bar Counsel\u2019s part to procure Mrs. Bantug\u2019s attendance, and, via email communications, Bar Counsel apparently made such an effort,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial court did not err by declaring Mrs. Bantug an unavailable witness. Moreover, we also conclude that, where Respondent had and exercised a full opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine Mrs. Bantug when she testified by telephone at the Inquiry Panel hearing conducted on 11 February 1999, Judge Harrington did not err by admitting that testimony in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Additionally, we find no merit in Respondent\u2019s contention that Mrs. Bantug\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because she was not sworn properly and because the admission of her testimony violated his right to due process. The former contention becomes frivolous and transparent in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of the following discourse on the record before the Inquiry-Panel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">[COURT REPORTER]: May I swear in the witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">[MR. RYDER<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]: Absolutely. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">[RAYMOND HEIN]: Mrs. Bantug, I\u2019m just, one minute, this is Raymond Hein [assistant bar counsel]. A court reporter is here in the room and he is now going to swear you in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">[COURT REPORTER]: If you would, raise your right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">[MRS. BANTUG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">WHEREUPON, REBECCA BANTUG, HAVING BEEN DULY SWORN ACCORDING TO LAW, WAS EXAMINED AND TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Mrs. Bantug properly was sworn. Respondent did not raise an objection before the Inquiry Panel as to the manner or venue in which she was sworn nor how her testimony was taken. We also reiterate that Respondent, who was present at the hearing, had an opportunity and similar motive to conduct cross-examination of Mrs. Bantug at that time. Respondent exercised this opportunity fully, which undermines his argument that he was denied due process because he was unable to cross-examine Mrs. Bantug again in front of Judge Harrington. We reject, therefore, Respondent\u2019s evidentiary exceptions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>B. <em>Other Exceptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">1. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.7(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.7(b) </em>\u2014 Conflict <em>of</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\n<em>Interest: General Rule.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">(2) the client consents after consultation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Petitioner contends that Respondent, by indicating to Chase Manhattan\u2019s counsel that he represented the Bantugs in connection with the foreclosure while simultaneously entering into a contract of sale to purchase the Bantugs\u2019 home himself, violated MRPC 1.7(b). Specifically, Petitioner asserts that Respondent acted in his self-interest and adversely to the interest of the Bantugs, who wished to avoid a foreclosure sale, when he forced the foreclosure by breaching the terms of the contract for sale. Specifically, Petitioner argues that Respondent acted in his self-interest exclusively by living in the Bantugs\u2019 home for approximately one year and by failing to disclose to the Bantugs that he failed to obtain financing or to bring their mortgages current.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">In response, Respondent asserts that he did not violate MRPC 1.7(b) because the Bantugs were represented by other counsel when they sold him their home. According to Respondent, a distant relative of the Bantugs, a practicing attorney, was involved in the preparation of the contract of sale and present at closing, where he witnessed the signing of the contract. Respondent specifically disputes the conclusion that such conduct by the Bantugs\u2019 attorney/relative does not constitute the practice of law even though there was no retainer agreement, contract, or fee involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">After thoroughly reviewing the record, we agree with Judge Harrington\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as they pertain to MRPC 1.7(b). The evidence, such as Respondent\u2019s testimony, <em>infra, </em>supports the conclusion that the Ban-tugs did not know about the foreclosure sale, much less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>engage Respondent to represent their interests with regard to it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Mr. Johnson, at any time prior to filing the voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the names of Arturo and Rebecca Bantug, did you have authorization, written or oral specifically from Arturo Bantug to file a bankruptcy case in his name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">[RESPONDENT]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Do you have any written agreements to represent Mr. Bantug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">[RESPONDENT]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Do you have that here with you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-10\">[RESPONDENT]: You have it. It\u2019s the contract for purchase of realty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Can you tell us where in that document it authorizes you to file bankruptcy on behalf of Mr. Bantug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">[RESPONDENT]: The last whereas clause on the first page. Whereas, until such time as buyer acquires financing, sellers will take all lawful and necessary steps to protect sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 interest in the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-13\">[BAR COUNSEL]: And you believe that authorized you to file for bankruptcy on behalf of Mr. Bantug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-14\">[RESPONDENT]: That in addition to oral statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-15\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Was the term \u2018bankruptcy\u2019 ever discussed with Mr. Bantug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-16\">[RESPONDENT]: Yes, we discussed bankruptcy, as one of many options.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-17\">[BAR COUNSEL]: In May of 1997, when a bankruptcy was actually filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court, did you speak to Mr. Bantug before filing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>[RESPONDENT]: No, I didn\u2019t.

Moreover, we share Judge Harrington\u2019s obvious difficulty accepting that Respondent truly believed that the language quoted <em>supra </em>from the contract of sale authorized Respondent to file for bankruptcy on the Bantugs\u2019 behalf. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such language and the purported \u201coral statements\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provided him with the authority, then, using Respondent\u2019s reasoning, Respondent (\u201cbuyer\u201d) would be authorized to file a bankruptcy petition on the Bantugs\u2019 (\u201csellers\u201d) behalf so that the Bantugs could protect Respondent\u2019s and their own interests in the property. Common sense and well-recognized legal principles indicate this cannot be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Bantugs were represented by independent counsel in negotiating and executing the contract of sale, Respondent nonetheless acted in his own interest, and against the interest of the Bantugs, when he failed to record the deed transferring title to the property, submitted to Chase Manhattan a proposal on the Bantugs\u2019 behalf (but without their knowledge or consent) for a workout of the arrearages of a loan that <em>Respondent </em>was obligated to bring current under the terms of the contract of sale, initiated the bankruptcy proceeding without the Bantugs\u2019 knowledge, and failed to take any remedial action to have the unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>rized bankruptcy case dismissed. We conclude, therefore, that Judge Harrington\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that Respondent violated MRPC 1.7(b) were based on clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">2. <em>Violation of MRPC 3.3(a)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>3.3(a)(1) </em>\u2014 Candor <em>toward the tribunal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Respondent excepts to Judge Harrington\u2019s findings that he forged the Bantugs\u2019 and McLemore\u2019s signatures. According to Respondent, both the Bantugs and McLemore knew that Respondent was going to sign their names to the bankruptcy petition.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Yet, we note the following discourse before Judge Harrington between Bar Counsel and Respondent regarding whether McLemore authorized the filing of the bankruptcy petition and whether Respondent filed accurate information in that petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Mr. McLemore didn\u2019t know anything about [the filing of the bankruptcy petition or the foreclosure on the Batungs\u2019 home]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">[RESPONDENT]: No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">[BAR COUNSEL]: And to the extent that you may have had conversations with the Bantugs after your association with Mr. McLemore, he wouldn\u2019t have known about that [the bankruptcy petition] even after your association?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">[RESPONDENT]: No, because all of my discussions were with [Mrs. Bantug] at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>[BAR COUNSEL]: Well, there came a point when you actually had to prepare some paperwork to file [for the bankruptcy petition].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">[RESPONDENT]: Yes, I prepared them and I filed them and I didn\u2019t show them to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">[BAR COUNSEL]: You at no point showed them to him.

McLe-more\u2019s testimony, <em>infra, </em>supports this finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cI\u2019ve never met with the Bantugs. I\u2019ve never had a retainer agreement with them. I never had any kind of agreement with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">I never signed any bankruptcy petitions. I don\u2019t have any explanations of why particular petitions were signed and my name was on them, other that I didn\u2019t give authorization for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Additionally, Respondent admitted to Judge Harrington that \u201che filed a bankruptcy petition with inaccurate and incomplete information.\u201d The testimony of Mr. Reburn corroborates this finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-12\">[BAR COUNSEL]: Did [Respondent] give you any further information about the bankruptcy filing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-13\">[MR. REBURN]: Well, I inquired about whether or not he had been retained, and the preparation of the documents; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and he acknowledged that he had not been paid. I had documents in front of me and we reviewed them; I reviewed those with him, but he had not been paid the fee that was outlined on the bankruptcy documents and <em>he had not been retained, </em>and there were misrepresentations. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-4\">[MR. REBURN]: ... I said \u201cIs that a misrepresentation?\u201d And he indicated to me that it was.

Having weighed the evidence and the testimony before her, Judge Harrington found that Respondent did not discuss the bankruptcy proceeding with the Bantugs, and thus he did not have the authority to sign their names to the petition. Judge Harrington also found that Respondent completed the bankruptcy petition using what he knew to be incorrect information about the Bantugs, and that he did not have McLe-more\u2019s authorization to enter his signature on that petition. Because these findings are based upon clear and convincing evidence, we sustain the resultant conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">3. <em>Violation of MRPC 5.5(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>5.5(a) </em>\u2014 Unautho<em>rized practice of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">A lawyer shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">(a) practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Maintaining that he is not a member of the Maryland Bar and has never practiced law in Maryland state courts, Respondent asserts that Judge Harrington erred when she concluded that he violated MRPC 5.5(a).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, he asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that he \u201conly possessed an office in Maryland.\u201d Respondent argues that this case is solely within federal jurisdiction because he filed pleadings and papers in a federal bankruptcy matter only. He further contends that his filing of the notice of bankruptcy in the Prince George\u2019s County foreclosure case was \u201cnot the act of an attorney and had no legal significance. It was simply courtesy to all; a notice that the bankruptcy had been filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional arguments are unfounded, for Respondent did practice law in Maryland without a license. Judge Harrington found that Respondent \u201cmet with clients in a Maryland office and advised clients in that office.\u201d She also found that Respondent misled the public, as well as his clients, by not including his jurisdictional limitations on the firm\u2019s letterhead, which bore only a Maryland address. The following interaction between Respondent and Bar Counsel is evidence supporting the judge\u2019s findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">[RESPONDENT]: Well, let me just address the issue of the letterhead. As I understand the Rules of Maryland ... I\u2019m not identified on the letterhead, there\u2019s a McLe-more &amp; Johnson.

We refer Respondent to MRPC 8.5, which governs our disciplinary jurisdiction over attorneys engaged in the practice of law in this State and which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">(b) A lawyer not admitted by the Court of Appeals to practice in this State is subject to the disciplinary authority of this State for conduct that constitutes a violation of these Rules and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">(1) involves the practice of law in this State by that lawyer, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">(2) involves that lawyer holding himself or herself out as practicing law in this State,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Moreover, Maryland Rule 16-701(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">Attorney means any person admitted by the Court of Appeals to practice law. <em>For purposes of discipline </em>or inactive status, <em>the term also includes a member of the bar of any other state, district, or territory of the United States who engages in the practice of law in this State, </em>or holds himself or herself out as practicing law in this State, or who has the obligation of supervision or control over another attorney who engages in the practice of law in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">(Emphasis added).

Regardless of the outcome of this, Should I voluntarily resign my membership in the Bar in the best interest of the Bar?\u201d After many weeks of soul searching, I came to the conclusion that I am both morally and intellectually fit to be a Member of the Bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em>O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. at 56, 400 A.2d at 417-18. Finding respondent\u2019s words and conduct relevant to determining the proper sanction to impose, the Court ultimately ordered a public reprimand. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. at 57, 400 A.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">We are at a loss as to why Respondent apparently believes the <em>O\u2019Neill </em>case is analogous to his own. Unlike the young attorney in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>who recognized his wrongdoing and considered what effect his conduct could have on the profession, Respondent neither recognizes that his conduct violated the MRPC nor expresses any regret for the harm he caused. Rather, Judge Harrington found that Respondent\u2019s actions were \u201cwithout excuse or mitigation.\u201d In light of Respondent\u2019s repetitive instances of unauthorized practice of law and acts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>deceit, represented in the findings of fact, we agree completely with Judge Harrington\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Harper &amp; Kemp, </em>356 Md. 53, 737 A.2d 557 (1999), we determined that an attorney not licensed to practice law in Maryland violated MRPC 5.5(a) in a \u201cdeliberate and persistent\u201d manner when he \u201cset up office for the general practice of law in Baltimore City in order to wring whatever value he could out of the inventory of pending cases of a disbarred lawyer who had practiced in Baltimore City.\u201d <em>Harper </em>&amp; <em>Kemp, </em>356 Md. at 70, 737 A.2d at 566. Determining that there was \u201cno reasonable basis on which [the attorney] could have thought his conduct was lawful,\u201d we ordered the attorney be disbarred because \u201c[o]ther unadmit-ted attorneys must be deterred from attempting to practice law in violation of the statutory prohibition against unauthorized practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same sanction is appropriate here, where Respondent misled the public regarding his jurisdictional practice limitations and forged the signatures of McLe-more and the Bantugs without their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Bar Counsel argues that the appropriate sanction for Respondent is disbarment in light of the serious nature of his conduct. We agree. Respondent repeatedly engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation. He made false statements to a tribunal, and he acted against the interests of the Bantugs during and after the sale of their home to him. We conclude that the appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY AT J.

Don F. Ryder, Jr., Esq. served as the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel that heard Mrs. Bantug\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\">. Aggrieved by Judge Harrington\u2019s findings that Mrs. Bantug's testimony before the Inquiry Panel was credible. Respondent asserted an additional exception. The Bantugs\u2019 attorney, both before the Inquiry Panel and Judge Harrington, asserted the attorney-client privilege, on his clients\u2019 behalf, and refused to produce or discuss in detail two letters from Mrs. Bantug to him that pertained to Respondent\u2019s purchase of the Bantugs\u2019 home and to the personal nature of Respondent\u2019s relationship with Mrs. Bantug. Respondent argues that, where her attorney was \"unsure\u201d whether Mrs. Bantug had mailed one of the letters to the Inquiry Panel and thus waived the privilege. Judge Harrington should not have permitted the attorney-client privilege to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>used as both a sword and a shield. As framed by Respondent, he \u201casserts <em>(but is not certain of this </em>position) that a client who asserts a claim against counsel waives any privilege by initiating this action.\u201d (Emphasis added). We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">MRPC 1.6, which governs the confidentiality of information, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-10\">(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm or in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-11\">(2) to rectify the consequences of a client's criminal or fraudulent act in the furtherance of which the lawyer\u2019s services were used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">(3) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, or to establish a defense to a criminal charge, civil claim, or disciplinary complaint against the lawyer based upon conduct in which a client was involved or to respond to allegations in any proceedings concerning the lawyer's representation of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-13\">(4) to comply with these Rules, a court order or other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">While Respondent may reveal privileged information regarding the Bantugs in defending himself against their complaint during the course of this particular proceeding, nothing in the rule permits the Bantugs\u2019 current attorney to reveal any privileged communications he received. While we agree that a letter sent to both the attorney and a third party (here, the Inquiry Panel) would no longer be privileged, we have found no evidence in the record to support Respondent's contention that such a letter was sent to or received by the Panel. Rather, we note the following discourse between Respondent and Mr. John W. Reburn, Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">[RESPONDENT]: Do you know there exists two communications from Mrs. Bantug to Mr. Champion [the Bantugs\u2019 current attorney], one about the personal relationship between [Respondent] and herself and the other about how they met and got into this transaction for this property?</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">[MR. REBURN]: I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">What is in this record are Mrs. Bantug\u2019s repeated refusals to waive her privilege. Because Rule 1.6 clearly prohibits the Bantugs\u2019 present attorney from revealing any confidential information without a waiver, we reject Respondent\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\">.

Respondent expands this argument by asserting that Judge Harrington and this Court have no jurisdiction over him since he is not, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>contends, a member of the Maryland Bar. According to Respondent, he should not be subject to the jurisdiction of this Court but, if at all, to the jurisdiction of \u201cthe Federal Courts who it is believed have their own separate disciplinary procedures.\u201d We disagree for the reasons enunciated <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b798-11\">. We note that neither party addressed whether Petitioner was a member of the federal bar.

As the record does not reflect whether Respondent is a member of the federal District Court bar, the reference in his brief to the \"separate method of handling disciplinary matters in the Federal Courts\u201d may present an illusory alternative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"><em>. </em>We highlight a particular comment made by Respondent in his exceptions.
