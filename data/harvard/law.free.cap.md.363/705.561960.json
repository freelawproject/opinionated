McCarter requested a jury trial, and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County. McCarter\u2019s initial appearance before the Circuit Court, pursuant to Rule 4-213(c), was on August 13,1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although McCarter was not represented by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>at the time and did not waive his right to counsel, he did purport to waive his right to a jury trial. The colloquy at the proceeding was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. McCarter, you are charged with possession of marijuana which carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $1,000 or one year in jail or both, possession of paraphernalia which carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $500.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">You have the right to be represented by an attorney.

If you don\u2019t have a lawyer on the trial date, you will be found to waive your right to a lawyer and have to proceed without one. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">The judge then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you know whether you want a Court or a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-16\">THE COURT: Do you understand you have the absolute right to be tried by a jury where 12 people hear the evidence? After hearing the evidence, they would all have to agree upon their verdict. They would all have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of your guilt before a jury would find you guilty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-18\">THE COURT: Understanding that, do you want to be tried by a jury or do you want to waive your right \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-20\">THE COURT: \u2014 to a jury trial and be tried by the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-21\">THE DEFENDANT: Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>.THE COURT: I find the defendant has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to trial by jury.

I am aware that before a finding of guilty in a jury trial, all twelve (12) jurors must find that I am guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I am aware that before a finding of guilty in a Court trial, the Judge must find that I am guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-9\">I hereby elect to be tried by: <em>COURT </em>I make this Election knowingly and voluntarily and with full knowledge that I may not be permitted to change the Election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">\n<em>I si Antwone McCarter \u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">On September 24, 1999, an assistant public defender entered his appearance on behalf of McCarter. A few days later, defense counsel moved to have the case scheduled for a trial by jury. Counsel argued that at the initial appearance McCarter had not waived his right to an attorney, and that the waiver of a jury trial is a critical stage of the proceedings during which the defendant was entitled to representation. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">McCarter appeared for trial. Before witnesses were called, defense counsel noted for the record that when McCarter elected a court trial he was not represented by counsel. The judge pointed out that the defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial from the bench. Again, defense counsel argued that a decision as to the mode of trial is a critical stage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>proceedings and that the defendant was entitled to an attorney when making the decision. The court nevertheless concluded that McCarter had previously knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a trial by jury. McCarter was then tried by the court. He was found guilty of possession of marijuana and not guilty on the charge of possession of paraphernalia. The court imposed a sentence of ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The defendant timely noted an appeal. Before argument in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion. <em>McCarter v. State, 358 </em>Md. 381, 749 A.2d 172 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The sole issue debated by the parties on this appeal is whether the circuit court proceeding on August 13,1999, was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal case, thereby triggering McCarter\u2019s constitutional right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">McCarter, discussing and primarily relying upon decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, argues that \u201c[i]n light of the ... decisions of the Supreme Court extending the [Sixth Amendment] right of counsel to pre-trial as well as trial proceedings, a defendant\u2019s election of court or jury trial must be deemed a \u2018critical stage\u2019 of the prosecution\u201d and that \u201ca decision regarding the mode of trial should be made only after an accused has had an opportunity to consult with counsel and obtain the benefit of counsel\u2019s opinion as to the manner of trial that would best serve his interests.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 7). The State asserts that \u201cthe resolution of McCarter\u2019s claim centers on whether his arraignment was a \u2018critical stage\u2019 in the proceedings requiring the assistance of counsel.\u201d (Appel-lee\u2019s brief at 2). The State contends that \u201cno decision of the Supreme Court or of the Maryland appellate courts has ... held\u201d that a \u201cproceeding wherein a defendant elects between a court trial or a jury trial is a \u2018critical stage\u2019 of the proceeding requiring the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Since McCarter did not waive the right to counsel, it is clear, as well as undisputed, that if McCarter had a right to the assistance of counsel at his initial appearance on August 13, 1999, the trial court erred in accepting McCarter\u2019s waiver of his right to a jury trial when the defendant did not have the benefit of counsel\u2019s advice. <em>See, generally, Coleman v. Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 7-11, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2002-2004, 26 L.Ed.2d 387, 395-398 (1970); <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 271-272, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1955-1956, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 1185-1186 (1967); <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 223-238, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1930-1938, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1155-1164 (1967); <em>White v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963); <em>Hamilton v. Alabama, </em>368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961). <em>See also, e.g., State v. Dickson, </em>9 Kan.App.2d 425, 680 P.2d 313 (1984) (the defendant was entitled to counsel at the arraignment at which he decided whether to request or waive a jury trial; thus the waiver by the unrepresented defendant was invalid); <em>Baker v. Wainwright, 245 </em>So.2d 289 (Fla.App.1971) (same, although the error was deemed harmless because the defendant and his counsel later acquiesced in a nonjury trial); <em>State v. Eller, </em>185 Wis.2d 917, 520 N.W.2d 291 (1994) (unrepresented defendant\u2019s pre-trial waiver of right to jury trial should not have been accepted by the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">As previously mentioned, the issue debated by the parties in this case has been whether the proceeding on August 13, 1999, when the defendant purported to waive his right to a jury trial, was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal case for purposes of the <em>constitutional </em>right to counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201cthis Court adheres to \u2018the established principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore Sun v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 659, 755 A.2d 1130, 1133-1134 (2000), quoting <em>Telni-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>koff v. Matusevitch, </em>347 Md. 561, 579 n. 15, 702 A.2d 230, 239 n. 15 (1997). <em>See, e.g., Harryman v. State, </em>359 Md. 492, 503 n. 6, 754 A.2d 1018, 1024 n. 6 (2000); <em>Ashford v. State, </em>358 Md. 552, 561, 750 A.2d 35, 40 (2000); <em>Thrower v. State ex rel. Bureau of Support Enforcement, </em>358 Md. 146, 149 n. 2, 747 A.2d 634, 636 n. 2 (2000), and cases there cited. This principle applies even if the non-constitutional ground was not raised by any party in the case. The \u201cappellate policy of avoiding unnecessary decision of constitutional issues gives rise to one of \u2018a very limited number of circumstances [that] have been treated as\u2019 \u201d \u201cextraordinary\u201d \u201c \u2018and thus within the exceptions to the requirement that an issue be raised in a certiorari petition, cross-petition, or order by the Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Professional Staff Nurses v. Dimensions Health Corp., </em>346 Md. 132, 138-139, 695 A.2d 158, 161 (1997), and cases there discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We shall hold that, at the proceeding on August 13, 1999, McCarter had a Maryland statutory right to counsel under Maryland Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27A, \u00a7 4, and Maryland Rule 4-214(b). In light of this holding, we need not and do not reach the issues of whether the August 13th proceeding was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal prosecution for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, whether there was a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the August 13th proceeding, or whether there was a right to counsel under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights which attached to the proceeding. Because McCarter had a <em>statutory </em>right to counsel at the August 13, 1999, proceeding, and because he did not waive his right to counsel, the trial court erred in holding that the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial when he did not have the benefit of counsel\u2019s advice. The trial court on August 13th should not have asked McCarter to choose between a jury or a nonjury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Art. 27A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 14, is the Maryland Public Defender Act. As this Court has pointed out on several occasions, \u201cthe right to counsel under the Public Defender Act is significantly broader than the constitutional right to coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>sel.\u201d <em>State v. Flansburg, </em>345 Md. 694, 700, 694 A.2d 462, 465 (1997). <em>See, e.g., Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 511-512, 687 A.2d 970, 977 (1997); <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 602-604, 474 A.2d 1305, 1316-1317 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Although \u201cthe Public Defender Act expressly grants a right to counsel only to indigents, this Court has held, on equal protection principles, that a person with means to obtain his own lawyer has a right to representation by his own counsel which is equally as broad as an indigent\u2019s right under the Public Defender Act.\u201d <em>State v. Flansburg, supra, </em>345 Md. at 700 n. 4, 694 A.2d at 465 n. 4. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>284 Md. 664, 670-671, 399 A.2d 256, 259-260 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 921, 100 S.Ct. 1858, 64 L.Ed.2d 275 (1980) (\u201can accused with the means to hire counsel to represent him ... could not be denied such representation in light of the statutory provisions granting legal assistance to an indigent accused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Section 4 of Art. 27A specifies the types of proceedings and the stages at which there is a statutory right to counsel. Section 4(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">\u201c(b) <em>Included proceedings. </em>\u2014 Legal representation shall be provided indigent defendants or parties in the following proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-8\">(1) Any criminal or juvenile proceeding constitutionally requiring the presence of counsel prior to presentment before a commissioner or judge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-9\">(2) Criminal or juvenile proceedings, where the defendant is charged with a serious crime, before the District Court of Maryland, the various circuit courts within the State of Maryland, and the Court of Special Appeals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-10\">(3) Postconviction proceedings under Article 27, Annotated Code of Maryland, when the defendant has a right to counsel pursuant to \u00a7 645A of that article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-11\">(4) Any other proceedings where possible incarceration pursuant to a judicial commitment of individuals in institutions of a public or private nature may result; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-12\">(5) An involuntary termination of parental rights proceeding or a hearing under \u00a7 5-319 of the Family Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Article, if the party is entitled to Public Defender representation under \u00a7 5-328 of the Family Law Article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">As the above-language indicates, proceedings where there is a constitutional right to counsel constitute only one of the five categories where the statute grants a right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Section 4(d) of Art. 27A specifies the \u201cstages\u201d at which the right of representation attaches. Instead of being limited to \u201ccritical stages\u201d of cases, \u00a7 4(d) expressly includes \u201call stages.\u201d Section 4(d) provides as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azs-dedup-1\">\u201c(d) <em>Extension of representation to all stages in proceedings. </em>\u2014 Representation by the Office of the Public Defender, or by an attorney appointed by the Office of the Public Defender, <em>shall extend to all stages </em>in the proceedings, including custody, interrogation, preliminary hearing, <em>arraignment, </em>trial, a hearing in an involuntary termination of parental rights proceeding, a hearing under \u00a7 5-319 of the Family Law Article, and appeal, if any, and shall continue until the final disposition of the cause, or until the assigned attorney is relieved by the Public Defender or by order of the court in which the cause is pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-7\"><em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 4-214(b), stating that counsel\u2019s \u201crepresentation extends to all stages in the proceedings, including but not limited to custody, interrogations ... [etc.].\u201d As the right of counsel \u201cshall extend to all stages,\u201d the right obviously attached to the August 13, 1999, proceeding. Moreover, expressly included in the list of illustrations of stages is an \u201carraignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">In a post-argument memorandum submitted by the State, it is argued that the statutory right to counsel did not attach to the August 13, 1999, proceeding because \u201cthe proceeding at issue here was not an arraignment as that term is used in the Public Defender statute because no plea was taken from the defendant.\u201d (State\u2019s memorandum of September 28, 2000, p. 2). The State cites cases from a few states which, for purposes of the procedure in those states, define \u201carraignment\u201d as an appearance at which a plea is entered. There are several alternative short answers to the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>First, </em>at the conclusion of the August 13th proceeding, the defendant signed a document which contained a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea. Thus, a plea was taken at the August 13th proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\"><em>Second, </em>the term \u201carraignment\u201d is no longer used in the Maryland Rules of Procedure. What was called an \u201carraignment\u201d in 1971 when the Public Defender Act was enacted is now called an \u201cinitial appearance,\u201d and the August 13th proceeding was an initial appearance. For example, <em>compare </em>Code, (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 591 <em>with </em>Code, (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 591 and <em>compare </em>Maryland Rules 4-213 and 4-215 <em>with </em>former Rules 723 and 719. When \u201carraignment\u201d is used in our cases, it is done so interchangeably with \u201cinitial appearance.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Brown, </em>341 Md. 609, 672 A.2d 602 (1996); <em>Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 474 A.2d 502 (1984); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 401, 722 A.2d 419 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\"><em>Third, </em>regardless of whether the August 13, 1999, proceeding was an \u201carraignment\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the statutory right to counsel \u201cextends to all stages in the proceedings.\u201d \u201cAll\u201d means \u201call,\u201d and it encompasses the August 13th proceeding regardless of its categorization. The specific types of proceedings listed in the statute and rule are for purposes of illustration only.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">As McCarter had a right to the advice of counsel before waiving his right to a jury trial on August 13,1999, the waiver was invalid. To reiterate, a trial judge should not ask a criminal defendant who appears at an initial appearance without a lawyer, and who has not waived his or her right to a lawyer, to elect between a jury or nonjury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.
