Darvish, Respondent, was found liable by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of defamation of Shahriar Gohari, Petitioner, and of tortious interference with a contract that Gohari had entered to purchase an automobile dealership. The jury awarded Petitioner compensatory damages in the amount of $600,000.00 for the defamation claim. Petitioner and Arlington Motors, Inc., Petitioner\u2019s co-plaintiff at trial, also were awarded $2,120,000.00 for tortious interference with the contract. The Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Circuit Court. According to the Court of Special Appeals, Respondent was entitled to a new trial, presumably on both counts, at which time he would be permitted to assert a qualified privilege defense and to introduce evidence that his statements about Petitioner were true. <em>Darvish v. Gohari, </em>130 Md.App. 265, 745 A.2d 1134 (2000). We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Gohari v. Darvish, </em>359 Md. 28, 753 A.2d 1 (2000), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">1. Whether the law of qualified privilege should be expanded to protect a business owner\u2019s defamatory statements about a former employee who seeks to enter a competitive business arrangement with a third party, even though such statements neither arise in the context of an employer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>employee relationship nor relate to any common interest of the business owner and third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">2. Whether a jury verdict may be reversed where a qualified privilege defense instruction, if given, would not have made any difference to the verdict, yet the Court of Special Appeals failed to consider whether any error is harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>A Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Darvish, at all pertinent times, was the owner and chief executive officer of Darcars Automotive Group (Darcars), the umbrella organization of a group of automotive franchises and related enterprises. In January 1987, Darvish hired Gohari, an accountant by training,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a comptroller trainee at one of the Darcars dealerships. In January 1988, Darvish promoted Gohaii to comptroller of Darcars Toyota, where he was responsible for overseeing the accounting and financial functions of the dealership. By 1992, Gohari ascended to the position of senior vice president of the Darcars Automotive Group<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was identified as such on the Darcars Toyota dealer\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Although Gohari accumulated extensive experience in the financial and accounting aspects of the businesses operated under the Darcars umbrella while working there, he was not trained in other aspects of its operations. Darvish testified that the only training Gohari received was in accounting; Gohari was not provided with any training in sales, service; or any of the other operating departments in the Darcars empire.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because he specialized in the financial side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>business, with demanding responsibilities that Darvish described as \u201cmore than a full time job,\u201d Gohari did not supervise directly the sales, service, or parts department of Darcars Toyota, nor did he, according to Darvish, ever express an interest in training to become a general manager in charge of supervising those departments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, Gohari agreed that he had not expressed interest in becoming a general manager because such a position would be the equivalent of a demotion from his position as senior vice president. When asked whether he lacked retail operational experience in the business, however, Gohari asserted that he did not lack such experience.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In August of 1996, Gohari quit his job with Darcars. In November of 1996, he entered into an agreement with James Kline to buy the Kline Arlington Toyota dealership.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Needing Toyota\u2019s permission to consummate the transaction, Gohari applied to Toyota Motor Sales, Inc.\u2019s (Toyota) local agent, Central Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc. (CATD), for approval to own and operate the dealership. According to testimony at trial, CATD was responsible for examining \u201cthe credentials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>of the individual to determine whether or not [he or she] qualified to be a dealer and/or operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">On 2 December 1996, Gohari met with Dennis Clements, president, and Roy Arminger, dealer development manager, of CATD. Gohari authorized CATD to \u201cinquire, through outside sources, about [his] character, general reputation and credit history\u201d and to \u201cobtain and share information from and with any of its affiliated entities.\u201d At trial, Clements testified that he specifically sought and received Gohari\u2019s permission to interview Darvish about Gohari\u2019s work experience at Darcars Toyota. On 10 December 1996, Clements met with Darvish and inquired about Gohari\u2019s qualifications \u2014 experience, background, and capabilities \u2014 to own the Arlington Toyota franchise. Later that day, Clements also met with Kline to report on the status of CATD\u2019s consideration of Gohari\u2019s franchise transfer application.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Clements drafted a file memorandum, dated 10 December 1996, regarding his meeting with Kline. In that memorandum, Clements related some of what he claimed Darvish told him in their meeting on 10 December 1996. That memorandum recited that Darvish told Clements that \u201cGohari lacked the experience, capacity and character to be considered a qualified candidate.\u201d Clements drafted a second file memorandum, dated 11 December 1996, purportedly memorializing his 10 December 1996 meeting with Darvish, which stated that Darvish also told Clements that Gohari \u201chad suddenly left the DARCARS organization several months ago in an unprofessional manner and with no notice[,] ... that there was questionable financial manipulation by Mr. Gohari to inflate his compensation^] and that Mr. Darvish should have terminated Mr. Gohari\u2019s employment much earlier but had kept him on out of loyalty.\u201d The 11 December 1996 memorandum also stated, among other things, that Gohari \u201chad no experience in the operational aspects of a dealership\u201d and that Darvish strongly questioned whether Gohari\u2019s experience or background qualified him to operate a dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Clements spoke to Armiger about his meeting with Darvish, and Armiger prepared his own file memorandum summarizing Clements\u2019s description of Darvish\u2019s 10 December comments about Gohari. During a 12 December 1996 telephone conversation with Darvish, Arminger read aloud to Darvish several passages from this memorandum reciting what Darvish reportedly told Clements about whether Gohari \u201chad had operational authority over the dealership, dishonesty, manipulation of financial figures, people skills and whether ... he had had other automotive experience other than accounting.\u201d Arming-er testified that, after relating these passages to Darvish, Darvish remained silent, offering no denials as to whether he had made these statements. Arminger considered the silence to be confirmation that Darvish had made the statements. Armiger requested that Darvish provide a letter confirming the statements that Darvish made to Clements. He told Darvish that Gohari\u2019s approval \u201cwould be dependent upon what was contained in the letter.\u201d Darvish sent Armiger the requested letter on 13 December 1996. The letter stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Mr. Gohari was employed at DARCARS ... through August 12,1996, as in house controller____He had responsibility for overseeing day-to-day accounting issues and coordinating all accounting issues with ... DARCARS\u2019 outside accounting firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Mr. Gohari\u2019s responsibilities did not include, however, involvement in or supervision over other dealership departments, including New and Used Car Sales, Service and Parts, Leasing, Body Shop, Customer Relations, or Finance or Insurance Programs....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">Unfortunately, Mr. Gohari left his employment in a most unprofessional manner.... As a result, there are many unanswered questions concerning the proper allocation of expenses in the dealership and pay plan applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">CATD ultimately concluded that, because Gohari lacked the necessary operational experience, it would require that he recruit a qualified general manager to oversee the day-to-day retail business of the dealership before it would approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>franchise transfer. Gohari submitted several names as possible general managers, but was unable to procure CATD approval before his contract with Kline expired by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\n<em>B. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Gohari, in his amended complaint in the Circuit Court, alleged that Darvish had defamed him and had tortiously interfered with his contract to purchase the Kline Arlington Toyota dealership. In his answer, Darvish asserted that his communications to CATD, solicited with Gohari\u2019s permission as part of CATD\u2019s evaluation of his dealership application, were privileged. Before trial, Gohari filed a motion in limine to preclude Darvish from asserting qualified privilege. The Circuit Court granted this motion, without further elaboration as to its reasoning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Gohari also filed motions in limine to preclude Darvish from introducing at trial evidence of Gohari\u2019s dishonesty or manipulation of financial statements while at Darcars, claiming that Darvish had waived any defense of truth by denying that he had said Gohari was dishonest or manipulated financial statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Darvish opposed the motions, arguing that Gohari was required to prove that Darvish\u2019s alleged statements were false and that Darvish was entitled to introduce evidence to the contrary. The trial court granted Gohari\u2019s motions, again without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>After a six day trial, the jury found that Darvish made false and defamatory statements and deliberately interfered with Gohari\u2019s contract with Kline. The jury awarded Gohari $500,000.00 in compensatory damages for defamation and Go-hari and Arlington Motors, Inc. $2,120,000.00 in compensatory damages for tortious interference with the contract. The jury declined to award punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed. <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 267, 745 A.2d at 1139-40. The intermediate appellate court determined that Darvish \u201cwas entitled to assert the qualified privilege defense, and to present evidence that the statements attributed to him<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were true\u201d so as to demonstrate that Gohari was not defamed. <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 274, 745 A.2d at 1138. In so finding, the court concluded that Darvish\u2019s statements to the CATD representatives, though not covered by Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-423 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> came within the common law protection of qualified privileges. <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 275, 745 A.2d at 1139. The court determined, as required by the common law of qualified privilege, that Gohari\u2019s fitness to operate a Toyota franchise was of sufficiently important interest to CATD to give rise to a qualified privilege and that the publication was made \u201cwithin the generally accepted standards of decent conduct.\u201d <em>Id . </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 595(1)). In reaching this conclusion, the appellate court considered that Darvish had made the comments \u201cin response to an [authorized] inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>and [were] not volunteered,\u201d and thus the court was \u201cpersuaded that he enjoyed \u2018greater latitude about what he may say about [Gohari] without incurring liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original) (quoting <em>Happy 40, Inc. v. Miller, </em>68 Md.App. 24, 35, 491 A.2d 1210, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 299, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985)). The court also took into account the business relationship between CATD and its existing franchisee, Darvish, and concluded that \u201c[b]ased on 1) [Gohari\u2019s] express consent authorizing CATD to solicit information from [Darvish] and 2) the business relationship between CATD-franchisor, and [Darvish]-franchisee, we hold the circuit court erred in concluding that [Darvish] was not entitled to a qualified privilege.\u201d <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 276, 745 A.2d at 1139-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Court of Special Appeals further held that Darvish\u2019s \u201cdenial that he made defamatory statements does not prevent him from asserting that those statements are substantially correct.\u201d <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 280, 745 A.2d at 1142. The court stated that Maryland Rule 2-303(e)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cexpressly authorizes a party to plead alternative defenses,\u201d and \u201c[i]t follows that [Darvish] should be able to put on evidence in support of each defense that he asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Alpar v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>20 N.C.App. 340, 201 S.E.2d 503, 506, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 N.C. 85, 203 S.E.2d 57 (1974)). The court concluded that Darvish was \u201centitled to a new trial on the qualified privilege issue\u201d and that Darvish was \u201cpermitted the opportunity to prove that the statements attributed to him were true.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 281, 745 A.2d at 1142.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Circuit Court determined that the following statements Darvish allegedly made to CATD\u2019s representatives were at the heart of the litigation:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">THE COURT: \u201cGohari never had operational authority over the dealership even at the time of Darvish\u2019s illness.\u201d Are you claiming that to be defamatory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">[GOHARI\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">THE COURT: Okay. \u201cHe manipulated financial statement figures to inflate his personal compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">[GOHARI\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">THE COURT: \u201cHe was dishonest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes sir</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">THE COURT: All right. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">[GOHARI\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, I think that is because I think that does really go to the heart of being the operator of a dealership. I think it is borderline, ... it is not something that I am going to spend a lot of time on----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Petitioner contends that no qualified privilege protects a business owner\u2019s defamatory statements about a former employee who seeks to enter a directly competitive business arrangement with a third party, in this case a potential common franchisor. Respondent argues that the Court of Special Appeals \u201ccorrectly held that the common law affords a qualified privilege to a franchisee who gives information about a former employee to his franchisor at the franchisor\u2019s request, just as it protects communications in other business and employment-related contexts.\u201d We agree with Respondent and the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Under Maryland law, to present a prima facie case for defamation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">a plaintiff must ordinarily establish that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person; that the statement was false; that the defendant was legally at fault in making the statement; and that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\"><em>Rosenberg v. Helinski, </em>328 Md. 664, 675, 616 A.2d 866, 871 (1992) (citing <em>Hearst Corp. v. Hughes, </em>297 Md. 112, 120-25, 466 A.2d 486 (1983); <em>Jacron Sales Co. v.

Specifically, the common law recognized that a person ought to be shielded against civil liability for defamation where, in good faith, he publishes a statement in furtherance of his own legitimate interests, or those shared in common with the recipient or third parties, or where his declaration would be of interest to the public in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>Marchesi, </em>283 Md. at 135-36, 387 A.2d at 1131 (internal citations omitted); <em>see McDermott v.

Vol.), \u00a7 5-423 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>supra </em>note 10, and (2) the common law. The Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that the franchisor-franchisee relationship in the present case is not covered by \u00a7 5-423. The intermediate appellate court reasoned that \u201c[bjecause CATD is a prospective franchisor and not a prospective employer [as to Gohari], [Darvish\u2019s] statements do not fall within the letter of this statutory protection.

It was undoubtedly in CATD\u2019s business interest to receive an accurate, full, and truthful assessment of the qualifications of a proposed franchisee candidate to operate one of its franchises. A logical person to give such an assessment might be someone like Darvish\u2014Gohari\u2019s former employer and an existing franchisee of Toyota, CATD\u2019s principal. Furthermore, conceptually it would be in Darvish\u2019s professional interest to answer candidly as Darvish must deal with CATD and Toyota on an ongoing basis as a Toyota franchisee. For example, Darvish \u201creports his sales to CATD and requests inventory from CATD, and it is CATD which, as in this case, holds approval power over the potential sale or transfer of a Toyota franchise.\u201d Thus, there is a common interest in maintaining a candid business relationship in furtherance of the franchisee\u2019s individual success and the overall success of the franchisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>We perceive also that a need \u201cto publish ... in the interest of others\u201d arguably is present in this case. The rule regarding the protection of interest of the recipient or a third person has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">(1) An occasion makes a publication conditionally privileged if the circumstances induce a correct or reasonable belief that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">(a) there is information that affects a sufficiently important interest of the recipient or a third person, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(b) the recipient is one to whom the publisher is under a legal duty to publish the defamatory matter or is a person to whom its publication is otherwise within the generally accepted standards of decent conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(2) In determining whether a publication is within generally accepted standards of decent conduct it is an important factor that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(a) the publication is made in response to a request rather than volunteered by the publisher <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">(b) a family or other relationship exists between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 595, at 268 (emphasis added); <em>see also Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 275, 745 A.2d at 1139-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">It seems patent that information regarding Gohari\u2019s qualifications would be important to CATD and Toyota. The information supplied by Darvish also appears to have been supplied within generally accepted standards of decent conduct. The comment regarding subsection (1) of the Restatement states that \u201ca statement made for the protection of a lawful business, professional, property or other pecuniary interest ... comes within the rule stated in this Section.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 595, at 270.

In <em>Fresh v. Cutter, </em>73 Md. 87, 92, 20 A. 774, 775 (1890), a case involving slander and a qualified privilege, we stated \u201c[i]f ... the statement be made in response to an inquiry, it would undoubtedly be privileged.\u201d (Citations omitted). The Court of Special Appeals also has noted that \u201cwhere the defamatory publication is ... in response to an inquiry and not volunteered, the defendant is afforded greater latitude in what he may say about the plaintiff without incur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ring liability.\u201d <em>Happy 40, Inc. v. Miller, </em>63 Md.App. 24, 35, 491 A.2d 1210, 1216 (1985) (citing <em>Stevenson v. Baltimore Baseball Club, Inc., </em>250 Md. 482, 487, 243 A.2d 533 (1968); <em>Fresh, </em>73 Md. at 92, 20 A. 774; <em>Beeler v. Jackson, </em>64 Md. 589, 593, 2 A. 916 (1886)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In the present case, Darvish was approached by CATD to provide his assessment of his former employee\u2019s, Gohari\u2019s, qualifications as the prospective owner-operator of a Toyota dealership. CATD approached Darvish after receiving Go-hari\u2019s express permission to do so. Moreover, Gohari\u2019s Toyota dealership application permitted CATD to obtain information from other sources about his \u201ccharacter, general reputation and credit history\u201d and to \u201cobtain and share information ... from and with any of its affiliated entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The only other jurisdiction to address directly the flagship question presented in this case held that a qualified privilege may be applied to communications in franchisor/franchisee relationships. In <em>Quinn v. Jewel Food Stores Inc., </em>276 Ill.App.3d 861, 213 Ill.Dec. 204, 658 N.E.2d 1225 (1995), the plaintiff was a former employee of Jewel Food Stores (Jewel) and, while working for Jewel, had received work evaluations in which he was described, in part, as being a con artist. <em>Quinn, </em>213 Ill.Dec. 204, 658 N.E.2d at 1228-29. The plaintiff left Jewel and sought a franchise with Southland Corporation (7-Eleven) and White Hen Pantry convenience stores. <em>Quinn, </em>213 Ill.Dec. 204, 658 N.E.2d at 1229. The plaintiff authorized the release of his personnel file from Jewel to the Southland Corporation and White Hen Pantry. <em>Id. </em>He was unaware of the contents of this file or that it contained the above mentioned evaluation. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff was denied a franchise and subsequently sued Jewel for defamation. <em>Id. </em>The Appellate Court of Illinois determined that Jewel had a qualified privilege because the situation involved \u201csome interest of the person to whom the matter is published or of some other third person .\u201d <em>Quinn, </em>213 Ill.Dec. 204, 658 N.E.2d at 1234. In so determining, the Illinois court stated: \u201c[p]laintiff seeks to differentiate the relationships between franchisor-franchisee and employer-employee relationship. However, we believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the difference between the two is in form, rather than substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognize this case as persuasive and reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that <em>Quinn </em>is distinguishable on the basis that \u201cthe plaintiff in <em>Quinn </em>specifically authorized the release of his entire employment file, including an internal evaluation form, by his former employer.\u201d Gohari authorized an equally broad, if not broader, inquiry than in <em>Quinn, </em>in light of the Toyota Dealer Application, which allowed, as stated <em>supra, </em>CATD to inquire, of \u201coutside sources,\u201d into Gohari\u2019s \u201ccharacter, general reputation and credit history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Lastly, Petitioner argues that there can be no qualified privilege because \u201cDarvish, as Gohari\u2019s potential competitor, had a powerful interest in destroying Gohari\u2019s chances of entering into the same sort of contract with CATD and acquiring his own Toyota dealership,\u201d and thus, \u201c[n]o \u2018social policies]\u2019 ... are advanced by applying a qualified privilege under such circumstances; to the contrary, a qualified privilege would only injure competition and protect individuals whose self-interest lies in defaming innocent parties.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 17 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Marchesi, </em>283 Md. at 135, 387 A.2d at 1131). We agree that the potential competitive interest of Darvish should not be disregarded. This same competitive interest, however, may exist within the employer/employee relationship. The mere fact that a franchisor/franchisee relationship underlies the present case does not make Petitioner\u2019s competitive interest argument any more poignant than when an employer/employee relationship is present. Indeed, in his reply brief, Petitioner acknowledges that the same interest may be present in employment relationships, but attempts to distinguish franchise relationships by arguing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">[t]he issue here is whether a privilege should be extended to a quite different context \u2014 heretofore unrecognized by Maryland courts and the Maryland legislature \u2014 in which the speaker, simply by virtue of his position in the marketplace, <em>inevitably </em>has incentives to disparage the subject of the communications in order to minimize competition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s Reply Br. at 6-7 (emphasis in original). As stated, <em>supra, </em>we do not believe that, for present purposes, the contrast between the employment and franchise relationships is as stark as Petitioner paints. Additionally, the same situation as with an existing franchisee aiming to preserve his or her position in the marketplace may arise with a former employer when a former employer enters, or attempts to enter, competition or in the same market. <em>See, e.g., Jacron Sales Co. v. Sindorf, </em>276 Md. 580, 582-83, 598-601, 350 A.2d 688, 690, 698-700 (1976) (discussing defamation and qualified privileges in a case in which the plaintiff left his former employer on uncertain terms to work with another employer \u201cin a similar capacity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Whether Respondent made the statements, assuming them to be false for present analysis, because of his competitive interest becomes part of the evaluation concerning whether the qualified privilege has been abused. The Court of Special Appeals correctly reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">appellee \u201chas the right notwithstanding the privileged character of the communication to go to the jury, if there be evidence tending to show actual malice, as where the words unreasonably impute crime, or the occasion of their utterance is such as to indicate, by its unnecessary publicity or otherwise, a purpose wrongfully to defame the plaintiff____ Or, malice may be established by showing that the publication contained matter not relevant to the occasion.... Expressions in excess of what the occasion warrants do not <em>per se </em>take away the privilege, but such evidence may be excess of malice.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\"><em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 276-77, 745 A.2d at 1140 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Hanrahan, </em>269 Md. at 29, 305 A.2d 151 (quoting <em>Fresh, </em>73 Md. at 93-94, 20 A. 774)) (citing <em>Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 777 n. 11, 661 A.2d 202 (1995)). Furthermore, \u201c[w]hile the question of whether a defamatory communication enjoys a conditional privilege is one of law for the court, whether it has been forfeited by malice is usually a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Sindorf, </em>276 Md. at 600, 350 A.2d at 700 (citing <em>Hanrahan, </em>269 Md. at 29, 305 A.2d at 156; <em>Jump </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>v.

Therefore, any competitive interest bias, if supported by evidence, could be the subject of a jury instruction and jury determination as to whether Respondent abused his qualified privilege. As such, the Court of Special Appeals was correct in stating that \u201c[u]pon remand, the circuit court\u2019s jury instructions must conform to the elements of proof required to overcome [Respondent\u2019s] qualified privilege to utter the statements attributed to him.\u201d <em>Darvish, </em>130 Md.App. at 277, 745 A.2d at 1140. In short, Respondent may lose the qualified privilege recognized here if Petitioner demonstrates that \u201cthe publication is made for a purpose other than to further the social interest entitled to protection ... or can prove malice on the part of the publisher.\u201d <em>McDermott, </em>317 Md. at 29, 561 A.2d at 1047 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Petitioner additionally contends that the evidence of record and the verdict in the present case demonstrate that a qualified privilege defense, even had it been allowed to be asserted, would not have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion, and thus, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s judgment should be reversed and the jury verdict reinstated. According to Petitioner, the Circuit Court\u2019s refusal to permit Respondent to employ a qualified privilege defense was harmless error because the jury necessarily concluded that Respondent\u2019s assumedly defamatory statements were made with actual malice. We disagree with Petitioner and determine that the Circuit Court\u2019s disallowance of Respondent\u2019s defense of qualified privilege was not harmless error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>As stated, <em>supra </em>pp. 22-23, the existence of a qualified privilege is a question of law for the court, and whether that privilege has been abused is for the jury to decide. Moreover, \u201c[i]t has been stated many times by this Court that error by the trial judge will not justify a reversal unless such error is prejudicial.\u201d <em>Sieland, v. Gallo, </em>194 Md. 282, 287, 71 A.2d 45, 46-47 (1950) (citing <em>Ross v. Phillips, </em>148 Md. 165, 169, 129 A. 21 (1925); <em>Dippel v.

We conclude that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision not to permit evidence of, or to instruct on, the defense of qualified privilege was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is in order first to explain how the jury was instructed (and not instructed) and what it necessarily decided (and what it did not decide necessarily). As noted <em>supra, </em>the Circuit Court, as a direct result of its pre-trial rulings on Petitioner\u2019s motions in limine, precluded Respondent from mounting a defense of qualified privilege. Concomitantly, the jury was not instructed regarding the defense of qualified immunity, or what conduct might defeat such a defense, let alone the standard of proof applicable to such an analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Defining the elements that Petitioner, as plaintiff, was required to prove as to the tort of defamation, the trial judge did explain the following to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">[L]et me tell you what defamation is under Maryland law: Under Maryland law, to recover damages for defamation, a Plaintiff must prove each of the following elements. One, he must prove that the Defendant made a defamatory communication or statement about the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Now a statement is defamatory if it exposes a person to public scorn, hatred, contempt, or ridicule, thereby injuring that person\u2019s reputation, or causing that person emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">Two, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant published the statement to a third person, who reasonably recognized the statement as being defamatory. Whether the statement was in fact defamatory depends upon the plain and natural meaning of the statement, how it appears to have been meant by the Defendant, and how it was understood by those to whom it was communicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Three, the Plaintiff must prove that the statement was false. A false statement is one that is not substantially correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>Four, the Plaintiff must prove that the Defendant was at fault.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">And, five, the Plaintiff, must prove that he suffered harm as a result of the defamatory statement. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Regarding the various types of compensatory damages sought by Petitioner under the unitary defamation count, and distinguishing essentially between defamation <em>per se </em>and <em>per quod, </em>the court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">Now, when a person has been defamed, but that person has not suffered actual injury, that person may still recover what we call nominal compensatory damages; that being for, say, a dollar. And that comes into play, and I will come back to that when we get further on in the instructions about what we call punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">If actual or constitutional malice has been proven, damages may be presumed when the words alone are self-evidently injurious and are subject to no double meaning. By that I mean this. You will recall that I had two different groups of alleged defamation statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">One dealt with allegations that Mr. Darvish attacked the honesty of the Plaintiff and said that he manipulated finan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>cial statements. That is one group. The other group being just simply saying what his job wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">Well, just simply saying what one\u2019s job is doesn\u2019t automatically to someone who doesn\u2019t know what the context of it is equate to defamation. If I were to say that someone\u2019s job doesn\u2019t include A, B, C, and D, that by itself is not defamatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">And it would only be defamatory if you considered it in the context of what was said and the circumstances. But calling someone dishonest or that they manipulate financial statements may on the other hand be clear statements that standing alone are injurious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Calling someone dishonest doesn\u2019t lead to any context to determine whether it is defamatory, and that is what we call defamation, <em>per se. </em>And in that instance, malice may be proven and damages \u2014 excuse me, but if malice has been proven, then damages from the statements of dishonesty, et cetera, may be presumed from the words alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Now, malice exists when a person who is making the statement deliberately lies, invents, or makes the statements with actual knowledge that they are false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Now, to go back to what I said a moment ago. If a word, such as theft, dishonesty, and manipulation, are found by you to have been said, then because those words are self-evidently are defamatory, then you may assume that \u2014 let me back up. If you find that the statements were made with malice, that they were actually deliberate lies, inventions, or made with a statement that were false, those statements of dishonesty, et cetera, then you may assume that there is damages as a result of that in that instance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Shortly following the completion of the instructions regarding compensatory damages, the judge explained the burden of proof standard the jury was to apply in its consideration of whether defamation had been proven and what amount of compensatory damages it might award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have told you what the claims are that have been made by the Plaintiff, and what the Plaintiff must prove. Now, let me spend a minute with you telling you about the standard of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">And this -will apply to everything except when I get to the punitive damage burden of proof. With regard to every other aspect of the truth of the cause of action, and proof that the Defendant did the things the Plaintiff said, and had the motive the Plaintiff said, and for damages, compensatory damages, the Plaintiff has the burden of proving each of these by what we call the preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">To prove by a preponderance of the evidence means to prove that something is more likely so than not so. In other words, a preponderance of the evidence means such evidence, which when considered and compares with the evidence opposed to it, has more convincing force, and produces in your mind a belief that it is more likely true than not true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Regarding the punitive damages sought by Respondent, the judge subsequently informed the jury as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Now, ladies and gentlemen, the Plaintiff in this ease is seeking not only what we call compensatory damages, damages that would result directly to the Plaintiff as a result of the alleged acts of the Defendant, but the Plaintiff goes further and asks that the court or the jury also award what we call exemplary or punitive damages in each of the two counts; the one for defamation, and the one for tortious interference with the Kline contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">Now, turning first to the defamation case, a person who has been defamed may be allowed the punitive damages where the Defendant published the defamatory statement with actual knowledge that it was false.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Punitive damages serve as punishment and as a warning to others, and compensatory damages must have been awarded for punitive damages to be awarded. The amount of punitive damages must relate to the nature and extent of the conduct and harm caused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">In the defamation case, you might recall that on the cases or in the instances where the Plaintiff claims that he called him dishonest, and manipulated, I said in that case that if you find no real damage, you may still grant what we call nominal damages, one dollar, for example, in damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">In order to recover punitive damages in either of these two counts, it is the Plaintiffs burden to prove by what we call clear and convincing evidence that the Defendant acted with actual malice. The Plaintiff must show actual malice with convincing clarity. For you to find actual malice, the evidence must be strong and positive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">Clear and convincing proof involves a degree of belief greater than the usual burden of proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence, but less than the burden of beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>You will recall that I used the two, and that it is in between. Clear and convincing evidence is more than a mere preponderance, but not so far as being beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">No appellate argument as to the legal correctness per se of these instructions has been briefed or argued to us by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The case was submitted to the jury on a written verdict sheet. The verdict sheet returned by the jury in this case, as concerns the defamation count, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">Count I \u2014 Defamation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">Check one (X)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">Do you find for the Plaintiff, Shahriar Gohari?

Even considering what the jury was instructed, the verdict sheet does not make it more likely that the jury concluded that Darvish\u2019s liability for compensatory damages was predicated on actual malice than on simple negligence. The court\u2019s instructions parsed Darvish\u2019s alleged defamatory statements into two categories: (1) possibly false statements regarding Gohari\u2019s job responsibilities (the <em>per quod </em>statements), and (2) statements regarding dishonesty by Gohari and manipulation of financial statements (the <em>per se </em>statements). It is only with regard to the latter category, however, that the court further explained the possible application in the award of compensatory damages (nominal or greater) of actual malice (described by the judge as when one \u201cdeliberately lies, invents, or makes the statements with actual knowledge that they are false\u201d). In the event the jury was satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that such \u201cactual malice\u201d existed, the instructions permitted it to assume some amount of compensatory damages. The verdict sheet, however, neither explicitly called for a special verdict as to actual malice with regard to compensatory damages for the defamation count, nor did it parse the two categories of defamatory statements presented in the judge\u2019s instructions. It is possible that, under the instructions as given, the jury could have found Darvish liable based entirely on his negligence with regard to the <em>per quod </em>statements, for which the jury was not instructed actual malice need be considered in awarding compensatory damages. Thus, it becomes equally speculative for Petitioner to assert now that the jury\u2019s award of $500,000 in compensatory damages for Count I (defamation) was predicated on a finding of actual malice as to the <em>per se </em>statements, a scenario by which his appellate argument might have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Petitioner argues that the present case is similar to <em>Dingle v. Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 749 A.2d 157 (2000). In <em>Dingle, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>circuit court concluded that a claim for a breach of contract<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> made by the respondent was, \u201cin effect, subsumed in her alternative claims of negligence<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and, for that reason, entered judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract action at the conclusion of the evidence.\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>358 Md. at 357, 749 A.2d at 158. The Court of Special Appeals reversed this part of the trial court\u2019s judgment on the grounds that the breach of contract claim should have been submitted to the jury. <em>Belin v. Dingle, </em>127 Md.App. 68, 79, 732 A.2d 301, 306 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>358 Md. 354, 749 A.2d 157 (2000). We reversed the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in this respect stating that the breach of contract claim was, \u201cin fact, submitted to the jury, which necessarily found against [plaintiff]\u201d and that \u201cthe essential underpinning of the claim was, in fact, submitted to the jury, which determined the issue in [defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>358 Md. at 357, 378, 749 A.2d at 158, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Petitioner argues that <em>Dingle </em>is similar to the present case because Petitioner, to prove defamation, had to demonstrate \u201cthat the alleged defamatory statements, if made, were false\u201d and that Petitioner \u201cat least 'act[ed] negligently in failing to ascertain\u2019 whether the defamatory statements were true.\u2019\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 20 (quoting <em>Jacron Sales Co., </em>276 Md. at 597, 350 A.2d at 698 (alterations in original)). Petitioner asserts that the jury verdict demonstrates that Petitioner met this burden and that the jury \u201c \u2018necessarily found that\u2019 [Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>spondent] made the defamatory statements with actual malice\u201d \u2014 the standard required to be met to find that Respondent had abused any qualified privilege that arguably may have been available. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 21 (quoting <em>K &amp; K Management, Inc. v. Lee, </em>316 Md. 137, 150, 557 A.2d 965, 971 (1989)).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Petitioner\u2019s use of <em>Dingle, </em>and reliance on <em>K &amp; K Management, Inc. v. Lee, </em>however, is inapposite. The essential underpinnings of the holdings in those cases are not present here; rather, permitting a qualified privilege to be asserted and considered undercuts the attempted analogy. We explained in <em>Marchesi </em>that \u201c[t]he common law conditional privileges rest upon the notion that a defendant may escape liability for an otherwise actionable defamatory statement, if publication of the utterance advances social policies of greater importance than the vindication of a plaintiffs reputational interest.\u201d <em>Marchesi, </em>283 Md. at 135, 387 A.2d at 1131 (citations omitted). As stated, <em>supra, </em>to establish a prima facie case for defamation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">a plaintiff must ordinarily establish that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person; that the statement was false; that the defendant was legally at fault in making the statement; and that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Once the plaintiff demonstrates that a statement was defamatory, then the defendant has the burden of proving that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>defamatory statement was privileged, the existence of which privilege, as noted <em>supra, </em>is a question of law for the court. If the privilege is recognized the plaintiff nonetheless may attempt to show that the privilege was abused, a question for the jury, thus rendering the defendant liable for defamation. Demonstrating abuse of the privilege requires overcoming a higher standard than simply demonstrating that the statement was defamatory. As the Court of Special Appeals stated, assuming the existence of a qualified privilege, Respondent defamed Petitioner if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">(1) the publication [was] made with malice, that is, with \u2018knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth ...,\u2019 <em>Marchesi v.

Because the record of the present case does not permit us to conclude that the jury necessarily found actual malice in any sense, the errors identified in Part II of this opinion are not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"><em>Exxon Corp. v. Schoene, </em>67 Md.App. 412, 508 A.2d 142 (1986), is informative here. In <em>Schoene, </em>as in the present case, the appellant argued that, in regard to a defamation claim, \u201cthe trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the scope of the conditional privilege and whether it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>forfeited by abuse.\u201d <em>Schoene, </em>67 Md.App. at 419, 508 A.2d at 146. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the appellant was \u201centitled to have the jury instructed on the existence of ... [the] conditional privilege\u201d because the statements were made within the employer-employee context even though at the time the statements were made, the appellee was no longer an employee. <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury regarding qualified privilege, the intermediate appellate court noted that the privilege was subject to forfeiture because \u201cthere was evidence from which the jury could have found such abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In spite of this latter conclusion, the court noted that abuse of a qualified privilege is a question for the jury to resolve, and therefore, the court held that the trial court \u201cerred in refusing to instruct the jury as to the conditional privilege applicable to [appellee\u2019s] statements and as to the manner in which that privilege could be abused.\u201d <em>Schoene, </em>67 Md.App. at 422, 508 A.2d at 147. The same is true in the present case; if there exists evidence that the qualified privilege was abused, it becomes a question for the jury to decide. It follows that we cannot determine that the jury necessarily would have concluded that the qualified privilege was abused on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided a similar case that is also instructive. In <em>Manbeck v. Ostrowski, </em>384 F.2d 970 (D.C.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 966, 88 S.Ct. 1077, 19 L.Ed.2d 1170 (1968), an attorney, appellee, sued the president of a local labor union, appellant, \u201cin slander.\u201d 384 F.2d at 971. At trial, during a bench conference, appellant\u2019s attorney admitted that he had \u201cinadvertently\u201d failed to raise the qualified privilege issue at the pre-trial conference and that the exclusion of the privilege would be prejudicial to appellant. <em>Manbeck, </em>384 F.2d at 972. The trial judge stated, however, that it would be unfair to interject that issue at that point in the litigation and \u201cruled that the defensive possibilities of the privilege could not be exploited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The jury, without hearing the qualified privilege defense, returned a verdict for the appellee and awarded compensatory and puni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tive damages. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the court determined that the defense of privilege should have been permitted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The <em>Manbeck </em>court concluded that the exclusion of the privilege was error and rejected appellee\u2019s argument that the jury, \u201cin awarding punitive damages, necessarily found that appellant\u2019s conduct possessed a degree of malice that would have operated to defeat the privilege.\u201d <em>Manbeck, </em>384 F.2d at 976-77. The court stated that this argument</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abg\">overlooks important contrasts that admission of the defense could have made possible. With privilege ruled out, the range for evidentiary presentations was narrowed, and argument and instructions to the jury on the subject were scotched. Had the trial embraced privilege, not only could its scope have expanded in these respects, but new considerations would have emerged that might have persuaded a verdict different in both its compensatory and its punitive features. We think it clear, in the first place, that the factual picture before the jury could to some extent have been transformed. More evidence might have been forthcoming, and that which was received might have taken on a new look.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>Manbeck, </em>384 F.2d at 977. The same is true in the present case where punitive damages were not awarded. The <em>Man-beck </em>court noted that when qualified privilege is involved, the nature of how one is determined to be liable for defamation changes; \u201cwords otherwise slanderous presumptively fall within the ambit of the privilege, and the burden rests upon the person maligned to show that they do not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\">.

Gohari testified, however, that he observed salespeople working on the dealership floor to ascertain whether they followed the proper procedures in their dealings with customers, that he was on the sales floor thirty to forty times a day, that he sold cars himself, and that he had been a licensed car salesperson in Maryland since 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">.
