Gigeous, Petitioner, challenges a judgment of the Circuit Court for Somerset County. The Circuit Court affirmed the administrative termination by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), Division of Correction (DOC), Respondent, of Petitioner\u2019s employment at its Eastern Correctional Institution. Underlying Petitioner\u2019s termination was his arrest on 28 February 1992, while off duty, and his being charged in Anne Arundel County with the criminal offense of possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Respondent suspended Petitioner without pay, pending charges for removal, and ultimately dismissed Petitioner from his job on 15 July 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Petitioner\u2019s dismissal was reviewed by three different Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) (the latter two as the result of judicial remands) and thrice reviewed by the Circuit Court for Somerset County. Petitioner contended then, as now, that his termination was based improperly on the records of his arrest and prosecution that had been expunged according to Maryland Code (1996, Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 737.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately, on 10 August 1999, the Circuit Court affirmed Petitioner\u2019s termination as appropriate because it was founded on police officers\u2019 testimony, based on their personal recollections and not on the expunged records. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Institution, </em>132 Md.App. 487, 752 A.2d 1238 (2000). We granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to consider the following questions:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals properly determine that a police officer who maintained and reviewed an investigative file prior to testifying in an administrative trial about the facts underlying an expunged criminal matter testified from his memory and not from the file?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly affirm the removal of Sergeant Gigeous by depriving him of meaningful challenge to the prior decision of an Administrative Law Judge who took a job with Gigeous\u2019s employer, Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Petitioner was employed as a Correctional Officer III (Sergeant) by Respondent at its Eastern Shore Correctional Institution. On 28 February 1992, Petitioner was arrested by Anne Arundel County Police, off of DPSCS property and during his non-duty hours, and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance-marijuana. On 2 March 1992, Petitioner notified his supervisors of the arrest. Petitioner was placed on administrative suspension, without pay, from his job.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent filed charges for termination, on 9 March 1992, against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>On 8 October ,1992, the criminal charge pending against Petitioner was nol prossed by the Anne Arundel County State\u2019s Attorney Office in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Anne Arundel County. Petitioner filed, on 13 October 1992, with the District Court a petition for expungement of records, pursuant to Maryland Code (1996, Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 737, <em>supra </em>note 1. On 22 December 1992, the District Court ordered that all records of Petitioner\u2019s arrest, including police records, be expunged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Petitioner appealed the charges of removal and, on 9 February 1993, a hearing was held before the OAH. Petitioner moved to have the charges for removal dismissed on that grounds that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office had entered a nolle prosequi in the criminal case. Based on the subsequent expungement of the records regarding the criminal charge, Petitioner also moved to exclude any evidence from police, court, or agency documentation, and testimony relating to his arrest or prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On 26 March 1993, ALJ Charles Fowler denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning that, while a \u201cjudge of any criminal court may order an expungement,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and those responsive to his orders are required to obey[,] ... any underlying act for which there may be any proof [is] susceptible to being proven in support of a case in a court of another jurisdiction.\u201d On 27 April 1993, at the hearing on the merits before ALJ Fowler, Petitioner lodged a continuing objection to the introduction of the expunged documentary evidence as well as the testimony of the two Anne Arundel County police officers who participated in his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Testimony from both arresting officers and the disputed documents concerning the arrest were admitted into evidence before ALJ Fowler. In particular, Officer James Teare, Sr., testified that, on 28 February 1992, he and fellow officer, Steve Jenkins, were assigned to uniformed patrol in Glen Burnie. At that time, a catering facility in the area was holding a concert. Officer Teare testified that as \u201cthe band was either just starting or\u201d just completing a break, he noticed Petitioner and a companion leave the hall and get into a car in the parking lot. The officer stated that he observed Petitioner and his friend apparently drinking in the car, \u201cin violation of the Anne Arundel County code,\u201d and, as a result, the two officers approached the car and asked Petitioner to get out. According to Officer Teare\u2019s testimony, when Petitioner got out of the car, Officer Teare smelled a strong odor of burnt marijuana on Petitioner and in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Officer Teare continued that Petitioner informed him that he was a correctional officer and \u201cexplained that if he was arrested, this would ruin his career.\u201d Petitioner then told him that he had smoked all of the marijuana that he had in his possession; however, Petitioner\u2019s jacket was found to contain \u201ca plastic baggy containing a greenish brown vegetable matter,\u201d that Officer Teare suspected was marijuana, and some rolling papers. Petitioner was arrested. Officer Teare conducted a field test on the matter in the plastic bag, which tested positive for marijuana. During his testimony before ALJ Fowler, Officer Teare did not rely outwardly on any documents. During cross-examination, Petitioner\u2019s attorney sought to show that Officer Teare\u2019s testimony was not credible; in the course of cross-examination, the arrest report and other documents were entered into evidence by Petitioner\u2019s attorney. Officer Jenkins also testified at the hearing that he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana while dealing with Petitioner\u2019s companion, but that he \u201chad no dealings with [Petitioner] at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">On 13 May 1993, ALJ Fowler issued a proposed decision affirming Petitioner\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner filed exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the proposed decision with the State Secretary of Personnel arguing, in part, that ALJ Fowler should have dismissed the case because the expunged records and testimony of the police officers should not have been received in view of the order of expungement. Following oral argument on the exceptions, the Secretary of Personnel, by a designee, filed an 15 July 1993 Order adopting as final findings and conclusions all of the recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law of ALJ Fowler.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Petitioner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. On 30 November 1994, the Circuit Court determined \u201cthat the testimony of the officers, to the extent that the testimony was from personal knowledge, was correctly admitted; however the [ALJ] erred when he admitted the expunged records.\u201d The Circuit Court further concluded that the failure to exclude the expunged records was not harmless. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Accordingly, the Order of the Secretary adopting the ALJ\u2019s recommendation was deemed legally erroneous. The Circuit Court remanded the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On 7 March 1995, a de novo hearing was held before a different ALJ, Dale McCloud. At this hearing, Officer Teare provided the same direct testimony as at the 27 April 1993 hearing, discussed <em>supra </em>pp. 488-89. On cross-examination, Officer Teare maintained that he was testifying strictly from his recollection, but that he had reviewed his \u201creports\u201d prior to testifying. Neither party offered documentary submissions into evidence. On 21 June 1995, ALJ McCloud filed a proposed decision stating that, in following the Circuit Court\u2019s directions, <em>supra, </em>he determined that as long as the live testimony of the two officers was not based on expunged records, the testimony was admissible and subject \u201cto an appropriate assignment of credibility.\u201d He further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFX\">[w]hile Officer Teare acknowledged during crossexamination that his memory was refreshed after reviewing his \u201creports,\u201d the matter was not further pursued, and the nature of the \u201creports\u201d was not identified. Since [Petitioner] raises the claim, he must bear the burden to show that the Officer relied upon expunged reports. He failed to do so. The testimony of both officers will, therefore, be accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">ALJ McCloud then recommended that Petitioner be terminated, and on 5 September 1995, the Secretary of Personnel\u2019s designee filed an Order of the Secretary adopting ALJ McCloud\u2019s proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Petitioner again sought judicial review in the Circuit Court, asserting that ALJ McCloud erred when he permitted testimonial evidence regarding the arrest and criminal charge for which the District Court had issued an order of expungement. On 5 December 1996, the Circuit Court penultimately remanded the case \u201cfor the purposes of determining whether the testimony of the police officers was based upon records which were subject to expungement\u201d and to decipher \u201cthe extent to which the testimony introduced at the hearing was first-hand knowledge, how much information officers obtained from rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ords, and whether the records used were subject to expungement.\u201d The Circuit Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">Should the agency determine that officers testified from memory or used records not subject to expungement, then the decision of the Secretary should be affirmed. If the agency determines that the testimony was based on records which should have been expunged, then the decision of the Secretary of Personnel should be reversed without further order of this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Upon this second remand, the case was set for another hearing before ALJ McCloud on 24 June 1997. On 12 June 1997, Petitioner requested that ALJ McCloud recuse himself, apparently on the ground that Petitioner had initiated a civil or criminal action against ALJ McCloud.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ALJ McCloud denied this request. One day before the scheduled hearing, Respondent was notified, for the first time, that Officers Teare and Jenkins would not appear at the hearing without subpoenas, although neither previously had required a subpoena to appear at the earlier administrative hearings. As such, the two officers did not appear at the 24 April 1997 hearing, at which Respondent presented a Motion for Continuance. Petitioner opposed a continuance and moved to dismiss Respondent\u2019s termination action. On 20 October 1997, after the parties briefed their respective positions, ALJ McCloud denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceedings, reasoning that it would be impossible to resolve the points raised in the Circuit Court\u2019s remand order in either party\u2019s favor without the officers\u2019 participation. The ALJ opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">Given the nature of the Court\u2019s instructions, [Petitioner] would appear to have as much an interest in the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>and testimony of the officers as the Agency. In the absence of their appearance and in the absence of relevant instructions from the Court, I would have no alternative but to defer to that record developed before me pursuant to the March 7,1995 hearing. My opinion regarding that record is obviously well known and unchanged at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">He directed prospectively that the limited remand hearing be held on a date when the officers would be present by subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">That hearing was held on 10 June 1998 before yet another ALJ, Leah J. Seaton.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties agreed that the purpose of the hearing was not a de novo re-adjudication, but was solely to determine the extent to which the officers\u2019 March 1995 testimony may have depended on expunged records for its vitality. Additionally, both parties agreed that only Officer Teare\u2019s testimony was necessary, as Officer Jenkins had not offered any additional relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Officer Teare testified that he recalled his previous testimony regarding the circumstances of Petitioner\u2019s arrest and that he had a general recollection of Petitioner\u2019s arrest both at the time of his prior testimony \u201cand I do today.\u201d He then stated that, in preparation of his testimony in 1995, he had reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>his investigative file, which he explained was the police officer\u2019s separate file, not the official and formal file kept by the Anne Arundel County Police Department at its Central Files location. Officer Teare further explained that the investigative file that he reviewed prior to the March 1995 hearing would have contained a copy of the incident report, a copy of the drug analysis, and copies of \u201cthe paperwork for the advice of rights for [Petitioner].\u201d Office Teare stated that he did not remember exactly which documents he reviewed in the investigative file and that he did not have the file with him; however, to the extent that he reviewed the file at all, it was only for the purpose of refreshing his recollection as to the date of the arrest, location of the arrest, and the color, year and type or model of the vehicle. When asked whether he gleaned any other information from the documents in his investigative file, Officer Teare testified that he looked \u201cspecifically for that type of information. It\u2019s something that I could not pull from recollection. The rest of my testimony was from my personal recollection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On 9 September 1998, ALJ Seaton issued a decision affirming the 21 June 1995 decision of ALJ McCloud.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on Officer Teare\u2019s most recent testimony that his 7 March 1995 testimony was based on his personal recollection of the events, except to the extent that he examined his investigative file to refresh his recollection as to the date and location of the arrest and the make and model of the vehicle that Petitioner occupied, ALJ Seaton concluded that the officers had not testified from expunged records.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">ALJ Seaton grounded her decision primarily on an assessment of Officer Teare\u2019s credibility; ALJ Seaton \u201cbelieved\u201d that Officer Teare had testified from his recollection and found the Officer\u2019s testimony to be \u201ccompletely credible.\u201d ALJ Seaton elaborated that she perceived that \u201cit [was] entirely credible that ... Officer Teare checked his file to refresh his recollection only as to the date [and location] of the arrest and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the make and mode of the vehicle\u201d and that Officer Teare only \u201cused his \u2018file\u2019 to refresh his recollection about facts that can only be described as collateral to the issue at hand.\u201d ALJ Seaton concluded: \u201cIn short, all relevant and material testimony from the officers regarding the arrest of [Petitioner] on February 28, 1998 was based on their own independent recollections. Thus, it was properly admitted and considered by ALJ McCloud.\u201d Petitioner returned to the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Circuit Court upheld Petitioner\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s termination. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 510, 752 A.2d at 1250. The intermediate appellate court determined that there was no error \u201cin the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the testimony of the officers, concerning the basic facts of [Petitioner\u2019s] arrest from the hearing conducted on March 7, 1995, originated from their independent recollection of the incident, and not any information in any expunged records of investigative files.\u201d <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 505, 752 A.2d at 1247. The court elaborated that it is clear from \u201cALJ Seaton\u2019s decision of September 9, 1998, that any testimony that did include information contained in the officers\u2019 investigative file was not dispositive in this case and, therefore, did not form the basis of the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that while it was error for any expunged records or records from an investigative file to have been introduced in the original hearing, \u201cthe error was harmless, because the agency\u2019s ultimate decision was not based on any of that evidence\u201d and, thus, the agency did not err in upholding Petitioner\u2019s dismissal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The Court of Special Appeals also rejected Petitioner\u2019s claim that he should have been permitted to view ALJ McCloud\u2019s personnel file. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 509, 752 A.2d at 1250. The intermediate appellate court reasoned that, as ALJ Seaton pointed out, <em>supra </em>note 9, \u201cin the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>McCloud had recused himself, [Petitioner\u2019s] case would have merely been assigned to a new ALJ,\u201d which occurred \u201cwhen McCloud left and ALJ Seaton was assigned the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once ALJ Seaton conducted a complete and independent review of all of the issues of the case, as she indicated that she did, the question of when ALJ McCloud began considering employment with Respondent became moot. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 509-10, 752 A.2d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We determine that ALJ Seaton did not abuse her discretion when she concluded that the officers testified from their independent recollection and that such conclusion was supported by substantial evidence on the record. We further conclude that any testimony resulting from examination of the officers\u2019 investigative files was collateral. Lastly, we resolve that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in determining that the issue regarding Petitioner\u2019s viewing of ALJ McCloud\u2019s personnel file was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We review an administrative agency\u2019s decision under the same statutory standards as the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of the lower court. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691, 694-95 (1974). Moreover, in <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 650 A.2d 226 (1994), we stated generally that \u201c[jjudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow. The court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d 336 Md. at 576-77, 650 A.2d at 230 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1978)); <em>see also Liberty Nursing Center, Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 442, 624 A.2d 941, 945 (1993) (\u201cJudicial review of agency fact finding is narrow in scope and requires the exercise of a restrained and disciplined judicial judgment.\u201d (citing <em>Supervisor v. Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 626, 547 A.2d 190, 195 (1988))).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We expounded upon this doctrine in <em>Board of Physician v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 729 A.2d 376 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a \u201ccourt\u2019s task in review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d ... Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.... Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-7\"><em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We, however, \u201cmay always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law. Therefore, ordinarily the court reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency shall determine (1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>Sch., v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985). Regarding the substantial evidence test, we explained in <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">That is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency, but it must not itself make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\"><em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662, 490 A.2d at 708. Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Snowden v. Mayor and County Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390 (1961)). In <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., supra, </em>we further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">The scope of review is limited to whether a reasoning mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. In applying the substantial evidence test, the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the <em>expertise </em>of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken. The reviewing court also must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity. Furthermore, not only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\"><em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662-63, 490 A.2d at 708 (citing <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512-13, 390 A.2d 1119); <em>see Motor Vehicle Administration v.

Expunged Records</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Petitioner\u2019s flagship argument is that Respondent \u201cnever should have been allowed to offer the testimony of the police officers who reviewed the expunged material\u201d because the language of the expungement statute, Md.Code (1996, Repl. Vol., 1999 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 737, <em>supra </em>note 1, \u201cclearly prohibits disclosure and review of the expunged material ... and the general policy concerns underlying the statute is to prevent situations such as this from arising.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 20-21. Petitioner further contends that \u201c[n]o citizen who receives the extraordinary benefit of expungement should be subjected to the use of the expunged information to deprive him of gainful employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We granted certiorari in this case principally to consider important matters regarding the intent and scope of the \u201cinvestigatory files\u201d exception to the definition of \u201cpolice records\u201d provided for in the expungement statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the ramifications flowing from the expungement of the criminal case records in this case upon the related administrative action of Petitioner\u2019s dismissal from State employment. As presented in the petition for writ of certiorari, it appeared that the present case was an appropriate vehicle for this Court to explore this relatively uncharted territory. As occasionally happens, however,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we discovered, after briefing and oral argument, that the vehicle lacked a full tank of gas. Upon closer examination, the record of the present case provided a compelling and fundamental reason not to embark on our intended journey. Thus, we shall not address here these important questions concerning the expungement statute. Concomitantly, we shall neither bless nor curse the positions taken in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>interpretation or application of the statute. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 496-502, 752 A.2d at 1243-46 (discussing <em>Mora v. State, </em>123 Md.App. 699, 720 A.2d 934 (1998), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>355 Md. 639, 735 A.2d 1122 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Although the admissibility of the officers\u2019 testimony is a question of law, as the Court of Special Appeals noted, \u201cthe determination by the agency that the officers\u2019 testimony was not based on inadmissible evidence, i.e., expunged records, is a matter of the agency\u2019s fact-finding process, which is subject, on appellate review, to the [deferential] standard\u201d of substantial evidence. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 495-96, 752 A.2d at 1242-43. ALJ Seaton believed Officer Teare\u2019s testimony that he did not rely on, or refresh his recollection, as to any material fact from any police record that arguably fell within the scope of those records covered by the expungement statute or the District Court order in this case. ALJ Seaton\u2019s \u201cjudgment call\u201d in this regard was quintessentially one involving the assessment of witness credibility. As the Court of Special Appeals concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">[T]he circuit court correctly directed the ALJ to determine, on the remand of [Petitioner\u2019s] case, if the testimony offered by the police officers was based on information maintained in the investigative file or came from the police officers\u2019 independent recollection of the incident. The agency\u2019s decision concerning the officers\u2019 testimony is a question of fact and we must apply the clearly erroneous and substantial evidence tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\"><em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 502, 752 A.2d at 1246. It is this latter part \u2014 the question of fact regarding the agency\u2019s decision concerning the well-spring of the officers\u2019 testimony\u2014 upon which our decision turns. To the extent the officers testified from something other than personal memory, it was as to inconsequential and collateral matters. Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the province of the expungement statute and the effect of the expungement order in Petitioner\u2019s criminal case, on this dismissal action, is not material to our decision on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>B. Basis of Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Petitioner asserts that Officer Teare\u2019s testimony was based on the expunged records and not on his memory of the events. According to Petitioner, Officer Teare \u201chad a long and close association with the expunged documents in this case\u201d; the officer, on numerous occasions, came into contact with the expunged documents<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> creating what Petitioner refers to as a \u201cpyramiding effect,\u201d which \u201cshaped\u201d Officer Teare\u2019s testimony. This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">When the Circuit Court remanded the case for the second time on 5 December 1996, as noted <em>supra </em>pp. 490-91, the court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">[T]he Court remands this matter to the administrative agency for the purposes of determining whether the testimony of the police officers was based upon records which were subject to expungement as defined by. the statute. The agency should determine the extent to which the testimony introduced at the hearing was first-hand knowledge, how much information officers obtained from records, and whether the records used were subject to expungement. Should the agency determine that officers testified from memory or used records not subject to expungement, then the decision of the Secretary should be affirmed. If the agency determines that the testimony was based on records which should have been expunged then the decision of the Secretary of Personnel should be reversed without further order of this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">At the 10 June 1998 administrative hearing, ALJ Seaton clearly delineated the purpose of the hearing. She noted her understanding that the Circuit Court remanded the case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the sole purpose of determining whether the officers testified from records that were subject to expungement. In this regard, she explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">Today\u2019s hearing is not a new de novo hearing, it is to determine whether the testimony introduced at the hearing before [ALJ] McCloud was first-hand knowledge, how the officers obtained from the records, and whether the records used were subject to expungement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">If I determine that the officers testified from memory or used records not subject to expungement, then I should affirm the decision of the Secretary. If I determine otherwise, then I should reverse the decision of said case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">So the purpose of this hearing is for [the officers] to testify about what evidence \u2014 what records, if any, they used to refresh their recollection. Whether they were expunged records, or whether those were records that should not have been expunged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Both parties agreed that only Officer Teare\u2019s testimony was necessary on this score. In her written decision, ALJ Seaton concluded from that testimony that the officers\u2019 testimony during the administrative hearing conducted before ALJ McCloud on 7 March 1995 was based on the officers\u2019 independent recollections and not in any meaningful way on the expunged records. She found as fact that \u201c[a]t the hearing held before ALJ Dale McCloud on March 7, 1995, the testimony of the police officers regarding the [Petitioner\u2019s] possession of a controlled, dangerous substance <em>was from memory, and was not based on the review of expunged records.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). ALJ Seaton also determined as a matter of fact that \u201c[w]hen testifying on March 7, 1995, Officer Teare relied on information contained in his own \u2018file\u2019 regarding the arrest to refresh his recollection of the date of the arrest and the make and model of the vehicle, <em>neither of which was central to the decision </em>made by ALJ McCloud.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">ALJ Seaton explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>[Officer Teare] stated that his testimony on March 7, 1995 was based on his own recollection of events, except that he had looked at his \u2018file\u2019 to refresh his recollection as to the date of the arrest and the make and model of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">Based on that testimony, I conclude that the officers did not testify from expunged records. <em>First and foremost, I believe Officer Teare when he states that he testified from his recollection at the March 7, 1995 hearing. </em>Contrary to the arguments advanced by counsel for [Petitioner], I found Officer Teare\u2019s testimony completely credible. He was forthright and direct in his demeanor. On February 28, 1992, when Officer Teare arrested the Employee, he was not on regular assignment, but was specially assigned. Thus, it was an unusual assignment, made all the more unusual when the Employee informed the arresting officers that he was a correctional officer and asked to be given a \u2018break.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8a\">Further, I find it entirely credible that ... Officer Teare checked his file to refresh his recollection only as to the date of the arrest and the make and model of the vehicle.' This type of detail is typically elicited from police officers in the type of proceeding, criminal trial, where police officers generally testify. It is not surprising, therefore, that a police officer would want to re-familiarize himself with the minutia of an arrest, since he would expect to be questioned about it in a criminal trial. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Because the issue of whether the officers relied on their memories in testifying was a question of fact, and ALJ Seaton found as fact that the officers relied on their memories and that any facts for which they turned to their personal investigative file to refresh their recollections were collateral, we employ the substantial evidence test, <em>supra </em>pp. 496-98, to determine the correctness of the ALJ\u2019s determinations. The question becomes could \u201c[r]easoning minds ... reasonably reach the conclusion reached by the agency from the facts in the record,\u201d and, therefore, are the findings based \u201cupon substantial evidence, ... [for which] the court has no power to reject\u201d these findings? <em>Liberty Nursing, </em>330 Md. at 443, 624 A.2d at 946 (citing <em>Snowden </em>224 Md. at 448, 168 A.2d at 392); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>see Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 838-39, 490 A.2d 1296, 1303 (1985). Because \u201ca reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the\u201d agency, and because \u201cthe court must review the ... [administrative decision] in the light most favorable to the ... [agency] (the ... [agency\u2019s] decision is prima facie correct and carries the presumption of validity),\u201d the decision, it is reasoned, \u201cmust be left undisturbed.\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 663-64, 490 A.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">That the ALJ made her findings based on the <em>credibility </em>of Officer Teare\u2019s testimony is a classic situation for application of these precepts. We stated in <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 666 A.2d 511 (1995), that \u201c[o]ften the resolution of conflicting evidence and inconsistent inferences involves making credibility determinations. In this area, as well, it is no less true that the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d 340 Md. at 284, 666 A.2d at 517 (citing <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662, 490 A.2d at 701; <em>Board of Education v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 363, 470 A.2d 332, 336 (1984); <em>Resetar v. State Board of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 554, 399 A.2d 225, 234 (1979)); <em>see also Anderson v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 216-17, 623 A.2d 198, 212-13 (1993) (stating that an agency, when examining the decision of an administrative law judge and particularly where the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is pivotal, should \u201cgive appropriate deference to the opportunity of the examiner to observe the demeanor of the witnesses,\u201d and the agency should reject credibility assessments only if it gives \u201cstrong reasons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Petitioner, nonetheless, avows that Officer Teare\u2019s testimony was not credible and that his memory is not as stable or reliable as Respondent would have the Court believe. Petitioner contends that doubt is cast on the officer\u2019s credibility because the officer testified generally on 10 June 1998 that he had a vague recollection of a lot of the arrests that he had made during his law enforcement career. Petitioner claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that, confirming this taint of general unreliability, on 7 March 1995 the officer testified that he could not recall the specifics of a conversation about the jacket in which the marijuana was found, and that he \u201cbelieved\u201d that the jacket belonged to Petitioner because Petitioner did not disavow his ownership of it at the time. Comparing this with the officer\u2019s claim on 27 April 1993 that Petitioner \u201cexplained that it was his coat,\u201d Petitioner asserts that a reasonable mind necessarily would conclude that Officer Teare reviewed his personal investigative file prior to testifying on each and every occasion, thus exposing and relying on the contents of the expunged records contained there.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The asserted testimonial discrepancy, assuming for the sake of argument that to be an accurate description, in no way leads to the inescapable conclusion that a reasoning mind necessarily would have concluded the officer generally to be bereft of credibility. In any event, on the record of this case, that call is left properly to the administrative fact-finder, unless a reasoning mind could not have found but otherwise. That latter scenario is not the case here. ALJ Seaton expressly stated why she determined Officer Teare\u2019s testimony to be credible. <em>See supra </em>pp. 502-03. She also provided a favorable evaluation of Officer Teare\u2019s demeanor. <em>See supra </em>pp. 502-03. We review the agency\u2019s explanation of the factual bases of its decision in the most favorable light possible as decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and \u201cnot only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662-63, 490 A.2d at 708 (citing <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512-13, 390 A.2d 1119); <em>see Caucus v. Maryland Securities, </em>320 Md. 313, 324, 577 A.2d 783, 789 (1990) (\u201cThis deference [to decisions of administrative agencies] applies not only to agency fact-finding, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well.\u201d (citing <em>St. Leonard Shores Joint Ven. v. Supervisor, </em>307 Md. 441, 447, 514 A.2d 1215 (1986))). Therefore, we conclude, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that there is no error \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the testimony of the officers, concerning the basic facts of [Petitioner\u2019s] arrest from the hearing conducted on March 7, 1995, originated from their independent recollection of the incident, and not any information in any expunged records or investigative files.\u201d <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md. App. at 505, 752 A.2d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">ALJ Seaton found as a fact that \u201c[w]hen testifying on March 7, 1995, Officer Teare relied on information contained in his own \u2018file\u2019 regarding the arrest to refresh his recollection of the date of the arrest and the make and model of the vehicle, <em>neither of which was central to the decision </em>made by ALJ McCloud.\u201d (Emphasis added). As stated, <em>supra, </em>whether the officer\u2019s personal investigative file forms a part, or contains some, of the expunged records is not material to the central issues presented in this employment termination action.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">ALJ Seaton explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">I agree with [Respondent] that Officer Teare used his \u201cfile\u201d to refresh his recollection about facts that can only be described as <em>\u201ccollateral </em>\u201d to the issue at hand. The first fact, the date of the arrest, was not even in dispute and became known to [Respondent] when [Petitioner] himself informed [Respondent] on March 2, 1992. In addition, there can be no doubt that the type of vehicle [Petitioner] was operating on the night of his arrest is a <em>tangential fact, </em>at best, in the administrative hearing concerning [Petitioner\u2019s] discharge. Indeed, the only relevant issue for this proceeding is whether [Petitioner], a Correctional Officer III, had marijuana in his possession when stopped by the officers on February 28,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">-k \"1- 'k</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">Moreover, for the purposes of the administrative hearing regarding the charges for removal, the relevant information concerns the basic facts of the arrest, not the type of minutia that would require referencing a document. The critical facts found by ALJ McCloud were that [Petitioner] was arrested because marijuana was found in a jacket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>believed by the officer to be [Petitioner\u2019s], that [Petitioner] had the strong odor of marijuana on him when approached by the police officers on February 28, 1992, and that [Petitioner] identified himself as a correctional officer and asked for a \u201cbreak\u201d to same his job. Based on those facts, ALJ McCloud found that [Petitioner] was in possession of marijuana on February 28, 1992. I have no problem believing that the officers, on March 7, 1995, testified to those essential facts, which are the basis for ALJ McCloud\u2019s decision, from their own respective recollection. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">It is clear that ALJ Seaton did not abuse her discretion in finding Officer Teare\u2019s testimony to be credible or err by determining any facts traceable for testimonial purposes directly to the officer\u2019s review of his personal investigative file were merely collateral to the issue at hand and did not form in any meaningful way the foundation of ALJ McCloud\u2019s or her decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The second question contained in Petitioner\u2019s certiorari petition was whether ALJ Seaton improperly denied Petitioner\u2019s request to review ALJ McCloud\u2019s personnel file to determine whether any impropriety existed with regard to McCloud\u2019s taking a position with Respondent. As explained, <em>supra </em>note 9, ALJ Seaton denied Petitioner\u2019s request to examine the personnel file of ALJ McCloud. Petitioner made the request because apparently Petitioner\u2019s counsel discovered, on or about 25 November 1997, that ALJ McCloud had sought employment with Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">As discussed <em>supra </em>pp. 489-91, McCloud first sat as an ALJ in this case on 7 March 1995 and filed a proposed decision on 21 June 1995, recommending that the termination of Petitioner\u2019s employment be upheld. On 12 June 1997, Petitioner requested that ALJ McCloud recuse himself on the ground that Petitioner had initiated a civil or criminal action against ALJ McCloud. <em>See supra </em>note 8 and accompanying text. In October of 1997, ALJ McCloud issued two written decisions in Petitioner\u2019s employment termination case, both of which con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>cerned motions for continuance. At the same time, ALJ McCloud denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to subpoena three additional witnesses. Petitioner argues that if ALJ McCloud issued these rulings at a time when he was pursuing employment with Respondent, then a conflict of interest would have existed, and ALJ McCloud should have recused himself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">At the hearing on 10 June 1998, ALJ Seaton asked Petitioner to explain how discovery of ALJ McCloud\u2019s personnel file would be relevant to the present case. Petitioner elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auv\">Because in the motions that were made \u2014 or the subpoenas were issued, and that he [ALJ McCloud] ruled on in October of 1997, for three additional witnesses, he denied that. We also asked him to recuse himself earlier. I think it was back in March of 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">ALJ Seaton then responded to Petitioner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">Well, here\u2019s what would have happened. Let\u2019s say you filed your motion to recuse Judge McCloud, and it\u2019s granted. He\u2019s recused. Well, let\u2019s just say instead of him leaving this office, the Executive Administrative Law Judge determined that it was inappropriate for him to come in and hear this case, you would have gotten the relief you now have, a new Judge that would take a fresh look at the remand order, decide the scope of the remand order, and revisit the issues that Judge McCloud ruled on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">ALJ Seaton observed, \u201cI already did that.\u201d Additionally, she noted the limited scope of the judicial remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">The only issue before at this time is whether the officers testified from expunged material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Now, I understand that you have this order \u2014 this concern about Judge McCloud, and I understand that you\u2019ve articulated it well. It is that you believe that he may have issued decisions involving a party opponent that \u2014 at such time as he may have had some interest in deciding it that person\u2019s favor because he was negotiating. I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">* <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">And that\u2019s why I denied the request of the subpoena [for former ALJ McCloud to testify], incidentally because I didn\u2019t see how Judge McCloud\u2019s testimony was relevant today. You may want to have some discovery about Judge McCloud for some other case, but how is that relevant to this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In her 9 September 1998 proposed decision, ALJ Seaton explained that ALJ McCloud\u2019s personnel records were irrelevant to the present case and concluded that \u201cwhatever concerns [Petitioner] had as to ALJ McCloud\u2019s rulings ... became moot, when the two matters were reviewed and decided by a different ALJ.\u201d On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals agreed and declared the issue moot because \u201cin the event McCloud had recused himself, [Petitioner\u2019s] case would have merely been assigned to a new ALJ,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat, in fact, occurred when McCloud left and ALJ Seaton was assigned the case,\u201d providing an \u201cindependent[ ]\u201d review of the case and its issues. <em>Gigeous, </em>132 Md.App. at 509, 752 A.2d at 1250. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In support of his contention, Petitioner contends that ALJ McCloud\u2019s recusal was warranted based on COMAR 28.02.01.08(C)(1)(a)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and on <em>Regan v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>355 Md. 397, 735 A.2d 991 (1999). Petitioner lifts and employs from <em>Regan </em>our statement that \u201c[p]rocedural due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>process, guaranteed to persons n this State by Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, requires that administrative agencies performing adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions observe the basic principles of fairness as to parties appearing before them.\u201d <em>Regan, </em>355 Md. at 408, 735 A.2d at 997 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 559, 625 A.2d 914, 923 (1993)). Petitioner also notes that we stated in <em>Regan </em>that \u201c[t]he doctrine that every person is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing \u2018applies to an administrative agency exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions\u2019, and \u2018is specifically applicable\u2019 to issues of disqualification, although \u2018disqualification will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power in the premises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Regan, </em>355 Md. at 408-09, 735 A.2d at 997 (quoting <em>Board of Medical Examiners v. Steward, </em>203 Md. 574, 582, 102 A.2d 248, 251-52 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Petitioner posits that doubt as to impartiality was present when ALJ McCloud favored positions taken by the agency where he later became employed. An investigation of McCloud\u2019s personnel records would have made his impartiality clear, Petitioner declaims. Petitioner continues that McCloud\u2019s refusal to recuse himself</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQj\">is not merely harmless error or somehow rendered moot. Acting as an ALJ, McCloud specifically breathed life into this case when the Department failed to subpoena witnesses to the administrative trial____The State\u2019s failure to properly secure its witnesses should have resulted in a decision favoring [Petitioner]. Instead, McCloud granted the Department \u2014 his future employer \u2014 a continuance to correct their failure to request that these Police Officers be compelled to attend.... The Agency failed to meet its burden at this juncture, yet ALJ McCloud forgave this blatant error by the Department of Public Safety <em>&amp; </em>Correctional services, his future employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Assuming, as did ALJ Seaton and the Court of Special Appeals, that ALJ McCloud\u2019s conduct, at least presented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>situation where a reasonable inference could be drawn of the appearance of impropriety, Petitioner effectively was afforded the relief to which he might have been entitled had recusal been found to be appropriate \u2014 a new hearing in front of a different administrative law judge. Thus, the issue is moot. <em>See Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 200, 725 A.2d 1027, 1033 (1999) (\u201cA question is moot \u2018if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing effective remedy which the court can provide.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Attorney General v. A.A. Co. School Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979)) (citing <em>Insurance Commissioner v. Equitable, </em>339 Md. 596, 613, 664 A.2d 862, 871 (1995))). As the intermediate appellate court observed, ALJ Seaton not only independently reviewed ALJ McCloud\u2019s rulings, but also overruled him, on one point, to the advantage of Petitioner, when she stated at the 10 June 1998 hearing: \u201cI disagree with Judge McCloud\u2019s ruling that shifting of \u2014 somehow the burden had shifted away from the proponent of the testimony of the officers.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As to Petitioner\u2019s earlier request for additional witness subpoenas, which ALJ McCloud rejected, ALJ Seaton conducted an independent review and concluded that, upon examination of the Circuit Court\u2019s remand order, there was no \u201croom for latitude in that remand order for the taking of additional testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Lastly, ALJ McCloud, in October 1997, in granting Respondent\u2019s motion for a continuance to ensure the presence of the two officers, as noted <em>supra, </em>provided a well-articulated, reasonable, and logical explanation for granting the continuance. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">[T]he instructions set forth by the Circuit Court of Somerset County cannot be satisfied without the appearance and testimony of the two officers. No other reasonable alternative exists. Moreover, the Court\u2019s instructions were not intended to further perpetuate a hearing on the merits of this matter, but clearly limit the scope of the administrative proceeding to the source of the officers testimony regarding the merits....
