Sledd\u2019s ex\u2019or against Thomas J. Turpin. The action was founded on a bond, as follows: $&gt;2,400. On demand, for value received, I promise to pay to James <em>V. </em>Sledd or his assigns, in gold or silver, or the equivalent thereof, the sum of twenty-four hundred dollars; and for the payment of which I bind myself, my heirs, ex\u2019ors, &amp;c., firmly by these presents. Witness, my hand and seal, this 8th day of May 1866. Thomas J. Turpin, (seal.) The declaration claims the sum of twenty-four hundred dollars, with legal interest from the 8th of May, 1866, in gold or silver, or the equivalent thereof; and it sets out the bond accurately.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-16\">The defendant demurred to the declaration; hut the court overruled the demurrer; and he then filed the pleas of payment and usury; on -which issues were made up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>On the trial the jury found specially the facts of the execution of the bond and payment of interest thereon until the 8th of May 1868; and that the balance had not been paid. That at the time of the execution of the bond the defendant was indebted to James V. Sledd,the obligee, for a balance due upon a debt contracted some time before the war; that there was no evidence as to what was the amount of that indebtedness; that at the time of the execution of the bond Sledd lent to the defendant a further sum of money, amounting to about $1,670 in United States treasury notes, or in National Bank notes; and that this last sum, together with the sum due as aforesaid, made the consideration of the bond; and the value of said notes at the time, as compared with gold and silver, was gold 129|- and silver about 121. If upon these facts the law was for the plaintiff, then they found for the plaintiff the said sum of $2,400, with interest from the 8th of May 1868 till paid; the same to be paid in gold or silver or. its equivalent. If the law be for defendant, then, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-11\">Upon this verdict the court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, that he recover against the defendant the.sum of twenty-four hunfired dollars, the debt in the said verdict ascertained, with legal interest thereon from the 8th of May 1868 till paid, and his costs. And thereupon Turpin applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas; </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-12\"><em>Mosby, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-13\"><em>Tabb, Page &amp; Maury, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-14\">Anderson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfC\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">The court is of opinion that the bond upon which this suit was brought, is an obligation to pay a certain sum, that is 2,400 -dollars, in <em>money, </em>that is to say, gold or silver, meaning gold or silver coin, not bullion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>transaction shows this: It was not a sale of bullion, but a contract to pay a debt, ascertained\u20142,400 dollars\u2014. Hot paper dollars, but gold or silver. In this obligation \u201cgold or silver,\u201d is evidently named as the standard of value, and as such, gold or silver coin could only have been meant. For whilst the obligor is not absolutely required to pay in that coin, he is absolutely required to pay that or its <em>equivalent. </em>lie must pay 2,400 dollars, gold or silver being the standard. He may pay it in either, but if not paid in one or the other, he may pay it in Hational Bank notes, or other currency, in an amount equal to twenty-four hundred gold dollars, or silver dollars, at his option. Such being the obligation of the plaintiff in error, it is a contract for a sum certain in money; and although he has the privilege to discharge itwith an equivalent of bank notes or other inferior currency, debt will lie, as was held by this court in <em>Butcher </em>v. <em>Carlile, 12 </em>Gratt. 520. The court is, therefore, of opinion that the demurrer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Hpon the second assignment of errors, the court is of opinion that the judgment of the court below, on the special verdict, is correct. The doctrine is well settled, that upon the plea of usury, the onus lies upon the defendants. The statute of . usury being highly penal, strict proof is required. <em>Brockenbrough's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Spindle's adm'rs, </em>17 Gratt, p. 21. In this case the defendant has failed to show that the consideration of the bond, . or any part of it, is usurious. And the defendant in error, by his counsel, having waived any right he may have to. a judgment for gold or its equivalent; and having withdrawn his assignment of error, that the court below did not render such, judgment, the court is of opinion that there is no error in the record for which the judgment should be reversed. Let it be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Judgment appirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
