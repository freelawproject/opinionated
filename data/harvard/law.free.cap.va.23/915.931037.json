The only difference between the two informations is, that in the first he is charged as being the keeper of a house of entertaiment, and in the last he is charged as keeping an ordinary. In the first case he appeared, and he pleaded \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and filed a demurrer to the information, which was over, ruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b934-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>The case came on to he tried on the 11th of Decern her, 1871, when the jury rendered a verdict in his fa- ' vour, and he was discharged by the court. And his plea averred that he was the same person and the offence was the same for which he had been before prosecuted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b934-9\">The attorney for the commonwealth demurred to the plea; and the court sustained the demurrer. And thereupon the defendant pleaded not guilty; and upon the trial there was a verdict against him; and the court adjudged that he should pay a fine of one hundred dollars- and costs; and that he should foi\u2019feit his license and give bond for his good behaviour. And Day applied to this-court for a writ of error; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b934-10\"><em>A. &amp; C E.

It sets out the record of proceedings in the corporation court of Alexandria, upon an information which is recited, together with the proceedings thereon, in -which it is charged that on the 11th of September in the-year 1871, in the city of Alexandria, Samuel Day, the keeper of a house of entertainment, in the said city, did in the house of entertainment of him the said Samuel Day, in the city aforesaid, permit unlawful gaming, by permitting divers persons there assembled, then and there to play at cards, against the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Virginia. That there was a demurrer by the defendant to said information, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>-overruled by the court; that the defendant then pleaded not guilty; upon which plea issue was joined; that the issue was tried by a jury who rendered a verdict of \u201c not guilty,\u201d and the judgment of the court thereon that the said Samuel Day be discharged of the said offence, and go thereof without day. And the plea avers that he (the defendant) and the said Samuel Day, so indicted and acquitted as aforesaid, are one and the same person, and the misdemeanor of which he was prosecuted and acquitted as aforesaid, and the misdemeanor of which he is indicted, are one and the same and not different misdemeanors. Parker O. J., we think justly said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>13 Mass. R. 455; \u201c Whenever it is made to appear substantially, by the record of a trial, that the second prosecution of the same party is for the same offence, and that on the first prosecution judgment has been awarded and actually executed (the plea in that case was <em>autrefois convict,) </em>the -court passing the first judgment having jurisdiction over the person and the offence, the second prosecution must be barred. In this case we are of opinion that the plea substantially avers, that the defendant had been previously prosecuted, tried and acquitted, by a court of \u2022competent jurisdiction, for the same offence, and that the judgment of acquittal remained in force and effect, and although inartificially drawn, it is a good plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>upon demurrer; and consequently, that the court below erred in sustaining the demurrer to the plea. The court is of opinion that the demurrer ought \u2022to have been overruled, and the attorney for the commonwealth, if he desired it, to have had leave to reply. And if he did not wish to reply, judgment should have been entered for defendant. The court is, therefore, of 'Opinion that the verdict in this cause be set aside, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>the judgment be reversed and annulled, and the caus\u00e9is remanded to the Corporation court of Alexandria, to. be proceeded in, in conformity with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
