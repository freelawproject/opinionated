The district court sentenced Gibbes to the statutory minimum of 120 months. On appeal, Gibbes challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in denying his request for application of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 (2004), the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, and that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment by enhancing his sentence based on facts not admitted by him. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Gibbes\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">The \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 allows district courts to sentence certain defendants without regard to otherwise mandatory statutory minimums. For \u00a7 5C1.2 to apply, the defendant cannot have more than one criminal history point; the defendant cannot have used violence or threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon in connection with the offense; the offense cannot have resulted in death or serious bodily injury; the defendant cannot be an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in regard to the offense; and \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant [must have] truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. The Government concedes that Gibbes met the first four factors, but contends that Gibbes failed to disclose all information regarding his drug conspiracy. We agree and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the application of \u00a7 5C1.2 because Gibbes did not disclose all information relating to his drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">Gibbes next contends that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court, however, sentenced Gibbes to the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months. Any fact finding by the district court, therefore, had no effect on Gibbes\u2019 sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 523 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[N]o <em>Booker </em>Sixth Amendment violation occurred here because Collins\u2019 sentence, with the addition of the career offender enhancement, still would have been the same even if the judge had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>made the finding as to the drug weight\u201d). We thus find no error in Gibbes\u2019 sentence and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
