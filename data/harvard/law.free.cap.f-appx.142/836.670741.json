We view all evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>296 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.2002). Hill contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images depicted \u201csexually explicit conduct.\u201d For the purpose of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(A)(4)(v) defines \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d as, inter alia, \u201clascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\u201d We have applied the six-factor test from <em>United States v. Dost, </em>636 F.Supp. 828 (S.D.Cal.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>813 F.2d 1231 (9th Cir.1987), to determine whether the images in Government exhibits 18, 21a, 21e, and 21f constitute such lascivious exhibitions. As these images indisputably meet most if not all of the <em>Dost </em>factors, a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the images depicted sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">Hill also asserts that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v) is unconstitutional as applied to him because the term \u201clascivious\u201d is too vague. We review the constitutionality of a federal statute de novo. <em>United States v. Rasco, </em>123 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.1977). To show that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(2)(A)(v) is unconstitutionally vague, Hill \u201cmust show that he could not have reasonably understood that his conduct was prohibited by the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Wicker, </em>933 F.2d 284, 288 (5th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). As Hill concedes, the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. X-Citement Video, </em>513 U.S. 64, 78-79, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994), the Supreme Court held that the use of the term \u201clascivious\u201d to define prohibited material is constitutional on its face. \u201cLascivious\u201d is defined as tending to excite lust; lewd; indecent; obscene; sexual impurity; tending to deprave the morals in respect to sexual relations; licentious. <em>Grimes, </em>244 F.3d at 381 (citing Blacks Law Dictionary 882 (6th ed.1990)). As used in the child pornography statute, the ordinary meaning of \u201clascivious exhibition\u201d of the genitals or pubic area \u201cmeans a depiction which displays or brings forth to view the genitals or pubic area of children, in order to excite lustfulness or sexual stimulation in the viewer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>When the images (such as those discussed above) and Hill\u2019s testimony that he obtained these images because of his interest in child pornography are viewed together with the \u201ccommonsensical\u201d meaning of \u201clascivious,\u201d Hill, or anyone in these circumstances, could reasonably understand that the images contained lascivious exhibitions of the minors\u2019 genitalia or pubic areas. Under the facts of this case, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
