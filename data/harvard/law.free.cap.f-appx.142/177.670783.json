Mattete disputes the finding that he failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal. We have reviewed the record and conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Mattete failed to demonstrate eligibility for this relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
