Lee, </em>217 F.3d 284, 288 (5th Cir.2000) (internal citation omitted). \u201cEvidence is sufficient to support a conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>311 F.3d 611, 613 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation and citation omitted). This court examines the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Violations of \u00a7 703 are strict liability offenses, requiring no proof of specific intent to commit the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 616. Because the evidence presented at trial indicated that the hawk killed by Stephens was an endangered bird species and Stephens admitted to shooting the hawk, Stephens\u2019s conviction was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lee, </em>217 F.3d at 288; 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.13 (2005). As Stephens cannot show that he had no reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, his conduct was not justified under the law. <em>See United States v. Gant, </em>691 F.2d 1159, 1162-63 (5th Cir.1982). In addition, federal law has provided no exemptions that would allow an individual to kill an endangered animal to protect property. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703, 1538, 1539; <em>see also Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 188, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Stephens also contests his sentence as excessive. Title 18, section 3742(f)(2) and (3) requires that we affirm a sentence unless we determine that it is plainly unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Stephens\u2019s sentence of a $600 fine, one year of probation and a one-year ban from hunting is not plainly unreasonable given the statute\u2019s allowance of a $15,000 fine and 6 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f)(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">For the reasons stated above, Stephens\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-19\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-29\">. The defendant spells his last name as Stephens. Hence, court documents that have the defendant\u2019s last name spelled as Stephans are incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
