More specifically, Plaintiffs asserted they were subjected to poisonous spiders and contracted staphylococcus infections from prison conditions; received inadequate medical attention; were victims of discrimination based on race; and suffered retaliation after filing grievances. In this interlocutory appeal, Plaintiff Marcia Wall appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her Motion for Equitable Relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>this Motion as a request for preliminary injunctive relief (as the district court did), since we would lack interlocutory jurisdiction over an order denying <em>permanent </em>relief, we affirm. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction \u201cis within the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Braun, </em>287 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 1167, 1171-72 (11th Cir.2002). Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In denying Wall\u2019s motion, the district court applied the well-established four-factor test for preliminary injunctive relief. Wall must demonstrate: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury without the injunction; (3) that the harm to Wall outweighs the harm to the non-moving parties; and (4) that an injunction would be in the interest of the public. <em>Palmer, </em>287 F.3d at 1329. \u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to be granted unless the movant clearly established the burden of persuasion\u201d as to each of the four prerequisites. <em>See McDonald\u2019s Corp. v. Robertson, </em>147 F.3d 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Texas v. Seatrain Int\u2019l, S.A., </em>518 F.2d 175, 179 (5th Cir.1975) (grant of preliminary injunction \u201cis the exception rather than the rule,\u201d and movant must clearly carry the burden of persuasion). The moving party\u2019s failure to demonstrate a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success on the merits\u201d may defeat the party\u2019s claim, regardless of the party\u2019s ability to establish any of the other elements. <em>Church v. City of Huntsville, </em>30 F.3d 1332, 1342 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also Siegel v. LePore, </em>234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that \u201cthe absence of a substantial likelihood of irreparable injury would, standing alone, make preliminary injunctive relief improper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The district court denied Wall\u2019s Motion, finding that Wall \u201conly conelusorily asserts that the four factors are met\u201d and noting that, \u201c[although the bulk of the Motion [for Equitable Relief] could be interpreted as a thirty-four page discussion of Plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits, the Motion barely addresses the questions of irreparable harm, balancing on the equities, and whether the issuance of an injunction would be in the public interest.\u201d In her brief, Wall essentially makes the same argument she made below. She does not apply the four-factor test nor does she suggest how she has satisfied each factor. On this record, we find no clear abuse of the district court\u2019s broad discretion in its decision on Wall\u2019s Motion, as she did not satisfy her burden of persuasion on each of the four elements that are prerequisites for the entry of such extraordinary relief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wall\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\">. In its order, the district court also: granted in part the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment; dismissed the claims of Plaintiffs Bruce, Garrison, Beauford, Gourley, Maddox, and Roberson; dismissed Defendants Ferrero, Doctor, and Paris from the case; and denied or overruled pretrial motions. On March 10, 2005, we dismissed this appeal as to the other issues based on our lack of jurisdiction to review those portions of the order on an interlocutory basis. Accordingly, in this opinion we address only the denial of Wall's motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>for equitable relief. To the extent Wall raises other claims in her brief, we again note that we do not have jurisdiction to review those aspects of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
