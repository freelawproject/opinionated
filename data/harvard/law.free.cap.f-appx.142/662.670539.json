Finding no error, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">Arcon is an asbestos removal contractor based in Norfolk, Virginia. In February 1999, Arcon contracted to remove approximately 1,500 feet of bulkhead panels from the M/V CAPE LOBOS, berthed in Wilmington, North Carolina. Arcon\u2019s work plan for the job described the removal of the panels as \u201cClass II Asbestos Work,\u201d J.A. 365, meaning that it involved activities such as \u201cthe removal of asbestos-containing wallboard, floor tile and sheeting, roofing and siding shingles, and construction mastics,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(b) (2004). The panels were located on the boat deck, the poop deck, and the upper deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">Arcon\u2019s crew \u2014 supervisor David Poole, Joe Boone, and Daryl Jefferson \u2014 arrived at the site on March 8,1999. At that time, they observed that there was already a great deal of dust in the work area. When the Arcon crew began work on March 9, air samples were taken by Warren Plautz, a field technician for Phoenix Envirocorp, which had been retained to conduct monitoring at the site. Plautz\u2019s pre-work sam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>pie indicated a fiber count of .065/cubic centimeter \u2014 over the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of .01. Plautz\u2019s next sample, called an \u201cexcursion sample,\u201d was taken from inside the work area on the boat deck and indicated a fiber count of 8.49/cubie centimeter. This was above the permissible excursion limit of l.O.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These high fiber counts were evidently the result of the friability of the wallboard \u2014 according to Boone, \u201cif you touch[ed] [the panels], the stuff would just fall out,\u201d J.A. 150\u2014 and Poole\u2019s use of a reciprocating saw (a \u201cSawzall\u201d) to remove wallboard from around a pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Plautz informed Poole of the high fiber counts, and then he informed the general manager of Phoenix Envirocorp, Thomas Green. Green consulted Arcon\u2019s safety manager, C.J. Morey, and advised her to shut down the project. When Arcon\u2019s president, Arthur Hawthorne, called Poole to discuss the situation, Poole stated that the sample results were high because of the way he removed the panels and possibly because a piece of the material fell on the air monitoring equipment. Poole did not inform Hawthorne that the panels were breaking apart or that he had used the Sawzall to remove one of the panels. After this conversation, it was Morey\u2019s understanding that the boat deck would be cleaned up and clearance samples would be obtained before the work continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">That night, Poole traveled to Norfolk to obtain a negative air machine, additional plastic sheeting, and an airless water sprayer. The following morning, March 10, the crew proceeded with work on the poop deck without first obtaining clearance samples from the boat deck. Plautz\u2019s air samples from the poop deck indicated that fiber counts were within the PEL, but Green nevertheless reported to Morey that he was concerned that Poole had not finished cleaning the boat deck. However, the work on the poop deck apparently proceeded without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">At the beginning of the day on March 11, Poole asked Gregory Baccari, the official responsible for approving the work area, to approve the containment area on the upper deck. Baccari refused, pointing out that the plastic sheeting that had been used to contain the area had tears, holes, and gaps, and that no sheeting had been placed on the ceiling, which was open as the result of the previous removal of ceiling tiles. Baccari left the area, but when he later returned he found that the crew had proceeded with the work without correcting the problems. According to Baccari, the area was \u201canywhere from ankle deep to knee deep\u201d in broken panels and there was visible dust in the air. <em>Id. </em>at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Later that morning, Allen Mosby, a compliance officer with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, boarded the CAPE LOBOS in response to an anonymous complaint about Arcon\u2019s work practices. Mosby took numerous photographs of the dust, debris, and holes in the plastic sheeting. Among other things, Mosby noted that it did not appear that the Arcon crew was wetting down the panels prior to wrapping them in the plastic sheeting. Mosby ordered the site to be shut down that afternoon. He also notified the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of possible regulatory violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">OSHA compliance officer Andrea Reid investigated the site and issued two citations containing a total of 12 items. Citation 1 alleged four serious violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>OSHA regulations, denoted as Items 1, 2a, 2b, and 3. Citation 2 alleged eight willful violations of OSHA regulations, denoted Items la-c and 2a-e. Reid imposed a total fine for the violations of $108,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Arcon sought review by an ALJ, who vacated three of the violations, reduced four of the willful violations to serious violations, and reduced the fine to $40,450. Arcon sought additional review from the Review Commission, which vacated another three items and reduced the fine to $36,200. Arcon now seeks further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The Secretary of Labor bears the burden of proving the violation of an OSHA standard. To do so, she must demonstrate \u201c(1) the applicability of the standard, (2) the employer\u2019s noncompliance with the terms of the standard, (3) employee access to the violative condition, and (4) the employer\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.\u201d <em>N&amp;N Contractors, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>255 F.3d 122, 126 (4th Cir. 2001). We must affirm the holdings of the Review Commission if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>at 125. \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla\u201d; it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Arcon first argues that the Secretary failed to establish that the cited standards apply because she did not prove that the fibers in the air were asbestos fibers, as opposed to some other kind of fiber. The Review Commission rejected this claim in a single sentence: \u201cThe argument is not a valid challenge to the applicability of the cited standards, whose applicability does not depend on whether asbestos dust is present.\u201d J.A. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The Review Commission was correct. The pertinent regulatory provision, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001 (2004), \u201cregulates asbestos exposure in all shipyard employment work ..., including but not limited to ... [rjemoval or encapsulation of materials containing asbestos.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(a)(2). Arcon admits that the wallboard panels contained amosite asbestos, and Mosby testified to this fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the regulations apply to the work Arcon was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">One of the citations \u2014 alleging a failure to provide adequate respiratory protection \u2014 relies on a regulatory standard that applies, as is relevant here, to certain forms of Class II asbestos work. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(h)(1)(ii), (iv) (requiring respirator protection \u201c[djuring al Class II work where the ACM [asbestos-containing material] is not removed in a substantially intact state\u201d or when no negative exposure assessment is supplied). Substantial evidence supports the determination that Ar-con\u2019s work on the CAPE LOBOS was Class II asbestos work, which is defined as \u201cactivities involving the removal of ACM ... includ[ing], but ... not limited to, the removal of asbestos-containing wallboard.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(b). As noted above, Arcon admits that the wallboard it removed from the CAPE LOBOS contained amosite asbestos. Its removal therefore was Class II work.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>In light of the clear applicability of the regulations, Arcon\u2019s assertion that the Secretary failed to prove the presence of airborne asbestos fibers appears actually to be a challenge to the finding of a violation of the applicable standards. Such a challenge would apply only to Citation 2, Item lc, which alleges a failure to use a proper respirator. Since the type of respirator required varies according to the amount of airborne asbestos, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001 tbl. 1, the Secretary was required to demonstrate the presence of airborne asbestos fibers in the workplace in order to establish a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The Secretary\u2019s evidence on this point consisted of the results of Plautz\u2019s environmental monitoring. Plautz employed phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) to count airborne fibers. In the absence of other information, OSHA regulations require any fiber at least 5 micrometers long with a 3:1 or greater length/width ratio to be counted as an asbestos fiber. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001 appx. A(13)(a), (b). Although PCM does not definitively establish a given fiber as asbestos, <em>see id. </em>appx. B \u00a7 1.3, the regulations provide that PCM is adequate to establish the presence of airborne asbestos, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1.2. However, the regulations also provide that a differential counting method, which will positively identify fibers as asbestos, \u201cshould be used if discrimination is desirable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Arcon maintains that the Secretary failed to carry her burden of proof with respect to Citation 2, Item lc because she did not employ a differential counting method to positively demonstrate the concentration of airborne asbestos fibers. This argument is without merit. The Review Commission has explicitly stated that compliance with the respirator standard \u201cis premised on the painstaking, microscopic measurement of samples required\u201d by PCM. <em>Sec\u2019y of Labor v. DEC-TAM Corp., </em>1993 WL 27401, at *13 (O.S.H.R.C. Jan. 19, 1993). This evidence is thus sufficient to meet the Secretary\u2019s burden of making a prima facie case for a violation and thereby to shift the burden to Arcon to rebut. <em>See Sec\u2019y of Labor v. EBAA Iron, Inc., </em>1995 WL 49331, at *1 (O.S.H.R.C. Feb. 7, 1995). Arcon has presented no evidence to rebut the sampling results.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Arcon next maintains that the Secretary failed to meet her burden of proof with respect to Citation 1, Item 2b. This item charged Arcon with failing to conduct additional monitoring after a change in process, namely, the use of the Sawzall to cut the wallboard panels on March 9. There is no question that the use of the Sawzall greatly increased the amount of airborne fibers in the work area. Arcon maintains, however, that this citation should be vacated because the use of the Sawzall was abandoned after March 9. According to Arcon, its return to its originally planned work practices absolved it of the need to conduct any additional monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Arcon did not raise this challenge to the citation before the Review Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, it has waived review of this issue. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a) (West 1999) (\u201cNo objection that has not been urged before the Commission shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>stances.\u201d). Additionally, even if this claim were not waived, the regulation does not support Arcon\u2019s position; it requires additional monitoring after a change in practice, without regard to whether monitoring may <em>actually </em>be needed. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(f)(4)(ii). And, Arcon cites no other authority in support of its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Item 2c of Citation 2 alleged that on March 11, Arcon failed to place \u201c[cjritical barriers\u201d \u2014 here, polyethylene sheeting \u2014 at all openings to the work area. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(g)(7)(ii)(A). In particular, the citation noted that (1) Arcon failed to use barriers over open portholes, (2) the sheeting that Arcon used \u201cdid not cover all open areas,\u201d J.A. 15, and (3) Arcon failed to use impermeable drop-cloths on the floor of the upper deck. This citation was based on Mosby\u2019s observations and photographs of the work area on March 11. Arcon asserts that this citation should be vacated because (1) the Secretary failed to prove any migration of airborne asbestos, and (2) it was prevented from proving the efficacy of the methods it did use because Mosby shut down the work on March 11 before any monitoring could be employed. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1915.1001(g)(7)(ii)(B) (providing that alternative barrier methods may be used if the efficacy of those methods is \u201cverified by perimeter area monitoring or clearance monitoring\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Arcon\u2019s first assertion is plainly without merit. The standard requires the use of certain methods, and thus a violation of the standard is established by the failure to use those methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Arcon\u2019s second argument fails because there is no evidence that it performed any perimeter area or clearance monitoring, or that Mosby prevented it from doing so. In the first place, the Arcon crew began work at approximately 8:30 a.m., and Mosby did not shut down the work until well after lunch. There is no dispute that Arcon did not perform any perimeter area monitoring during the five or more hours that it worked on March 11. And, although Ar-con now asserts that it would have performed clearance monitoring if Mosby had not shut down the job, there is no evidence in the record that supports this assertion. Accordingly, there is no basis for vacating this citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Finally, Arcon challenges the amount of the penalty imposed on it as an abuse of discretion. <em>See generally </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 666(j) (West 1999) (discussing authority to impose civil penalties and relevant considerations as to the amount of penalty). Arcon\u2019s argument on this point rests entirely on its previous assertion that the Secretary failed to prove the presence of airborne asbestos fibers. As discussed above, however, the use of phase contrast microscopy is an accepted method for determining the presence of airborne asbestos fibers. The Secretary therefore met her burden, and it was up to Arcon to challenge the validity of the Secretary\u2019s evidence. Since Arcon failed to do so, there is no basis on which to reduce the penalties imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">For the reasons set forth above, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. This test result was initially reported as 35.5 fibers/cubic centimeter, an impossibly high level. Although this caused some confusion, it appears that everyone involved agreed that the problem was likely a misplaced decimal point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. On appeal, Arcon contends that Mosby\u2019s testimony \u2014 that tests of the wallboard \"came back am[o]site,\u201d J.A. 36 \u2014 was improper because Mosby was not an \"expert.\u201d Arcon did not challenge his testimony on this basis during administrative proceedings, however, and thereby waived this claim. <em>See 29 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 660(a) (West 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">.
