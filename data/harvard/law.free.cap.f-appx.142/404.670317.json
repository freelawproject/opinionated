The government\u2019s theory and proof was that Allums committed these crimes in an attempt to prevent his conviction on earlier charges of kidnapping and transporting across state lines a minor, his thirteen-year old stepdaughter. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting prosecutorial comments and testimony about Allums\u2019s sexual relationship with his minor step-daughter over his Fed.R.Evid. 403 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to exclude evidence pursuant to Rule 403 only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>33 F.3d 1507, 1524 (11th Cir.1994). Rule 403 permits a district court to exclude relevant evidence only when \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d We consider \u201cRule 403 ... an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly because it allows a court to exclude admittedly probative evidence.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>33 F.3d at 1524. As such, we \u201cnarrowly circumscribe\u201d a trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence as unduly prejudicial. <em>United States v. Cross, </em>928 F.2d 1030, 1048 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cThe \u2018major function\u2019 of Rule 403 \u2018is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>928 F.2d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">There was no abuse of discretion. Testimony about Allums\u2019s sexual relationship with his minor step-daughter was admissible to demonstrate his motive for committing the charged offenses, as well as to demonstrate the motive of Carl Hollander, a key government witness, in assisting the government in its investigation of Allums. <em>See United States v. Church, </em>955 F.2d 688, 700 (11th Cir.1992). In other words, the evidence about what Allums had done to his minor step-daughter \u201cpertain[ed] to the chain of events explaining the context, motive, and set-up of the crime,\u201d and \u201cform[ed] an integral and natural part of an account of the crime, or [was] necessary to complete the story of the crime for the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Williford, </em>764 F.2d 1493, 1499 (11th Cir.1985). Because the prejudicial effect of this testimony did not substantially outweigh its probative value, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony. Therefore, we affirm Allums\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
