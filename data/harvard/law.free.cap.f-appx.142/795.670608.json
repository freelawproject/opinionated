The district court imposed the following sentence, enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) and armed-career-criminal guideline, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4: concurrent prison terms of 262 months as to count 1 and 240 months as to count 2; a consecutive 60-month prison term as to count 3; and concurrent supervised release terms of, respectively, five, three, and five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">For the first time on appeal, Miller argues that his sentence, as determined pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>-U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the offense level for his cocaine-base-possession charge, which was determined by the district court to have been 26, should have been only 12, the offense level for a minimum quantity of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Court held that, \u201c \u2018[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537, the Court held that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">In <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, the Court extended <em>Blakely </em>to the <em>federal </em>guidelines, holding that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Court excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the guidelines effectively advisory rather than mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65, 125 S.Ct. 738. Under <em>Booker, </em>district courts are still required to consider the guidelines, and <em>Booker </em>applies to this direct appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 757-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">A challenge under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>that is raised for the first time on appeal, however, is reviewable only for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Even if the district court plainly erred by enhancing Miller\u2019s guideline sentence based on factors not submitted to the jury, Miller cannot prevail on appeal unless he shows that the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521. This requires him to show that the district court would have reached a \u201csignificantly different result\u201d under an advisory sentencing regime. <em>Id. </em>Miller cannot make that showing, because at trial he stipulated that cocaine base was found in his home, and the stipulation referred directly to a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>report showing that 6.0 grams of the substance was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Miller also contends, for the first time on appeal, that his ACCA sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely. </em>In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Court held that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and not a separate element of a criminal offense. <em>Apprendi </em>left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>intact; as noted above, <em>Apprendi </em>states that the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d need not be submitted to a jury. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The holding in <em>Booker </em>applies to \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Accordingly, the line of authority from <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to <em>Booker </em>does not require that a prior conviction be treated the same way as other factors that affect a sentence. Even if <em>Booker </em>did render Miller\u2019s ACCA and \u00a7 4B1.1 sentence unconstitutional, there is not enough information in the record to justify a conclusion that the district court plainly erred in determining that Miller\u2019s armed-robbery convictions were sufficiently separate that they qualified as the \u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d necessary to support the armed-career-criminal enhancements. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">. Miller also emphasizes that, in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. 738, which was pending in the Supreme Court when Miller filed his briefs herein, that Court was considering whether to extend <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines. A decision was issued in <em>Booker </em>after briefing had been completed here. <em>United States v. </em>Booker,-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
