Because the allegedly defective performance of Miller\u2019s subcontractor was not an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and because a policy\u2019s subcontractor exception to an exclusion does not grant or extend coverage, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this issue is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Miller, a general contractor, obtained commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policies from Travelers. These CGL policies obligate Travelers to indemnify Miller for bodily injury or property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined by the policies to be \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The policies contained various exclusions, including a \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion that limits coverage for property damage to the insured\u2019s work. \u201cThis [\u201cyour work\u201d] exclusion does not apply [however] if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on [the insured\u2019s] behalf by a subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Wal-Mart and I.B. Ventures, LLC hired Miller to complete site development work on two adjacent pieces of property in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Wal-Mart also hired Miller to build a Wal-Mart store on one of the lots. Miller used a subcontractor to complete the site development work; however, this subcontractor allegedly selected and used defective fill material. The allegedly defective fill material expanded, resulting in damage to buildings on both properties, including the store that Miller built for Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Wal-Mart and I.B. Ventures sued Miller in state court for property damages. Travelers subsequently sought a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine coverage under the CGL policies. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart and I.B. Ventures. In this appeal, Travelers contests only the district court\u2019s determination that it is required to indemnify Miller for Wal-Mart\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Monumental Paving &amp; Excavating, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Mfrs.\u2019 Ass\u2019n Ins. Co., </em>176 F.3d 794, 797 (4th Cir.1999). This court also reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s contract interpretation. <em>Seabulk Offshore Ltd. v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). \u201cThe interpretation of a written contract is a question of law that turns upon a reading of the document itself, and a district court is in no better position than an appellate court to decide such an issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">The district court applied Virginia law and the parties do not contest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>issue on appeal. Although the Supreme Court of Virginia does not appear to have considered whether a contractor\u2019s deficient performance can constitute an \u201coccurrence,\u201d the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia recently predicted how the Virginia Supreme Court would decide the issue. <em>See Hotel Roanoke Conference Ctr. Comm\u2019n v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>303 F.Supp.2d. 784, 786 (W.D.Va.2004). It followed <em>American Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. v. Doverspike, </em>36 Va. Cir. 263, 1995 WL 1055839 (1995), in deciding that poor performance on a renovation contract could not be considered an accident or occurrence, and concluded that \u201c[t]he insurance policy issued to the [contractors] is a general liability policy covering accidents causing bodily injury or property damage. It is not a performance bond. It does not cover poor workmanship.\u201d <em>Hotel Roanoke, </em>303 F.Supp.2d. at 786-87 (quoting <em>American Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>36 Va. Cir. at 264, 1995 WL 1055839).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The <em>Hotel Roanoke </em>court additionally noted that \u201ca wealth of case law from other states [also] supports the conclusion that damages resulting from the insured\u2019s defective performance of a contract and limited to the insured\u2019s work or product is not covered by a commercial general liability policy because it is \u2018expected\u2019 from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d <em>Hotel Roanoke, </em>303 F.Supp.2d at 787. The damage to the Wal-Mart store allegedly was a result of Miller\u2019s subcontractor\u2019s defective performance. As a result, such damage is not considered to be \u201cunexpected,\u201d or caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Wal-Mart did not file an appellate brief. It settled and is not a party in this appeal. In its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, however, its arguments for coverage for its damages were based not upon the existence of an \u201coccurrence,\u201d but upon the subcontractor exception to the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion. Travelers does not dispute that the subcontractor exception would prevent denial of coverage under the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion <em>if </em>the damage to the Wal-Mart store were considered to be property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d It does dispute, however, the district court\u2019s apparent determination that coverage would be created by the subcontractor exception and would exist even absent an \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In support of its determination that the subcontractor exception provided coverage, the district court cited, <em>inter alia, L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Maine Ins. Co., </em>350 S.C. 549, 567 S.E.2d 489, 494 (App.2002), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>\u2014 S.E.2d -, 2004 WL 1775571 (S.C. Aug.9, 2004). In reversing, the Supreme Court of South Carolina determined that there had been no \u201coccurrence,\u201d so there was no need to consider the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion and subcontractor exception. <em>Id. </em>at -, 2004 WL 1775571 at *4. It continued its discussion, however, \u201cto reverse the court of appeals\u2019 determination that an exception to an exclusion \u2018restores\u2019 coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because South Carolina law provided that \u201can exclusion does not provide coverage but limits coverage,\u201d the court determined that the lower court had erred in stating that an exception to an exclusion \u201crestore[d]\u201d coverage. <em>Id. </em>at-, 2004 WL 1775571 at *5 (quoting <em>Engineered Prods., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>295 S.C. 375, 368 S.E.2d 674, 675-76 (App.1988)). The subcontractor exception merely rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion inapplicable; it did not itself provide coverage. <em>Id. </em>at -, 2004 WL 1775571 at *4-5. We find this holding to be consistent with Virginia law. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wenger, </em>222 Va. 263, 267, 287 S.E.2d 874, 876 (1981) (quoting <em>Haugan v. Home Indent* Co., </em>86 S.D. 406, 413, 197 N.W.2d 18, 22 (1972)) (\u201cExclusion (a) does not extend or grant coverage. To the contrary it is a limitation or restriction on the insuring clause.\u201d); <em>see also RML Corp. v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>No. CH02-127 (Va. Cir. Ct. Dec. 31, 2002) (citing <em>Wenger, </em>222 Va. at 267, 278 S.E.2d at 876) (\u201c[E]xclusions do not extend or grant coverage.... The Court rejects [the] argument that language excepting subcontractor\u2019s work from [an] exclusion ... extends coverage under the CGL policy to all repairs of subcontractors\u2019 defective workmanship.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Because the damage to the Wal-Mart store was not unexpected and, therefore, not an \u201coccurrence,\u201d and because an exception to an exclusion does not grant or extend coverage, Travelers is not required under this policy to indemnify Miller for Wal-Mart\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> Similarly, the Virginia Circuit Court of Fairfax County determined that \"defective workmanship cannot constitute a covered \u2018occurrence\u2019 ..., as faulty workmanship by the insured is almost always foreseeable.\u201d <em>Pulte Home Corp. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Co., </em>No. 210454, 2004 WL 516216, *5 (Va. Cir. Ct. Feb. 6, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
