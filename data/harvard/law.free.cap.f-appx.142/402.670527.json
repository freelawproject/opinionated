Booker, </em>548 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After review, we reinstate 010: previous opinion and affirm Dixon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">After a jury trial, Dixon was convicted of: (1) conspiracy to make false statements to purchase firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count One); (2) four counts of making false statements to purchase firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6), 924(a)(2), and 2 (Counts Two through Five); and (3) four counts of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (Counts Six through Nine).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">On direct appeal to this Court, Dixon challenged the district court\u2019s admission of evidence at trial related to his prior felony conviction, his child-support warrant, and the nature of his relationship with a child alleged to be his son. We affirmed Dixon\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 981, -, slip op. at 12 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">Dixon did not raise any challenge to his sentence in his initial brief or in his reply brief on direct appeal, much less any error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending <em>Apprendi. </em>Instead, after filing his initial and reply briefs, Dixon filed a \u201cmotion to supplement issues on appeal,\u201d in which Dixon sought to raise a new challenge to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We denied Dixon\u2019s motion based on this circuit\u2019s well-established rule that issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed waived. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2004), <em>judgment vacated by, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2542, 162 L.Ed.2d 272 (2005), <em>judgment reinstated by, United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 991 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001); <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1023, 122 S.Ct. 552, 151 L.Ed.2d 428 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Dixon filed a petition for <em>certiorari </em>in the United States Supreme Court. On June 6, 2005, the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>vacated our December 1, 2004 judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker. Dixon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2542, 162 L.Ed.2d 271 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">As discussed above, Dixon did not challenge his sentence or raise any <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>issues in his initial brief or reply brief to this Court. Although he did attempt to raise the issue in a motion to supplement issues on appeal, we denied that motion. Under our circuit\u2019s precedent, Dixon\u2019s failure to raise those issues in his initial brief on direct appeal bars him from doing so now. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that <em>\u201cBooker </em>itself recognized that retroactivity is subject to ordinary prudential rules, and thus nothing in <em>Booker </em>undermines or affects our prudential rules; if anything, <em>Booker </em>contemplates that they should be applied in Booker-remand cases\u201d); <em>United States v. Vanorden, </em>414 F.3d 1321, 1322-23 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause Vanorden did not challenge his sentence on Sixth Amend<em>ment-Apprendi-Blakely-Booker </em>grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>in his first trip through this circuit, this argument is \u2018deemed abandoned.\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d 1251, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe well-established law in our circuit requires that issues be raised in the parties\u2019 initial brief.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2005) (stating in a <em>Booker-remand </em>case that \u201c[t]he Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the [Booker] issue in his initial brief bars him from doing so now\u201d); <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to consider on remand <em>Booker </em>issue not raised in appellant\u2019s initial brief); <em>Ardley, </em>242 F.3d at 990 (stating after a remand from the Supreme Court that \u201cwe apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs [prior to Supreme Court remand] are deemed abandoned\u201d and declining to consider any <em>Apprendi </em>error after remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Thus, after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>we reinstate our December 1, 2004 opinion and affirm Dixon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
