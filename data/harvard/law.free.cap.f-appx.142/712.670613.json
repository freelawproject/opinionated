Bailey appeals her conviction and twenty-one month sentence following her guilty plea to aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206 (2000). In her appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Bailey claims to have found no non-frivolous claims for appeal, but argues that the magistrate judge erred in accepting Bailey\u2019s guilty plea. Bailey was notified of her opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-24\">Bailey did not seek to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court. Accordingly, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). A plea is presumed to be final and binding if the Rule 11 hearing is adequate. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). Our review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation details a thorough Rule 11 colloquy that assured Bailey\u2019s plea was made both knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>ed States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117, 120 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we find Bailey\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and properly accepted by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Finding no meritorious issues upon our review of the record, we affirm Bailey\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
