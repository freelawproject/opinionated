The district court sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>fenced Owens under the federal sentencing guidelines to 108 months incarceration and stated an alternative sentence of 50 months pursuant to our directive in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Owens now appeals, arguing that his sentence was imposed in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, as expressed in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm Owens\u2019 conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for re-sentencing. Owens argues on appeal that his sentence is unconstitutional because it was enhanced based on the district court\u2019s findings that he possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense and that he possessed a specific quantity of a controlled substance. These findings resulted in an enhancement of Owens\u2019 sentencing range under the guidelines as mandatory from 46 to 57 months to 100 to 120 months. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines\u2019 mandatory scheme \u2014 which provided for sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the court); <em>id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). In light of the ruling in <em>Booker, </em>we find that the district court erred in imposing a sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed prior to <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, although we affirm Owens\u2019 conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">. As we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of [Owens\u2019] sentencing.\u201d <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing <em>range </em>along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
