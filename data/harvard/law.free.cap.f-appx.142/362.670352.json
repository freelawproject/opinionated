We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-26\">Dees first contends that the district court erred by concluding that it lacked authority to make his federal sentence run concurrently with his then-impending state sentence. A district court has authority to impose a sentence concurrent with a future state sentence, and its failure to recognize that authority is reversible error. <em>United States v. McDaniel, </em>338 F.3d 1287, 1288 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>(llth Cir.2003) (per curiam). Dees contends that the district court\u2019s comment at sentencing \u2014 that it was \u201cof the belief that you can\u2019t run a sentence concurrent with a sentence that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d \u2014 reveals it misunderstood its authority and, therefore, erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We will assume, without deciding, that Dees\u2019 contention that the district court improperly failed to recognize its authority is correct, because any error by the district court was harmless anyway. First, the error itself did not affect Dees\u2019 ultimate sentence because, even had the district court recognized (and exercised) its authority to make Dees\u2019 sentence concurrent to the impending state sentence, the state court would have been free to ignore that order and impose a consecutive sentence. <em>See United States v. Andrews, 330 F.3d </em>1305, 1307-08 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003) (\u2018We fully recognize that the Supremacy Clause does not permit federal courts to control how a state court sentences a defendant.\u201d) Second, when the state court eventually sentenced Dees, it ran his state sentence concurrent with his federal sentence. <em>See </em>Appx. to Appellee\u2019s Br. Thus, because any error by the district court did not affect Dees\u2019 substantial rights, remand on that error is not warranted. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Next, Dees contends that he is entitled to resentencing under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the district court enhanced his sentence based on facts neither admitted by him nor found by a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Dees raised this constitutional objection for the first time on appeal, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631-32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Under plain error review, \u201cbefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 122 U.S. at 1785, 122 S.Ct. 1781 (quotation and internal marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Under our recent decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2005), Dees has not shown that his sentence would have been different under the new <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. Therefore, Dees again cannot show that his substantial rights were affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Finally, Dees argues that our precedent on the issue of whether \u201ccoincidental possession\u201d of a firearm during the commission of another felony is sufficient to support the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) is wrong because it is contrary to the language of the guidelines (and the holding of ten other circuits). Although he recognizes that we cannot overrule a prior panel decision, he raises the issue to preserve it for appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">Dees correctly acknowledges that the prior precedent rule would prevent us from accepting his argument, were we to reach it. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is the firmly established rule of this Circuit that each succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d). His challenge, however, is foreclosed for a more preliminary reason. Dees\u2019 argument regarding \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>misplaced because he did not actually receive the four-level enhancement under that sentencing provision. Instead, Dees\u2019 total adjusted offense level was based on a cross-reference found at \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A), which required the judge to sentence him based on \u00a7 2D1.1, a completely separate guidelines provision with its own offense-specific enhancements. Because Dees was found with between five and twenty grams of cocaine base, he was given a base offense level of 26 under \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(7). Then, a two-level (not four-level) enhancement was added under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for possessing a dangerous weapon. Thus, this Court\u2019s precedent interpreting \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) did not affect Dees\u2019 sentence. Dees does not argue in his brief that the nearly identical language in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1), the cross-reference that enhanced his sentence, should be interpreted the same way he argues that language should be interpreted under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">. After Dees filed his brief in this case, the Supreme Court applied the holding of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-13\">. The cross-reference applies if a defendant possesses a firearm \"in connection with\u201d another offense, \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1), while the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) requires that the firearm be possessed \"in connection with\u201d a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
