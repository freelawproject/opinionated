In his appeal, filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel for Mason asserts there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. The court\u2019s repeated attempts to inform Mason of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-23\">Upon our review of the record, we likewise find no meritorious issues warranting review. Mason was advised of the nature of the charge, the potential punishment, and the rights he was waiving by entering a plea of guilty, and he knowingly and intelligently waived those rights and pled guilty. The sentence imposed by the district court was within the range established by statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 402, and the Sentencing Guidelines were not applicable. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 1B1.9 (2003). In short, there is no basis for questioning Mason\u2019s conviction or sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Heves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
