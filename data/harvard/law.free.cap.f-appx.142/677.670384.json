In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">The district court entered the criminal judgment on April 10, 2003, and entered its judgment granting Ward\u2019s motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) to allow a belated notice of appeal on September 20, 2004. Ward\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on February 22, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Ward failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-14\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
