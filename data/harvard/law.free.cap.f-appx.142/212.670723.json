Trevino-Saenz argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme. He acknowledges that this claim is reviewed for plain error only.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The district court committed error that is plain by sentencing TrevinoSaenz under a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). Nevertheless, Trevino-Saenz has not carried his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. Trevino-Saenz\u2019s contention that this error is structural and gives rise to a presumption of prejudice is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297); <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.2005). Trevino-Saenz has not shown that he should receive relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Trevino-Saenz\u2019s argument that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional is, as he concedes, foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Trevino-Saenz has shown no reversible error in the district court\u2019s judgment. Consequently, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
