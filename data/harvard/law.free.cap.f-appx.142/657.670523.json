At sentencing, the district court imposed a sentence of 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. The court also imposed an alternate sentence \u201cin accordance with the ruling of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 2nd, 2004, and in the event the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines are found to be non-binding on the sentencing courts.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Joint Appendix at 14). The court stated the alternate sentence was the same 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, McCullough contends the sentence should be vacated and remanded because the court did not have the benefit of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it imposed an alternate sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because McCullough did not object at sentencing to the mandatory use of the sentencing guidelines, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">However, the alternate sentence imposed by the district court treating the guidelines as advisory did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>769; <em>see also Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 553 (noting that treating the guidelines as mandatory is a separate <em>Booker </em>error). McCullough argues the sentence was substantially swayed by the constraints of the mandatory sentencing guidelines. He argues that resentencing is required despite the alternative sentence because it was imposed without benefit of Booker and <em>Hughes. </em>McCullough further states there is no indication what sentence would have been imposed had the court exercised its discretion under \u00a7 3553(a) and treated the guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><em>Booker </em>states that, in reviewing sentences that do not involve a Sixth Amendment violation, appellate courts may apply the plain error and harmless error doctrine in determining whether resentencing is required. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (appellate court may disregard any error that does not affect substantial rights). The harmless error standard permits an error at sentencing to be disregarded if the reviewing court is certain that any such error \u201cdid not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). Here, because the district court imposed an alternative discretionary sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, as authorized by <em>Hammoud, </em>that was identical to the guideline sentence, the error inherent in the application of the guidelines as mandatory did not affect the court\u2019s ultimate determination of the sentence. Because McCullough cannot show prejudice in using the guidelines as mandatory, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-12\">. The district court was citing the order issued in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004), <em>opinion issued by, United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-22\">. McCullough does not challenge either of his convictions. He only raises the sentencing issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
