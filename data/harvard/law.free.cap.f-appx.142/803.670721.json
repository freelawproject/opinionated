Because Johnson\u2019s claim that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is not entitled to reimbursement from his settlement proceeds requires interpretation of the Medicare Secondary Payer statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2), the claim arises under the Medicare Act. <em>See Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 614-15, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). He is therefore required to channel the claim through the agency process and obtain a final decision from the Secretary of DHHS before he may obtain judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) &amp; (h); <em>Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 1, 10-15, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000). Section 405(g)\u2019s requirement that Johnson present his claim to DHHS before raising it in court is nonwaivable and nonexcusable, and his failure to so present the claim precludes federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or \u00a7 1346. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h); <em>Ill. Council, </em>529 U.S. at 15, 120 S.Ct. 1084. That Johnson does not directly seek Medicare benefits does not bar application of \u00a7 405. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 120 S.Ct. 1084.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-13\">2. The Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s judicial review provisions do not provide a basis for jurisdiction because \u00a7 405(h) precludes review of Johnson\u2019s claim until it has gone through the agency process. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) (providing that the APA\u2019s judicial review provisions do not apply where another statute precludes judicial review of agency action); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (providing that <em>final </em>agency actions are subject to judicial review); <em>Ringer, </em>466 U.S. at 606, 104 S.Ct. 2013 (\u201c[A] \u2018final decision\u2019 is rendered on a Medicare claim only after the individual claimant has pressed his claim through all designated levels of administrative review.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-14\">3. DHHS\u2019s past adherence to the position that the Secondary Payer statute entitled it to reimbursement for Medicare benefits paid on behalf of claimants who later obtained tort settlements does not alone persuade us that it will not apply current controlling legal principles, including <em>Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>337 F.3d 489 (5th Cir.2003), to Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>claim. Without more, Johnson has failed to show that presentment of his claim to DHHS would be futile. <em>See McGowin v. ManPower Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 556, 559 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cA failure to show hostility or bias on the part of the [body responsible for] administrative review is fatal to a claim of futility.\u201d); <em>Nygren v. United States, </em>268 F.Supp.2d 1275,-1280-81 (W.D.Wash.2003) (finding that DHHS\u2019s past position that it was entitled to reimbursement of Medicare benefits paid on behalf of claimants who later obtained tort settlements was insufficient to show that presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims that DHHS was not so entitled to the agency would be futile).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
