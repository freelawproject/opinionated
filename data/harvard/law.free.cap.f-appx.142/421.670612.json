This indictment stemmed from an incident at Fort Gordon, Georgia, on Sunday, August 3, 2003, when Kelley and his passenger, Mazo Ford Jones, attempted to enter the military base to buy beer. Because they did not have a proper identification sticker, military police (\u201cMP\u201d) pulled them over into a search area. An MP thought that he detected an odor of marijuana in the car, so he conducted a search of the vehicle. During the search, the MP found several hundred rounds of different caliber ammunition in the vehicle\u2019s trunk. The MP then asked Kelley whether there was a weapon in the vehicle. Although Kelley did not immediately respond that there was a weapon in the car, he eventually told the MP that Jones had a firearm under the passenger seat. The MP then searched the car and found the firearm under the seat and the firearm\u2019s magazine in the glove box. The MP subsequently conducted a complete search of the vehicle and found, in the trunk, a bag that belonged to Kelley. In the bag was a tennis shoe that contained approximately 28 grams of crack cocaine. Kelley subsequently pled guilty to the above charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">In addition to the crack cocaine possession charge, in January 1998, Kelley was convicted, in relevant part, of carrying a concealed weapon. In July 1998, Kelly was convicted of (1) possession of a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>by a convicted felon, (2) possession of a firearm after being adjudicated delinquent, and (3) possession of a firearm while simultaneously possessing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At sentencing, the district court imposed a two-level enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), for possessing a dangerous weapon. In so doing, the court stated that, given the fact that (1) Kelley knew that the gun was in the vehicle, (2) the gun and its magazine were in close proximity to one another, (3) there was a significant amount of cocaine in the trunk of the vehicle, (4) Kelley\u2019s previous firearm convictions demonstrated his familiarity with firearms and that he has them around when he possesses a controlled substance, and (5) there was a significant amount of ammunition in the trunk of his car, it was clearly probable that the gun related to his possession of the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The court subsequently sentenced Kelley to 108 months imprisonment, the top of his Sentencing Guideline range, stating that it was troubled with Kelley\u2019s performance while on pretrial release, his lack of candor with the pretrial services officer, and his \u201cattempt to manipulate his lawyer, the court, the magistrate judge, the probation officers and everybody else around him.\u201d The court went on to state that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnH\">Mr. Kelley is a repeat offender of offenses involving firearms and drugs. He is too clever. He is a manipulative person and the prospect of his having advanced computer expertise is one that I find somewhat chilling. I can\u2019t tell him what to learn or what not to learn, but I hope any potential employers in the future will look at his background very carefully if that is the kind of work he is going to be involved in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">In short I am taking into account ... everything else I have come to know about Mr. Raleigh Kelley, IV, and I don\u2019t trust what he says. I am doubtful about his true intentions at all times. While I have given him acceptance of responsibility I have done so for reasons which do not [ ] amount to bestowing a merit badge on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">On appeal, Kelley contends that the district court erred in (1) attributing to him the two-level enhancement for possessing a dangerous weapon, and (2) sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">I. Firearm Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">On appeal, Kelley asserts that the district court erred in assessing a two-level firearm enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), for possessing a dangerous firearm because the person who actually possessed the firearm had no knowledge that Kelley had cocaine in his suitcase. Thus, it was clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to his drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact when it enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence in cases involving U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.1(b)(1), and review the application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Under the guidelines, a defendant should receive a two-level enhancement if he possessed a firearm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that \u201c[t]he adjustment should be applied if the [firearm] was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n. 3. The government has the burden of proving that \u201cthe firearm was present at the site of the charged conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995). Then the burden shifts to the defendant to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>strate that \u201ca connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In the case at bar, although Kelley claims that the firearm could not be connected to his drug offense because Jones, the owner of the gun, was unaware of the crack cocaine in the trunk, Kelley\u2019s arguments are misguided. Kelley admitted that he was aware that he had approximately 28 grams of crack cocaine and several hundred rounds of ammunition in the trunk of his vehicle. He also knew that there was a gun under the passenger seat, only a few feet away from him, and the gun\u2019s magazine was located in the glove box, only a few feet from the gun. Since 28 grams of crack cocaine is consistent with a distribution amount, and not merely a personal amount, it further supports the district court\u2019s decision that it was not clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to Kelley\u2019s drug offense. <em>See United States v. Sarniento, </em>744 F.2d 755, 761 (11th Cir.2984) (\u201cIntent to distribute may be inferred form the amount of cocaine involved.\u201d); <em>United States v. Wash, </em>231 F.3d 366, 371 (7th Cir.2000) (noting that 5.4 grams of crack cocaine is a distribution amount). Given Kelley\u2019s knowledge of the drugs in his trunk, the amount of drugs in the trunk, the location of the firearm, and the location of the gun\u2019s magazine, in addition to Kelley\u2019s previous controlled substance offense that involved the use of a gun, it was not <em>clearly </em>improbable that the firearm was connected to Kelley\u2019s drug offense. <em>See Hall, </em>46 F.3d at 63. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">H. Booker Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Kelley further contends that the district court erred, under <em>Booker, </em>in sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system. In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court held that, under the state of Washington\u2019s mandatory sentencing guidelines system, the imposition of a sentencing enhancement based upon facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2534-2538, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended this holding to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 755. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, we have stated that there could be two <em>Booker </em>errors: (1) a Sixth Amendment error \u2014 the error of imposing a sentencing enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury, and (2) a statutory error \u2014 the error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Because Kelley\u2019s sentence was enhanced under a mandatory guidelines system based on facts found by the judge and not admitted by him, Kelley\u2019s right to a jury trial was violated. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Kelley raised an objection to the enhancement in the district court; thus, we review the sentence de novo. <em>Id. </em>However, if this error is harmless, we must disregard it. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Where \u201cthe error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u201d it must be disregarded. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">When a defendant raises an objection to the mandatory nature of the guidelines, we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). While this is a less stringent harmless error standard than that applied to a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, a statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u201cis harmless if, viewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error, the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (internal quotation omitted). In the present case, there was a non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error because the district court sentenced Kelley under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. For the foregoing reasons, we find both the statutory and constitutional <em>Booker </em>errors harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Here, the record demonstrates that the court\u2019s statutory error did not affect, or had but a slight effect, on Kelley\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2005) (finding sentencing the defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme was harmless because (1) he was sentenced to the top of the guideline range, and (2) the district court considered sentencing the defendant to the maximum allowable under the statute of conviction). Moreover, with respect to the enhancement and constitutional eiTor, \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the [constitutional] error complained of did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained.\u201d <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (quotation omitted). Specifically, when it sentenced Kelley, the district court stated that Kelley was a \u201cmanipulative person\u201d and his knowledge of computers was \u201cchilling.\u201d The court further stated that it hoped that Kelley\u2019s future employers would look \u201cvery carefully\u201d at Kelley\u2019s background. Furthermore, the court stated that, although it gave him the acceptance of responsibility adjustment, it did not trust what Kelley said, and doubted his true intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">This language from the court, in addition to the court\u2019s sentencing Kelley to the top of the guideline range, suggests that Kelley\u2019s sentence was not \u201csubstantially swayed by the error,\u201d because it indicates that the district court was afraid that, when Kelley was released back into society, he would continue to commit controlled substance and firearm offenses, or that his knowledge of computers would lead to other criminal charges. Additionally, the court\u2019s comments also suggest that, if the guidelines were advisory instead of mandatory, the court would have given Kelley a higher sentence than what the guidelines required. The court\u2019s comments further indicate that \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the constitutional error of enhancing the sentence based upon facts neither admitted nor proven to a jury did not contribute to the sentence. Therefore, the errors by the district court in sentencing Kelley under a mandatory guidelines system and enhancing his sentence were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Kelley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
