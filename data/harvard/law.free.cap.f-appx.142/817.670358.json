Avila-Chavez, </em>87 Fed.Appx. 433 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">The Government argues that this appeal is moot because Avila was released from prison and deported back to Mexico on December 27, 2004. Avila argues that his appeal \u201cstill presents a live issue\u201d because he is on supervised release until December 27, 2005. Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution requires that a \u201c \u2018case-or-controversy ... subsist[ ] through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847 (5th Cir.1999). This requirement is met because Avila is still subject to supervised release, a part of his total sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 928 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">Avila\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines \u201cis structural, or at least presumptively prejudicial, thus obviating the need for a specific showing of prejudice\u201d has been rejected as inconsistent with this court\u2019s analysis in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600-01 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 559-61 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Avila\u2019s alternative argument that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines constitutes plain error also lacks merit. This court will not consider a Booker-related challenge raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Avila identifies \u201cno evidence in the record suggesting that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Hernandez-Gonzalez, </em>405 F.3d 260, 261 (5th Cir.2005)); <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22. The fact that the district court imposed the minimum sentence under the guideline range \u201calone is no indication that the judge would have reached a different conclusion under an advisory scheme.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005)(citing <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22). Because Avila has not demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>strated plain error, \u201cit is obvious that the much more demanding standard for extraordinary circumstances, warranting review of an issue raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari, cannot be satisfied.\u201d <em>See Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate our judgment affirming Avila\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
