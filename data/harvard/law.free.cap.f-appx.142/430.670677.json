(\u201cSolar Time\u201d) appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s final judgment, after a bench trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in favor of XL Specialty Insurance Co. (\u201cXL\u201d). And XL has cross-appealed some of the magistrate judge\u2019s determinations. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">XL issued claims-made Errors and Omissions (\u201cE <em>&amp; </em>0\u201d) policy to Lancer International Corp., a freight forwarder, effective from 31 December 1993 through 31 December 1996, with a $100,000 annual limit. XL then issued to Lancer a policy with identical provisions effective from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 1997. The policies were diminishing policies: they were depleted by defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">Condition 2 of both policies states that XL only will cover a claim based on a negligent act that occurred during the policy period: and only if the claim first is made during the policy period and reported to XL in writing while the agreement is in effect. Both policies also contain Condition 7, which required Lancer to notify XL immediately in writing of a negligent act, error, or omission, even if no claim had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-18\">On 26 August 1996, Lancer received a letter from a shipper, Three HHH, Inc., advising Lancer of the loss of $156,000 of watches shipped to Solar Time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But XL did not receive notice of the loss from Lancer until 16 June 1997: when XL received from its sister company<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> demands made in early June 1997 from Solar Time to Lancer for payment for the value of the watches.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-19\">On 19 June 1997, Ben Llaneta, an XL vice president who handled this claim, sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>a form letter to Lancer acknowledging receipt of the notice of claim, describing the coverage of the policy, and reserving XL\u2019s rights \u201cuntil it has been afforded the opportunity to fully investigate this claim.\u201d The next day, Llaneta sent a letter to Lancer observing that Lancer had not notified XL of the Solar Time loss claim until nearly ten months after the events leading to the claim. Llaneta pointed to Condition 7; he did not mention Condition 2. But Llaneta noted that XL was reserving its right to deny coverage if its \u201cability to defend, investigate or otherwise resolve this claim are [sic] prejudiced as a result of this late notice.\u201d Llaneta also mentioned that XL had retained a law firm to represent Lancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Llaneta stated that the documents attached to the claim report had enough information for him to determine what coverage defenses were available to XL. And Llaneta admitted that, when he sent the letters to Lancer, he knew that Condition 2 had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In September 1997, Llaneta notified Lancer that XL had received the suit by Three HHH against Lancer. This letter again reserved XL\u2019s right to deny coverage; but the letter did not decline coverage. XL then paid for the defense of Lancer. XL retained another law firm to represent it on coverage issues: this firm sent Lancer a letter in October 1999 advising Lancer that XL was renewing its reservation of rights. The letter referenced Condition 7 but not Condition 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In January 2000, XL filed a suit for declaratory relief against Solar Time and Lancer, alleging that no coverage existed due to late notice. The complaint cited Condition 7 but not Condition 2. XL voluntarily dismissed the complaint in August 2000. At some point in 2000, Lancer went out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In March 2001, Solar Time obtained a $225,975.83 total judgment against Lancer, in excess of the $100,000 policy limit. In June 2001, Lancer executed a release of XL from all claims in return for up to $5,000 in defense costs for the appeal from the underlying judgment. The release mentioned Condition 7 but not Condition 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">In November 2002, Solar Time, as judgment creditor of Lancer, filed this suit against XL, alleging statutory and common law bad faith for failing to settle the claim within policy limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> XL responded that no coverage existed under its policy for the underlying claim. XL initially cited Condition 7 as the basis for its coverage defense. Months later, XL for the first time mentioned Condition 2 and argued that no coverage existed because Lancer had failed to report the loss during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">The magistrate judge bifurcated the coverage issue from the bad faith issue and held a bench trial. The magistrate determined that, under Condition 2, no coverage existed under the policy because Lancer failed to report the claim in writing during the applicable policy period. The magistrate opined that, because the policy did not cover the claim, XL\u2019s failure to notify Lancer about the lack of coverage under Condition 2 did not constitute XL\u2019s waiver of its right to rely on lack of coverage. And the magistrate determined that Solar Time had no standing to assert that XL was estopped from denying coverage: Solar Time was not a party to the insurance contract and took no assignment of Lancer\u2019s rights under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Finally, the magistrate rejected Solar Time\u2019s attempt to invoke an exception to the rule \u201cthat the doctrines of waiver and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>estoppel mil not operate to create coverage in an insurance policy where none originally existed.\u201d <em>Cigarette Racing Team, Inc. v. Parliament Ins. Co., </em>395 So.2d 1238, 1239 (Fla.App. 4th Dist.1981). The exception is that \u201cwhen an insurance company assumes the defense of an action, with knowledge, actual or presumed, of facts which would have permitted it to deny coverage, it may be estopped from subsequently raising the defense of non-coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239-40. The magistrate noted (1) that Solar Time issued a reservation of rights letter, (2) that Solar Time not only wished to be placed \u201cin the shoes of the insured\u201d but in a better position than the insured, and (3) that the insured received no harm \u2014 -and received a benefit \u2014 from the acts of the insurer, which provided a defense that the insured was not entitled to. The magistrate further determined that, because XL issued reservation of rights letters, even though XL failed to mention Condition 2 in those letters, XL did not mislead Lancer into believing that coverage existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Solar Time argues that, because it obtained a judgment against Lancer in excess of Lancer\u2019s policy limit, it has standing to bring a Florida law third-party bad faith action against XL without an assignment from Lancer. Solar Time maintains that, as the injured party \u201cstanding in the shoes\u201d of Lancer, it may assert that XL is estopped from denying coverage. And Solar Time argues that the district court erred in concluding that XL was not es-topped from denying coverage: Solar Time asserts that XL created a false sense of security by failing to mention Condition 2 as a basis for denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions of law following a bench trial.\u201d <em>Ogden v. Blue Bell Creameries U.S.A., Inc., </em>348 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">We initially affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s decision that no coverage existed under the terms of the policy. XL issued Lancer a claims-made policy: this policy only protects the insured against claims made and reported during the policy period. <em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, </em>438 U.S. 531, 98 S.Ct. 2923, 2926 n. 3, 57 L.Ed.2d 932 (1978). The loss of Solar Time\u2019s watch shipment occurred at the latest in August 1996. Lancer\u2019s applicable claims-made policy ran until 31 December 1996. But Lancer did not report the lost watch claim until June 1997: Lancer\u2019s policy did not cover this claim. <em>See Gulf Ins. Co. v. Dolan, Fertig &amp; Curtis, </em>433 So.2d 512, 515 (Fla.1983) (with a claims-made policy, \u201cif the claim is not reported during the policy period, no liability attaches\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">We also affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that XL was not estopped from raising a complete lack of coverage, under Condition 2, at such a late date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The general rule is that \u201cestoppel may not be invoked to enlarge or extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the coverage specified in an insurance contract.\u201d Carn<em>eiro Da Cunha v. Standard Fire Ins. Co./Aetna Flood Ins. Program, </em>129 F.3d 581, 587 (11th Cir.1997). Florida recognizes an exception to this rule: \u201cwhen an insurance company assumes the defense of an action, with knowledge, actual or presumed, of facts which would have permitted it to deny coverage, it may be estopped from subsequently raising the defense of non-coverage. Whether the exception to the rule applies depends upon whether the insurer\u2019s assuming the defense prejudiced the one claiming to be insured.\u201d <em>Doe v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>653 So.2d 371, 373 (Fla.1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Contrary to Solar Time\u2019s assertions, we discern no prejudice to Lancer, the insured, that resulted from XL\u2019s defense. As the magistrate judge noted, XL\u2019s failure to deny coverage resulted in Lancer receiving (1) the benefit of a defense \u2014 at XL\u2019s cost and that Lancer was not entitled to \u2014 for the full policy value and (2) $5,000 in appellate defense costs in exchange for Lancer\u2019s release of claims against XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Solar Time contends that Lancer was prejudiced because Lancer relied on XL to settle the case within the policy limits and, had XL denied coverage from the outset, Lancer could have attempted to settle with Solar Time to avoid an excess judgment. But Lancer\u2019s president testified that he relied on the law firm retained by XL to \u201crepresent him properly\u201d and to \u201cwin\u201d the case. Solar Time\u2019s suggestion that Lancer would have settled \u2014 had XL earlier denied coverage \u2014 is speculative. And we reject as irrelevant Solar Time\u2019s argument that it, too, was prejudiced by XL\u2019s late denial of coverage: the inquiry under Florida law is on the prejudice to the insured, not a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Further, XL issued reservation of rights letters. Although these letters mentioned Condition 7 and not Condition 2, the letters specifically noted that XL was not waiving any defenses or rights. <em>Cf. Fla. Mun. Ins. Trust v. Village of Golf, </em>850 So.2d 544, 547-48 (Fla.App. 4th Dist.2003) (noting expert\u2019s testimony that, absent reservation of rights letter, \u201cthe insured receives a false sense of security\u201d); <em>Doe, </em>653 So.2d at 372-74 (approving application of exception to rule that estoppel cannot create coverage where insurer had not issued reservation of rights letter); <em>Cigarette Racing, </em>395 So.2d at 1239-40 (same). Solar Time contends that by mentioning only Condition 7 as a possible coverage defense \u2014 and not Condition 2 as a basis for denying coverage \u2014 XL lulled Lancer into believing that coverage existed. But Solar Time points to no binding precedent applying the doctrine of estoppel when the insurer issues a reservation of rights letter that refers to a coverage defense but does not refer to a specific basis for a denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Finally, Solar Time correctly observes that Florida law allows \u201ca third party to file a bad-faith claim directly against the liability insurer without an assignment by the insured upon obtaining a judgment in excess of the policy limits.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Zebrowski, </em>706 So.2d 275, 277 (Fla.1997); <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 624.155(1)(b). But the magistrate judge properly did not reach the issue of bad faith after it determined that no coverage existed. <em>See Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Anheuser-Busch Cos., Inc., </em>741 So.2d 1259, 1261 (FlaApp. 5th Dist.1999) (writing that coverage and liability issues must be determined before a bad faith cause can be prosecuted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In sum, the magistrate committed no error in determining (1) that no coverage existed under Lancer\u2019s policy with XL based on Lancer\u2019s failure to inform XL of the claim during the policy period, and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that XL was not estopped from raising a complete denial of coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-11\">. The parties <em>consented in </em>writing <em>to </em>trial and final disposition of the issues in this case by a magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\">. Lancer had used a company named Tie Cargo Corp. to ship the watches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\">. Claims reported by an insured were made to XL\u2019s sister company, Trade Insurance Services, Inc., which acted as XL\u2019s insurance agent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-20\">. In its response to XL's cross-appeal, Solar Time suggests in a footnote that a dispute exists about whether XL received notice of the loss within the policy period. But Solar Time failed to present substantive argument, in its initial appellate brief, on the district court's determination that Solar Time did not establish that notice of the loss was given in 1996. This issue is abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. Solar Time filed suit in state court; XL removed the action to federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">. We note that some confusion exists in Florida law about whether Solar Time, as a third party judgment creditor of Lancer, had standing to argue that XL was estopped from denying coverage. <em>See Gen. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Barrentine, </em>829 So.2d 980, 983 (Fla.App. 1st Dist. 2002) (concluding that estate of person killed by insured in vehicle accident lacked standing to assert estoppel defense to insurer\u2019s denial of coverage to insured); <em>but see Johnson v. Dawson, </em>257 So.2d 282, 283-84 (Fla.App. 3d Dist. 1972) (writing that judgment creditor had standing to argue estoppel about insurance coverage against insurer of judgment debtor, but ultimately concluding that estoppel could not be used to create liability on the part of an insurer for loss not covered in the insurance policy). We need not decide the issue of standing: even assuming that Solar Time has standing, estoppel does not create coverage in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b461-17\">. Before determining that no coverage existed under the policy, the magistrate initially had concluded that XL was precluded from denying coverage based on Lancer\u2019s failure to notify XL promptly of the claim: a breach of Condition 7. The magistrate wrote that Lancer\u2019s late notice of the claim did not prejudice XL: and because XL suffered no prejudice from the late notice, XL thus was precluded from denying coverage based on a breach of Condition 7. This determination is the subject of XL's cross-appeal. But we have affirmed the magistrate's ultimate determination that no coverage existed: we need not address the arguments in XL\u2019s cross appeal on the preliminary determination about Condition 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
