We affirm their convictions, but we vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">Goulbourne and Williams claim that the district court improperly sentenced them when it imposed a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone. Because they failed to raise this claim below, we review it for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. The jury convicted Goulbourne and Williams of responsibility for 500 for or more grams of cocaine for each count. At sentencing, the district court found Williams accountable for 2,958.02 grams of cocaine, for a total offense level of thirty pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5) (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court held Goulbourne accountable for 2,975.06 grams of cocaine and 10.81 grams of cocaine base, USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(5), and assessed an additional four offense levels for his role in the offense, USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(a), for a total offense level of thirty-four. Given their criminal history category of I, the district court\u2019s drug quantity factual finding increased Williams\u2019 sentencing range from 63-78 months to 97-121 months. The drug quantity and role in the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>findings increased Goulbourne\u2019s sentencing range from 63-73 months to 151-188 months. Goulbourne\u2019s 188 month sentence and Williams\u2019 121 month sentence thus exceeded the sentences that could have been imposed based only on the facts found by the jury. The district court thus erred in basing their sentence on judge-found facts under a mandatory guidelines regime, and the error was plain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 547-48. Because Goulbourne\u2019s and Williams\u2019 sentences were longer than what could have been imposed based on the jury\u2019s verdict alone, the error affected their substantial rights, <em>id. </em>at 548, and we will notice the error, <em>id. </em>at 555. Therefore, Goulbourne and Williams must be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We affirm Goulbourne\u2019s and Williams\u2019 convictions. We deny Goulbourne\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief because the issue he seeks to raise in that brief was adequately raised in his formal brief. In light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>we vacate Goulbourne\u2019s and Williams\u2019 sentences and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART: VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. Williams' presentence report assessed an offense level of 30 based on drug quantity, and added two points for her role in the offense, for a total offense level of 32. During the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it would have assessed four levels for her role in the offense, but instead would only assess two levels based on the probation officer\u2019s recommendation. When the court pronounced sentence, however, it used a total offense level of 30. There is no explanation in the transcript for this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Williams\u2019 and Goulboume\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
