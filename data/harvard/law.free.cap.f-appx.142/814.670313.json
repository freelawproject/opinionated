Laing does not dispute the validity of the underlying tax liabilities, but rather argues he never received a first notice of assessment and demand for payment within 60 days as prescribed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a). This alleged notice failure, according to Laing, precludes the Government\u2019s ability to exercise its administrative collection remedies. The Government filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-19\">This Court has previously determined that Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) Forms 4340 (Certificate of Assessments, Payments, and Other Specified Matters), copies of which were submitted by the Government as part of its summary judgment evidence, are \u201cvalid evidence of a taxpayer\u2019s assessed liabilities and the IRS\u2019s notice thereof.\u201d <em>Perez v. United States, </em>312 F.3d 191, 195 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>McCarty v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 1085, 1089 (5th Cir.1991) (observing that Forms 4340 \u201cindicate] that [taxpayer] had received notice of the assessment and demand for payment\u201d)). Moreover, whether Laing <em>received </em>notice is not material to whether the IRS <em>sent </em>the notices. <em>Jones v. Cmm\u2019r, </em>338 F.3d 463, 467 (5th Cir.2003). As the district court observed, Laing\u2019s evidence that he did not receive such notice is limited to an affidavit submitted by his accountant, which the district court disregarded as being \u201cbased on hearsay and not upon any personal knowledge.\u201d The district court determined that, without more, Laing did not come forward with any competent summary judgment evidence establishing that notice of assessment was not properly provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-20\">Having carefully reviewed the entire record of this case, and having fully considered the parties\u2019 respective briefing, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s order. We therefore AFFIRM the final judgment of the district court for the reasons stated in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b841-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
