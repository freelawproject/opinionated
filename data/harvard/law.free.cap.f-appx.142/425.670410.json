Through counsel, they seek review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">Because the BIA issued its own decision in this case, we review only that decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test; we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283 \u2014 84 (internal quotation omitted). The substantial-evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow us to \u201cre-weigh the evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The petitioners first contend that they are entitled to asylum because, according to them, they have shown that Lopez suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion or his imputed political opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argue that Lopez was subjected to threats by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) because of his involvement with a religious outreach group that sought to recruit youths out of gangs.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In order to be eligible for asylum, an alien must establish with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that he will suffer persecution in the future on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). \u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and markings omitted). \u201cThreats alone generally do not constitute actual persecution; only rarely, when they are so immediate and menacing as to cause significant suffering or harm in themselves, do threats per se qualify as persecution.\u201d <em>Vatulev v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 1207, 1210 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s factual conclusion that Lopez has not suffered past persecution. Lopez\u2019s experiences in Colombia do not rise to the level of persecution. His allegations of persecution include: (1) a warning that Lopez considered to be a joke; (2) a three-to four-minute encounter with four men on motorcycles who verbally harassed and threatened him; and (3) several threatening phone calls, which he received at various locations. Neither Lopez nor his family was ever physically harmed. These things are nothing more than \u201ca few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d which is insufficient to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. As we have just noted, Lopez has never suffered more than threats, and there is no evidence to suggest that those threats will escalate into anything more serious in the future. And, the fact that Lopez\u2019s daughters have remained in Colombia casts doubt on Lopez\u2019s fears of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Because the petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum, their claim for withholding of removal also fails. The standard for obtaining withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum. Thus, if an applicant cannot show the well-founded fear of persecution necessary for asylum, he generally is unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292 \u2014 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Finally, the petitioners\u2019 claim for relief under CAT also fails. In order to obtain withholding of removal under CAT, the applicant must prove that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>petitioners have not met that heavy burden. The evidence shows that they were threatened, but never physically harmed, when they lived in Colombia. That the petitioners\u2019 daughters have safely remained in Colombia suggests that will continue to be the case. Finally, while the threatening telephone calls that Lopez received suggest the possibility that FARC may seek to harm him, those calls fall far short of showing that possibility is more likely than not.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">.
