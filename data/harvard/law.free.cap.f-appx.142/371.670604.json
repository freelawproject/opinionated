Jewell, a Florida state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-26\">Jewell was charged with multiple counts, including attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer (\u201cLEO\u201d). At the conclusion of a jury trial, the judge instructed the jury that if they found Jewell guilty of attempted second-degree murder, they then must determine if the offense involved a deadly weapon. The court further instructed that, if the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>found Jewell guilty of a lesser offense of aggravated assault, the jury must determine if the victim was an LEO. The jury convicted Jewell of attempted second-degree murder with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At sentencing, the court stated that Jewell was convicted of attempted second-degree murder of an LEO, and sentenced Jewell to thirty years imprisonment, which was the maximum statutory sentence for attempted second degree murder with a deadly weapon. The sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Jewell filed a state Rule 3.800 motion to correct his sentence, claiming that his sentence was enhanced improperly because the victim\u2019s LEO status was not determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, as required under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). After a hearing at which the judge admitted his misstatement at sentencing when he said that Jewell had been convicted of attempted second-degree murder of an LEO, the state court denied the Rule 3.800 motion and explained that it would correct the judgment to reflect the proper offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Jewell then filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition, alleging, inter alia, that his sentence was illegal in light of <em>Apprendi </em>because he received an enhancement for attempted second-degree murder of a LEO, but the LEO element was not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The state responded and moved to dismiss on the grounds that, inter alia, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation, as Jewell had been convicted of attempted second-degree murder with a deadly weapon and not attempted second-degree murder of an LEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The district court denied habeas relief, finding, inter alia, that <em>Apprendi </em>was not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. After the district court denied Jewell\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), this court granted a COA on the following issue: \u201c[wjhether the district court erred when it found that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not apply in this case because of the <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), non retro-activity doctrine?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">On appeal, Jewell argues that the court erred in denying habeas relief because his appeal was not final when <em>Apprendi </em>was decided and the sentencing enhancement that the victim was an LEO was included in the charging document but not submitted to the jury. He further claims that <em>Apprendi </em>was a \u201cwatershed rule of criminal procedure\u201d that would be retroactively applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). A habeas petition</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim-(l) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Here, the district court erred in finding that the <em>Apprendi </em>claim was barred because Jewell\u2019s conviction was not final until after <em>Apprendi </em>issued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Jewell was not entitled to relief because Jewell was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, the statutory maximum for attempted second-degree murder with a deadly weapon. Fla. Stat. Ann \u00a7 775.082(3)(b); <em>Jennings v. Florida, </em>704 So.2d 1078 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1997). Therefore, the state court\u2019s determination that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>error was not contrary to federal law. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). As long as Jewell\u2019s sentence did not exceed the thirty-year statutory maximum, there was no <em>Apprendi </em>error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, <em>1272 </em>(11th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Because the district court properly denied relief on the merits, this court need not address the state\u2019s remaining arguments. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-16\">. Jewell filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), and, therefore, the provisions of that act govern this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. The jury verdict indicates that the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense involved a deadly weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\">. The state court\u2019s decision affirming Jewell\u2019s sentence was final when the mandate issued on August 31, 2001. <em>Apprendi </em>was decided in 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\">. To the extent that Jewell may contend that there could be any error under <em>Blakey v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that argument is without merit. <em>Blakely </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, -, slip op. at 8-9 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
