Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Allen v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1023, 160 L.Ed.2d 1005 (2005). We previously affirmed Allen\u2019s convictions but vacated his sentence and remanded for re-sentencing based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>302 F.3d 1260, 1276, 1278-80 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cAllen I\u201d). </em>Based on <em>Apprendi, </em>Allen had argued that the district court erred in sentencing him higher than the statutory maximum for minimum drug quantities contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) because the quantity of drugs was neither specified in the indictment nor presented to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 1276. At re-sentencing, the district court found that, although only 158 grams of cocaine and 55 grams of crack cocaine (or the equivalent of 1,131 kilograms of marijuana) were seized from Allen\u2019s residence, he should be held accountable, as a result of his leadership role, for the quantity of drugs distributed by the other members of the conspiracy, which it calculated as 3,000 kg of marijuana equivalent. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>92 Fed.Appx. 781, slip op. at 6 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cAllen II\u201d). </em>It sentenced Allen to concurrent sentences of 235 months on one count and 60 months on another count. <em>Id. </em>at-, slip op. at 2; R5 at 40-41. Following re-sentencing, Allen again appealed and we affirmed. <em>Allen II </em>at-,-, slip op. at 1, 8. On appeal, Allen had again argued that the district court erred by making findings of fact regarding Allen\u2019s accountability for a particular quantity of drugs. <em>Id. </em>at-- -, slip op. at 4-5. We found that the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous because its approximation as to the quantity of drugs was \u201creasonably fair, accurate, and conservative, and not merely speculative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-- \u2014-, slip op. at 6-7 (citation and internal punctuation omitted). The Supreme Court vacated our prior judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">After remand, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs providing the court with: (1) a description of when, where, and how the <em>Booker </em>issue was first raised; and (2) any arguments about whether and how the <em>Booker </em>decision applies in this case and what action should be taken. In supplemental briefing, Allen argues that the district court erred by sentencing him based on fact-finding about both the type and quantity of the drugs to which Allen was held accountable and regarding Allen\u2019s possession of a firearm. The government concedes that the district court erred by sentencing Allen under a mandatory guidelines scheme and to a sentence which exceeded the maximum au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>thorized by jury fact-finding. It also concedes that Allen raised a constitutional error issue under <em>Apprendi </em>on appeal and at re-sentencing and is thus entitled to a harmless-error review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">There are two types of <em>Booker </em>error-(l) a \u201cconstitutional\u201d error of imposing a sentence enhancement based upon a judicial finding that goes beyond the facts admitted by a defendant or found by a jury, and (2) a \u201cstatutory\u201d error of imposing a sentence under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). We review the constitutional error <em>de novo </em>and, unless the government can demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, will reverse and remand. <em>United, States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Under the harmless-analysis, the government must show that the constitutional sentencing error neither contributed to the defendant\u2019s sentence nor otherwise affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 948. \u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation and quotation omitted). In reviewing the district court\u2019s mandatory use of the guidelines, the government is unable to meet its burden to show harmlessness or no effect on substantial rights if the record does not indicate whether or not the district court would have sentenced the defendant the same under an advisory sentencing scheme. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir. May 4, 2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Allen\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court enhanced his sentence, under a mandatory guidelines system, based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by Allen. The district court increased Allen\u2019s sentence based on facts which were neither found by the jury nor admitted by Allen regarding the quantity of drugs involved in Allen\u2019s conviction and regarding his possession of a weapon. The district court also sentenced Allen under a mandatory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The government cannot meet its burden. Although we have previously held that the district court\u2019s factual finding regarding the quantity of drugs was based on a \u201c \u2018reasonably fair, accurate, and conservative, and not merely speculative\u2019 \u201d approximation, <em>Allen II, </em>at---, slip op. at 7-8 (citation and internal punctuation omitted), in light of <em>Booker, </em>that finding is no longer appropriate. Because the district court cannot enhance Allen\u2019s sentence based solely on a judicially-found fact pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>suant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, it cannot consider factors not found by the jury. Specifically, because the jury found Allen guilty of offenses involving only cocaine and marijuana, the district court cannot enhance Allen\u2019s sentence for his involvement with cocaine base. Further, we do not know how the district court would have sentenced Allen if it had treated the guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory and if it had considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>the district court violated Allen\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based solely on judicially found facts pursuant to a mandatory, rather than advisory, sentencing scheme. We, therefore, REVERSE and REMAND for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-5\">. As we noted in <em>Allen I, </em>although <em>Apprendi </em>had not been filed at the time of the initial sentencing, the district court was aware of decisions from other circuits which had addressed sentencing issues arising from a conspiracy involving multiple controlled substances, no special verdict as to the various substances, and differing maximum sentences based on the quantity of drugs for each substance. <em>See Allen I, </em>302 F.3d at 1267-68. In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we conducted a plain error review and determined that Allen\u2019s sentence should be properly limited to the statutory maximum for the quantity of drugs that was \"essentially uncontroverted\u201d and supported by \"overwhelming\u201d evidence. <em>Allen I, </em>302 F.3d at 1278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">An issued raised under <em>Apprendi </em>raises by extension an issue pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>397 F.3d 1330, 1331 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
