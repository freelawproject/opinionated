Alvarenga\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging Alvarenga\u2019s sentence but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Alvarenga was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Alvarenga\u2019s counsel raises as a potential issue whether, in light of <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>-U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), an information alleging a specific quantity of drugs may support a base offense level based upon that amount where the indictment did not charge a specific quantity of methamphetamine and the plea agreement did not refer to the information. In sentencing Alvarenga, the district court relied on the amount of drugs to which she stipulated and not on the higher amount set forth in the information. Moreover, our review of the record leads us to conclude that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred in this case because Alvarenga\u2019s seventy-eight-month sentence is less than the applicable sentencing guideline range calculated in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300-01 &amp; n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Alvarenga\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
