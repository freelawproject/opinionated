We will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">Chaudhry claims that the immigration judge\u2019s consideration of a signed statement from a police officer, who was not present to be cross-examined, violated his due process rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review \u201clegal issues, including claims of due process violations, de novo.\u201d <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 278 (4th Cir.2004). In an immigration context, admissibility of evidence is governed by \u201cwhether the evidence is probative and whether its use is fundamentally fair____\u201d <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>325 F.3d 396, 405 (3d Cir.2003) (quotations and citations omitted). Fairness is determined by whether the evidence is trustworthy and rehable. <em>Id. </em>Having reviewed the evidence in question, we conclude that the evidence at issue here was clearly probative, and its use was not fundamentally unfair. Therefore, its admission did not constitute a denial of due process. We reject Chaudhry\u2019s challenges <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the immigration judge\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>of asylum, finding that the decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-17\">.
