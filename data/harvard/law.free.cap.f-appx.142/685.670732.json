Jimenez appeals, claiming that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act were violated, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the district court erred at sentencing in determining the amount of drugs attributable to him and in increasing his offense level for his role in offense. Jimenez also contends that his sentence must be vacated under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court, treating the United States Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, impermissibly applied certain offense-level enhancements based on judge-found facts. Because we conclude that re-sentencing is warranted under <em>Booker, </em>we need not address Jimenez\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines provisions. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 556 n. 15 (4th Cir.2005). For the reasons that follow, we affirm Jimenez\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Jimenez first argues that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act (STA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 (2000), were violated because his trial failed to commence within seventy days of his first court appearance. The time that Jimenez\u2019s co-defendant\u2019s motions for continuance were pending is excluded from the STA computation for all defendants in the same action. 18 U.S.C. 3161(h)(1)(F); <em>United States v. Jarrell, </em>147 F.3d 315, 316 (4th Cir.1998). In addition, the list of periods of delay that are excluded for purposes of speedy trial calculations includes \u201c[a]ny period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant ... if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\u201d \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). Here, in both orders granting the motions for continuance, the district court specifically found that \u201cthe ends of justice served by the granting of a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial.\u201d Therefore, we find that Jimenez\u2019s rights under the Speedy Trial Act were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Next, Jimenez asserts that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 854 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), established the following. In the Spring of 1999, the RUSH Drug Task Force, comprised of the Harrisonburg Police Department, Rockingham County Sheriffs Department, the Virginia State Police, and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, uncovered a large cocaine trafficking conspiracy operating in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Jimenez was one of the leaders of a group of crack distributors in and around Harrisonburg, Virginia, who called themselves \u201cthe boys.\u201d Sergeant Shane Brown of the Harrisonburg Police Department testified that, as part of an investigation into organized drug trafficking in Harrisonburg, he supervised three controlled purchases of crack cocaine from Jimenez in 2000 and 2001. Pedro Guerrero testified that he served as a \u201crunner\u201d for Jimenez beginning in 2000. According to Guerrero, Jimenez traveled to New York \u201cevery two weeks\u201d to purchase powder cocaine which he would \u201ccook\u201d into crack upon his return to Harrisonburg. Guerrero accompanied Jimenez to New York \u201cat least twice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Robinson de la Cruz testified that he sold crack for Jimenez and accompanied Jimenez to New York to purchase cocaine \u201ca few times.\u201d De la Cruz stated that Jimenez would purchase \u201cmaybe an ounce at most\u201d on his trips to New York. De la Cruz stated that Izelle Frye (\u201cZeek\u201d) worked for Jimenez, selling crack out of an Economy Inn. Mike Eshbaugh testified that he purchased crack from Jimenez \u201c500, 1,000\u201d times and that Jimenez was part of a group of individuals \u2014 including several named co-conspirators \u2014 from whom he routinely purchased crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">We find that this evidence sufficiently established each of the elements necessary to support Jimenez\u2019s conviction for conspiring to distribute crack cocaine. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 857. As to Jimenez\u2019s argument challenging the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses, it is well established that the question of witness credibility is within the sole province of the jury and not susceptible to review. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Moreover, the potential biases of each of the Government\u2019s witnesses were fully explored during direct and cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Finally, Jimenez challenges his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>At sentencing, the district court attributed 12 kilograms of crack cocaine to Jimenez, resulting in a base offense level of 38. The court also gave Jimenez a four-level enhancement for his role in the offense, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Based on a total offense level of 46<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a criminal history category of I, the resulting guideline range was life imprisonment, which the court imposed. In contrast, the base offense level for the amount of crack charged in the indictment (fifty grams) would have been 32; without applying any other enhancements, Jimenez\u2019s guideline range would have been 97-121 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Although Jimenez did not raise a Sixth Amendment challenge at sentencing, this court has held that a mandatory enhancement based on judicial factfinding sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ported by a preponderance of the evidence constitutes plain error warranting correction. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>we find that the district court plainly erred in sentencing Jimenez.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Hughes. </em>In light of this disposition, we deny Jimenez\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">. The district court riso applied a two-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2D 1.1 (b)(1) based on its finding that Jimenez traded crack for a handgun on three occasions and also a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Jimenez does not challenge these enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-17\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \u201d[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Jimenez\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \u201cthe law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
