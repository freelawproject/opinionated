He argues that in answering a question from the jury, the district court erred in instructing the jury concerning the Government\u2019s burden of proof to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Gross actually or constructively possessed the firearm. Gross identified one statement by the district court which he concedes was \u201ctechnically correct\u201d but argues that it was \u201chorribly misleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Because Gross did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United, States v. Harris, </em>104 F.3d 1465, 1471-72 (5th Cir.1997). Under the plain-error standard of review, \u201creversal is not required unless there is (1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000). Error in a jury instruction is plain \u201conly when, considering the entire charge and evidence presented against the defendant, there is a likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. McClatchy, </em>249 F.3d 348, 357 (5th Cir.2001)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The district court gave standard jury instructions concerning the Government\u2019s burden of proof and the definitions of actual and constructive possession, as well as sole and joint possession. As Gross concedes, the district court\u2019s jury instructions as a whole were correct statements of the law. Gross has not shown that the district court\u2019s single statement, even if misleading, constituted plain error as he has not shown that \u201cthere is a likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See McClatchy, </em>249 F.3d at 357 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
