Reversible error exists; we vacate Cowan\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court opinions in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-23\">At trial and at sentencing, the government produced evidence showing (1) that Cowan possessed a handgun that he bought from Patricia Biederman, (2) that law enforcement found drug paraphernalia in the same room where they arrested Cowan and found the gun, (3) that the residence was used for drug trafficking, and (4) that Cowan tried after his arrest to convince Biederman to testify that the gun was hers and that she merely had left it at Cowan\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-24\">The probation officer (PO) recommended a base offense level of 20, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The PO then recommended (1) a four-level increase for Cowan\u2019s use of the firearm in connection with another felony offense, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and (2) a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, \u00a7 3C1.1, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Cowan had attempted to influence Biederman\u2019s testimony. The total offense level of 26, combined with a criminal history category V, resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. But because the statutory maximum sentence for Cowan\u2019s conviction was 120 months, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), Cowan\u2019s guideline range was 110 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, under \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Cowan challenged the fact basis for his sentencing enhancements. Cowan also objected based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He claimed that his constitutional right to a have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts essential to his sentence was violated: the facts used to enhance his sentence were not charged in the indictment, admitted by him, or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The district court overruled Cowan\u2019s sentencing objections. In rejecting Co-wan\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>challenge, the court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZAz\">Regardless of whether I personally feel like the <em>Blakely </em>decision applies to the guidelines, it is my duty to follow the guidelines because those guidelines, based on the current status of the law, are and have been held to be constitutional, and until the Supreme Court or the Eleventh Circuit declares otherwise, it is my obligation to follow those guidelines based on that law and that is what I intend to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The government then requested the district court to announce alternate sentences: one under the guidelines, and another assuming that the guidelines were not binding. The district court responded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVG\">I will not do that. And the reason I don\u2019t want to do that ... is I don\u2019t know what ... guidance we\u2019ll receive from the Eleventh Circuit or the Supreme Court as to whether there will be some other form of determina[te]-type sentencing or whether it will be strictly indeterminate or whether we should use the guidelines as a guide. I guess there are just to many unknown variables for me to do that at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The district court then sentenced Cowan to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">On appeal, Cowan reiterates his argument that the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancements violated his constitutional rights under Blakely.<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cowan timely raised his constitutional objection. We review this issue <em>de novo; </em>but we will not reverse the district court if the government shows that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">We have stated that under <em>Booker </em>\u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d- (2005). Cowan\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory guidelines system, based on facts found by the judge and not admitted by him: <em>Booker </em>indicates that Cowan\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was violated. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269,1270 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">And the government has failed to show \u201cthat the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to [Cowanj\u2019s sentence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 1271. Here, the district court refused to state an alternate sentence if the guidelines were not binding: the court pointed to the lack of guidance from the Supreme Court and from this Court at the time it imposed sentence. In other words, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory....\u201d <em>Id., but see United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2005) (determining that government showed <em>Booker </em>error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where district court expressly stated that sentence imposed would be the same even if the guidelines were advisory).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Cowan\u2019s sentence erroneously was based in part on extra-verdict enhancements under a mandatory guidelines system. And the government cannot meet its burden of showing that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Cowan must be resentenced under the advisory guidelines system: on remand, the district court, \u201cwhile not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 949 (quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We VACATE Cowan\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">. Cowan also challenges again the fact basis underlying the enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
