Chavez has timely appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Chavez argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. His challenge is directed solely to the element of alienage. The dispositive issue at trial was whether Chavez\u2019 mother had always retained the United States citizenship she acquired at birth from her father or whether she lost that citizenship and later naturalized by taking an oath of allegiance. It was undisputed at trial that Chavez\u2019 mother was granted a certificate of citizenship that was effective retroactively to the date of her birth. Chavez\u2019 trial witness opined, however, that the certificate of citizenship was erroneously issued and that immigration officials should have determined that Chavez\u2019 mother had naturalized. The jury was free to reject the opinion of Chavez\u2019 witness. Based on the certificate of citizenship granted to Chavez\u2019 mother, the fact that she never lived in the United States until 1966, and the absence of any evidence that Chavez ever filed a naturalization application, a rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Chavez is an alien. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 301(g); <em>United States v. Moser, </em>123 F.3d 813, 819 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. El-Zoubi, </em>993 F.2d 442, 445 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Chavez also challenges the district court\u2019s jury charge. He argues that the district court should have given his proffered instruction setting forth his interpretation of a Supreme Court case. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the proffered instruction because Chavez was able to argue his interpretation of the case to the jury. <em>See United States v. Tovias-Marroquin, </em>218 F.3d 455, 457. Chavez\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s instruction on the law contained at INA \u00a7 301(g) is made on a different basis here than it was in the district court. Thus, it is reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>252 F.3d 411, 415 (5th Cir.2001). There was no such error, however, because the explication of INA \u00a7 301(g) was necessary in light of the district court\u2019s charge as a whole. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>105 F.3d 956, 967 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Allred, </em>867 F.2d 856, 868 (5th Cir.1989). Nor has Chavez shown that the district court erred in responding to questions from the jury while deliberating. <em>See United States v. Mann, </em>161 F.3d 840, 864 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Chavez challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Given the deferential standard which applies and our review of the record, we cannot that the district court erred in denying Chavez\u2019 request based upon its finding that the issue of alienage in this case was a factual one. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>42 F.3d 906, 913 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Finally, Chavez argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he raises the issue to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
