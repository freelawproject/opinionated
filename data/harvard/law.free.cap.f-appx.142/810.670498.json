He argues that the sentence enhancing provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional. This argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536-43. This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-21\">Orta argues that under <em>Blakely, </em>the enhancement of his sentence based on his prior conviction was error. In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of facts ... <em>admitted to by the defendant.\u201d Blakely, 124 </em>S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original). However, <em>Booker </em>reaffirmed the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that prior convictions are excluded from the facts that must be admitted or submitted to the jury. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Thus, Orta\u2019s sentence was not affected by a Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Orta argues that because his sentence was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional, mandatory guidelines system, it is unconstitutional and should be vacated. This is the type of error that was experienced by the other respondent in <em>Booker, </em>Ducan Fanfan. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69; <em>see also United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). Because Orta did not raise this issue below, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The \u201cFanfan\u201d error was plain, meeting the first two prongs of the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. MartinezLugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005). In order to show that the error meets the third prong and affected his substantial rights, he must show that it affected the outcome of the proceedings in the district court. <em>Id. </em>The error was not structural and prejudice is not otherwise presumed. <em>See id.; United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Orta cannot show that he was prejudiced by the error because the district court sentenced him at the midpoint in the guidelines range and nothing in the sentencing transcript indicates that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence if it knew that the guidelines were not mandatory. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
