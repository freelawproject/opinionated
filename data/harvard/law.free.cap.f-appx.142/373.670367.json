On appeal, Taylor challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims, as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">We review the district court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo, </em>accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and construing facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Harper v. Thomas, </em>988 F.2d 101, 103 (11th Cir.1993). A complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022-23 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">In order to succeed on a \u00a7 1983 claim, \u201ca plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right <em>by a person </em>acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). According to <em>Will v. Mich. Dept. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 67, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2310, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the State is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. The Eleventh Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XI. The Eleventh Amendment bars suit against a State brought by the State\u2019s own citizens. <em>McClendon v. Ga. Dept. of Cmty. Health, </em>261 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2001). Moreover, state agencies share the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as do States. <em>See Fouche v. Jekyll Islandr-State Park Auth., </em>713 F.2d 1518, 1520-23 (11th Cir.1983). Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit against a non-consenting State and its agencies. <em>Vt. Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens, </em>529 U.S. 765, 778,120 S.Ct. 1858, 1865, 146 L.Ed.2d 836 (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Here, this case was brought against state agencies, which are not \u201cpersons\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 1983 and which enjoy the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as does the State of Georgia. We are unpersuaded by Taylor\u2019s general equity-based arguments for why the Eleventh Amendment should not apply here. He also has not shown how the agencies qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d for \u00a7 1983 purposes. In short, because the state agencies did not waive their immunity or consent to suit and Congress did not abrogate state immunity, they are immune from suit based upon the Eleventh Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\">. This case does not present a situation where the State has consented to suit or waived its immunity, <em>cf. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v.
