Reece does not challenge his conviction on appeal. Reece\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, yet objecting to his criminal history category under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) . Reece, by counsel, also filed a supplemental brief in which he argued that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , the district court erred by sentencing him under the mandatory guidelines. Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm Reece\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-25\">Reece first contends that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court erroneously calculated his criminal history score, as the court had to make factual findings beyond the mere fact of conviction. In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). While we have recognized that not all prior convictions fall within the <em>Apprendi </em>exception framework, <em>see United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 842-43 (4th Cir.2005), because they may require attendant, impermissible fact-finding by the district court, such concerns are inapplicable in this case because none of the facts underlying the district court\u2019s assessment of Reece\u2019s criminal history points were disputed. We therefore find that the district court\u2019s assessment of criminal history points did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Reece also maintains that even if the district court did not err in calculating his criminal history category, it erred in failing to treat the guidelines as advisory. Because this issue was not raised before the district court, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this standard, although Reece is correct that the district court committed error in treating the guidelines as mandatory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48, he is not entitled to relief. We recently held that in a plain error context, the error of sentencing under the mandatory guidelines regime did not warrant a presumption of prejudice nor was it a structural error. <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 224 (4th Cir.2005). As nothing in the record suggests the error affected the court\u2019s ultimate determination of Reece\u2019s sentence, Reece cannot satisfy the prejudice requirement of the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Reece\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">. Reece maintains that this issue was properly preserved based on his <em>Blakely </em>objection that was raised before the district court. We find, however, that Reece's objection was narrowly tailored to the calculation of his criminal history category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-19\">. Although <em>Booker </em>establishes that the district court erred by treating the guidelines as mandatory, we note that the court followed the law in effect at the time of Reece's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
