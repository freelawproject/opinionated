Complaining of severe pain, she had surgery fusing several cervical vertebrae. The surgery, however, did not abate her complaints. An ALJ denied Morgan\u2019s application for Social Security benefits, and the district court affirmed. Morgan now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">We conclude that because of faulty hypothetical questions the ALJ posed to the vocational expert, the record lacks substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that jobs exist in the national economy for someone with Morgan\u2019s impairments. We therefore vacate and remand the district court\u2019s order with instructions to vacate and remand the ALJ\u2019s order. On remand, the ALJ must reevaluate Morgan\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC), and accept such additional testimony as may be necessary to decide whether relevant jobs exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Because, however, the ALJ\u2019s errors, if any, with respect to the application of the treating physician rule were harmless, and the ALJ\u2019s decisions discrediting Morgan\u2019s allegations and the responses of Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter were supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ need not reevaluate his decision on these matters on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Morgan was employed as a cashier at a convenience store in Aiken, South Carolina. In March 2000, she hurt her back scanning a twelve-pack at work. She visited Dr. Douglas Holford, an orthopedic surgeon, who, in April 2000, performed surgery on Morgan removing two discs and fusing three cervical vertebrae. Under Dr. Holford\u2019s care, Morgan returned to light-duty, part-time work. In August 2000, Morgan began complaining of pain in her lower back and legs, and Dr. Holford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>first impression was that the pain was caused by degenerative disc disease and sciatica. Nevertheless, Dr. Holford authorized her to increase to moderate-duty, full-time work.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Morgan continued complaining of pain, and in January 2001, Dr. Holford referred Morgan to Dr. William Kirkley, an orthopedist, for testing. Dr. Kirkley concluded from the tests results that Morgan\u2019s pain was \u201csubjective,\u201d (R. at 171), and was not caused by her underlying condition. In February 2001, Morgan quit her job. Dr. Holford later ordered a Functional Capacity Exam (FCE) to test Morgan\u2019s functional restrictions. The FCE indicated that although Morgan\u2019s functional ability was limited, she could nevertheless work an eight-hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">On March 20, 2001, Morgan filed applications for Social Security benefits. At the hearing on Morgan\u2019s claim, the ALJ admitted evidence as to the scope of Morgan\u2019s impairment. The most salient pieces of evidence were the FCE, Drs. Holford\u2019s and Kirkley\u2019s reports, Morgan\u2019s testimony, and written responses to questionnaires completed by Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter. The ALJ also accepted testimony from a vocational expert, who testified regarding the availability of jobs in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">After weighing this evidence, the ALJ denied Morgan\u2019s claim. The Appeals Counsel affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, as did the district court. Morgan now appeals, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Morgan argues that: (1) the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was insufficient evidence on which the ALJ could conclude the national economy had jobs for someone with her functional restrictions; (2) the ALJ improperly applied the treating physician rule in discrediting the opinion of Dr. Holford; (3) the record lacked substantial evidence upon which the ALJ could discredit her allegations of disabling pain; and (4) the ALJ erred in rejecting the written questionnaire responses submitted by Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter regarding her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">We must uphold the ALJ\u2019s factual findings \u201cif they are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standard.\u201d <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d <em>585, 589 </em>(4th Cir.1996). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). \u201cIt consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Laws v. Celebrezze, </em>368 F.2d 640, 642 (4th Cir.1966). \u201cIn reviewing for substantial evidence, we do not ... reweigh conflicting evidence, make credibility determinations, or substitute\u201d the ALJ\u2019s judgment with our own. <em>Craig, </em>76 F.3d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">With these principles in mind, we address Morgan\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">A. The Vocational Expert\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">Morgan first argues that her FCE reveals that her functional capacity is more limited than the hypothetical the ALJ posed to the vocational expert, and that this fact resulted in the record lacking any relevant evidence on the question of whether she could engage in work that exists in the national economy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">The parties concede that the ALJ properly resolved the first four steps of the Social Security Administration\u2019s five-step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>sequential evaluation process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fifth step, however, is in dispute. The claimant is disabled at the fifth step if the ALJ determines that the claimant cannot \u201cengage in any ... kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (West 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">To decide whether the claimant is disabled under this standard, the ALJ must proceed in a two-tiered analysis. The ALJ must first determine the claimant\u2019s RFC. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), (e) (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cRFC is an assessment of the individual\u2019s ability to do sustained work-related physical and mental activities in a work setting on a regular and continuing basis.\u201d Social Security Ruling (SSR) 96-8p at *1. To determine the claimant\u2019s RFC, the ALJ must consider the relevant medical evidence and other evidence of the claimant\u2019s condition in the record, including testimony from the claimant and family members. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">The ALJ must then decide the ultimate issue of whether the Commissioner has satisfied her burden of showing that the claimant can engage in a job that \u201cexist[s] in significant numbers in the national economy.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(c)(1) (2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(c)(2) (providing that the Commissioner bears the burden at the second tier of step five); <em>Wilson v. Heckler, </em>743 F.2d 218, 220 (4th Cir.1984) (same). In deciding whether the Commissioner has met her burden, the ALJ generally must accept evidence from a vocational expert, who, based on the claimant\u2019s age, education, work experience, and RFC, testifies whether there are jobs for such a person in the national economy. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g)(1). The Commissioner can show that the claimant is not disabled only if the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that jobs exist in the national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>economy is in response to questions from the ALJ that accurately reflect the claimant\u2019s work-related abilities. <em>See Walker v. Bowen, </em>889 F.2d 47, 50 (4th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In this case, after considering the evidence presented, the ALJ relied primarily on the FCE in deciding Morgan\u2019s RFC. (R. at 15 (\u201cI give greater weight to the results of actual testing[, <em>i.e., </em>the FCE,] than I do the opinion of Dr. Holford, especially in light of Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion.\u201d).) The FCE determined, in relevant part, that Morgan was not able to do full time \u201csedentary\u201d work, but she could work a full 8-hour day only if the job required her to sit, stand, walk, or climb each for no more than % of the day, or, in other words, she could do each activity for no more than 2 hours and 40 minutes per day. In determining Morgan\u2019s RFC, however, the ALJ found that Morgan was not able to do full-time \u201csedentary\u201d work, but she could work a full 8-hour day at a \u201csedentary\u201d job if the job also allowed her to have a \u201csit/ stand option.\u201d (R. at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Morgan contends that the FCE\u2019s sit, stand, walk, or climb combination is more restrictive than the RFC\u2019s \u201csit/stand option.\u201d We agree. Whatever a \u201csit/stand option\u201d is, it provides only for sitting and standing, and, even interpreted in the manner most consistent with the FCE, it still provides that Morgan may sit or stand for of an 8-hour day, or 4 hours. The \u201csit/stand option\u201d would therefore require Morgan to sit and stand significantly longer than the restrictions indicated by the FCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The ALJ\u2019s error with respect to Morgan\u2019s RFC, moreover, translated into deficient hypotheticals the ALJ posed to the vocational expert. Each of the ALJ\u2019s hypotheticals assumed that Morgan could work a full eight-hour day alternating sitting and standing. (R. at 56-57.) According to the FCE, however, Morgan must also have the ability to walk or climb for J\u00e9 of the day in order to complete a full eight-hour workday. The vocational expert\u2019s testimony that the national economy has a significant number of jobs for an employee who is able to work a full eight-hour day alternating sitting and standing was therefore incapable of producing a reliable assessment of relevant work opportunities for Morgan. <em>See Walker, </em>889 F.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">B. Dr. Holford\u2019s Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Morgan next argues that the ALJ erred in failing to credit the opinions of Dr. Holford under the treating-physician rule. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the FCE was substantial evidentiary support for the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Dr. Holford\u2019s <em>legal conclusions </em>and that even if the ALJ erred in rejecting what we will assume is Dr. Holford\u2019s <em>medical opinion, </em>such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">The Code of Federal Regulations draws a distinction between a physician\u2019s medical opinions and his legal conclusions. \u201cMedical opinions are statements from physicians ... that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of [the claimant\u2019s] impairments), including ... symptoms, diagnosis and prognosis, what [the claimant] can still do despite impairments), ... and [the claimant\u2019s] physical or mental restrictions.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(a)(2) (2004). Legal conclusions, on the other hand, are opinions on issues reserved to the ALJ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>such as \u201cstatements[s] by a medical source that [the claimant is] \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work.\u2019\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). While the ALJ must give a treating physician\u2019s <em>medical opinions </em>special weight in certain circumstances, <em>Craig, </em>76 F.3d at 590 (holding that a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion must be given controlling weight only when it \u201cis well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence\u201d in the record (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2))), the ALJ is under no obligation to give a treating physician\u2019s <em>legal conclusions </em>any heightened evidentiary value. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(3) (\u201cWe will not give any special significance to ... [a treating physician\u2019s legal conclusions]____\u201d). The ALJ is not free, however, simply to ignore a treating physician\u2019s legal conclusions, but must instead \u201cevaluate all the evidence in the case record to determine the extent to which the [treating physician\u2019s legal conclusion] is supported by the record.\u201d SSR 96-5p at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In her brief, Morgan points to four opinions given by Dr. Holford: (1) \u201cshe probably qualifies for disability,\u201d (R. at 293); (2) \u201c[h]er functional capacity evaluation basically figures that she can\u2019t work a total of an 8 hour day,\u201d (R. at 292); (3) \u201c[s]he can possibly do modified duty [from her cashier job] but it would probably be a 4 hour day,\u201d (R. at 293.); and (4) \u201cit would be hard [for her] to sit or stand for a 5 hour day.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (R. at 317.) The ALJ discredited Dr. Holford\u2019s opinions, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">statements that a claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d, \u201cunable to work,\u201d can or cannot perform a past job ... or the like are not medical opinions but are administrative findings dispositive of a case, requiring familiarity with the [Code of Federal Regulations] and legal standards set forth therein. Such issues are reserved to the Commissioner.... Opinions on issues reserved to the Commissioner, such as [those] of Dr. Holford, can never be entitled to controlling weight.... I give greater weight to the results of actual testing[, <em>ie., </em>the FCE,] than I do the opinion of Dr. Holford.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">(R. at 15.) The ALJ did not err in concluding that at least the first three of Dr. Holford\u2019s opinions were legal conclusions and were thus deserving of no special weight. Dr. Holford\u2019s first two opinions\u2014 that Morgan was \u201cdisabled\u201d and that she \u201ccan\u2019t work\u201d an 8 hour day \u2014 are clearly legal conclusions. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). Dr. Holford\u2019s third opinion is also a legal conclusion: an opinion that Morgan cannot complete the duties of her previous job is merely a legal conclusion on an issue reserved for the ALJ at the fourth step of the sequential evaluation process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv) (\u201cAt the fourth step ----[i]f you can still do your past relevant work, we will find that you are not disabled.\u201d). Moreover, the FCE was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit these legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">It is a closer question whether Dr. Holford\u2019s fourth opinion \u2014 that \u201cit would be hard [for Morgan] to sit or stand for a 5 hour day\u201d \u2014 is a medical opinion. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>assuming, however, that this opinion is a medical opinion due special weight under the treating-physician rule, any error in failing to credit this opinion was harmless. The ALJ attempted to adopt the FCE in determining Morgan\u2019s RFC. As Morgan herself recognizes, however, the FCE does not materially contradict Dr. Holford\u2019s (assumed) medical opinion. Dr. Holford\u2019s opinion was that Morgan would have difficulty sitting and standing for more than 5 hours. Nothing in his opinion is meaningfully contradicted by the FCE\u2019s determination that Morgan could not sit and stand for more than <em>% </em>of an 8-hour day, or 5 hours and 20 minutes, but that she could <em>also </em>walk or climb the remainder of the 8-hour workday. Any error the ALJ may have made in rejecting Dr. Holford\u2019s medical opinion, which provided essentially the same time restriction on sitting and standing as the FCE, was therefore harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 190 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cWhile the general rule is that an administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained, reversal is not required where the alleged error clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of the decision reached.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">C. Morgan\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Morgan also argues that the sources on which the ALJ relied to discredit her own testimony regarding the disabling nature of her pain were not substantial evidence. For the following reasons, we hold that the opinion of Dr. Kirkley and the FCE were substantial evidentiary support for the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Morgan\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">In evaluating claims of disabling pain, the ALJ must proceed in a two-part analysis. First, because pain alone, no matter how disabling, cannot create a \u201cdisability\u201d under the Social Security Act without an underlying medical condition that causes the pain, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant has produced medical evidence of a \u201cmedically determinable impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce .... the actual pain, in the amount and degree, alleged by the claimant.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>76 F.3d at 594 (emphasis added). It is important to note that while the claimant must introduce objective medical evidence of an impairment, the evidence must only demonstrate that the impairment reasonably <em>could be expected </em>to produce the pain alleged. <em>Id. </em>at 595. Second, if, and only if, the ALJ finds that the claimant has produced such evidence, the ALJ must then determine, as a matter of fact, whether the claimant\u2019s underlying impairment <em>actually </em>causes her alleged pain. Craig, 76 F.3d at 595. The ALJ need not find either that the claimant\u2019s pain is real, or, if he finds that it is real, that it is caused by her underlying medical condition if such findings are \u201cinconsistent with the available evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Here, the ALJ concluded that the objective evidence revealed that Morgan\u2019s medical condition could reasonably be expected to produce the pain she alleged, and thus analyzed whether her medical condition actually produced the allegedly disabling pain. In discrediting Morgan\u2019s allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>of pain, the ALJ relied on \u201c[Morgan\u2019s] activities, particularly her hobbies of needlepoint, crochet, etc.; the lack of frequent emergency room visits or hospitalizations for pain; the absence of significant side-effects attributable to medication, the results of [the FCE], and the opinions of Drs. Kirkley and Holford.\u201d (R. at 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Dr. Kirkley opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">[Morgan\u2019s] MRI really didn\u2019t show anything that I think would explain her symptoms.... I told her I could give her a note to be out of this work indefinitely because of complaints of pain but <em>strictly speaking and on an objective basis I can find no reason why she theoretically could not do the job. </em>It is true that people do have chronic pain and that it does sometimes keep an individual from being able to work. Unfortunately, the complaint is subjective....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">(R. at 171 (emphasis added).) Although Dr. Kirkley did not question Morgan\u2019s subjective experience of pain, he also believed that her pain was not caused by her underlying condition. The fact that Dr. Kirkley authorized Morgan\u2019s absence from work based on her complaints of pain in no way casts doubt on his belief that Morgan\u2019s condition did not produce her pain. And while it is true that Dr. Kirkley gave his opinion about the source of Morgan\u2019s pain more than a year before she gave her testimony, Morgan has pointed to no additional objective evidence submitted after Dr. Kirkley gave his opinion that would call his opinion into doubt by linking her pain with her underlying condition. Moreover, the FCE concluded that Morgan was able to work an entire 8-hour day. Because the FCE measures a claimant\u2019s functionality, which takes account of her pain, the FCE, like Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion, also contradicts Morgan\u2019s allegations of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We believe that, given Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion and the FCE, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Morgan\u2019s allegations of pain was supported by substantial evidence. Even assuming the ALJ erred in crediting the other evidence contradicting Morgan\u2019s allegations \u2014 her activities, her lack of hospitalizations, the absence of significant side-effects, and the opinion of Dr. Holford \u2014 this error was therefore harmless. <em>See Ngarurih, </em>371 F.3d at 190 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">D. Morgan\u2019s Husband\u2019s and Daughter\u2019s Responses to Questionnaires</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Finally, Morgan argues that the ALJ impermissibly discredited the questionnaire responses submitted by her husband and daughter on the basis of inherent familial bias. While we agree with Morgan\u2019s argument in principle, we would not reach the issue here, because the ALJ did not, in fact, discredit the observations of Morgan\u2019s family members solely because of inherent familial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">In the order denying Morgan\u2019s claim, the ALJ found, in part because of Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion and the FCE, that <em>\u201cthe allegations </em>of disabling pain ... [were not] credible.\u201d (R. at 16 (emphasis added).) The ALJ gave no indication that \u201cthe allegations\u201d of disabling pain to which he was referring were only Morgan\u2019s allegations, and not also the allegations of Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter. Indeed, the most natural reading of the indefinite article \u201cthe\u201d is that it refers to all, not just some, of the allegations of pain. We believe, therefore, that the ALJ discredited the questionnaire responses for the same reasons he rejected Morgan\u2019s own testimony; <em>i.e., </em>Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion that Morgan\u2019s underlying condition did not cause her pain and the FCE indicating that Morgan maintained the functional capacity to work an 8-hour day. And as we concluded with respect to Morgan\u2019s testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ny, any error the ALJ made in crediting the other evidence on which the ALJ relied \u2014 here, her activities, her lack of hospitalizations, the absence of significant side-effects, the opinion of Dr. Holford, <em>and </em>inherent familial bias \u2014 was harmless, because Dr. Kirkley\u2019s opinion and the FCE were substantial evidentiary support for the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Morgan\u2019s husband\u2019s and daughter\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We therefore vacate and remand the district court\u2019s order with instructions for the district court to vacate and remand the ALJ\u2019s order. On remand, the ALJ should, in a manner consistent with this opinion, redetermine Morgan\u2019s RFC and, if required, accept additional evidence to determine whether relevant jobs exist for Morgan in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\">.

Morgan challenges this, and I agree that it materially misapplies the Commissioner\u2019s regulations and is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The majority, instead, ignores the bulk of medical evidence Dr. Holford submitted and suggests that only a few select statements are at issue here. It then dismisses three of the four selected statements as legal opinions. This misses the forest for the trees: the record contains notes Dr. Holford submitted from some 19 visits, replete with medical impressions and opinions about Morgan\u2019s condition. The majority then claims that any remaining discounting of Dr. Holford\u2019s medical opinions was at best harmless error because it was similar to the FCE. This cannot be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">From the majority opinion one would never know the full range of medical evidence Dr. Holford submitted in this case. From his records in the district court transcript (\u201cTr.\u201d) we learn the following: After an emergency room visit and several examinations, on April 5, 2000 Dr. Holford found Morgan in \u201ca lot of pain\u201d and diagnosed her with a \u201cC5-6 disc and spondylolisthesis at C6-7,\u201d Tr. at 308. On April 18, 2000, he removed her C5-6 and C6-7 discs and fused her vertebrae from C5 through C7 with anterior plating. Dr. Holford prescribed medication and directed therapeutic exercises. By the end of May, he concluded that Morgan was doing \u201cfair\u201d and could return to light work in about four weeks. Tr. 303. Dr. Holford continued to see Morgan throughout that summer and prescribed medication and more exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Morgan\u2019s pain did not abate. In fact, after trying to grab an item that fell off of a shelf, she returned to the emergency room on June 17, 2000. She still performed light work, but complained of pain in her shoulders. On August 30, 2000, Dr. Holford noted that after squatting to stock a shelf at work, Morgan had developed lower back pain which radiated into her left leg. An x-ray revealed \u201cdegenerative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>changes of the lumbar spine, mainly at 3^4 and at the thoracal lumbar junction.\u201d Tr. 298. His impression was that Morgan suffered from sciatica and degenerative disc disease and he prescribed medication. On September 20, 2000 Dr. Holford felt that Morgan could gradually increase to working 40 hours per week with moderate duties. By late January of 2001, however, Morgan still complained bitterly of pain and tenderness in her back and neck. On January 30, 2001, Dr. Holford tested her range of motion and found \u201cdemonstrable weakness\u201d in several areas. Tr. 296. He ordered an MRI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 19, 2001, Dr. Holford noted that the MRI revealed multiple degenerative discs. Dr. Holford felt Morgan\u2019s job, which included \u201cbending and stooping while trying to protect her [surgically repaired] neck probably aggravated a pre-existing condition.\u201d Tr. 295. He set up more tests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">On March 20, 2001, Morgan returned to Dr. Holford, who reviewed the new tests, found Morgan with pain and tenderness in her back, diagnosed her with radiculopathy and axonal neuropathy, recommended epidural steroids, and kept her off of work. Dr. Holford stated that her \u201c[prognosis is guarded,\u201d Tr. 294, and noted that she may qualify for disability for neck and lumbar spine disease. The steroids evidently offered some short-term aid, but Morgan still experienced pain. By April 18, 2001, Dr. Holford found that Morgan had reached maximum medical improvement and had a \u201cpermanent impairment,\u201d but could possibly do \u201cmodified duty\u201d for a 4-hour day if it involved intermittent standing, sitting and twisting. Tr. 293.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Dr. Holford also recommended the FCE and, on August 15, 2001, reviewed it. He observed that she was \u201cup and down,\u201d Tr. 292, and noted that Morgan\u2019s FCE \u201cbasically figures that she can\u2019t work a total of an 8 hour day.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She can\u2019t work for more than 4 hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He thought that Morgan qualified for disability \u201cunder cervical and lumbar disc disease. She has an inability to sit, bend, stoop, or twist long enough to work in an 8 hour day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, on January 28, 2002, Dr. Holford again noted Morgan\u2019s back and neck pain and prescribed more medication. After a March 14, 2002 final evaluation, he indicated that Morgan \u201c[s]till hurts quite a bit[,]\u201d and had difficulty bending, stooping, twisting, straightening, and lifting. Tr. 317. He found that she had reached maximum medical improvement and that she would have difficulty sitting or standing for a five-hour day. He also stated that \u201cI think she qualifies for disability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">All this, of course, is significantly different from the conclusory assertions the majority selects and dismisses. Merely because Dr. Holford at one point made some legal conclusions does not, of course, poi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>son the many other medical opinions. And the striking picture painted by Dr. Holford\u2019s medical impressions and opinions simply cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">An examining physician\u2019s opinions are given more weight than the opinion of one who has not examined the claimant, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), and a treating physician\u2019s opinion is especially valuable because such doctors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aou\">are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of your medical impairments) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations, such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). This subsection of the regulations goes on to explain that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlW\">If we find that a treating source\u2019s opinion on the issue(s) of the nature and severity of your impairment(s) is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in your ease record, we will give it controlling weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\"><em>Id. </em>Even when a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not given \u201ccontrolling\u201d weight it can still receive much more weight than other classes of evidence: \u201cWhen the treating source has seen you a number of times and long enough to have obtained a longitudinal picture of your impairment, we will give the source\u2019s opinion more weight than we would give it if it were from a nontreating source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(I). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">the more knowledge a treating source has about your impairment(s) the more weight we will give to the source\u2019s medical opinion. We will look at the treatment the source has provided and at the kinds and extent of examinations and testing the source has performed or ordered from specialists and independent laboratories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(h); <em>see Mastro v. Apfel, </em>270 F.3d 171, 178 (4th Cir.2001) (explaining \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">In addition, \u00a7 404.1527(d)(3) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">The more a medical source presents relevant evidence to support an opinion, particularly medical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight we will give that opinion.... Furthermore, because nonexamining sources have no examining or treating relationship with you, the weight we will give their opinions will depend on the degree to which they provide supporting explanations for their opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-16\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight it deserves, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(4), and specialists operating in their field of specialty receive more weight than those of non-specialists. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Under these regulations, Dr. Holford surely stands alone as the source whose opinions should receive the greatest weight. He is a specialist, and his opinions are plainly based upon far more than mere recitations of subjective statements of pain: he conducted spinal surgery on Morgan, repeatedly and personally examined her and ordered, reviewed, and relied upon medical tests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He monitored Morgan\u2019s rehabilitation and prescribed pain medication for a significant period of time. Indeed, the record indicates that he saw her some 19 times \u2014 much more frequently during the time in question than any other person who submitted evidence outside of Morgan\u2019s immediate family. In short, here Dr. Holford is uniquely positioned to provide precisely the type of \u201cdetailed, longitudinal picture\u201d of Morgan\u2019s medical impairments that we must value highly. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). This long-term perspective is especially valuable in this kind of case, where a claimant proffers variable levels of pain from a severe impairment that could cause \u2014 but may not necessarily result in \u2014 debilitating, disabling pain. In such cases \u201csnapshot\u201d examinations are especially likely to mislead and \u201cmoving pictures\u201d provided from records of long-term treating relationships are especially probative. To the extent that his opinion differs from the FCE \u2014 a product of a single day\u2019s examination by a non-treating occupational therapist \u2014 the ALJ was exactly backwards; Holford\u2019s opinions must merit <em>more </em>weight.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Regarding the ALJ\u2019s discounting of Dr. Holford\u2019s medical opinions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the majority claims that any error was harmless because of the FCE, which the ALJ \u201cattempted to adopt.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at -. The majority\u2019s awkward phrasing reveals problematic reasoning and internal contradictions. The majority frankly admits that <em>the ALJ materially misinterpreted the FCE to Morgan\u2019s detriment. See ante </em>pp. ---.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is, the ALJ explicitly used the FCE to <em>discount </em>Dr. Holford\u2019s opinions (because, in supposed contrast, it involved \u201cactual testing\u201d), Tr. 15, while the majority finds it sufficiently <em>redundant </em>with Dr. Holford\u2019s \u201c(assumed)\u201d medical opinion to make discounting Dr. Holford\u2019s opinion harmless error. <em>Ante </em>at -. Both propositions cannot be concurrently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>right; in fact, both are quite wrong. The FCE\u2019s results do overlap to some extent with Dr. Holford\u2019s findings. But to the extent they are similar, the FCE is an entirely inadequate substitute for Dr. Holford\u2019s medical opinions. Thus it cannot be harmless error. Moreover, the ALJ did not view the two as similar, and so at a bare minimum the remand must be accompanied with instructions to construe the FCE as fully supporting Dr. Holford\u2019s opinions. To the extent the two differ, for the reasons I have explained above, the FCE cannot possibly trump Dr. Holford.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">I would thus grant the medical opinions submitted by Dr. Holford significant, appropriate deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The ALJ, while recognizing that \u201c[t]he medical evidence in this case does establish the existence of a medically determinable impairment which is capable of producing\u201d Morgan\u2019s symptoms, Tr. 15, nonetheless did not find Morgan\u2019s testimony of disabling pain and limited functional capacity credible. The explanation was based on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">[considering the claimant\u2019s activities, particularly her hobbies of needlepoint, crochet, etc.; the lack of frequent emergency room visits or hospitalizations for pain; the absence of significant side-effects attributable to medication, the results of formal functional capacities evaluation in June 2001, and the opinions of Drs. Kirkley and Holford.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Tr. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">This explanation reveals important errors and is not supported by substantial evidence. First, it is difficult to imagine more benign and gentle hobbies than the occasional practice of needlepoint and crochet. Morgan testified that her pain varied, and that she only engaged in her hobbies \u201cprobably 45 minutes\u201d on \u201ca real good day\u201d but never on a bad day. Tr. 51-52. Of course, a claimant need not be constantly bedridden or completely incapacitated to be found disabled. <em>See Trotten v. Califano, </em>624 F.2d 10, 11-12 (4th Cir.1980) (\u201cAn individual does not have to be totally helpless or bedridden in order to be found disabled under the Social Security Act, otherwise, the ability to perform substantial gainful activity even one day each month or each year would disqualify an individual for benefits.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>see also Waters v. Bowen, </em>709 F.Supp. 278, 284 (D.Mass.1989) (collecting cases where light housework and hobbies like crocheting did not disqualify claimants as disabled). Indeed, \u201cwhile a claimant must show by objective evidence the existence of an underlying impairment that could cause the pain alleged, 'there need not be objective evidence of the pain itself.\u2019\u201d <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d at 593 (citations omitted); see <em>also Walker v. Bowen, </em>889 F.2d 47, 49 (4th Cir.1989). Here, the ALJ\u2019s finding that needlepoint and crochet negate her testimony essentially requires Morgan to be consistently bedridden or proffer \u201cobjective evidence\u201d of pain; it also ignores the fact that Morgan presented objective test results which her primary treating physician found fully capable of producing her disabling pain. This is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Also, Morgan <em>was </em>admitted to the emergency room more than once, and it would be passing strange to penalize a claimant for having the good sense and good fortune to receive regular treatment through specialists instead of returning to the emergency room over and over. Further, I am frankly puzzled as to how a lack of side-effects from pain medication can discount Morgan\u2019s testimony that she is still in pain <em>despite </em>the medication. And, as the majority recognizes, <em>ante </em>at-- -, the FCE restricted Morgan by, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>example, stating that she could not sit or stand for more than $ of the workday-each.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The ALJ\u2019s statement that Dr. <em>Holford\u2019s </em>findings somehow support that Morgan is <em>not </em>disabled is simply incomprehensible; no reasonable reading of his submitted evidence, as detailed above in Part I.A, can claim this. If Dr. Holford\u2019s findings <em>did </em>contradict Morgan\u2019s claims, I must wonder why Morgan would argue for us to give them such great weight? Finally, Dr. Kirkley, whatever else he wrote, specifically signed a document indicating that Morgan was unable to work indefinitely and only encouraged her to work if she felt capable. For all of these reasons, I believe that the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Morgan\u2019s testimony is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s novel suggestion that the ALJ discounted the evidence submitted by Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter because of Dr. Kirkley and the FCE is unsustainable. The ALJ was crystal clear that the family members\u2019 testimony was \u201cviewed as biased\u201d and given little weight <em>simply because of their relationship to Morgan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Morgan\u2019s husband and daughter submitted questionnaires that indicated Morgan was able to engage in only the most limited of activities. Morgan\u2019s husband noted that she could not do things she likes to do, such as work in the yard and house or attend movies and rummage sales. He stated that Morgan cannot bend or lift, cannot sit or stand for any long period without pain, and experiences numbness that makes walking difficult. He wrote that he must help her complete basic tasks and sometimes must help her walk or stand up. Morgan\u2019s husband also explained that the pain has \u201ctaken away her independence. She was a very independent and active lady [and] that has all changed for her.... \u201d Tr. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Morgan\u2019s daughter echoed this assessment, writing that while her mother had previously been highly independent, she now \u201cis reliant on others to perform the smallest of duties,\u201d Tr. 132, and has difficulty standing, cooking, cleaning, getting things out of cabinets, and walking up stairs. She also wrote that Morgan cannot play -with her grandson or have him sit on her lap without pain and that she had to help her mother lay on the floor in the grocery store when her legs spasmed uncontrollably.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">In direct response to this evidence, the ALJ simply stated that: \u201c[a]s immediate family members, the claimant\u2019s husband and her daughter would be expected to support the claimant\u2019s effort to secure disability benefits. While I do not question the veracity of the claimant\u2019s husband or daughter, their statements are viewed as biased and I give them little weight.\u201d Tr. 16. In contrast to the majority\u2019s version of things, it is perfectly clear to me that <em>the ALJ offered no other reason for discounting this evidence </em>and then moved on to discuss Morgan\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>As with other recommendations, the magistrate judge rightly recognized that the ALJ\u2019s <em>per se </em>discounting of Morgan\u2019s family members\u2019 observations for bias was reversible error. Courts consistently and appropriately rely on the testimony of family members in the full range of matters. As one court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">Descriptions of friends and family members who were in a position to observe the claimant\u2019s symptoms and daily activities have been routinely accepted as competent evidence. <em>Sprague v. Bowen, </em>812 F.2d 1226, 1232 (9th Cir.1987); 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3). A disregard for such evidence violates the Commissioner\u2019s regulations about observations by nonmedical sources as to how an impairment affects a claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>Id. </em>When an ALJ fails to believe lay testimony about a claimant\u2019s allegations of pain or other symptoms, he should discuss the testimony specifically and make explicit credibility determinations. <em>Smith v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 312, 313 (8th Cir.1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Behymer v. Apfel, </em>45 F.Supp.2d 654, 663 (N.D.Ind.1999); <em>see also, e.g., Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1289 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe fact that a lay witness is a family member cannot be a ground for rejecting his or her testimony. To the contrary, testimony from lay witnesses who see the claimant every day is of particular value; such lay witnesses will often be family members.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Regennitter v. Comm, of the Social Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1298 (9th Cir.1999) (noting claimant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony, explaining that such lay testimony \u201cprovides an important source of information about a claimant\u2019s impairments, and an ALJ can reject it only by giving specific reasons germane to each witness.\u201d (citing <em>Smolen </em>)). As Morgan argues, if family members\u2019 evidence <em>was </em>automatically worthless, it would be an odd exercise in futility to even allow them to fill out questionnaires and submit them into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">For these reasons, I believe (1) Dr. Holford\u2019s medical opinions should receive greater weight, and the evidence submitted (2) by Mrs. Morgan and (3) her family deserves proper consideration. When all of Morgan\u2019s evidence is appropriately considered, the unavoidable conclusion is that the case should be remanded with instructions to award benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\">.

With regard to evaluating treating sources versus non-treating sources, this court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">\"[i]f we find that a treating source\u2019s opinion on the issue(s) of the nature and severity of [the] impairment(s) is well supported by medically acceptable <em>clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques </em>and is <em>not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence </em>in [the] case record, we will give it controlling weight.\u201d By negative implication, if a physician\u2019s opinion is not supported by clinical evidence or if it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence, it should be accorded significantly less weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-18\"><em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 590 (4th Cir. 1996) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) and 416.927(d)(2)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\">. The ALJ\u2019s implicit idea that Holford never administered \"actual testing\u201d during many examinations of Morgan flatly ignores the record. Dr. Holford conducted numerous physical exams, <em>see, e.g., </em>Tr. 296, 298, 310, 317, and reviewed neurological exams, 299, X-ray tests, Tr. 298, 300-02, 310, MRIs, Tr. 295, 304, and nerve-conduction tests, Tr. 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. Dr. Holford's medical opinions are also \"consistent with the record as a whole.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(4). Dr. Forsyth performed an MRI which revealed bulging lumbar disc material on multiple levels. Dr. Haas also diagnosed Morgan with SI radiculopathy, bilateral and early axonal neuropathy. While Dr. Kirkley did not believe that these tests provided an objective explanation and termed Morgan's lower back pain \"chronic mechanical,\u201d he also found Morgan's claims of pain sufficiently credible to remove her from work indefinitely. Moreover, Morgan testified that her pain had increased dramatically since she saw Kirkley over a year ago. Taken together, this all complicates Kirkley\u2019s brief note sufficiently that they simply cannot count as substantial evidence to trump Holford\u2019s medical opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b754-17\">. I freely agree that certain of Holford\u2019s opinion are legal opinions, which the ALJ need not accept uncritically. But I must reemphasize, in case it is not perfectly clear, that such opinions are few among many strongly supported medical opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b754-18\">. Indeed, the ALJ did not stop there but went on and, shall we say, \"attempted to\u201d wield the FCE to discredit both Morgan and (in the majority's mind, at least) her family members. See <em>ante </em>at pp.---.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">. More specifically, the FCE also stated that she could lift to her shoulders or carry, push, or pull only 8 pounds occasionally and 4 pounds frequently; it also noted that she could only lift overhead 3 pounds occasionally and 2 pounds frequently. Importantly, the FCE also reported that while Morgan could reach frequently, she could <em>never </em>bend, squat, kneel, or crawl and could not sit, stand, walk, or climb for more than 33% of a workday each. In response to Morgan's \"physical demand classification,\u201d the FCE listed \"no classification.\u201d Tr. 255. <em>With these restrictions explicitly noted, </em>the FCE found that Morgan\u2019s \"current work status\u201d was \"qualified full time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
