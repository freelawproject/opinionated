Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Our review of the Board\u2019s \u201casylum eligibility determination is most narrow ... [and] recognizes the respect we must accord the [Board\u2019s] expertise and its status as the Attorney General\u2019s designee in deportation decisions.\u201d <em>Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.2004) (alterations added). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We find there was no such compelling evidence. Accordingly, we will not reverse the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">We thus deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\"> This court will not review the Board's denial of Gidey\u2019s applications for withholding from removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture because Gidey did not raise specific issues with respect to those forms of relief in her brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
