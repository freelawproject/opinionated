Belton, Sr. seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s second amended order and judgment adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissing his civil action with prejudice as to two Defendants (the United States and Bonnie Franklin), and dismissing the complaint without prejudice as to the remaining Defendants. Finding no reversible error, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Belton v. Amos, </em>No. CA-03-3547-3 (D.S.C. Nov. 5, 2004; Nov. 12, 2004). <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 511(a), 7104, 7252, 7291, 7297 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254, 1296 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 17; <em>see generally Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). We deny Appellee Fairfield Manor Nursing Home\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal; even though the dismissal order was without prejudice as to this party, no amendment could cure the defect in Belton\u2019s complaint against Fairfield Manor Nursing Home. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed as to Fairfield Manor Nursing Home. We deny Belton\u2019s motions for sanctions and other relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
