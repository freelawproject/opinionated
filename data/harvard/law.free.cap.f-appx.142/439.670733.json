Because the district court did not er when it denied Okhiku\u2019s motion to suppress, and the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support his conviction for possession of stolen mail, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Okhiku and a codefendant were indicted and charged with possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices (count 1). Okhiku was also charged with using, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with intent to commit wire fraud (count 2). Okhiku moved to suppress evidence seized from his apartment. Based on the recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">After Okhiku\u2019s codefendant pleaded guilty, a superceding indictment added a third count and charged Okhiku with possession of stolen mail (count 3). Okhiku proceeded to trial, and, after the government rested, Okhiku moved for judgment of acquittal. The district court denied the motion, and Okhiku was convicted by a jury of counts 1 and 3 and acquitted of count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The district court sentenced Okhiku to 37 months of imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, followed by supervised release for 3 years. The court also ordered Okhiku to pay restitution in the amount of $8, 601.50 to the victims of his crimes. Okhiku appeals his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Okhiku makes two arguments on appeal. He first contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because he did not voluntarily consent to a search of his apartment. Okhiku also argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for possession of stolen mail. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">\n<em>A. Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Because \u201crulings on motions to suppress involve mixed questions of fact and law, the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, while that court\u2019s application of the law is subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>12 F.3d 1019, 1022 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, the court must construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Milcell, </em>102 F.3d 470, 474 (11th Cir.1996). The question we must consider is whether the district court clearly erred when it found that Okhiku voluntarily consented to the search of his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">Although \u201csearches undertaken without a warrant issued upon probable cause are <em>per se </em>unreasonable,\u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>835 F.2d 1406, 1408 (11th Cir. 1988) (quotations omitted), law enforcement officers may conduct a search without a warrant if they first obtain voluntary consent to the search. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>888 F.2d 795, 798 (11th Cir.1989). Voluntary consent is \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>890 F.2d 355, 360 (11th Cir.1989). To determine whether consent was freely given, this Court must scrutinize the facts and balance the suspect\u2019s right to be free from coercive conduct and the legitimate need of the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ernment to conduct lawful searches. <em>Id. </em>Although not dispositive, the following several factors are relevant in determining voluntariness: (1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status, (2) the presence of coercive police procedure, (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with police, (4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse to consent to the search, (5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence, and (6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found. <em>United States v. Chemaly, </em>741 F.2d 1346, 1352 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Exceptionally clear evidence is required to establish consent. <em>United States v. Lopez-Pages, </em>767 F.2d 776, 779 (11th Cir. 1985). The government bears the burden of proving both the existence of consent and that the consent was not a function of acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority, but was given freely and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>888 F.2d 795, 798 (11th Cir.1989). The government is not required to prove that the suspect was aware of the right to refuse consent. <em>Chemaly, </em>741 F.2d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">There are two reasons that the district court did not clearly err when it determined that Okhiku voluntarily consented to a search of his apartment. First, the magistrate judge found, and the district court agreed, that the testimony of the government agents that Okhiku verbally consented to the search of his apartment was more credible than Okhiku\u2019s version of the events. Such a credibility finding is within the province of the fact-finder. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). The testimony of both agents was substantially consistent, and both testified that they did not enter Okhiku\u2019s apartment or begin the search until Okhiku granted them oral permission to search. Nothing in the record undermines the veracity of the agents\u2019 testimony, other than Okhiku\u2019s self-serving recollection of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Second, the record suggests that there was nothing inherently coercive about the search. Although Okhiku alleged that he was placed in handcuffs when the agents searched his apartment, the district court found his testimony incredible. On the other hand, the credible testimony of the agents established that Okhiku was not touched or restrained in any way, and none of the officers unholstered their weapons. The record clearly supports the finding that the consent granted by Okhiku was the product of a free and unconstrained choice and not the result of allegedly coercive tactics employed by the law enforcement agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Okhiku concedes that mail addressed to persons other than himself was found in his apartment, but argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to show that the credit cards were stolen from the mail or that he knew the mail in his possession was stolen. Whether the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support the criminal conviction is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1084 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government and all reasonable inferences and credibility choices are made in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">To support a conviction for possession of stolen mail, \u201cthe evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) appellant possessed the items alleged to have been stolen from the mail; (2) the items were stolen from the mail; (3) appellant knew the items were stolen; and (4) appellant specifically intended to possess the items unlawfully.\u201d <em>United States v. Henry, </em>920 F.2d 875, 877 (11th Cir.1991). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cuse of the mails may be established, like most other facts, by circumstantial evidence, even if the jury might draw other reasonable inferences from the circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Okhiku argues that the government did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the items were stolen from the mail and that Okhiku knew that they were stolen. We disagree. The record shows that Okhiku possessed a significant amount of postal materials that were addressed to persons other than himself. His codefendant testified that Okhiku had access to all the mailboxes at the apartment complex and often retrieved mail that did not have his name on it. Based on this circumstantial evidence, the jury could have drawn a reasonable inference that the items found in Okhiku\u2019s possession were stolen from the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">As to whether Okhiku knew the mail was stolen, a \u201cjury is entitled to infer that, absent a satisfactory explanation, a person who possesses [mail] which has been recently stolen has knowledge of the stolen character.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>639 F.2d 268, 270 (5th Cir. Mar.12, 1981) (citation omitted). The quantity of postal evidence addressed to other individuals in Okhiku\u2019s apartment supports a conclusion that the mail was stolen and that Okhiku knew it was stolen. The jury could have drawn a reasonable inference that Okhiku knew the mail was stolen. The district court, therefore, did not err when it denied Okhiku\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Because the district court did not er when it denied Okhiku\u2019s motion to suppress, and the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support his conviction for possession of stolen mail, we affirm Okhiku\u2019s convictions for possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, and possession of stolen mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
