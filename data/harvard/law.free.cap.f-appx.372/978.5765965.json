On appeal, Howard argues that, during trial, her counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failure to argue that she could not conspire with herself, and that the jury instructions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>improper. Howard also argues that, at sentencing, her counsel was ineffective for failure to object to the district court\u2019s determination that she is a career offender based on prior convictions. Further, Howard contends that her sentence was unreasonable. Lastly, Howard attempts to show reversible error by making a number of other constitutional challenges. Upon review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted). A district court may not modify a previously imposed term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the United States Sentencing Commission. <em>Id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3582(c)(2). When determining whether to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court it is not permitted to resentence <em>de novo, </em>and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Howard argues that Amendment 706, which revised the Drug Quantity Table set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and reduces by two levels the offense level for crack cocaine offenses, affords her a reduced sentence. After review of the record, we find that Howard is not entitled to a sentence reduction. As a Career Offender, Howard was not sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1, but was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1. Therefore, we find that the district court did not err in holding Howard was not eligible for a sentence reduction and that Amendment 706 did not affect Howard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201cboth the district court and [this Court is] bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by [this Court] in a prior appeal of the same case unless (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (citation omitted). This Court has recognized the law-of-the-case doctrine in the context of \u00a7 3582(c) motions. <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1562 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">Howard\u2019s arguments that she is not a career offender and that her sentence is unreasonable are groundless. Howard has already presented these issues before this Court in <em>United States v. Howard. </em>252 Fed.Appx. 955. In that appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that Howard was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and held that the sentence applied was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 959-962. Here, Howard has not presented an argument which falls under the three exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine in her \u00a7 3582 motion. Therefore, to the extent that Howard attempts to argue that she was improperly sentenced as a career offender and that her sentence was unreasonable, the contentions are foreclosed by the law-of-the-case doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">Finally, Howard has raised several constitutional challenges to her underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>conviction and sentence. We reject these arguments for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">First, Howard has also already argued ineffective assistance of counsel. We denied Howard\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to this claim stating that Howard failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>CM/ECF for U.S. Dist. Ct. For S.D. Fla, case no. 1:08-cv-20411. Doc. 29. Howard has nonetheless argued the merits of that motion in the instant appeal. We do not address those arguments. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (\u201c[W]e hold that in an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Second, Howard\u2019s remaining constitutional arguments are not to be considered within the context of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. In <em>Bravo, </em>we held that constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence are the sort of \u201cextraneous\u201d issues that are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and must be pursued through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 collateral attack. <em>Id. </em>at 782 (upholding a district court\u2019s finding that it had no jurisdiction in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to consider the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment). Thus, we find that a \u00a7 3582(c) motion is not the proper vehicle by which to challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it denied Howard\u2019s motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
