King, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. King argues that the district court erred in determining that the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) was inapplicable to his claim and abused its discretion by failing to stay the instant proceedings pending the resolution of a Ninth Circuit case. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">In June 2009, King filed a pro <em>se </em>petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging his convictions for conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. King argued that he was actually innocent of the money laundering charges, and that his convictions violated his due process rights, because \u00a7 1956 was void for vagueness. He stated that he previously filed a \u00a7 2255 petition, which had been denied. King asserted that he was entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, based on <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">In a memorandum in support of his \u00a7 2241 petition, King argued that he was eligible for relief under \u00a7 2241, because <em>Santos </em>was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review and decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted. King explained that, because <em>Santos </em>defined \u201cproceeds\u201d to mean \u201cprofits,\u201d King was actually innocent of the money laundering offenses, because the government used \u201cgross receipts\u201d to compute his sentence. He also asserted that \u00a7 1956 was void for vagueness because it failed to define \u201cproceeds\u201d and, therefore, failed to provide him with sufficient notice that his conduct was criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">King attached to his memorandum a copy of his plea agreement, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Under the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that King conspired with other individuals to defraud investors and launder money through various corporate entities (\u201cCount 1\u201d). The parties also agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that King conspired to defraud investors by falsely promising that the investors\u2019 money \u201cwould be held in an attorney\u2019s escrow account until it would be placed in an \u2018investment trading program\u2019 whereby United States Treasury Bills would be leased and the revenue generated would be distributed\u201d to investors (\u201cCount 113\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The government responded that King failed to meet the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition, because (1) the Supreme Court had not made <em>Santos </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; (2) <em>Santos </em>did not establish that King was convicted for a non-existent offense, because <em>Santos\u2019s </em>narrow holding was related only to proceeds of an illegal gambling operation; and (3) circuit law did not foreclose King from raising his claim prior to entering his plea or on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">King subsequently filed a motion to grant a continuance or hold his case in abeyance pending the outcome of <em>Moreland v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 997, 173 L.Ed.2d 289 (2009), a case arising from the Ninth Circuit that was remanded by the Supreme Court for further consideration pursuant to <em>Santos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATL\">The magistrate judge denied King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion, finding that King was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, because (1) the Supreme Court had never declared <em>Santos </em>to have retroactive effect; (2) <em>Santos\u2019s </em>holding did not establish that King\u2019s convictions were now nonexistent offenses, because King\u2019s convictions did not involve illegal gambling; and (3) at the time of King\u2019s conviction, circuit law did not foreclose an argument that \u201cproceeds,\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, meant \u201cprofits\u201d as opposed to \u201creceipts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\n<em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201cSavings Clause\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Generally, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, if a remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, a federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. \u201cThe burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the petitioner.\u201d <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">We have established that \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause applies only when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). A petitioner may not argue the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the savings clause applies to his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The relevant portion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[w]hoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity ... shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction ... or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1). In <em>Santos, </em>the Supreme Court held that the word \u201cproceeds,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1956, meant \u201cprofits,\u201d rather than \u201creceipts.\u201d <em>Santos, </em>523 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 2025.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 421, 175 L.Ed.2d 272 (2009), we noted that <em>Santos </em>had \u201climited precedential value,\u201d because three parts of the four-part opinion were issued by a plurality of Supreme Court justices. <em>Id. </em>at 1242. Thus, because \u201cno single rationale explaining the result enjoy[ed] the assent of five Justices,\u201d the <em>Santos </em>holding \u201cmay be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgment[] on the narrowest grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201c[t]he narrow holding in <em>Santos, </em>at most, was that the gross receipts of an unlicensed gambling operation were not \u2018proceeds\u2019 under section 1956.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that <em>Santos </em>did not apply to Demarest\u2019s case, because there was \u201cno evidence that the funds Demarest laundered were gross receipts of an illegal gambling operation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">In determining whether King met the three <em>Wofford </em>requirements necessary to \u201copen a portal\u201d under \u00a7 2255(e), it appears that King met the first requirement \u2014 that his claim was based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Although the Supreme Court, in <em>Santos, </em>did not specifically state that its holding was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, <em>Wofford </em>does not require such a statement. <em>See id. </em>(simply requiring that a claim be \u201cbased upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision\u201d); <em>compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (requiring that a successive \u00a7 2255 motion be based on \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, <em>made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). We have held that \u201c[decisions of the Supreme Court construing substantive federal criminal statutes must be given retroactive effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002). The <em>Santos </em>opinion clearly construed a substantive federal criminal statute, because it defined the meaning of one of the terms included in \u00a7 1956. <em>See Santos, </em>523 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 2025. Thus, it appears that King has satisfied the first <em>Wofford </em>prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">However, even if King has satisfied the first <em>Wofford </em>prong, he has failed to satisfy the second prong. Specifically, King failed to demonstrate that, based on the <em>Santos </em>decision, he was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. As the district court noted, and as the factual statements in King\u2019s plea agreement show, King\u2019s money laundering convictions were based on his participation in \u201ca cash rental \u2018ponzi scheme\u2019 and a related treasury bill leasing program.\u201d We have interpreted <em>Santos </em>to apply only to money laundering schemes involving an illegal gambling organization. <em>See Demarest, </em>570 F.3d at 1242. Thus, because King\u2019s offense conduct was totally unrelated to illegal gambling, <em>Santos </em>is inapplicable to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Because King has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test, he has failed to \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 (requiring a prisoner to satisfy all three prongs). Although King argues that the district court should have considered his void-for-vagueness argument, the district court was not required to consider the merits of this claim, because King failed to \u201copen the portal\u201d by meeting the three <em>Wofford </em>requirements. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>Denial of Motion to Stay Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to stay pending resolution of related proceedings in another forum. <em>See Ortega Trujillo v. Conover &amp; Co. Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1262, 1264 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000) (reviewing the district court\u2019s issuance of a stay).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying King\u2019s motion to stay his proceeding pending the outcome of <em>Moreland. </em>We have restricted application of <em>Santos </em>to money laundering cases involving proceeds of illegal gambling organizations. <em>See Demarest, </em>570 F.3d at 1242. Therefore, King failed to meet <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>second requirement, because he failed to show that his money laundering offense was rendered \u201cnonexistent\u201d by <em>Santos. </em>Moreover, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Moreland </em>will not affect this determination, because Ninth Circuit case law is not binding on Eleventh Circuit courts. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (recognizing that \u201cthe decisions of one circuit are not binding on other circuits\u201d). Because the outcome of <em>Moreland </em>would have no effect on the district court\u2019s resolution of King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying King\u2019s motion for a stay. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
