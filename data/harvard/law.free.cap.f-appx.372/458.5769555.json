He appeals the sentence resulting from an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. He argues that the district court erred procedurally in failing to consider each intermediate step as it moved up the various offense levels within category VI. Our review of Munoz\u2019s procedural challenge is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Neal, 578 </em>F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009); Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-21\">In <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc), this court stated, \u201cOrdinarily the district court\u2019s reasons for rejecting intermediate categories will clearly be implicit, if not explicit, in the court\u2019s explanation for its departure from the category calculated under the guidelines and its explanation for the category it has chosen as appropriate.\u201d That is the case here: The court plainly set forth the reasons for its upward departure, thereby implicitly rejecting intermediate offense levels. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, Munoz has not shown error, plain or otherwise, as to the procedural soundness of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 830-31 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-22\">Munoz contends further that the district court justified its upward departure on an impermissible basis in that, although none of his prior convictions qualified as aggravated felonies, the court considered them as such because the violent conduct underlying those convictions resembled felonies. This claim amounts to speculation as to the motives for imposing an upward departure. Moreover, the argument is contradicted by the record. The court plainly stated that the prior offenses \u201cdid not rise to the level of aggravated felonies.\u201d Because the court did not classify Munoz\u2019s prior violent offenses as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d or \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d the categorical approach had no application in the sentencing proceedings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 371-72 (5th Cir.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
