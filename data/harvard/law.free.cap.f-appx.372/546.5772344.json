The district court determined that the claims raised therein were duplicative of Smith\u2019s prior civil suit against one of the same defendants in <em>Smith v. Bowles, </em>No. 3:06-CV-1189-N, 2007 WL 1435612 (N.D.Tex. May 16, 2007). The district court denied Smith\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal based on its determination that Smith\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. We are now presented with Smith\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal and challenge to the district court\u2019s good-faith determination. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Smith also seeks the appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">Smith argues that his \u00a7 1983 suit raised claims that implicated his constitutional rights and that the district court therefore erred in dismissing his complaint. Smith does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the suit arises from the same series of events underlying his prior civil rights action. He thus has waived the issue whether the district court erred by certifying that his appeal would raise no nonfrivolous claims in challenging its dismissal of the suit as duplicative. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Because Smith has not shown that he will present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motions for leave to proceed IFP and for appointment of counsel are denied and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">Our dismissal of Smith\u2019s appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights suit as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Smith that if he accumulates a third strike pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) he shall be barred from proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ing IFP while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under Ihe limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
