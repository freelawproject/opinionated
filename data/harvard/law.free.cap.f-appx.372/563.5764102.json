He appeals his sentence of 188 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Martinez maintains that the district court erred in imposing a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstructing justice by perjuring himself at trial. The district court considered various statements made by Martinez during his trial and concluded that the statements were false, that they pertained to material matters, and that they were willful and not prompted by confusion or misunderstanding. Because the court\u2019s findings established a factual predicate for finding perjury, the district court did not err in imposing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Creech, </em>408 F.3d 264, 270-71 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wild, </em>92 F.3d 304, 308 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
