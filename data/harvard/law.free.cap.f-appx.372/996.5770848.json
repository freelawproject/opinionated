He asserts the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion because there is a presumption that he is entitled to the property, and the Government failed to provide an adequate justification for its failure to return it. We address his claim, first with regard to the $500 and next with regard to the remaining property. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling as to the former and reverse and remand as to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-19\">[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return. The motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized. The court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-20\">Overall, \u201c[a] motion to return seized property under Rule 41(g), is a motion in equity, in which courts will determine all the equitable considerations in order to make a fair and just decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 974 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWhen an owner invokes Rule 41(g) after the close of all criminal proceedings, the court treats the motion for return of property as a civil action in equity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-21\">When a district court denies a Rule 41(g) motion, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 973. In addition, we review the denial of a Rule 41(g) motion for equitable reasons for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir.2006), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1313 (11th Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s motion as to the $500. To invoke Rule 41(g), the movant must show both a possessory interest in the seized property and have clean hands. <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Palacios Gonzalez pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly and intentionally importing 100 grams or more of heroin into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a), and one count of possession with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In pleading guilty, Palacios Gonzalez agreed, in open court, to forfeit \u201call of his right, title and interest\u201d in the $500 referenced in the indictment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. The Government then moved for a preliminary order of forfeiture for the $500 mentioned in the indictment, pursuant to \u00a7 853. The district court adopted the Government\u2019s motion, and preliminarily ordered that the $500 be forfeited to the Government under \u00a7 853. The district court then sentenced Palacios Gonzalez to a total sentence of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered \u201cthe forfeiture consistent with the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">After Palacios Gonzalez was sentenced and the court entered his judgment, the Government filed a declaration of publication, which noted that, pursuant to \u00a7 853(n)(l), notice of the forfeiture for the $500 had been posted online for at least 30 consecutive days. In addition, the Government moved for a final order of forfeiture with regard to the $500. The district court adopted the Government\u2019s motion, and issued a final order of forfeiture regarding Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s interest in the $500. In particular, the order stated Pa-lacios Gonzalez forfeited \u201call right, title and interest\u201d in the $500 and vested clear title in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Consequently, because Palacios Gonzalez cannot show a possessory interest in the $500, and Palacios Gonzalez has unclean hands with regard to the money, as the $500 was seized from his possession during the course of his drug-trafficking, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying him equitable relief under Rule 41(g). <em>See Machado, </em>465 F.3d at 1307 (holding that it would be inequitable to return the fruits of the movant\u2019s crimes to the movant); <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">We reverse the district court\u2019s ruling as to the remainder of Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s property. The district court denied Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s motion as to the $500, based solely on the Government\u2019s unverified claims made in its response to Palac-ios Gonzalez\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. The Government claimed it \u201cprovided more than adequate opportunity to pick up the property,\u201d and that upon the passage of the 30-day period required before considering the property abandoned, the Government continued to possess the personal property until it gave final notice that it would be disposed. After the Government failed to receive a response to the notice, the Government considered the property abandoned and destroyed it in accordance with agency policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">In interpreting Rule 41(g),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we have stated that \u201cthe person from whom the property was seized is presumed to have a right to its return, and the government must demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason to retain the property.\u201d <em>United States v. Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe government must do more than state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>without documentary support, that it no longer possesses the property at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>192 F.3d 374, 377-78 (3d Cir.1999). Consequently, when the government does not verify its claim that the seized property was destroyed, and there is no evidence in the record to show that the property was actually destroyed, the government fails to meet its burden under Rule 41(g). <em>Id. </em>In this case, the Government offered no evidence to support its claim that the remainder of Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s personal belongings had been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">Palacios Gonzalez asserts that if the Government cannot return the property he requests, he should be granted either equitable relief or money damages. In <em>Potes Ramirez, </em>although we noted that the Government had sovereign immunity preventing the movant\u2019s claim for money damages, we did recognize a district court\u2019s ability to fashion equitable relief in instances where property had been destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 1315-16. Because the Government in <em>Potes Ramirez </em>failed to provide evidence supporting its claims that the movant\u2019s property had been destroyed, we reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the 41(g) motion and remanded to the district court to enable the parties to present evidence that would allow the court to make determination about what relief might be equitable. <em>Id. </em>at 1314-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Because the Government failed to present any evidence that Palacios Gonzalez\u2019s remaining property was destroyed, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision with regard to the property and remand to allow the parties to present evidence as to whether the property was been destroyed, and, if so, what equitable relief might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED AND REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">.
