The district court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>missed Bastida\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">Bastida contends that he established a due process violation because the Louisiana statutes governing parole use language leading a prisoner to expect release upon satisfaction of the pertinent rules. He also asserts that the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Paroles erred in denying his parole requests on the basis of \u201cunchangeable\u201d factors such as the nature of the underlying offense and Bastida\u2019s criminal history, particularly in light of Bastida's lengthy incarceration and evidence of his rehabilitative efforts. Bastida has pointed to no state laws using language mandating release, which would give rise to a constitutionally protected \u201cexpectation of parole.\u201d <em>Board of Pardons v. Allen, </em>482 U.S. 369, 373, 377-78, 107 S.Ct. 2415, 96 L.Ed.2d 303 (1987). He thus has not established that his right to parole is protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Bastida also asserts that the denial of parole constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. He maintains that officials in the Attorney General\u2019s Office informed prison officials that defendants convicted of armed robbery were ineligible for parole under the \u201cold timer\u201d statute. See La. R.S. \u00a7 15:574.4(A)(4). He argues this decision created a class of individuals suffering discrimination. <em>See Wottlin v. Fleming, </em>136 F.3d 1032, 1036-37 (5th Cir.1998). Bastida admits that the prison removed the restriction and that many such offenders were then granted parole under the statute. He therefore has not shown that a \u201cgovernmental action ... classifie[d] between two or more relevant persons or groups.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 309 (5th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">To the extent that Bastida is arguing that his continued denial of parole resulted in discrimination against a \u201cclass of one,\u201d he has not established that he was treated differently as a result of \u201cillegitimate animus or ill-will\u201d or that the different treatment was intentional. <em>See Shipp v. McMahon, </em>234 F.3d 907, 916 (5th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds, McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 328-29 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Bastida thus has not established that the district court erred in dismissing his Section 1983 lawsuit as frivolous or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). The judgment of the district court is thus affirmed. Bastida is informed that, upon our affirmance, the district court\u2019s dismissal counts as one strike for purposes of Section 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Bastida is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut.
