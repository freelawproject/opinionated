In his \u00a7 2254 petition, Scott challenged the revocation of his state probation, which became final in April 2006 when his counsel, against Scott\u2019s directive, did not file an appeal on his behalf. The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely because it was filed in January 2009, well over the one-year limitations period for federal habeas corpus petitions under the AEDPA. We granted Scott a Certificate of Appealability on whether the district court erred by finding his writ untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">On appeal, Scott argues that his lawyer\u2019s failure to appeal his state probation revocation was a State impediment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) that should have delayed the start of the limitations period. Scott also argues that this same failure entitles him to equitable tolling of the limitations period and constitutes cause and prejudice sufficient to overcome AEDPA\u2019s procedural bar. Scott\u2019s second argument on appeal is that our Circuit should recognize an \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception to AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations period and that because there was no evidence that the victim of his aggravated assault experienced apprehension or fear, he is actually innocent of the offense which triggered the revocation of his probation. Therefore, Scott claims that his \u00a7 2254 petition should be considered timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a federal habeas petition, including the determination that a petition is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d).\u201d <em>Melson v. Allen, 548 F.3d </em>993, 996-97 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 254, 175 L.Ed.2d 173 (2009). By statute, there is a one-year period of limitation for a person in state custody to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>federal petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The period runs from the latest of several potential start dates, including when the state court judgment became final after the expiration of the time for seeking direct review. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Under Georgia law, a defendant has 30 days to file an appeal challenging the revocation of probation. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 5-6-35(a)(5), (d). No appeal was filed in Scott\u2019s case. Therefore, the judgment of the superior court became \u201cfinal\u201d on April 13, 2006, and Scott had one year within which to file his federal habeas corpus petition or toll the limitations period by filing a state collateral attack. He did not file his federal petition or a state habeas petition prior to the expiration of the one-year period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Scott\u2019s first argument \u2014 that his attorney\u2019s failure to appeal his probation revocation is a State impediment cognizable under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) \u2014 is without merit. The AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period may be tolled by the existence of an impediment that was created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States if \u201cthe applicant was prevented from filing by such State action.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). However, we have held that the incompetence of a habeas petitioner\u2019s attorney is not the type of State impediment envisioned in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B). <em>Lawrence v. Florida, </em>421 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that the State impeded his timely filing of his \u00a7 2254 petition by providing him an incompetent attorney through the Florida counsel registry system).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Nor can Scott show that there are extraordinary circumstances present in his case to warrant the application of equitable tolling. \u201cEquitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which is typically applied sparingly.\u201d <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000). It is only available \u201cwhen a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cMere attorney negligence does not justify equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Steed, </em>219 F.3d at 1300. For a petitioner to be entitled to equitable tolling, there must be \u201cegregious attorney misconduct,\u201d such as \u201cproof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer\u2019s part.\u201d <em>Melson v. Allen, </em>548 F.3d 993, 1001 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Scott\u2019s allegations that his attorney failed to file an appeal of his probation revocation, and to inform him of this fact, does not constitute egregious attorney misconduct warranting equitable tolling. Far from constituting bad faith or dishonesty, Scott\u2019s decision not to appeal the probation revocation was a purely tactical one, especially in light of Scott\u2019s admission of guilt as to the probation revocation offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Finally, Scott\u2019s actual innocence argument fails as well. \u201cNeither the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>preme Court nor this Court has ever held that the Constitution requires an actual innocence exception to the AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period.\u201d <em>Melson, </em>548 F.3d at 1002. However, assuming that such an exception exists, a \u201cpetitioner must first make a sufficient showing of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis requires the petitioner to produce new reliable evidence \u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014 that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Scott has made no such showing as to the aggravated assault underlying his probation revocation. Instead of offering new evidence, he cited to the victim\u2019s and a law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony from his revocation hearing. Moreover, at the hearing, Scott admitted to committing the aggravated assault offense and violating his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In sum, the district court did not err by dismissing Scott\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred because the alleged incompetence of his state-appointed lawyer did not qualify as a \u201cState impediment\u201d that delayed the start of the limitations period or justify equitable tolling. Assuming that there is an actual innocence exception to the time period for seeking habeas relief, Scott also failed to present new evidence showing his actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">. We decline to address Scott's argument that his attorney\u2019s failure to file an appeal constituted cause and prejudice sufficient to overcome the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations because this argument is misplaced. Scott\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition was not dismissed due to procedural default so a showing of cause and prejudice is not relevant or necessary. Procedural default occurs when a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief is barred from raising a federal constitutional claim in federal court because he failed to first properly raise the issue in state court. <em>Henderson v. Campbell, </em>353 F.3d 880, 892 (11th Cir.2003). Scott's petition was dismissed due to untimely filing; no court ever reviewed the merits of his petition or determined that he attempted to raise a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim. Therefore, he need not show \"cause\u201d for the default and actual \"prejudice\u201d resulting from the default. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
