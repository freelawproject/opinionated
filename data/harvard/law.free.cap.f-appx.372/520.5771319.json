Tron\u2019s within-guidelines sentence was imposed to run consecutively to the 10-month sentenced imposed following the revocation of his supervised release. He contends that the consecutive nature of his sentence rendered it substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). Specifically, he argues that the district court overemphasized the seriousness of his offense, overstated his criminal history, and failed to account for his reasons for going to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This court reviews a sentence, including its consecutive nature, for reasonableness in light of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. If not, we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Likewise, a consecutive sentence imposed within the parameters of the advisory guidelines is presumptively reasonable and accorded great deference. <em>Candia, </em>454 F.3d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The district court considered Tron\u2019s request for a concurrent sentence and ultimately determined that a consecutive sentence at the top of the applicable guideline range was appropriate based on the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the court noted Tron\u2019s multiple appearances in federal court, his extensive criminal history, and his repeated failure to follow the court\u2019s instructions despite assurances to the contrary. The imposition of a consecutive sentence is authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, and Tron has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Candia, </em>454 F.3d at 478-79. Because he has not demonstrated that the consecutive sentence within the guidelines range was an abuse of discretion, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
