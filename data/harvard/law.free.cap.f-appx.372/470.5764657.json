We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-25\">The Masons sued their homeowners\u2019 insurer, Auto Club Family Insurance Company (\u201cAuto Club\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that it had failed to pay for covered damage to their house from Hurricane Katrina. The Masons were represented by James Larose, III, and Wayne E. Garrett. Auto Club moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the policy excluded claims for the damages at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-26\">On March 17, 2008, the district court issued a notice of hearing on Auto Club\u2019s motion and set the date for April 2, 2008. Counsel for the Masons did not file any memorandum in opposition to the motion, did not request a continuance, and did not file for an extension of time. On April 10, the court granted Auto Club\u2019s motion, noting the lack of opposition and observing that \u201c[a] motion for reconsideration of this order based on the appropriate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, if any, must be filed within thirty (30) days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-27\">Once again, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did nothing in response. The court entered final judgment for Auto Club on May 20, 2008, dismissing the claims with prejudice and ordering the parties to bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-28\">On August 8, 2008, counsel for the Masons finally responded with a motion for relief under rule 60. Counsel explained their inaction up to that point by saying they had \u201cmisunderstood the purview of the motion\u201d for judgment on the pleadings. Garret had suffered from cardiac illness since 2005, counsel claimed, but his condition had worsened in 2008, and as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201ccertain matters [were] neglected and not responded to.\u201d Neither the rule 60 motion nor the accompanying memorandum offered an excuse for Larose\u2019s inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The district court denied the motion. In November 2008, counsel moved for reconsideration, again seeking relief under rule 60(b)(1) for \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d explaining that attorney Larose had not registered for the district court\u2019s email notification system until April 29, 2008. The motion did not explain the reason Larose had failed to register until then or to ask his co-counsel and office-mate Garrett for information about the crucial deadlines. The motion gave no explanation why La-rose did nothing for the Masons\u2019 case in the three weeks between his registration and the court\u2019s final judgment order or why he waited more than two months after final judgment to register opposition to the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The rule 60 motion did come with an attached affidavit, from Garrett\u2019s doctor, that only the most generous reader could call \u201csupportive.\u201d The affidavit said only that Garrett had received a pacemaker implant in 2005, that he had complained about \u201cweakness ... sweating and swooning,\u201d and that changes were made to his medication <em>two days before </em>the filing of the rule 60 motion. The affidavit did not indicate that Garrett\u2019s condition had worsened in early 2008. It did not say whether Garrett was unable to work, then or at any earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The district court denied the rule 60 motion. The Masons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201c[W]e recognize that the decision to grant or deny relief under [r]ule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for abuse of that discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). There is no abuse of discretion here. In denying the rule 60(b) motion, the district court considered not only counsel\u2019s inexplicable and inexcusable neglect, but also the merits of the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The record indicates that the court was thorough, fair, and helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-29\">. The defendant was misidentified as <em>\u201cAAA </em>Insurance Company\u201d in the original petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. In a supplemental memorandum to the district court, the Masons argued that the \u201cslight abuse\u201d standard in <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d, 396 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan. 1981), should apply. There, we noted that \u201cwhere denial of relief [under rule 60(b)] precludes examination of the full merits of the cause, even a slight abuse may justify reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">The Masons have not renewed that argument on appeal, so it is waived. Even if we were to consider it, the <em>Seven Elves </em>standard would be inappropriate here, because the district court addressed the merits of the motion for judgment before rendering judgment. Even if we did apply the <em>Seven Elves </em>standard, it would make no difference, because the Masons have not demonstrated even \u201cslight abuse\u201d by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
