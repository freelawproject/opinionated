She argues that the district court clearly-erred in refusing to grant a two-level reduction in her offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for her minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Quintanilla has not shown that the district court clearly erred in determining that she was not entitled to a two-level reduction in her offense level for a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). Quintanilla has not shown that she was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d or that she was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In the factual resume, she admitted that she supervised or directed employees of the business; she obtained tax stickers on the slot machines in her name for codefendant Javier Flores; she was paid ten dollars per hour by Flores; she was listed as the manager of the business in one publication; and the electric bills for the gambling business were listed in her name. She further admitted that the slot machines paid out cash winnings and that the business was in continuous operation for thirty days or more. She also admitted to the probation officer that she knew the gambling business was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Quintanilla\u2019s admissions show that she was not less culpable than the average participant or peripheral to the advancement of the illegal gambling business. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. A defendant who is not charged or sentenced based on being part of a larger conspiracy or criminal activity is generally not entitled to a mitigating role reduction under Section 3B1.2. See <em>United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 313 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007). Because Quintanilla\u2019s role was coextensive with the conduct for which she was convicted, she was not entitled to a minor role reduction even if her activities in the larger criminal conspiracy or activity may have been less than her codefen-dants. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
