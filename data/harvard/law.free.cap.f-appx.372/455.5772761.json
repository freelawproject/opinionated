Turner argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by denying his motion on the basis of his prison disciplinary record without first holding an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Section \u00a7 3582 directs the court to consider the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). However, the court is not required to provide reasons for its denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion or to explain its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The district court had the benefit of Turner\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, two completed \u00a7 3582 motion questionnaire forms, Turner\u2019s original Presentence Investigation Report and Addendum, and the probation officer\u2019s worksheet and supplemental report regarding Turner\u2019s eligibility for a reduction of sentence. On one of the questionnaire forms, Turner specifically discussed the information he wanted the court to consider in evaluating the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition, the probation officer\u2019s worksheet included a section discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the nature and circumstances of Turner\u2019s underlying offense. Thus, the record reflects that the district court considered Turner\u2019s motion and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">To the extent Turner is arguing that the district court erred by basing the denial of his motion on his extensive prison disciplinary record, the 2008 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines allow a court to consider a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). In addition, we have \u201cdecline[d] to hold that a district court cannot consider post-conviction conduct in determining whether to grant a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Turner also argues that the district court erred by denying his motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. Because it involves only a modification of a previously imposed sentence, a defendant need not be present at a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 43(b)(4). Moreover, because he failed to challenge the probation officer\u2019s Supplemental Report, Turner concedes there were no facts in dispute to warrant an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
