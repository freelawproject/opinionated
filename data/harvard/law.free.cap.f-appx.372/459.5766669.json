For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">In 1998, Tovar-Valencia pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The district court sentenced him to life imprisonment on the dl'Ug charge and to a concurrent 240-month term on the money laundering charge. The court also imposed a fine of $25,000, to be paid \u201cin full immediately.\u201d Tovar-Valencia began paying his fine in installments under the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019s Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">This court dismissed Tovar-Valencia\u2019s direct appeal as frivolous after granting his counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Tovar-Valencia\u2019s first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of merit; this court denied a COA and later denied leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">The instant appeal is the latest in a series of challenges Tovar-Valencia has mounted against his fine and the manner in which he is paying it. His motion asked the district court to remit or modify the fine pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the motion, Tovar-Valencia contests the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s use of the IFRP to facilitate the payment of fines that are due \u201cin full immediately.\u201d He argues that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612(e), his failure to pay the fine immediately put him in default, which should have triggered the collection procedures outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3612, 3613, and 3613A. The government\u2019s failure to adhere to these procedures, he asserts, violates the Fifth Amendment and forfeits its ability to collect the balance of the fine. Claiming that new economic circumstances \u2014 including his alleged dismissal from a prison job due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to his immigration status \u2014 affect his ability to continue paying his f\u00edne, Tovar-Va-lencia asked the district court to set a new payment schedule or remit the remainder of the fine. He also asserted that he may attempt to recover the amount he has already paid the government as illegally collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The district court dismissed Tovar-Va-lencia\u2019s motion, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction. It reasoned that the motion was a collateral attack on the criminal judgment and should be treated as another successive \u00a7 2255 petition. The court denied Tovar-Valencia\u2019s Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Tovar-Valencia\u2019s fine is not of the type for which \u00a7 3572(d)(3) authorizes relief. He does not challenge a \u201cjudgment for a fine which permits payments in install<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ments\u201d as required under \u00a7 3572(d)(3)\u2014 the district court did not make Tovar-Valencia\u2019s fine payable in installments. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wynn, </em>328 Fed.Appx. 826, 828 (3d Cir.2009) (unpublished). His motion is more accurately characterized as a challenge to the validity of his IFRP payment plan \u2014 in other words, a challenge to the manner in which his sentence is being executed, rather than a \u201cclaim[ ] relating to unlawful custody\u201d cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1137 (5th Cir.1994). In <em>Segler, </em>this court explained that \u00a7 2255 was reserved for claims relating to unlawful custody and could not serve as the vehicle to challenge the imposition of a fine. <em>Id. </em>at 1137-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">A properly stated claim of the sort To-var-Valencia seeks to make requires exhaustion of administrative remedies and must then be asserted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in the district court in the district where he is incarcerated. <em>See United States v. Diggs, </em>578 F.3d 318, 319-20 (5th Cir.2009). In <em>Diggs, </em>a restitution case raising an analogous issue, we stressed that \u201c[prisoners cannot use [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3664(k)\u201d \u2014 the equivalent of \u00a7 3572(d)(3) in the restitution context \u2014 \u201cas a vehicle for a court not in the district of incarceration to modify or suspend IFRP payments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">This court can affirm the judgment of the district court on any basis supported by the record. <em>Bickford v. Int\u2019l Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981). Although the district court incorrectly premised its dismissal on the bar against second or successive \u00a7 2255 petitions, that dismissal was nonetheless the proper result.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir%. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-13\">. <em>Anders v.
