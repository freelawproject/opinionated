Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). The district court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>missed Evans\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies because Evans conceded that his appeal from the decision rendered following his disciplinary proceeding was rejected as untimely. Following the denial of a postjudgment motion for reconsideration, Evans filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Evans\u2019s IFP \u201cmotion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. This court\u2019s inquiry into good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The notice of appeal in this case was not filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a). Evans\u2019s motion for reconsideration was filed more than 10 days after the entry of the order it challenged, and it is properly construed as a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) that did not suspend the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>Id. </em>We thus conclude that Evans\u2019s notice of appeal is timely only as to the denial of his motion for reconsideration. This court reviews the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Evans argues that his appeal from the disciplinary decision was untimely through no fault of his own. He asserts that prison officials repeatedly separated him from his papers and damaged or destroyed his appeal drafts until he was finally able to file an appeal several months after his disciplinary hearing. Evans\u2019s argument cannot be construed as one of excusable neglect warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(1) because he alleges that his failure to file a timely appeal was the result of reasons beyond his control. <em>See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 394-95, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). Evans does not assert, and the record does not suggest, the applicability of Rule 60(b)(2), (3), (4), or (5). Nor do Evans\u2019s allegations demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6). <em>See Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the denial of Evans\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Edwards, </em>78 F.3d at 995; <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The district court\u2019s certification that Evans\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, his motion for IFP status on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Evans that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
