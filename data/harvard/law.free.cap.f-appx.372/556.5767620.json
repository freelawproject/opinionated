Smith argues that in denying the motion, the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and thus, failed to consider the purpose of the amendment, which was to cure the disparity in sentencing between crack and powdered cocaine. He asserted that his sentencing under the career offender Guideline did not preclude a reduction of his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">Smith\u2019s argument that his sentencing under the career offender Guideline does not preclude a reduction of his sentence is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 &amp; n. 4, 791 &amp; n. 8. His arguments based on the <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>decisions are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-23\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
