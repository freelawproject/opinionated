Mack, </em>988 F.2d 1216 (11th Cir.1993) (Table), we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences for robbing an FBI agent, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, assaulting the agent with a deadly weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 1114, and with possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In affirming his sentences, we rejected the argument that the district court erred in sentencing appellant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"AuJR\">On March 5, 1988, appellant moved the district court to modify his sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), in light of Amendment 433 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argued that Amendment 433 clarified that the crime of felon-in-posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>sion-of-a firearm no longer constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1; hence, he should not have been sentenced as a career offender. The district court denied his motion, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>247 F.3d 246 (11th Cir.2001) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">On June 30, 2008, appellant once again moved the district court to modify his sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on the ground that Amendment 433 established that the court had erred in using his felon-in-possess-of-a-firearm conviction as a basis for sentencing him as a career offender. The district court denied his motion. He now appeals the ruling, contending that the district court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion because the court failed appropriately to consider the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which analyzed the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for Armed Career Criminal Act purposes, in ruling on his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, a decision of a legal issue establishes the \u201claw of the case\u201d and \u201cmust be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal in the appellate court,\u201d unless (a) the evidence in a subsequent trial is substantially different; (b) there is a change in controlling law; or (c) the decision was clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1561 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). The law-of-the-case doctrine applies in proceedings commenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 1557. In this case, the law-of-the-case doctrine does apply to appellant\u2019s successive \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because we previously affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s earlier \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and no exception to the doctrine applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
