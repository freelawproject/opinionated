Garcia for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Hicks contends that the district court erred when, sua sponte, it dismissed his claims against Deputy Garcia prior to service of process and without affording notice and an opportunity to respond. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-22\">\u201cNotwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion thereof, that may have been paid,\u201d the district court must dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint if, at any time, it determines that the action is frivolous or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Further, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A requires that the district court screen complaints filed by a prisoner seeking redress from a government officer or employee and dismiss claims that the court determines to be frivolous or malicious, or that fail to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-23\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, inmates must exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available\u201d prior to bringing a civil action. \u00a7 1997e(a). Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, and \u201cinmates are not required to specifically plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Although district courts may not screen prisoners\u2019 complaints for failure to plead exhaustion, they may, sua sponte, \u201cdismiss a case prior to service on defendants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>failure to state a claim, predicated on failure to exhaust, if the complaint itself makes clear that the prisoner failed to exhaust.\u201d <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007). \u201c[We review] a district court\u2019s dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">When he was a pretrial detainee in the Tarrant County Jail (TCJ) and was restrained in a restraint chair, Hicks was assaulted by a fellow inmate. In his amended complaint, Hicks alleged that he filed grievances complaining of the assault and attached copies of three grievances he had filed while in the TCJ. Hicks also alleged that the TCJ did not maintain a two-step grievance procedure and that TCJ officials never responded to his grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">As we have previously noted, \u201c[t]he TCJ provides a two-step procedure for presenting a grievance: (1) an inmate must send a written statement directly to the Grievance Board, which should respond within 60 days, then (2) if an inmate is dissatisfied with the Grievance Board\u2019s response, he may appeal in writing to the Inmate Grievance Appeal Board within five days of receiving the written response to his grievance.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Tarrant County Texas, </em>345 Fed.Appx. 911, 913 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Hicks v. Deputy Parker, </em>349 Fed.Appx. 869, 871-72 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Accepting Hicks\u2019s allegations as true, he exhausted the first step of the two-step grievance procedure once the 60-day period for responding had expired. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998) (overruled on other grounds). Because he did not appeal the Grievance Board\u2019s decisions (or lack thereof) by filing a step-two grievance, however, Hicks\u2019s failure to pursue his grievance remedy to conclusion constituted a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Hicks\u2019s amended complaint and our pri- or decisions make clear that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and thus failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Therefore, the district court did not err when it dismissed Hicks\u2019s claims against Deputy Garcia sua sponte prior to service of process. <em>See Carbe, </em>492 F.3d at 328. The record shows that the exhaustion issue was thoroughly briefed and that Hicks was given adequate notice that his claims were subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Finally, the record does not support Hicks\u2019s contention that he filed petitions for certiorari in <em>Hicks v. Tarrant County Texas </em>and <em>Hicks v. Deputy Parker. See Hicks, </em>345 Fed.Appx. at 911; <em>Hicks, </em>349 Fed.Appx. at 870-71. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
