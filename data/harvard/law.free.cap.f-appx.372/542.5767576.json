The district court dismissed Davis\u2019s claim that he was forced to work without compensation and granted summary judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>favor of the defendants. Davis argues that he timely filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. He contends that the district court failed to conduct a de novo review because it improperly found that objections were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Because Davis forwarded his written objections to prison officials within ten days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of receiving the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the objections were timely filed. <em>See Thompson v. Rasberry, </em>993 F.2d 513, 515 (5th Cir.1993). Consequently, Davis should have been afforded de novo review by the district court, and our review on appeal is de novo. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C); <em>Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The district court denied Davis\u2019s Fed. R.CivP. 59(e) motion wherein Davis complained that the court failed to address his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. In denying the motion, the court found that Davis failed to show the dismissal of his suit was erroneous and also denied all outstanding motions. The district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 59(e) motion indicates that a de novo review was conducted. Thus, any error in failing to consider Davis\u2019s objections is harmless. <em>See Smith v. Collins, </em>964 F.2d 483, 485 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Davis does not renew any of the substantive claims raised in the district court. By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Davis has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.
