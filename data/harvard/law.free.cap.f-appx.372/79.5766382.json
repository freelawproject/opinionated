Schulman, a Jackson Memorial Hospital physician. He contends that he adequately alleged a constitutional violation of the Eighth Amendment based on deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Granda also argues that Dr. Schulman agreed to all of the allegations against him by failing to submit an answer denying them. Upon review of the record and Granda\u2019s brief, we find that Granda failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, and the district court did not err by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In his complaint, Granda alleged that after sustaining multiple, near-fatal gunshot wounds inflicted by the Special Response Team of the Miami-Dade Police Department, he was transferred by ambulance to Jackson Memorial Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Gran-da alleged that Dr. Jose A. Hernandez and possibly others performed the emergency surgery, leaving bullet fragments in Gran-da\u2019s chest and shoulder, and a complete bullet in his left thigh. Granda alleged that Dr. Schulman, the only named defendant, approved of Dr. Fernandez leaving bullet fragments and an entire bullet in his body. After the emergency surgery, Granda alleged that Dr. Schulman gave him \u201can extremely perfunctory examination\u201d and prescribed (1) 800 milligrams of ibuprofen every six hours for pain, (2) topically applied bacitracin for his wounds twice daily, and (3) five milligrams of amoxicillin every eight hours. Dr. Schulman discharged Granda to the Metro-Dade West Infirmary only nine hours after undergoing emergency surgery. Granda alleged that Dr. Schulman, <em>inter alia, </em>was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by violating the proper standard of medical care, the Hippocratic Oath, and his fiduciary duty, which resulted in a breach of trust when he discharged Granda.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Granda claimed he received injuries, including disfiguring scars, because Dr. Schulman failed to ensure, following his discharge, that \u201cmedical personnel [or] staff that [had] care [or] custody of [him]\u201d properly cleaned and treated his wounds, as ordered, changed his dressings \u201cdaily and consistently,\u201d and gave him the prescribed medications. Granda also claimed that he suffered a bacterial skin infection and painful abscesses in his wounds from such deficient treatment. Granda further alleged that, although Dr. Schulman au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>thorized his release into the Metro-Dade West Infirmary, Granda \u201cinstead was placed in a classification unit where [he] received absolutely no medical care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Before Dr. Schulman answered Granda\u2019s complaint, a magistrate judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed the complaint, and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Granda\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), a \u201ccourt shall review, before docketing, if feasible or ... as soon as practicable after docketing,\u201d a prisoner\u2019s civil rights complaint \u201cseeking] redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity,\u201d and must dismiss such a complaint if it is frivolous or \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We review dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted <em>de novo. Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 632, 172 L.Ed.2d 619 (2008). Even so, this obligation \u201cis not the equivalent of a duty to re-write [a complaint] for [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims when it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). \u2018We have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when ... the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">At the pleading stage, a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), which possesses \u201cenough heft to sho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1966, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (alteration in original) (citation and quotation omitted). Courts must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepting all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201c[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d). \u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlefment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u201d and must be sufficient \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1965, 1974. The Supreme Court recently clarified the level of specificity required to state a plausible claim for relief, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>lows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are \u201cmerely consistent with\u201d a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u201cstops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\"><em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Generally, to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must adequately allege \u201cthat he ... was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. \u201cSection 1983 creates no substantive rights; it merely provides a remedy for deprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Almand v. DeKalb County, </em>103 F.3d 1510, 1512 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VIII. The Eighth Amendment is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>Campbell v. Johnson, </em>586 F.3d 835, 842 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (citation omitted). While the Eighth Amendment applies only to convicted prisoners, the same standard applies for evaluating pretrial detainees\u2019 claims of inadequate medical care under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth Amendment to include \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (internal citation omitted). Every claim by a prisoner that he did not receive adequate medical treatment, however, does not state a violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 97 S.Ct. at 291. To state a claim of inadequate medical treatment, a prisoner must allege facts that satisfy both an objective and a subjective requirement. <em>See Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000). The plaintiff must allege an \u201cobjectively serious deprivation\u201d of medical care, which requires (1) \u201can objectively serious medical need ... that, if left unattended, pos[es] a substantial risk of serious harm,\u201d and (2) that the state actor\u2019s response \u201cwas poor enough to constitute an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, and not merely accidental inadequacy, negligen[ce] in diagnoses] or treatment], or even [mjedical malpractice actionable under state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A serious medical need is \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">A prisoner also must allege the state actor\u2019s subjective intent to punish by pleading facts that would show that he acted with deliberate indifference. <em>Taylor, </em>221 F.3d at 1258. Accordingly, a prisoner alleges deliberate indifference by pleading: (1) the actor\u2019s \u201csubjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm;\u201d (2) the actor\u2019s \u201cdisregard of that risk;\u201d and (3) \u201cconduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Allegations of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>complete denial of readily available treatment for a serious medical condition would state a claim for deliberate indifference. <em>Harris v. Coweta County, </em>21 F.3d 388, 393 (11th Cir.1994). Deliberate indifference includes: (1) \u201cgrossly inadequate care,\u201d (2) \u201ca decision to take an easier but less efficacious course of treatment,\u201d and (3) medical care that is \u201cso cursory as to amount to no treatment at all.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1351 (citation and quotation omitted) (holding that a prisoner stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment where he alleged that he was prescribed medications to treat hepatitis and the human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d), but \u201ccomplain[ed] of complete withdrawal of treatment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Allegations of a delay in medical care for \u201cserious and painful injuries\u201d also can state a claim for a violation of the Eighth Amendment, especially where delay in treating a \u201cknown or obvious\u201d serious medical condition is unexplained. <em>Harris, </em>21 F.3d at 393 (citation omitted); <em>Brown v. Hughes, </em>894 F.2d 1533, 1538 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (citations omitted). Likewise, allegations that state officials knowingly interfered with a physician\u2019s prescribed course of treatment would state a claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Young v. City of Augusta, </em>59 F.3d 1160, 1169 n. 17 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Nevertheless, \u201ca complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292; <em>see Hamm v. DeKalb County, </em>774 F.2d 1567, 1575 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cAlthough [the prisoner] may have desired different modes of treatment, the care the jail provided did not amount to deliberate indifference\u201d). In <em>Estelle, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prisoner failed to state a claim of deliberate indifference by alleging that medical personnel failed to diagnose and treat his back injury properly, which caused him to suffer pain for a three-month period, because he admitted to receiving treatment, including painkillers and muscle relaxants, on multiple occasions. 429 U.S. at 99-101, 106-07, 97 S.Ct. at 288-89, 292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">As an initial matter, it is unclear whether Dr. Schulman was acting under color of state law during the relevant time period, or whether he was acting solely as a private physician. <em>See Griffin, </em>261 F.3d at 1303. Granda did not allege that Jackson Memorial Hospital was a state-owned facility, and he did not allege that a contractual relationship existed between Dr. Schulman and state prison officials to provide prisoners with medical care. However, because Granda is a pro <em>se </em>litigant, we must construe his complaint liberally. <em>See Alba, </em>517 F.3d at 1252 (citation omitted). Even assuming that Dr. Schulman acted under color of state law, Granda failed to allege facts sufficient to support a plausible deliberate indifference claim against him under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">First, accepting as true Granda\u2019s claim that Dr. Schulman approved the operating surgeon\u2019s decision to leave bullet fragments and an entire bullet in Gran-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>da\u2019s body, this fact alone cannot nudge his claim across the line from conceivable to plausible without further allegations that would show an impermissible motive behind Dr. Schulman\u2019s decision. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. Likewise, Granda\u2019s claim that Dr. Schulman discharged him when he was not stable, following an \u201cextremely perfunctory\u201d examination and after only nine hours in the hospital, does not support a reasonable inference that he received grossly inadequate care. Granda admitted that he received treatment in the form of surgery and sutures, that Dr. Schulman oversaw the surgery, and that Dr. Schulman prescribed various medications, including painkillers and antibiotics, before approving his discharge. Second, Granda claimed that he remained under Dr. Schulman\u2019s care after his discharge from the hospital and his release into the custody of the corrections center, and that Dr. Schulman was liable for failing to provide him with any of the prescribed treatment for four days following his discharge. These are conclusory assertions insufficient to raise his \u201cright to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. Third, while Granda claimed that corrections center personnel interfered with Dr. Schulman\u2019s prescribed course of treatment and delayed his receipt of proper treatment for four days following his discharge from the hospital, which allegedly caused him to suffer permanent injuries, he named no such personnel as defendants. Further, he failed to allege a causal connection in this regard sufficient to state a claim against Dr. Schulman. <em>See Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1234 (11th Cir.2003) (discussing \u00a7 1983 liability under a theory of supervisory liability which requires either direct participation in the constitutional violation or a causal connection between the actor and the supervisor).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Finally, Dr. Schulman\u2019s failure to answer Granda\u2019s letters, which were not legal pleadings, or his complaint, which the district court dismissed prior to service, did not amount to an admission because Dr. Schulman had no legal obligation to respond to these documents. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(b)(6) (\u201cAn allegation ... is admitted if a responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a responsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Granda\u2019s constitutional claims for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. Likewise, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Granda\u2019s pendent state law claims to allow him to re-file them in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. However, it should be noted that there is an intra-circuit split as to the third prong of deliberate indifference regarding the actor\u2019s conduct. In <em>Bozeman v. Orum, </em>the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>prong consisted of \u201cconduct that is more than <em>[gross] </em>negligence.\u201d 422 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1351) (emphasis added). Subsequent reported Eleventh Circuit cases that cite the <em>Bozeman </em>construct include <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>540 F.3d 1298, 1312 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Burnette v. Taylor, </em>533 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Goebert v. Lee County, </em>510 F.3d 1312, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Andujar v. Rodriguez, </em>486 F.3d 1199, 1203-04 (11th Cir.2007). Regardless of what standard is applicable, Granda fails to sufficiently allege the lower standard of \"conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
