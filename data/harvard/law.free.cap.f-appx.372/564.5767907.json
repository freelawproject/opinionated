New was sentenced to two years of probation, with 90 days of home confinement, a fine of $2000, and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Although New originally characterized his pleading as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, he acknowledges that he is not entitled to challenge his conviction under that provision because he was not in federal custody when he filed his pleading. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). He has therefore waived that claim and is not required to obtain a COA for it. There is no requirement to obtain a COA in order to appeal the denial of a petition for a writ of coram nobis. <em>United States v. Kwan, </em>407 F.3d 1005, 1009 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Rodriguez v. Johnson, </em>No. 00-50225, 2000 WL 1901607, *1 (5th Cir.2000) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188, 189 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Treating Few\u2019s filing as an appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of coram nobis, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the writ. We have previously determined on direct appeal that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that New made a false representation to the agent. <em>See United States v. Few, </em>62 Fed.Appx. 557 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. New has failed to overcome the presumption that the underlying criminal proceedings were correct, and he has not shown a fundamental error that resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Jimenez v. Trominski, </em>91 F.3d 767, 768 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
