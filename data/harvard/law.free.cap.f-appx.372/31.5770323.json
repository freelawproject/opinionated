After review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-26\">During <em>voir dire, </em>Dianne Streid informed the court that she had problems with the length of the pretrial delay and her possible inability to impose a mandatory sentence if she thought it was too ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>treme. The district court explained to Streid that there were many reasons why the trial could be delayed and that was not her concern and that the jury had no involvement in sentencing. The district court asked whether, based on her knowledge of mandatory sentencing, she could find Lewis guilty, and Streid responded \u201cI don\u2019t know what the law states at this point.\u201d The district court reiterated that the juror\u2019s function was not to sentence, and Streid responded, \u201c[s]o I\u2019m better off not knowing. It\u2019s just sometimes \u2014 .\u201d The district court responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I want to make sure that the function of the jury and judge is separate.\u201d Streid answered \u201cI understand keeping it separate is important.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Defense counsel asked Streid whether she could be fair and impartial and base her verdict only on the evidence, and Streid responded \u201c[y]es, I can, as long as I\u2019m not \u2014 and I am not aware of what the mandatory \u2014 what the law states as far as \u2014 that\u2019s your job. So I\u2019m \u2014 ignorance is bliss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The government moved to strike Streid for cause. Over Lewis\u2019s objections, the district court struck Streid, commenting, \u201c[e]ven though she did not come right out and say it, I think she\u2019s troubled by the nature of this case, about the potential sentence, for whatever reason by the length of time it took to come to trial.\u201d Lewis was convicted and sentenced to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Lewis argues that the district court abused its discretion by striking Streid for cause because the government failed to establish her bias. Lewis argues that Streid\u2019s final statements that she could be fair removed any doubts regarding her impartiality, and he contends that it is possible to rehabilitate a juror with an expressed bias, as in <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>177 F.3d 963 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that despite initial statements indicating possible bias, further examination established that the juror could be impartial, and the district court\u2019s refusal to strike the juror for cause thus was not an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to strike a prospective juror for cause for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1356 (11th Cir.2006). The constitutional standard for whether a prospective juror can be impartial is whether she can set her personal opinions aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>961 F.2d 183, 184 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cIn particular, when reviewing juror impartiality, this court has focused on whether (1) the juror may be affected by matters not in evidence, and (2) the juror may presume guilt rather than innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1045 (11th Cir.2001). Because it is not always clear from the record that a prospective juror is unmistakably biased, we must give deference to the district court\u2019s determination whether or not the juror will be able to faithfully apply the law because the district court had the opportunity to see and hear the juror. <em>Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1357. There are few aspects of a jury trial where we are less inclined to reverse a district court\u2019s exercise of discretion than with regard to ruling on challenges for cause. <em>United States v. Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 509 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">We conclude that the district court properly removed Streid for cause. When questioned during <em>voir dire, </em>Streid indicated that she had concerns about the length of time it took the case to go to trial and the possible sentence Lewis could face. Although she stated that she could be impartial, her responses made it clear that she was affected by the possible punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ment and that this could influence her role as a juror. The district court was in the best position to evaluate Streid\u2019s responses, and we cannot say that it abused its discretion by finding that her statements indicated that her ability to be impartial was questionable. Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
