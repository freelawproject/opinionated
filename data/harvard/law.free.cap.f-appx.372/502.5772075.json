He does not challenge the BIA\u2019s rulings that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to establish that he was entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture; thus, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. </em>Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">Hernandez Ramirez contends that the BIA misapplied the standards of review applicable to the IJ\u2019s decision and that the IJ\u2019s finding of past persecution was a factual finding that the BIA should have reviewed only for clear error. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Although an IJ\u2019s finding about \u201c \u2018what happened\u2019 to the individual\u201d constitutes a factual finding reviewable for clear error, the determination by the IJ that those facts rise to the level of past persecution constitutes a legal question that the BIA may review de novo. Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to Improve Case Management, 67 Fed.Reg. 54,878-01, 54,890 (Aug. 26, 2002); <em>see, e.g. Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496-98 (BIA 2008); \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The agency\u2019s interpretation of its rules is entitled to deference unless the interpretation is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>see also United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 229-31, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). The BIA\u2019s decision did not reweigh the facts found by the IJ but instead determined that the facts alleged by Hernandez Ramirez did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>Cf. Alvarado de Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 227, 235 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that the BIA\u2019s actions in reweighing the facts regarding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>bona fide marriage constituted an improper application of the standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Hernandez Ramirez asserts that he established past persecution because the undisputed evidence established that he was raped on account of his homosexuality. <em>See Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 819, 822-23 (BIA 1990) (a person\u2019s sexual orientation may form the basis for an asylum claim as a particular social group). He contends that his testimony established that his reporting the rape to authorities was futile and that he was not required to demonstrate that the Mexican government refused to protect him. Hernandez Ramirez also contends that the fact that homophobic practices and beliefs continue to exist in Mexico, despite the fact that the Mexican government has prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and engaged in campaigns for tolerance of homosexuals, establishes that he will be persecuted if he returns to Mexico. We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 113 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The petition for review is thus DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b529-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
