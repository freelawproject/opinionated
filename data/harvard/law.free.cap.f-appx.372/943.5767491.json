The Board and the immigration judge denied Tellez\u2019s petition for asylum as untimely and found that Tellez failed to establish that she faced the probability of future persecution or torture if she returned to Colombia. We dismiss in part and deny in part their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Tellez and Torres contend that the Board erroneously denied Tellez\u2019s application for asylum, request for withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the decision that Tellez\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir. 2007); <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). We also deny Torres\u2019s petition to review the denial of withholding of removal and relief under the Convention because the regulations for these forms of relief do not provide derivative benefits. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c); <em>Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">Substantial evidence supports the decision to deny Tellez\u2019s application for withholding of removal. Tellez failed to prove that she suffered past persecution or would likely face persecution in Colombia on account of a protected ground. Tellez\u2019s testimony supports a finding that she was detained and threatened because of her relationship to her father and his business, not on account of an imputed political opinion. Although the record contains evidence that Tellez\u2019s father was a member of the Liberal Party, Tellez testified that her father was detained on account of his business and later threatened for his refusal to provide free hotel accommodations to members of the Self-Defense Forces. Tellez argues that the Self-Defense Forces described her father as being a \u201cguerrilla sympathizer,\u201d but Tellez testified that the Forces said that her father would be considered a sympathizer \u201cif he didn\u2019t allow them to stay\u201d in his hotels. Extortion \u201cdoes not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006); see <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890-91 (11th Cir.2007). Tellez complains that she was denied a \u201ctrue opportunity\u201d to present testimony from her father to establish that she \u201cpossesses] [a] credible and objective fear of being persecuted,\u201d but Tellez waived this argument by declining the invitation of the immigration judge to call Tellez\u2019s father to testify. <em>See United States v. Puleo, </em>817 F.2d 702, 705 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cIt simply will not do for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>counsel to preserve an error for appellate review without giving the trial court a reasonable opportunity to render a decision upon the same objection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Tellez will not likely be tortured if removed. Torture is confined to those acts inflicting \u201csevere pain and suffering, whether physical or mental\u201d committed at the hands, under the direction, or with the acquiescence of \u201ca public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). The 2007 Country Report stated that the \u201clast [Self-Defense Forces] block demobilized in August 2006,\u201d and the government had \u201cconfronted militarily any groups that did not demobilize as well as new criminal groups.\u201d Tellez failed to present any evidence that she would be of interest to the Self-Defense Forces if she returned to Colombia. Tellez also failed to present any evidence that she would be tortured at the direction or acquiescence of the Colombian government. Government forces instead secured her release after she was detained by the Self-Defense Forces. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We DISMISS the petition for review of the denial of asylum and DENY the petition for review of the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
