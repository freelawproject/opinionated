McCray consented to the magistrate judge\u2019s resolution of these motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). However, because the magistrate judge\u2019s orders denying those motions are neither final decisions nor appealable collateral orders, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them in this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Davis v. East Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., </em>78 F.3d 920, 925-26 (5th Cir.1996). His appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">McCray also petitions this court for a writ of mandamus on the grounds that (1) certain of his pretrial motions were granted initially before the magistrate judge issued the order denying them and (2) the defendants were criminally convicted as part of this action and should have already been sentenced. Both of McCray\u2019s asserted grounds are erroneous. McCray\u2019s mandamus petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">McCray previously filed a similar mandamus petition, which was also denied. McCray is warned that any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions upon his ability to file pleadings in this court or any other court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MANDAMUS PETITION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-21\">Pursuant to 5th Ciu. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
