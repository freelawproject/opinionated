After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2s\">A. Naturalization Application</p>\n<p id=\"b948-25\">Roberts is a Jamaican citizen who has been living in the United States for approximately 24 years. In January 2008, Roberts submitted a naturalization application to become a United States citizen. In May 2008, Roberts completed her citizenship interview and passed a civics test and a Federal Bureau of Investigation background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-26\">In June 2008, while her naturalization application was pending, Roberts was arrested on two felony counts of importing cocaine into the United States and possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute it. In October 2008, Roberts pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>guilty in federal court to both counts and received a 21-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) subsequently denied Roberts\u2019 naturalization application. Roberts has not challenged before an immigration officer the denial of her naturalization application. DHS issued a detainer advising that it sought custody of Roberts for purposes of removing her after her prison term ends. Roberts received notice of the de-tainer, but has not received a Notice to Appear commencing removal proceedings. In her appeal brief, Roberts admits that she has not yet been taken into DHS custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">B. First Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">While serving her prison sentence, Roberts <em>pro se </em>filed this civil action seeking: (1) review of her naturalization application; (2) removal of the detainer lodged against her; and (3) a declaration that she is a national of the United States. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Roberts\u2019 complaint, but gave Roberts until June 11, 2009 to file an amended complaint. The district court rejected Roberts\u2019s argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5) provided the jurisdictional basis to review Roberts\u2019 nationality claim. Instead, the district court liberally construed Roberts\u2019 complaint to raise a nationality claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 and concluded that Roberts\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim. The district court also determined that filing her naturalization application and swearing allegiance to the United States were insufficient to make Roberts a U.S. national.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">C. Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">Roberts timely filed a <em>pro se </em>pleading\u2014 titled a Declaration of Nationality \u2014 seeking relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1429 and 1101(a)(22)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and reiterating her claim to being a U.S. national. Roberts also filed a <em>pro se </em>pleading \u2014 titled Judicial Review after Denial of Application \u2014 which reiterated her request to review her naturalization application and the detainer against her and cited 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c) as a jurisdictional basis for relief. Roberts asked the district court to remove the detainer and order the Attorney General to grant her naturalization application.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">The district court construed Roberts\u2019 new filings as her amended complaint and dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction: (1) to review the denial of her naturalization application because she had not exhausted administrative remedies; or (2) to review the detain-er against Roberts because she had not alleged she was in immigration custody pursuant to the detainer. The district court did not disturb its previous ruling denying Roberts\u2019 request for a declaration of nationality. Roberts filed this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">A. Naturalization Application</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes a person whose application for naturalization is denied to seek review of such denial in the district court, but only \u201cafter a hearing before an immigration officer under section 1447(a) of this Title.\u201d INA \u00a7 310(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(c); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 336, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447 (outlining the procedures governing hearings on denials of applications for naturalization). A \u201cdetermination denying an application for naturalization ... shall not be subject to judicial review until the applicant has exhausted those administrative remedies available to the applicant under section 336 of the Act.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 336.9(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Here, Roberts concedes that she has not challenged in a hearing before an immigration officer the denial of her naturalization application, as required by the INA. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Roberts\u2019s challenge to the denial of her naturalization application.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">B. Detainer</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The DHS may issue detainers against aliens arrested for violating controlled substance laws and, if the detainer is issued and the alien is not otherwise in custody, the Attorney General is required expeditiously to take custody of the alien. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 287(d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cUnder certain circumstances, challenges to detainers may ... be brought under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Orozco v. INS, </em>911 F.2d 539, 541 (11th Cir.1990). However, \u201c[t]he filing of [a] detainer, standing alone, [does] not cause [the petitioner] to come within the custody of the [DHS]\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>(affirming dismissal of alien\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenging immigration detainer where alien was incarcerated on state charges); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (requiring \u00a7 2241 petitioner to be \u201cin custody\u201d unless it is necessary to bring him into court to testify or for trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">Here, although Roberts\u2019s complaint alleged that DHS lodged a detainer against her, it did not allege that Roberts was taken into DHS custody and that removal proceedings had commenced. In fact, Roberts alleged that she had not received a Notice to Appear and admitted in her filings that she is not in DHS custody. Under <em>Orozco, </em>the district court properly dismissed without prejudice Roberts\u2019 \u00a7 2241 challenge to her immigration de-tainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">C.Nationality Claim</p>\n<p id=\"ADi\">Citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5), Roberts\u2019 initial complaint sought an order declaring her to be a \u201cnational\u201d of the United States. The district court correctly concluded that \u00a7 1252(b)(5) addresses immigration removal proceedings and did not provide jurisdiction to grant Roberts relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">Section 1252 of Title 8 provides for judicial review of removal orders solely by the Court of Appeals. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(1), (5). Section 1252(b)(5) authorizes the Court of Appeals, in reviewing a final order of removal, to address a petitioner\u2019s nationality claim if there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(A). However, if an issue of fact exists, the Court of Appeals must transfer the proceeding to the district court for a determination \u201cas if an action had been brought in the district court\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(B). Further, \u201c[t]he petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this paragraph.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Here, Roberts has not raised her nationality claim within the context of immigration proceedings, much less in a petition for review of a final order of removal. Thus, \u00a7 1252(b)(5) does not provide the district court (or this Court) with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">In her amended complaint and on appeal, Roberts also cites 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429. Section 1429 delineates the prerequisites for naturalization; it does not give the district court jurisdiction to determine a person\u2019s status as a U.S. national. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The district court liberally construed Roberts\u2019 complaint as a \u00a7 2241 petition and concluded that it failed to state a nationality claim. However, for the same reason the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Roberts\u2019 \u00a7 2241 challenge to her immigration detainer, the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a nationality claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Additionally, because it is clear on the face of Roberts\u2019 complaint that immigration proceedings had not yet begun, the district court did not err in dismissing without prejudice any declaratory judgment action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. <em>See McGrath v. Kristensen, </em>340 U.S. 162, 168-69 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10, 71 S.Ct. 224, 228-29 &amp; n. 10, 95 L.Ed. 173 (1950) (stating that \u201c[wjhere an official\u2019s authority to act depends upon the status of the person affected, in this case eligibility for citizenship, that status, when in dispute, may be determined by a declaratory judgment proceeding after the exhaustion of administrative remedies\u201d and concluding that the plaintiff could bring a \u00a7 2201 declaratory judgment action to determine citizenship status because the Attorney General\u2019s refusal to suspend deportation was a final administrative decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-10\">. Although the district court did not cite a provision for its <em>sua sponte </em>review of Roberts\u2019 complaint, it appears to have been acting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and to have dismissed Roberts' \u00a7 2241 claim for failure to state a claim, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-11\">. Section 1429 of Title 8 provides that a person seeking naturalization must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that he or she is a lawful permanent resident and that there is no pending removal proceeding pursuant to a warrant for arrest. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429. Section 1101 (a)(22) defines the term \u201cnational\" as \"a person owing permanent allegiance to a state.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(22).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-17\">.After filing her notice of appeal, Roberts filed a motion for reconsideration in the district court. The district court construed it as a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and denied the motion. Roberts did not file a notice of appeal after this ruling. Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\">.
