She now appeals her sentence, arguing that (1) the district court erred in imposing a written restitution order that exceeded the restitution amount imposed at sentencing; and (2) her prison term, which is below the sentence range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines, is substantively unreasonable. We consider these arguments in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Appellant points out that the district court indicated its intent at sentencing to credit against her restitution amount the value of the equity in her personal home at the time it was foreclosed, unless the party foreclosing on the property provided a sufficient justification for failing to sell the property. She states that the court conveyed this intent in its written judgment, but provided the foreclosing party a 30-day period to explain its failure to sell the property. She further states that the court never amended the judgment to reflect what, if any, amount should be credited toward her restitution requirement. The Government concedes that a remand is warranted to determine whether and to what extent appellant is entitled to a credit against her restitution amount for the equity in her personal home. We therefore vacate the restitution provision of the court\u2019s judgement and remand the restitution issue with instruction that the district court to clarify what, if any, additional amount should be credited against appellant\u2019s restitution requirement for the equity in her personal home.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable, we employ the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentencing court abuses its discretion when it commits a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Appellant contends that the district court committed such an error here, and therefore abused its discretion, because it did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Section \u00a7 3553(a) requires the sentencing court to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the sentencing guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The court need not \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or ... discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, the court\u2019s sentencing rationale is legally sufficient if the record makes clear that it has considered the evidence and the arguments. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Because the record shows that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, appellant\u2019s argument that her 36 months\u2019 prison term is substantively unreasonable fails. We therefore affirm the prison-term part of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Appellant\u2019s sentence is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">VACATED, in part, and REMANDED with instructions, and AFFIRMED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
