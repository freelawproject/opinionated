He argues that the district court committed significant procedural error by imposing a sentence within the pertinent guidelines range without giving specific reasons for rejecting his nonfrivolous arguments in favor of a sentence below this range. He requests this court to vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">We review Delgado\u2019s argument for plain error because he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). To show plain error, Delgado must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if the error substantially affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-24\">A review of the record does not support Delgado\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider his arguments for a lower sentence. In fact, \u201cthe full sentencing record reveals the district court\u2019s reasons for the chosen sentence and allows for effective review by this court.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 657-58 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 904, 173 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Even if the district court\u2019s reasons were inadequate and constituted error, Delgado cannot show that a more extensive explanation would have changed his 77-month sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See id.; see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 53, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
