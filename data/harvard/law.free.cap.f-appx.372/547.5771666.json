The district court sentenced him to 57 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. The district court, expressing concern that Galan-Castro received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, sua sponte vacated the judgment against Galan-Castro, appointed the Federal Public Defender to represent Galan-Castro, and set the case for resentencing. The district court imposed the same sentence on resentencing, which occurred 14 days after the original sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-22\">The parties both argue that the district court lacked authority to resentence Ga-lan-Castro. This court reviews de novo whether a district court had authority to resentence a defendant pursuant to Rule 35(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>557 F.3d 237, 239 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-23\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s authority to correct or modify a sentence is limited to those specific circumstances enumerated by Congress in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582( [c]).\u201d <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Lopez, </em>26 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1994) (district court authorized to modify term of imprisonment only if one or more bases permitted by \u00a7 3582(c) is applicable). The only statutory predicate potentially applicable to the instant case is \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), which authorizes a sentencing court to modify a sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">Assuming for the sake of argument that the amended version of Rule 35, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>became effective while this appeal was pending, made the district court\u2019s resen-tencing timely, the district court nevertheless overstepped its authority in resen-tencing Galan-Castro. Any sua sponte sentencing modifications must be made \u201cto correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.CrimP. 35(a). Although the district court expressed concerns about counsel\u2019s performance at sentencing, Galan-Castro\u2019s initial sentence did not result from clear error. Galan-Castro\u2019s attorney\u2019s commitment to an argument that could have lengthened Galan-Castro\u2019s sentence did not actually prejudice Galan-Castro since the district court declined to enhance Ga-lan-Castro\u2019s sentence based on counsel\u2019s argument. Further, Galan-Castro\u2019s counsel on resentencing found nothing that would impact Galan-Castro\u2019s sentence that had not previously been called to the district court\u2019s attention, and the district court imposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Because there was no \u201cclear error,\u201d the district court laeked authority to resen-tence Galan-Castro pursuant to Rule 35(a). <em>Ross, </em>557 F.3d at 239-43. Therefore, we VACATE and REMAND this case for reinstatement of the original judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
