The respondent appeals from the judgments of the trial court terminating her parental rights as to the five chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>dren (SC 18086). In the two additional appeals, four of the children<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal from the judgments of the trial court terminating the parental rights of the respondent (SC 18085) and from the court\u2019s subsequent denial of their motion for visitation with the respondent pending the appeal of the termination of parental rights (SC 18087).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the judgments in the appeals pertaining to the termination of parental rights, and we dismiss the appeal pertaining to the motion for visitation as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The record reveals the following facts, as found by the trial court, and relevant procedural history. In May, 2002, the department of children and families (department) received an anonymous telephone call reporting that the respondent, the respondent\u2019s boyfriend (boyfriend) and her six<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> children recently had moved to Connecticut from New York and were living in a one bedroom apartment in Hartford. The anonymous caller further reported that the children were being exposed to sexual activity between the adults and were being sexually abused by the boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The department thereafter conducted a home visit and began an investigation. Through its investigation, the department learned that the respondent and her boyfriend had a history of substance abuse and that the respondent had relapsed. The department also became aware that the respondent had an active case with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>New York state office of children and family services, child protective services, \u201c \u2018for excessive corporal punishment and sexual abuse.\u2019 \u201d The New York agency informed the department that the respondent\u2019s boyfriend had sexually abused Melody and exposed her to pornography, and as a result, the respondent had been ordered to prevent the boyfriend from having contact with the children. The department was further informed that the respondent had violated that order, and that a New York court had ordered her to turn the children over to New York child protective services. The respondent failed to comply with the court\u2019s order and subsequently fled New York with her boyfriend and the children. As a result, in May, 2002, the department removed the four minor children from the home on a ninety-six hour hold pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The oldest of the four, Melody, was then seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>During its continuing investigation, the department further learned that the respondent had moved to Connecticut with her boyfriend and her six children in January, 2002. Once in Connecticut, the respondent failed to enroll any of the children in school. The respondent, her boyfriend and all six children were sleeping together in one bedroom with two beds. During this time, the respondent and her boyfriend engaged in sexual intercourse on numerous occasions in the presence of the children. In addition, both the respondent and her boyfriend physically abused the minor children when disciplining them. In August, 2002, the children were adjudicated neglected and committed to the care and custody of the department. As part of the judgment, the trial court ordered specific steps for the respondent to take to facilitate the return of the children to her, including that she have no further contact with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In December, 2002, the department received a telephone call reporting that Jenira had informed her foster mother that the boyfriend had touched her inappropriately while she was taking a bath dining a supervised visit with the respondent. The report of sexual abuse was confirmed during the department\u2019s interview with Jenira. The respondent admitted that she was still cohabiting with the boyfriend at that time, explaining that she needed his assistance during her pregnancy with Neri Jasmin. The boyfriend drove the respondent to the hospital for the birth of Neri Jasmin, who was bom on January 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In February, 2003, the department received a telephone call reporting that Melinda had informed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>foster mother of a new allegation of abuse, namely, that the boyfriend had sexually abused her while she was in the bathtub, and also had sexually abused Melody and Jenira. Melinda also reported multiple incidents of physical abuse by the boyfriend. Melinda informed the department that she had told the respondent about the abuse and that the respondent had told the children to tell the boyfriend to stop touching them. During an interview with the department, the respondent denied having any knowledge of the sexual abuse and denied that there had been any unsupervised contact between the boyfriend and Neri Jasmin. On the basis of the disclosures and the respondent\u2019s continued contact with the boyfriend, the department removed Neri Jas-min from the home on a ninety-six hour hold pursuant to \u00a7 17a-101g. In September, 2003, Neri Jasmin was adjudicated neglected and was committed to the custody of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The department interviewed Melody on two occasions in February, 2003. Melody stated that the respondent and her boyfriend had engaged in substance abuse in front of the children when they lived in New York and that they had allowed the oldest child, Malcolm; see footnote 2 of this opinion; to smoke marijuana in the home. Melody also reported multiple prior incidents of sexual abuse by the boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">As a result of these disclosures, the department referred Melody to the Aetna Children\u2019s Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center (hospital). During an interview at the hospital, at which a department employee was present, Melody disclosed multiple incidents of sexual abuse by the boyfriend, including penetration and oral sex. Melody further reported that the respondent and the boyfriend would have sexual relations in her presence. Melody also reported that the boyfriend would instruct her teenage brother Marcus; see footnote 2 of this opinion; to \u201chump her\u201d and put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>his penis on her buttocks while in the bathtub together. During this interview, Melody stated that she had reported the sexual abuse to the respondent at least four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The department interviewed Marcus, who confirmed Melody\u2019s reports of sexual abuse. He informed a department employee that the respondent and the boyfriend would have sexual intercourse in the presence of the children and that the boyfriend would talk to him about sex. He also confirmed that the boyfriend would make him get into the bathtub with Melody and direct him to put his penis on her vagina, while the boyfriend watched.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Throughout this period of time from May, 2002, and continuing well into 2005, the department\u2019s goal was to reunify the respondent with her children. She regularly visited with the children, who were generally doing well in their foster homes, and she and the children were being provided services intended to assist in the reunification of the family. In April, 2005, Marcus, who had significant behavior problems and previously had been removed by the department from the respondent\u2019s home, returned to live with the respondent. In July of that same year, Jaime returned to the respondent\u2019s home to live. The respondent thereafter became overwhelmed with her parental responsibilities for Marcus and Jaime at home. She hit one of the boys twice; she allowed Marcus\u2019 health insurance to lapse; she failed to pick up prescription medicine for Marcus and he suffered a seizure as a result; and she left Jaime and the other children, when visiting, in Marcus\u2019 supervision despite having been warned not to do so. Marcus also frightened the other children by tormenting the family cat in front of them. In December, 2005, Marcus and Jaime again were removed from the respondent\u2019s custody. During December, 2005, and January, 2006, the respondent refused to take a test to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>she was again abusing drugs, she stopped seeing her psychiatrist and she stopped taking her prescribed medications. As of January, 2006, the older children had been in the department\u2019s custody since May, 2002, and Neri Jasmin since February, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In January, 2006, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 Q),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the commissioner of children and families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>(commissioner) filed petitions to terminate the parental rights of the respondent to the five youngest children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As grounds for the termination, the commissioner alleged, pursuant to statute, that the children had been adjudicated neglected and committed to the department, that the respondent had been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the children\u2019s return and that she had \u201cfailed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, [the respondent] could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii). The commissioner further alleged, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (C), that the children had been denied \u201cthe care, guidance or control necessary for [their] physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being\u201d by reason of the respondent\u2019s acts of commission or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">After a lengthy trial, the trial court granted the petitions for termination. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court first determined that \u201cprior to filing its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>termination petitions, [the department] made reasonable efforts to reunify each of the children with the [respondent] . . . through offers of and provision of services . . . .\u201d The trial court then found that, \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, as to the [respondent] that [the department] has proved [the grounds for termination based on] . . . failure to rehabilitate, and [the grounds for termination based on] . . . acts of commission or omission (except with respect to Neri [Jas-min], who was not bom at the time of the [acts of commission or omission] incidents).\u201d The court further found that termination was in the best interests of the five minor children. Accordingly, the trial court granted the department\u2019s petitions. These appeals followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">THE RESPONDENT\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The respondent appeals from the judgment of the trial court terminating her parental rights to the five children. On appeal, she claims that: (1) the trial court improperly found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite her with her children; (2) the trial court improperly found that she had failed to rehabilitate herself; and (3) the termination of her parental rights violated her rights under the state and federal constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The respondent first claims that the trial court improperly found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify her with her children. More specifically, she asserts that the trial court improperly found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify her with her children because the department did not provide the respondent and her children with joint or family therapy. In response, the department asserts that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with her children, and that the department had provided family therapy where appropriate. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We begin by setting forth the standard of review for this claim. \u201cIn order to terminate parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 0), the department is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it has made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds . . . that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification .... General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1). The standard for reviewing reasonable efforts has been well established by the Appellate Court. Turning to the statutory scheme encompassing the termination of the parental rights of a child committed to the department, [\u00a7 17a-112] imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>. . . The trial court\u2019s determination of this issue will not be overturned on appeal unless, in light of all of the evidence in the record, it is clearly erroneous. . . . <em>In re Daniel C., </em>63 Conn. App. 339, 361, 776 A.2d 487 (2001).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 632, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. ... On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was factually supported and legally correct. ... In doing so . . . [g]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude that there was adequate evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family. After the four older children were placed in the department\u2019s custody in May, 2002, and the youngest child was placed in February, 2003, the department offered to the respondent numerous services and programs to aid in their reunification. The trial court found that these services and programs included: a program for nonoffending partner parenting and understanding sexual abuse issues; substance abuse evaluation and treatment; individual and group therapy; random urine screening; a child parenting program; court-ordered evaluations; family therapy; supervised and unsupervised visitation; transportation for the respondent and the children; assistance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>obtaining appropriate housing; assistance in obtaining appropriate furniture; intensive family reunification services; in-home services; assistance in obtaining resources for employment; an infant outreach program; parental aide services; and administrative and case management services. The department actually attempted reunification by permitting Jaime to five with the respondent beginning in July, 2005. Until January, 2006, the department\u2019s plan for the family had been to reunify the respondent and her children. Jaime was chosen to be the first child returned home, with the expectation that the others would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The respondent nevertheless asserts that the department did not make reasonable efforts for reunification because it did not provide group or family therapy for her and the children. The evidence in the record, however, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the department provided group therapy for the respondent and her children, where appropriate. The department provided family therapy for the respondent and Jaime, which began in June, 2005, and continued throughout his reunification with the respondent. The respondent\u2019s family therapy with Jaime continued until December, 2005, when Jaime was removed from her care after the attempted reunification failed. In July, 2005, the department began providing family therapy for the respondent and Melinda. This therapy continued until September, 2005. The department also provided family therapy for the respondent and Jenira beginning in August, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In her brief, the respondent specifically asserts that the department did not make reasonable efforts at reunification because it did not provide family therapy for her and Melody. The evidence in the record, however, belies this claim. Melody received individual therapy and her personal therapist did not recommend joint therapy until the fall of 2005. When the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>scheduled an appointment for Melody and the respondent to begin family therapy at that time, the respondent did not show up for the appointment. Thereafter, Melody began withdrawing from those around her, including her foster mother, therapist and department caseworker. As a result, family therapy with Melody was discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the department made reasonable efforts at reunification was not clearly erroneous. Even if the evidence had established that additional family therapy might have been beneficial, such evidence does not render the trial court\u2019s finding clearly erroneous. As we previously have noted herein, \u201c [reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Destiny D., </em>86 Conn. App. 77, 82, 859 A.2d 973, cert. denied, 272 Conn. 911, 863 A.2d 702 (2004). The Appellate Court properly has affirmed findings that the department made reasonable efforts for reunification in cases in which the department\u2019s efforts were far less comprehensive than those in the present case. See <em>In re Alexander T., </em>81 Conn. App. 668, 673, 841 A.2d 274 (\u201c[i]n light of the entire record, the failure to provide the referral, while a lapse, does not make the overall efforts of the department fall below the level of what is reasonable\u201d), cert. denied, 268 Conn. 924, 848 A.2d 472 (2004); <em>In re Ebony K, </em>68 Conn. App. 342, 350, 789 A.2d 1158 (2002) (\u201c[notwithstanding the court\u2019s finding that the department\u2019s response to the [respondent mother\u2019s] request for assistance in obtaining housing was shameful and unacceptable, our review of the evidence admitted at the trial does not leave us with a definite and firm conviction that the court mistakenly found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent and the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The respondent also claims that there was insufficient evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that she had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B) (ii). Specifically, the respondent claims that her compliance with the specific steps ordered by the court at the commitment proceedings for the children demonstrates that she achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation to allow her to assume a responsible position in her children\u2019s lives. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">We first turn to the standard of review that governs this claim. \u201cA trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. ... A finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was factually supported and legally correct. ... In doing so, however, [g]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u201cIn order to terminate a parent\u2019s parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112, the petitioner is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1); (2) termination is in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>interest of the child; General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2); and (3) there exists any one of the seven grounds for termination delineated in \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3).\u201d <em>In re SamoMha C., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In the present case, the department alleged in its petition that the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii). That statute provides for the termination of a child where the child \u201cis found to be neglected or uncared for and has been in the custody of the commissioner for at least fifteen months and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (]) (3) (B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We previously have concluded that, \u201c[p]ersonal rehabilitation . . . refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent . . . [and] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent\u2019s] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . The statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by available support systems. It requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 706, 741 A.2d 873 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Our careful review of the record in the present case reveals that the evidence credited by the trial court adequately supported its finding that the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation. First, contrary to the respondent\u2019s allegations, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had not complied with all of the specific steps ordered by the court. Specifically, the trial court found that although the respondent did participate in individual therapy, she had failed to make progress toward the identified treatment goals. The trial court\u2019s finding was based on a report by the respondent\u2019s therapist in December, 2005, that the respondent \u201ccontinued to use poor judgment and her disorganization was troubling.\u201d The therapist further reported that the respondent would not be able to keep the younger children safe while Marcus was in the home because of his aggressiveness and bullying. The trial court further concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate that she had complied with the requirement to \u201c[sjecure and/or maintain adequate housing and legal income\u201d because the evidence at trial demonstrated that she had not obtained full-time employment sufficient to support the children if they were returned to her. She had exhausted her benefits from the department of social services and could not show how she would be able to support herself and the children. The trial court further found that the respondent did not comply with the substance abuse testing requirements and the requirement that she not engage in substance abuse. These findings are supported by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u201cIn determining whether a parent has achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation, a court may consider whether the parent has corrected the factors that led to the initial commitment, regardless of whether those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>factors were included in specific expectations ordered by the court or imposed by the department. . . . Accordingly, successful completion of expressly articulated expectations is not sufficient to defeat a department claim that the parent has not achieved sufficient rehabilitation.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Vincent D., </em>65 Conn. App. 658, 670, 783 A.2d 534 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In the present case, the trial court found that because the respondent \u201cdid not actually acknowledge and accept her personal responsibility to prevent such horrific sexual acts committed by her boyfriend against [her] children, [she] has been unable to take the steps necessary for her rehabilitation to the point where she could be viewed as a viable resource for the protection and safety of her children, and thus as a viable parenting resource with whom the children could again reside permanently.\u201d The evidence presented at trial supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The department presented testimony from Kelly Rogers, a licensed psychologist. Rogers had conducted five evaluations of the respondent and the minor children from March, 2003, through May, 2006. Rogers testified that the respondent\u2019s personality was that of \u201can individual with very limited frustration tolerance, prone to be impulsive, especially in an emotional sense, having propensity to develop dependent relationships that may alternate with long periods of . . . solitude and isolation.\u201d Rogers further testified that \u201cwhile [the respondent] had been through a great deal of treatment and is able to articulate an understanding of the difficulties in her family system previously . . . she doesn\u2019t address behavioral disturbances on the part of the children in a productive way and that, in my opinion, she is likely to have further impulsive responses to bad behavior from her children; that she may use excessive force or that she may respond in other exaggerated ways that are not productive; that, while there was little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>indication that she is presently in a romantic relationship, that there exists a significant potential for her becoming involved in further dependent relationships ... in which she may become involved in ... an abusive type relationship and expose the children to that kind of dynamic; [and] that as a product of what I\u2019ve characterized as her limited insight, that she will tend to fail to recognize, ignore or minimize mental health concerns on the part of her children that will lead to inadequate treatment of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In addition, in the report of the May, 2006 psychological evaluation completed by Rogers, which was introduced at trial, Rogers concluded that, \u201c[w]hile [the respondent] demonstrates the intellect and understanding necessary to effect productive changes, it is evident that she continues to demonstrate inadequate or inappropriate parenting when given the opportunity to have the children in her care. Such failures are evident despite more than adequate services and an appropriate level of participation in such services. . . . [T]here is little to suggest that the [respondent] will productively improve to the degree that she would consistently parent any of her children in a safe and psychologically healthy manner consistent with their best interests. . . . While she gives the appearance of adequate education in parenting skills, has the intellect to make reasonable decisions regarding their welfare, and has sufficient understanding for self-management, [the respondent] continues to accept little responsibility for the children\u2019s maltreatment\u2014at her hands and at the hands of her former partner. Whatever insight she has gained through education and treatment has not translated to consistency in responsible parenting, and the children are in need of permanency now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The trial court credited Rogers\u2019 testimony and report, the accuracy of which was confirmed by what transpired after Marcus and Jaime were returned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>respondent\u2019s care in 2005. The respondent then displayed an inability to make appropriate decisions for the care of her children, a lack of candor with the department and other service providers, and a failure to follow through on department directives designed to ensure the safety of the children. The department substantiated two incidents of physical abuse of Marcus by the respondent. In addition, the respondent allowed Marcus\u2019 health insurance to lapse and failed to obtain his anti-seizure medication from the pharmacy, resulting in him suffering an epileptic seizure. A teacher from Jaime\u2019s Head Start program also testified that the respondent failed to respond to concerns about Jaime that were raised by teachers at the program while he was in the respondent\u2019s care. Both the respondent and her therapist testified at trial that the respondent had failed to disclose these incidents to the department or the therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Although the record reveals that the respondent was attached to her children, visited with them regularly, and attempted to, and did comply, with several specific steps, it also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that she had not accepted responsibility for the earlier mistreatment of the children and had not rehabilitated adequately so as to be able to parent them safely. We therefore conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent had not achieved a sufficient level of personal rehabilitation after almost four years to encourage the belief that she could parent her children safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The respondent also claims that the trial court\u2019s termination of her parental rights violated her rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the respondent failed to raise her constitutional claims before the trial court, we acknowledge that a party may prevail on unpreserved constitutional claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). It is well established, however, that parties affirmatively seek to prevail under <em>Golding, </em>and bear the burden of establishing that they are entitled to appellate review of their unpreserved constitutional claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Commins, </em>276 Conn. 503, 514-15, 886 A.2d 824 (2005). In the present case, however, the respondent does not seek a review under <em>Golding. </em>Her brief makes no mention of, or request for <em>Golding </em>review. Consequently, we decline to review the respondent\u2019s constitutional claims. <em>Ghant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>255 Conn. 1, 17, 761 A.2d 740 (2000) (\u201c[i]t is not appropriate to engage in a level of review that is not requested\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, the respondent has inadequately briefed her constitutional claim, which is alleged to be an equal protection claim. She addresses the claim in only one and one-half pages of her brief, without any analysis or explanation. We therefore could not address this claim even if <em>Golding </em>review had been sought. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 120, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003) (\u201cWe repeatedly have stated that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the issue properly . . .

On appeal, the children claim that the trial court improperly: (1) admitted expert opinion testimony by Rogers; and (2) concluded that termination of the parental rights of the respondent was in the best interests of Melody and Jaime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Neri Jasmin also claims that the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights without a jury trial violated her rights under our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Our appellate courts have not had the opportunity to determine specifically whether a child may properly appeal from the termination of the parental rights of his or her parent. Accordingly, the threshold issue in the children\u2019s appeal is whether the children have standing to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We begin, therefore, with our well settled principles dictating the nature of that inquiry. \u201cThe issue of stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ing implicates this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. . . . Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy. . . . When standing is put in issue, the question is whether the person whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of the issue .... Standing requires no more than a colorable claim of injury; a [party] ordinarily establishes . . . standing by allegations of injury. Similarly, standing exists to attempt to vindicate arguably protected interests. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u201cStanding is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring an action, in other words statutorily aggrieved, or is classically aggrieved. . . . The fundamental test for determining [classical] aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: [F]irst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in [the challenged action], as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the [challenged action]. . . . Aggrievement is established if there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Eder Bros., <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>275 Conn. 363, 368-70, 880 A.2d 138 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Although this court has not had the opportunity to decide whether a child may bring an appeal from the termination of the rights of his or her parent, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>addressed a similar issue in <em>In re Christina, M., </em>280 Conn. 474, 486-87, 908 A.2d 1073 (2006). The issue in that case was \u201cwhether parents who are respondents to a termination of parental rights petition have standing to assert the constitutional rights of their children who are the subject of the termination action.\u201d Id., 476. We concluded that parents can assert the constitutional rights of their children because \u201cthe rights of the [parents] are inextricably intertwined with those of their children.\u201d Id., 487. In doing so, we relied on <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Alexandria Division of Social Services, </em>16 Va. App. 821, 433 S.E.2d 500 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1050, 115 S. Ct. 651, 130 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1994). In that case, the Virginia Court of Appeals, concluded that \u201c [i]n cases involving parental rights, the rights of the child coexist and are intertwined with those of the parent. The legal disposition of the parent\u2019s rights with respect to the child necessarily affects and alters the rights of the child with respect to his or her parent. [The child] ha[d] a \u2018personal stake in the outcome\u2019 of the proceeding to terminate her mother\u2019s parental rights and, therefore, ha[d] standing to challenge the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s decision to terminate those rights.\u201d Id., 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We find this reasoning to be even more persuasive and directly applicable in the present case, for the issue in <em>Wright, </em>as in the present case, was whether the child had standing to appeal from the termination of her mother\u2019s parental rights. The rights of the children here are inextricably intertwined with those of the respondent. As we recognized in <em>In re Christina M., </em>supra, 280 Conn. 485, \u201cboth the [parents] and the children have a mutual interest in the preservation of family integrity, and the termination of parental status is irretrievably destructive of that most fundamental family relationship.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that the children have established standing to appeal from the judgments terminating the parental rights of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On appeal, the children first claim that the trial court improperly admitted and relied on expert opinion testimony from Rogers. Specifically, the children claim that Rogers lacked the requisite expertise with sexual abuse to testify as an expert in the present case and that his testimony was based on insufficient information about the parties involved. In addition, the children also assert that the trial court improperly allowed Rogers to testify as to the ultimate issue in the case. In response, the department claims that the trial court properly admitted testimony from Rogers and did not abuse its discretion in relying on his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe applicable standard of review for evidentiary challenges is well established. Unless an evidentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the [t]rial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evi-dentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>286 Conn. 499, 532, 944 A.2d 947 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In the present case, Rogers had conducted five evaluations of the respondent and the children from March, 2003, through May, 2006. At the time the commissioner petitioned for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights, the parties agreed that Rogers would conduct another evaluation and answer a series of questions, including, inter alia, \u201c[considering the age and needs of the children . . . whether the [respondent] can achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>period of time, [she] could resume a responsible position in the [lives] of the child [ren].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At trial, the department introduced testimony from Rogers and sought to qualify him as an expert in the areas of clinical psychology, court-ordered evaluations in Juvenile Court and sexual abuse trauma. The respondent and the children objected to Rogers\u2019 qualification as an expert in the area of sexual abuse trauma, but did not object to his qualification as an expert in the other two areas. Indeed, the children\u2019s attorney acknowledged that Rogers, \u201cobviously, has good qualifications as a clinical psychologist and as a court-ordered evaluator . . . .\u201d Thereafter, the trial court qualified Rogers as an expert in the areas of clinical psychology and court-ordered evaluations in Juvenile Court and denied without prejudice the department\u2019s motion to qualify him in the area of sexual abuse trauma, indicating that the parties might not \u201cget to any issue involving expertise in that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Rogers thereafter testified as to the results of his evaluation, including his opinion that the respondent had not rehabilitated herself sufficiently to be able to assume a responsible position in the lives of the children. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court credited Rogers\u2019 testimony and his report of the May, 2006 evaluation, which was also admitted into evidence, wherein he concluded that the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">On appeal, the children first claim that the trial court\u2019s admission of testimony and documentary evidence from Rogers was improper because he was not qualified as an expert in sexual abuse trauma and did not spend an adequate amount of time with the family. We disagree. As we explained previously herein, Rogers was appointed by the court to conduct evaluations of the family on five separate occasions during the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>time period. In this capacity, Rogers met with the respondent and each of the children on numerous occasions. In this capacity, Rogers\u2019 role was to assess the psychological functioning of the respondent and the children and to answer several questions posed by the court. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that Rogers had conducted approximately 1000 court-ordered evaluations of families in Juvenile Court and had extensive experience in the field of clinical psychology. Throughout this time, the respondent and the children never asserted that Rogers was not qualified or was not adequately conducting these evaluations. To the contrary, Rogers\u2019 continuing appointment was by the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">At trial, the court acted consistent with the children\u2019s objection and did not qualify Rogers as an expert in the field of sexual abuse trauma. The children do not point to, and we cannot find, any instance in which Rogers\u2019 testified as to issues specifically related to sexual abuse. Instead, Rogers testified as to the findings of his evaluations, an area in which the court had properly recognized him as an expert without objection from the respondent or the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The children further claim that the trial court improperly allowed Rogers to testify as to the ultimate issue in the case, namely, whether the respondent had achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation or if more time or services would allow her to assume a responsible position in the lives of the children if they were to return home. The children claim that such expert testimony was improper because it called for legal conclusions and was not necessary to help or to inform the court. In response, the department asserts that Rogers\u2019 testimony as to the ultimate issue in the case was consistent with \u00a7 7-3 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence and common practice in Juvenile Court proceedings. Furthermore, the department also asserts that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>present case, all of the parties, including the children\u2019s attorney, agreed that a court-appointed evaluator was needed in this case to assist the court in making determinations about the family. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">This court repeatedly has held that, \u201c[e]xperts can . . . sometimes give an opinion on an ultimate issue where the trier, in order to make intelligent findings, needs expert assistance on the precise question on which it must pass.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35,41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 926, 75 S. Ct. 775, 99 L. Ed. 1257 (1955). This understanding has been codified in \u00a7 7-3 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[tjestimony in the form of an opinion is inadmissible if it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact, except that ... an expert witness may give an opinion that embraces an ultimate issue where the trier of fact needs expert assistance in deciding the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As the Appellate Court aptly has recognized, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting expert testimony is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. . . . Furthermore, [c]ourts are entitled to give great weight to professionals in parental termination cases.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn.

Moreover, the memorandum of decision demonstrates that the trial court considered other evidence as well, but ultimately-concluded that the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation, based in part on her difficulty in reunification with Marcus and her failed attempt at reunification with Jaime in 2005. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Rogers\u2019 testimony regarding whether the respondent had achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The children also claim that the trial court improperly determined that the termination of the parental rights of the respondent was in the best interests of Melody and Jaime.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the children assert that the trial court ignored substantial evidence that Melody and Jaime were bonded with the respondent and that the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights would be detrimental to them.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In response, the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>asserts that the trial court\u2019s determination that the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of Melody and Jaime is supported by the record and was not clearly erroneous. We agree with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe legal framework for deciding termination petitions is well established. [A] hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudica-toiy phase, the trial court must determine whether one or more of the . . . grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 [(j) (3)] exists by clear and convincing evidence. ... If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the dispositional phase. During the disposi-tional phase, the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests of the child. . . . The best interest determination also must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Davonta V., </em>285 Conn. 483, 487-88, 940 A.2d 733 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that a trial court\u2019s factual findings are accorded great deference.

A finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was factually supported and legally correct. ...

We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The children assert that the trial court improperly found that the termination of the parental rights of the respondent was in the best interests of Melody and Jaime because the evidence established that those children shared a bond with the respondent. \u201cOur courts consistently have held that even when there is a finding of a bond between parent and a child, it still may be in the child\u2019s best interest to terminate parental rights.\u201d <em>In re Rachel J., </em>97 Conn.

In the present case, on the basis of our careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of Melody and Jaime was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">At trial, the department introduced an evaluation report prepared by Rogers in May, 2006. In this report, Rogers stated that Melody did not display evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>an ongoing parent-child relationship with the respondent, but had \u201cpositive sentiments regarding [the respondent] ... as a component of their ongoing visitation . . . .\u201d Rogers also pointed out that \u201c[t]he long period outside [the respondent\u2019s] care [approximately four years] has effectively precluded an ongoing parent/ child relation for Melody . . . .\u201d Moreover, Rogers further opined that Melody did not see the respondent as her psychological parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The evidence further established that Melody, who had been the victim of substantial sexual abuse by the respondent\u2019s boyfriend, had negative feelings toward the respondent and that she was afraid of returning to the respondent\u2019s custody. Melody\u2019s foster mother testified at trial that Melody had told her on several occasions that \u201cshe\u2019s afraid of going with [the respondent] because she\u2019s afraid that whatever happened to her before, if [the respondent] did not believe her, what makes her think [the respondent] will believe her now. And also that [the respondent] had moved from [the home she shared with the boyfriend] but only two blocks away.\u201d The testimony at trial also demonstrated that Melody still remained fearful that the boyfriend would return, and began screaming and crying on at least one occasion when she saw a man who resembled him. The foster mother further testified that Melody did not ask for the respondent or talk about her between visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The trial court also relied on Rogers\u2019 report of his consultation with Ellen Pharr, the coordinator of the safe home program in which Melody had recently stayed before being placed in a foster home and who served as Melody\u2019s individual therapist. Pharr reported that Melody shared little about her biological family and spoke of missing her previous foster mother, but made no mention of the respondent. Pharr also reported that she \u201cnever had the impression that [Melody] had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>strong bond\u201d with the respondent and had never heard Melody speak about wanting to return to live with the respondent. Pharr indicated that although Melody initially had been eager to attend family visits, her enthusiasm for such visits waned when Marcus and Melinda stopped attending. On the basis of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the termination of the parental rights of the respondent was in Melody\u2019s best interests was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In his May, 2006 report, which was introduced as a full exhibit at trial, Rogers opined that Jaime also did not display evidence of an ongoing parent-child relationship with the respondent, but had \u201cpositive sentiments regarding [the respondent] ... as a component of their ongoing visitation . . . .\u201d Moreover, Rogers further indicated that \u201cJaime\u2019s age, placement apart from [the respondent] and limited contact with her do not support an ongoing mother/son relation.\u201d Rogers also reported that \u201cJaime did not convincingly articulate his allegiances, but his emotional connection to [the respondent] was not compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Moreover, the evidence at trial demonstrated that when Jaime was returned to the respondent\u2019s care for several months in 2005, the respondent became overwhelmed, physically abused her older child Marcus and left Jaime in Marcus\u2019 supervision against the department\u2019s clear instructions, refused to comply with the department\u2019s request for drug testing, stopped seeing her psychiatrist and stopped taking her prescription medications. As a result, the department had to halt Jaime\u2019s reunification with the respondent and remove him from her care once again. Accordingly, on the basis of all this evidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that termination of the parental rights of the respondent was in the best interests of Jaime was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Neri Jasmin claims on appeal that the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights without a jury trial violated the state constitutional rights of both the respondent and Neri Jasmin. The state correctly points out, and Neri Jasmin seems to concede in her brief, that she failed to raise her constitutional claim in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">As we acknowledged previously herein, a party may prevail on an unpreserved constitutional claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, \u201cif the party affirmatively requests and adequately briefs [her] entitlement to <em>Golding </em>review.\u201d <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>274 Conn. 507, 532, 876 A.2d 1178 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Waz, </em>240 Conn. 365, 371 n.11, 692 A.2d 1217 (1997) (party \u201cwho seek[s] consideration of unpreserved constitutional claims [on appeal] . . . bearfs] the burden of establishing their entitlement to such review under the guidelines enumerated in <em>Golding\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In the present case, Neri Jasmin claims that her constitutional claim is subject to <em>Golding </em>review, but fails in her brief to provide any analysis of her claim under the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. To the contrary, Neri Jasmin merely asserts in one sentence that her claim is subject to <em>Golding </em>review without providing any analysis of the four prongs. See <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 532. We conclude therefore, that Neri Jasmin has failed to establish her entitlement to <em>Golding </em>review of her constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Moreover, we note that Neri Jasmin has failed to provide an independent analysis of her state constitutional claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . .

Accordingly, we decline to review Neri Jasmin\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">THE CHILDREN\u2019S APPEAL FROM THE DENIAL OF THE MOTION FOR VISITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The children also appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying their motion for visitation with the respondent pending these appeals. The children contend that the trial court improperly concluded that there were constitutional implications to the children\u2019s motion for visitation and failed to apply properly the best interests of the child standard in denying the children\u2019s motion. The department responds that the trial court properly denied the motion for visitation because it properly determined that such visitation was not in the best interests of the children. Furthermore, at oral argument in this court, the department asserted that this appeal would be rendered moot if this court were to affirm the trial court\u2019s termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights because the children were seeking visitation only during the pendency of these appeals. We agree with the department that the outcome of the other appeals renders this appeal moot, and, accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. After the trial court rendered the judgments terminating the parental rights of the respondent, the respondent and the children filed nptices of appeal. Shortly thereafter, the children filed two motions with the trial court. In one motion, the children moved to continue regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>visits with the respondent pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-10a<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and 46b-59,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> pending the disposition of the appeals. In the other motion, the children moved to stay the execution of the court\u2019s order terminating the parental rights of the respondent and to continue visitation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-12,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> pending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>outcome of the appeals. After a hearing, the trial court denied both motions. Thereafter, the children filed a notice of appeal from the order of the trial court denying both motions. The children also filed a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s order denying their motion for a stay. The Appellate Court thereafter granted the children\u2019s motion for review, but denied the relief requested therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Because mootness implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this court, we first address whether our resolution of the other appeals relating to the merits of the termination of the parental rights of the respondent renders this appeal moot. \u201cMootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction .... We begin with the four part test for justiciability established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). . . . Because courts are established to resolve actual controversies, before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable. Justiciability requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute ... (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse ... (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ant.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>286 Conn. 367, 373-74, 944 A.2d 276 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201c[A]n actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pen-dency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In the present case, the children appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying their motion to continue visitation with the respondent pending the appeals from the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights. We have now concluded that the trial court\u2019s judgments terminating those rights should be affirmed. These appeals therefore are at an end and we can grant no practical relief to the children in their appeal from the denial of visitation. In their motion, the children sought continued visitation while the two appeals were pending. Our resolution of those appeals, therefore, makes it impossible to grant the children the relief they sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">We recognize that \u201can otherwise moot question may qualify for review under the capable of repetition, yet evading review exception [to the mootness doctrine]. To do so, however, it must meet three requirements. First, the challenged action, or the effect of the challenged action, by its very nature must be of a limited duration so that there is a strong likelihood that the substantial majority of cases raising a question about its validity will become moot before appellate litigation can be concluded. Second, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the question presented in the pending case will arise again in the future, and that it will affect either the same complaining party or a reasonably identifiable group for whom that party can be said to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>as surrogate. Third, the question must have some public importance. Unless all three requirements are met, the appeal must be dismissed as moot. . . . The basis for the first requirement derives from the nature of the exception. If an action or its effects is not of inherently limited duration, the action can be reviewed the next time it arises, when it will present an ongoing live controversy. Moreover, if the question presented is not strongly likely to become moot in the substantial majority of cases in which it arises, the urgency of deciding the pending case is significantly reduced. Thus, there is no reason to reach out to decide the issue as between parties who, by hypothesis, no longer have any present interest in the outcome.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyle, </em>287 Conn. 478, 487 n.3, 949 A.2d 460 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In the present case, we acknowledge that it is possible for an appeal from a motion for continued visitation pending appeal to be decided along with any appeals from the termination judgment in the majority of cases. We are, however, unpersuaded that this possibility makes it likely that \u201cthe substantial majority of cases\u201d raising a question about continued visitation pending appeal will evade review. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>271 Conn. 193, 201-202, 856 A.2d 997 (2004). To the contrary, as the children did in this appeal, any child seeking continued visitation pending appeal may seek a motion for stay of the termination pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-12. If the motion is denied, a child may seek to have that denial reviewed by filing a motion for review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-6,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as the children did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in this case. Indeed, it appears that the children\u2019s appeal from their motion for continued visitation pending appeal is merely an attempt for further review of the same issues decided in the motion for review. Because there is another, more appropriate, avenue for reaching the issue presented by their appeal\u2014namely, a motion to stay\u2014the issue can be reviewed the next time it is presented and is, therefore, not of limited duration. We conclude, therefore, that the children\u2019s appeal does not satisfy the first prong of the capable of repetition, yet evading review doctrine. See, e.g., <em>In re Amy H., </em>56 Conn. App. 55, 61, 742 A.2d 372 (1999) (declining to review challenge to visitation order because respondent parent did not move for stay of execution); <em>In re Clifton B., </em>15 Conn. App. 367, 368 n.l, 544 A.2d 666 (1988) (declining to review whether parents had rights to continued visitation where respondents did not file motion for review of denial of motion for stay and continued visitation). We therefore conclude that the children\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion for visitation is moot and, accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The judgments of the trial court terminating the parental rights of the respondent as to the children are affirmed; the appeal from the order of the trial court denying the children\u2019s motion for visitation is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In this opinion ROGERS, C.

Moreover, in her brief, Neri Jasmin asserted that if the aijjudicatory determinations of the trial court were affirmed, the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of Neri Jasmin.

The tragic family situation portrayed in these pages presents us with the case of a mother who, after an initial period of serious neglect of her children, has redeemed herself through her dedicated efforts to regain her role as a parent. The respondent mother, according to the reliable, well-informed testimony of many witnesses, has complied with each one of the specific steps required by the state despite the inconsistent and, at times, inadequate support of the department of children and families (department). The respondent ended her relationship with the children\u2019s abuser and rejected any other harmful relationships, acknowledged her responsibility for her past mistakes, became and remained substance free, participated fully in therapy, obtained an education, gained employment, secured a dwelling for herself and the children, and overcame all obstacles to maintaining close contact with her children. It is difficult to imagine how any person in this situation could do more toward the goal of being reunited with her children. Her efforts have been so fruitful that the testimony of all but one medical professional witness urged that termination of her parental rights was not in the children\u2019s best interests. That one witness, Kelly Rogers, the court-appointed evaluator on whom the trial court relied almost exclusively in its decision, had minimal contact with the respondent during a period of four years\u2014a mere four sessions encompassing a mere ten hours. In an almost unprecedented development, all five children, whose relationship with their mother was terminated by the court against their wishes, have joined in appealing the termination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The guardian ad litem for the children, Susanne McNamara, strongly supported the respondent\u2019s position\u2014and the children\u2019s best interests\u2014in her extensive trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Although I agree with the conclusion of the majority opinion that, under the current standard of review of a trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights, we are bound to affirm the judgment of the trial court, I write separately to emphasize that these three appeals demonstrate emphatically that a more rigorous appellate review of the record is essential in appeals challenging the termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">1 emphasize specifically that the trial court in the present case did not give appropriate weight to the highly reliable evidence in the record that unmistakably supported the claims of the children and the respondent in opposition to the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights. The trial court granted the petition for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights filed by the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, on the basis of its determinations that the department had proved by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) it had made reasonable efforts toward reunification, and the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1); (2) the respondent had failed sufficiently to rehabilitate herself; see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii); (3) the respondent had denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>each child, with the exception of Neri Jasmin, by reason of an act or acts of commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his or her physical, educational or emotional well-being;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 0) (3) (C); and (4) termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interest of each child. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2). A scrupulous review of the record casts great doubt on the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the department satisfied its burden of showing that it made reasonable efforts to reunify the children, and that the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from the offers of and provision of services to the point where she could be considered to be a parental resource for reunification. Although those conclusions would suffice to call the trial court\u2019s judgment into question, and it is unnecessary for me to reach the issue of whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that termination was in the best interests of the children, I reach that issue, and conclude that the record does not support the court\u2019s conclusion, to demonstrate further that a scrupulous review of the record would yield a different result in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Ordinarily, the factual findings of the trial court are subject to clearly erroneous review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>288 Conn. 345,358,952 A.2d 784 (2008). When, however, \u201cthe factual findings implicate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and the credibility of witnesses is not the primary issue, we will . . . undertake a scrupulous examination of the record to ensure that the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. Under this level of review, the trial court\u2019s judgment will stand unless that judgment is clearly erroneous\u2014the only difference is that in making that determination, we undertake a \u201cscrupulous review\u201d of the record, a level of factual review that we currently do not employ in termination cases. We have applied this heightened level of review of the factual record in cases involving: a criminal defendant\u2019s right to due process; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>282 Conn. 141, 154, 920 A.2d 236 (2007) (scrupulous examination of record to determine whether defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 335, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) (scrupulous examination of record in reviewing finding of aggravating factor); equal protection; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 700-701, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995) (scrupulous examination of record in reviewing trial court\u2019s finding that jury panel was selected randomly); a criminal defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights; see, e.g., <em>State v. Jones, </em>281 Conn. 613, 654-55, 916 A.2d 17 (scrupulous examination of record to determine whether waiver of fifth amendment rights was valid), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 868, 128 S. Ct. 164, 169 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 759-60, 670 A.2d 276 (1996) (scrupulous examination of record to determine whether defendant was in custody for purpose of fifth amendment <em>Miranda </em>warnings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>); fourth amendment rights; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>214 Conn. 146, 154-55, 570 A.2d 700 (scrupulous examination of record to determine whether defendant\u2019s fourth amendment protections were implicated by police interrogation), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S. Ct. 65, 112 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1990); and eighth amendment rights. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>252 Conn. 128, 138, 750 A.2d 448 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(scrupulous examination of record to review trial court\u2019s determination that lethal injection is not cruel and unusual punishment), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S. Ct. 93, 148 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2000).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although the present case is not a criminal matter, of course, it is unquestionable that termination of a parent\u2019s rights implicates a fundamental liberty interest\u2014the right to raise one\u2019s children\u2014that is accorded a unique position in our society. The United States Supreme Court has stated that it is \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this [c]ourt.\u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000). \u201cThe history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 232, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972). In fact, to say that the present case <em>implicates </em>the fundamental right to raise one\u2019s children is a vast understatement. \u201cA termination of parental rights is both total and irrevocable. Unlike other custody proceedings, it leaves the parent with no right to visit or communicate with the child.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 118, 117 S. Ct. 555, 136 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996), quoting <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 39, 101 S. Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). \u201cFew forms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>state action are both so severe and so irreversible.\u201d <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 759, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). The interest of the parent in \u201cthe accuracy and justice of the decision ... is, therefore, a commanding one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, the court has held that due process requires that, \u201c[b]efore a [s]tate may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the [s]tate support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 747-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In arriving at its conclusion that, at a minimum, the state must prove its case in support of termination by clear and convincing evidence, the court employed the due process balancing test set forth in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). For the same reasons that the court concluded that due process requires the clear and convincing standard as the minimum burden of persuasion borne by the state, I believe that due process also requires that a reviewing court examine the record scrupulously to determine whether the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights is supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, in <em>Mathews, </em>the court stated that the \u201cidentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the [g]ov-ernment\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d Id. No one disputes that the private interest at stake in termination cases is a fundamental right protected by both the federal and state constitutions. See, e.g., <em>Troxel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 65; <em>Dutkiewicz </em>v. <em>Dutkie-wicz, </em>289 Conn. 362, 372-73, 957 A.2d 821 (2008); <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 218, 789 A.2d 431 (2002). In sweeping language that has direct application to the case at hand, the court in <em>Santosky </em>described the significant risk of erroneous deprivation in a termination proceeding: \u201cAt such a proceeding, numerous factors combine to magnify the risk of erroneous factfinding. Permanent neglect proceedings employ imprecise substantive standards that leave determinations unusually open to the subjective values of the judge. ... In appraising the nature and quality of a complex series of encounters among the agency, the parents, and the child, the court possesses unusual discretion to underweigh probative facts that might favor the parent. Because parents subject to termination proceedings are often poor, uneducated, or members of minority groups . . . such proceedings are often vulnerable to judgments based on cultural or class bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u201cThe [s]tate\u2019s ability to assemble its case almost inevitably dwarfs the parents\u2019 ability to mount a defense. No predetermined limits restrict the sums an agency may spend in prosecuting a given termination proceeding. The [sjtate\u2019s attorney usually will be expert on the issues contested and the procedures employed at the factfinding hearing, and enjoys full access to all public records concerning the family. The [s]tate may call on experts in family relations, psychology, and medicine to bolster its case. Furthermore, the primary witnesses at the hearing will be the agency\u2019s own professional caseworkers whom the [sjtate has empowered both to investigate the family situation and to testify against the parents. Indeed, because the child is already in agency custody, the [sjtate even has the power to shape the historical events that form the basis for termination.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 762-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The present case exemplifies precisely the type of problems envisioned in <em>Santosky. </em>The state, through its action and its inaction, shaped the course of the termination proceedings. In the state\u2019s determined efforts to pursue termination, the realities of the complex factual situation became obscured in an overly simplistic view of the family relationships involved. As a result, the respondent\u2019s extraordinarily successful efforts to recover from a difficult situation were too readily dismissed. The fact that the testimony of a court-appointed evaluator with disturbingly limited contacts with the family, rather than a state\u2019s witness, had unusual and inappropriate impact on the court\u2019s decision making, should not insulate the factual record from our penetrating review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The addition of the due process safeguard that I propose in this concurrence is, I submit, one of great benefit\u2014namely, a decreased likelihood of an unjust termination of parental rights. Moreover, according the level of factual review that I propose would not subject the trial court\u2019s determinations to more than clearly erroneous review; it would merely require the reviewing court, in applying clearly erroneous review to the judgment of the trial court, to scrutinize the factual record as closely as it would when dealing with the deprivation of liberty that is at issue in criminal cases. The deprivation of liberty and the far-reaching consequences of a parental termination are surely no less important than many of the criminal proceedings that are given scrupulous review. The government\u2019s interest in safeguarding children would not be affected adversely by a more exacting review of the record, because such a review must be conducted solely for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination. This case illustrates that the government\u2019s interest in safeguarding children would, in fact, be strengthened. This balance is appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>priate given the unique nature of the fundamental right to raise one\u2019s children, and given Santosky\u2019s recognition that the interest at stake in parental rights termination cases is \u201cfar more precious than any property right.\u201d Id., 758-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The present case illustrates clearly the need for a more exacting review of the factual record in termination cases. To illustrate, I examine each of the following in turn to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the department met its burden of establishing each requirement by clear and convincing evidence was supported by substantial evidence: (1) the department made reasonable efforts toward reunification; (2) the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from further reunification efforts; and (3) termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is in the best interest of each child. As to each, I conclude that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In arriving at its conclusion that the department had made reasonable efforts toward reunification, the trial court relied on evidence of the services provided to the respondent. The court listed those services as including: the nonoffending partner parenting program, substance abuse evaluation and treatment, individual and group therapy, random urine screenings, child parenting program, court-ordered evaluations, family therapy, supervised and unsupervised visitation, transportation for the respondent and her children, assistance in obtaining appropriate housing, assistance in obtaining furniture, intensive family reunification services, in-home services, assistance in obtaining resources for employment, infant outreach program, parent aide services, and administrative and case management services.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Although the department did provide many services to the respondent, the question, in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the department made reasonable efforts, is whether the department did <em>everything </em>reasonable toward reunification\u2014not necessarily everything <em>possible, </em>but at the very least everything reasonable. See <em>In re Daniel C., </em>63 Conn. App. 339, 361, 776 A.2d 487 (2001). My review of the record reveals that the department failed in three major areas to make reasonable efforts toward reunification: family therapy, visitation, and the first reunification attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Denise Stone, the respondent\u2019s therapist, testified that family therapy was essential to the reunification process. She testified that family therapy would allow the therapist to observe the family functioning as a unit and address any issues that arose in that context. It also would have allowed the children a forum to present the respondent with their concerns about the respondent\u2019s failure to protect them from abuse, and would have allowed the therapist to observe how she responded to those difficult questions. It would have allowed the children an opportunity to process the abuse with the respondent in a safe environment and receive reassurances that she would be able to protect them in the future. McNamara, the children\u2019s guardian ad litem, also testified that the amount of family therapy provided to the family, a service that the experts agreed was essential as part of a reunification plan, was minimal and did not demonstrate a commitment to reunification on the part of the department. She testified specifically regarding Melody\u2019s need for family therapy, a service that had not been provided on any consistent and significant basis by the department, and expressed the view that such therapy would have been essential to assist Melody to work through the trauma of the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Even Rogers, a clinical psychologist and the court-appointed evaluator in the present case, strongly recommended in his first evaluation that family therapy would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>be the \u201cideal\u201d way to address the sexual abuse that the children had suffered, and the resulting erosion of their sense of security in the home and trust in the respondent. He reiterated that recommendation several times, in very strong terms: \u201cFamily therapy must be instituted and at least four sessions . . . are necessary before reunification is considered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In his second evaluation report, Rogers stated that family therapy for about six months to prepare the family for reunification would be reasonable. Such therapy, according to Rogers, would \u201cform an evaluative context to drive the decision whether or not to reunify.\u201d According to Rogers, open communication between the family therapist and all the individual therapists would be required in order for the process to be effective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the recommendations of Stone and Rogers, and McNamara\u2019s opinion of the importance of providing family therapy on a consistent basis, it is not even a close call to say that the provision of family therapy to this family by the department would have been reasonable, and, therefore, that the department should have, as part of its reasonable efforts toward reunification, provided family therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Despite the fact that both Stone and Rogers informed the department that family therapy was an essential component of reunification, the department provided no more than minimal family therapy to the family. Stone testified that she had spoken to Denita Weber, a social worker assigned to the case, several times about beginning family therapy with the respondent and the children. Weber responded initially that Melody\u2019s individual therapist had indicated that Melody was not ready for family therapy at that time. The department gave no reason for the failure to supply family therapy for the younger children at the outset. Eventually, family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>therapy was provided for Marcus, Melinda and Jenira, but the girls\u2019 sessions did not even begin until 2005, three years after the children had been removed from the home, and the sessions stopped soon after they began. Melody appears to have had one family therapy session with the respondent. After the respondent missed one family therapy session with Melody, the sessions were terminated and were not resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Stone and Rogers also both advocated increased visitation between the respondent and the children. Rogers recommended a progressive increase in visitation, from supervised to unsupervised, and in increasing time increments, eventually to include weekend visits, in order to prepare the children for reunification. Stone testified that increased visitation would have assisted in fostering the parent-child relationship. Given this information, it is without question that it would have been reasonable for the department progressively to increase visitation between the respondent and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">When Stone requested increased visitation between the respondent and the children, however, Weber claimed that it would take too much time to schedule the visits and that no one was available to provide transportation. Eventually, in 2005, during the attempted reunification with Marcus and Jaime, the respondent had some unsupervised visitation with Melinda, Jenira and Neri Jasmin, but the frequency of that visitation and the duration of the visits is not clear from the record. McNamara noted specifically in her assessment of the best interests of the children that the department had made only a minimal attempt to implement a progression of visitation\u2014either by increasing the frequency and duration of the visits or by allowing some unsupervised visitation\u2014despite an obvious need for it, and despite the respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>extraordinary commitment to adhere to the existing visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">There is also evidence in the record that the department prematurely abandoned its first attempt at reunification with Marcus and Jaime. Marcus was returned to the respondent in April, 2005. The department transported Marcus back and forth to his individual therapy throughout the attempted reunification. Several issues and concerns arose during the reunification process. The respondent had difficulty controlling Marcus\u2019 behavior and on two occasions hit him. Weber testified that Marcus missed some therapy sessions when he refused to get into the medical cab that came to the house to transport him to therapy. He also refused to take his anti-seizure medication and eventually had a seizure. He missed several medical appointments and the respondent allowed his medical coverage to lapse. The respondent doubtless exercised poor judgment at times, including one occasion when she allowed Marcus to be alone with Jaime during the summer, playing football outside while she was sleeping inside the house. Additionally, Melinda told Weber that, during an unsupervised visit, the girls were left alone with Marcus, who tormented the family cat in the girls\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Several professional service providers testified, however, that all of these issues could and should have been dealt with by assisting the respondent without removing Marcus and Jaime from the home. Patricia Valle, a social worker employed by the Village for Families and Children, worked in the intensive family preservation program (program), which provides services to families in which the department has indicated that the children are at risk of removal. Valle worked with the respondent from March, 2005, through October, 2005, during the attempted reunification with Marcus and Jaime and was aware of the ongoing issues. At the beginning of the first unit of service, which was dedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cated to reunifying the respondent and Marcus, the department and the program identified three goals for the respondent and Marcus: (1) reunification of the respondent with Marcus; (2) the respondent\u2019s provision of a safe and appropriate environment for Marcus; and (3) Marcus\u2019 compliance with the respondent\u2019s house rules. As of June 10, 2005, service with regard to Marcus was terminated because the program determined that the respondent had completed the goals successfully. Valle testified that the respondent had made improvements during the course of the first unit of service in providing structure and discipline for Marcus. Valle worked with the respondent on setting limits for Marcus and establishing clear expectations for him. According to Valle, the respondent greatly improved in her parenting skills and did not hesitate to contact Valle any time that she needed support and guidance. At the close of the first unit of service, Valle recommended that the department continue to support and assist the family toward reunification. At that time, the program opened a second unit of service to reunify the respondent with Jaime. Similar goals were identified for this second unit: reunification, strengthening of parenting skills and provision of a safe and appropriate home environment for Jaime. Valle testified that, in the beginning of his placement with the respondent, Jaime had some delays in his speech. The respondent worked with providers and physicians, who advised her as to how to assist Jaime in improving his speech. Consistent with that advice, she obtained educational toys and worked with Jaime. By the end of the placement, there was a noticeable improvement in his speech development. Valle also testified that the respondent continued to make use of her services, seeking her assistance in being consistent and improving her coping skills. When questioned as to whether she had any concerns about the home environment, Valle responded: \u201cNo. [The respondent] main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>tained a good home, a clean home. She was also going to school at the time, and she had found employment during the second unit of services, and she still maintained a good home, and also, the boys helped out. The boys were now\u2014especially, Marcus was now actively involved. I would come, and I would see the two oldest boys do chores in the kitchen, and they were all functioning well within the home, and it was kept well.\u201d The program terminated the second unit of services because the respondent successfully completed the identified goals. Valle, who was aware of the issues that subsequently occasioned the removal of Marcus and Jaime from the home, once again recommended that the department follow through and continue to assist the respondent in working toward reunification. When questioned regarding the respondent\u2019s level of commitment to her children, Valle responded that she was \u201cvery committed to her children.\u201d She elaborated: \u201cShe was trying to improve their life, and she was trying to make sure that she provided the safety that she stated that she was not able to provide . . . prior ... to her children being removed from her care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Stone testified that when Jaime and Marcus initially were returned to the home, the respondent \u201cstruggled\u201d and was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d at having responsibility for an \u201cactive toddler\u201d and a teenager with behavioral problems. The respondent, however, eventually was able to overcome that anxiety and stress, in part because she actively sought out the support and advice of her therapist, the pastor at her church, and other professionals who were available as part of her support network. The respondent also took the initiative to seek out additional parenting courses offered by the Village for Families and Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">McNamara testified that she had not been notified that Jaime had been reunified with the respondent, and found out about his removal only afterward. In her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>opinion, the department unnecessarily and prematurely removed Jaime on the basis of issues that could have been addressed while Jaime remained with the respondent. Given the opinions of Valle, Stone and McNamara, I conclude that it would have been reasonable for the department to address the issues that the respondent was having during this first attempted reunification while the children remained in the home with her, rather than abandoning the effort entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">That the department could have dealt with the concerns that arose during the first attempted reunification while Jaime and Marcus remained in the home with the respondent is further borne out by the success of the second reunification between Marcus and the respondent. Connie Carter, a family support team clinician employed by Catholic Charities, offered testimony regarding the second reunification between Marcus and the respondent. The family support team (team), which provides intensive in-home services to families, was assigned to assist the respondent during the second reunification attempt. The services were ongoing at the time of trial. At the beginning of the provision of services, the team set goals for the respondent, including establishing appropriate roles, rules and boundaries, creating positive communication, encouraging Marcus to participate in after school activities, and setting consequences for him. Carter testified that both the respondent and Marcus had made progress in attaining those goals, and that the respondent was trying to implement the goals, was willing to discuss issues and welcomed input from the team. She also testified that she was very impressed with the respondent\u2019s ability to follow the team\u2019s recommendations and \u201cgo with it.\u201d For example, the respondent had implemented a rewards program that the team had suggested for Marcus, rewarding him for good behavior at home and in school. The respondent consistently applied the plan, and Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cus was responding by improving his behavior. As compared to other parents in similar situations, the respondent, according to Carter, had a much higher frustration threshold, and was much more willing to accept suggestions and implement them. When Carter observed the respondent and Marcus together, the respondent\u2019s behavior was appropriate and affectionate. Finally, Carter testified that the team\u2019s services would be available to assist the respondent, given a referral from the department, in achieving reunification with the remaining children.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The department\u2019s failure to provide family therapy and to both increase and progress visitation, contrary to the strong recommendations of both Stone and Rogers, coupled with the department\u2019s premature abandonment of the attempted reunification, despite the opinions of Stone, Valle and McNamara that the problems during that reunification could have been addressed without removing the children from the home, leads me to conclude that substantial evidence is lacking in the record for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the department established by clear and convincing evidence that it made reasonable efforts toward reunification. The trial court\u2019s conclusion is further called into question by the testimony of McNamara, the guardian ad litem for the children, that family therapy, progressively increased visitation, and a more committed attempt at reunifying Marcus and Jaime, would have been in the best interests of the children. In light of this scrupulous review of the record, I would conclude that the trial court\u2019s termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">I next turn to the question of whether the department established by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent would have been unable to benefit from further services. In concluding that further services would not benefit the respondent, the court gave unjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ifiably great weight to the testimony of Rogers, the court-appointed evaluator, who conducted a mere four evaluations in this case, spending a total of only ten hours with the respondent over the course of four years, and who testified that the respondent had never accepted responsibility for the sexual and physical abuse suffered by the children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, Rogers testified that, at different times during the course of the court-ordered evaluations, the respondent had claimed that Melody had not told her of the sexual abuse, had stated that although she may have been \u201cpartly to blame for not seeing [the abuse],\u201d she \u201cdid not do anything <em>directly </em>to [her] children\u201d; (emphasis added); and had stated that her addiction to heroin had prevented her from realizing that her boyfriend was sexually abusing the children. Rogers stated that in his opinion, the respondent had \u201cminimize [d]\u201d the sexual abuse and had tried to relegate it to the back of her mind. In the fourth and final evaluation, Rogers stated that, in his opinion, \u201c[the respondent] continues to accept little responsibility for the children\u2019s mistreatment\u2014at her hands and at the hands of her former partner . . . .\u201d The court also relied on Rogers\u2019 statement, in an addendum to his second evaluation, that Stone had told him that the respondent \u201csteadfastly maintained in therapy that Melody never made any disclosure to [the respondent] prior to removal . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Rogers\u2019 testimony regarding the respondent\u2019s pattern of becoming involved in abusive relationships illustrates why both he and the court linked the respondent\u2019s alleged failure to accept responsibility with a supposed inability to benefit from further services. Although Rog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ers admitted that there was no evidence whatsoever that the respondent was currently involved in any relationship, he expressed reservations regarding the respondent\u2019s ability to avoid becoming involved in an abusive relationship in the future, a development that would jeopardize the well-being of the children. In addition to that speculation, he further testified that, given the respondent\u2019s failure to \u201cshow much positive response\u201d from past reunification efforts, it was his opinion that the respondent would tend not to benefit from further reunification efforts. When asked what he meant by stating that the respondent did not show a positive response, he stated that the respondent continued to minimize her role in the abuse and failed to accept responsibility for that role. In other words, Rogers speculated that, because of her alleged failure to accept responsibility, the respondent could allow the same thing to happen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The court also indicated in its memorandum of decision that McNamara\u2019s testimony supported the conclusion that the respondent never swayed from her initial failure to acknowledge the abuse and accept responsibility for her role in it. Specifically, the trial court stated that McNamara testified that \u201c[the respondent] has continued to use the excuse of \u2018I was blinded by my excessive substance abuse\u2019 through the present to excuse her from having or taking responsibility for the sexual abuse of her children, her failure or unwillingness to protect them, and the consequences thereof.\u201d Relying primarily on the testimony of Rogers, but also in part on what it asserted was McNamara\u2019s testimony and Rogers\u2019 testimony of a hearsay statement by Stone, the court concluded that the respondent had failed to acknowledge the sexual abuse to which her children had been subjected and failed to accept responsibility for her role in permitting that abuse to occur. The court considered its conclusion that the respondent never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>accepted responsibility for her role in the sexual abuse as essential to its further conclusion that the respondent had been unable to rehabilitate sufficiently and benefit from further services, stating: \u201cBecause [the respondent] has not been able to acknowledge and accept that she was personally responsible for what happened to and that she failed to protect such children, [the respondent] has been unable to take the steps necessary for her rehabilitation to the point where she could be viewed as a viable resource for the protection and safety of her children, and thus as a viable parenting resource with whom the children could again reside permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s statements concerning McNamara\u2019s testimony in the memorandum of decision, McNamara\u2019s testimony does not at all support the conclusion that the respondent failed to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the sexual abuse suffered by her children. McNamara specifically testified that one of the respondent\u2019s great strengths as a parent was her willingness to learn and change in order to be reunified with her children. She also testified that the respondent openly had acknowledged to McNamara her role in and responsibility for the sexual abuse suffered by her children. McNamara testified that she was \u201cquite confident\u201d that the respondent had accepted responsibility for her part in the abuse. This testimony cannot be reconciled with the trial court\u2019s characterization of McNamara\u2019s opinion on the issue of whether the respondent accepted responsibility. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In addition to misstating McNamara\u2019s testimony, the trial court gave no credence at all to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the mental health care professional who was in the best position to give an opinion regarding the extent and sincerity of the respondent\u2019s acceptance of responsibility\u2014Stone, the respondent\u2019s therapist. Instead, the court chose to accept Rogers\u2019 testimony regarding an alleged hearsay statement made to him by Stone, that the respondent had evaded responsibility for her role in the abuse by maintaining that Melody was lying in reporting that she had told the respondent about the abuse. The court only briefly acknowledged the fact that Stone\u2019s testimony supported exactly the opposite conclusion, and dismissed it immediately because, in the court\u2019s opinion, Stone, and all of the other mental health providers who concluded that the respondent had accepted responsibility for her actions, failed to realize that the respondent\u2019s ultimate acceptance of responsibility was negated by the fact that she ultimately admitted that her addiction to heroin prevented her from being able to protect her children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Stone\u2019s testimony strongly supported the conclusion that the respondent eventually came to acknowledge the abuse and accepted responsibility for her failure to protect her children against their abuser. Stone began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to provide treatment for the respondent in May, 2003, and had continued to treat her until shortly prior to trial, meeting with the respondent on a weekly basis for most of those three and one-half years. The context of Stone\u2019s initial contact with the respondent is also significant; the respondent participated in a program for nonoffending parents of children who were abused and was referred to Stone by the leader of that program when she sought additional services. Stone was in a significantly better position than Rogers, therefore, accurately to assess the respondent\u2019s progress in acknowledging that the sexual abuse had occurred and accepting responsibility for her role in allowing it to happen. She testified that the respondent had made significant progress in therapy, progress comparable to parents who had achieved reunification with their children. She stated that it took some time before the respondent trusted her enough to be able to be honest, in the context of their sessions, about \u201cwhat had led ... to her children being sexually abused.\u201d In the first six months of therapy, the respondent struggled with accepting the fact that her children had been sexually abused. Eventually, however, after the respondent was provided access to the children\u2019s forensic interviews, she gradually moved from acknowledgment that the abuse had occurred to acceptance of her responsibility for not protecting her children from that abuse. Part of that process involved coming to terms with the role that her substance abuse had played in her failure to protect her children from their abuser. Stone also testified that the respondent made significant progress during therapy in understanding the role that domestic violence had played in her past relationships and working toward not repeating the patterns that had led her to seek out abusive partners. For example, Stone testified that the respondent had built considerable support networks for herself, particularly in her church and with the Village for Families and Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>That the trial court only briefly references Stone\u2019s testimony, relying instead on a hearsay statement reported by Rogers that is completely at odds with Stone\u2019s direct testimony during trial, and mischaracter-izes McNamara\u2019s testimony, aptly demonstrates that a scrupulous review of the record in this case and other termination cases is absolutely essential. The true picture of the respondent that emerges from the testimony of these two well-informed witnesses stands in sharp contrast to the image accepted by the trial court as established by clear and convincing evidence, and supported only by the testimony of Rogers on the basis of his limited contacts. What is most concerning is that Rogers\u2019 portrayal of the respondent is not consistent with the opinions of all the mental health care professionals who observed the respondent\u2019s parenting skills after the respondent had made a truly extraordinary effort at transforming herself into a better parent for the sake of her children. For example, Valle\u2019s testimony indicated that she had complete confidence in the respondent\u2019s ability to parent her children safely. Carter, who was still providing in-home services to the respondent at the time of trial, also testified strongly regarding the respondent\u2019s progress, her willingness to accept suggestions and implement recommendations, her ability to cope with frustration and her commitment to becoming a better parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The testimony of two additional mental health care providers who observed the respondent\u2019s parenting skills in dealing with Marcus is also significant. Peter McGreen, a clinical psychologist at Riverview Hospital (hospital), testified regarding his interaction with the respondent while Marcus was committed to the care of the hospital from March, 2006, to July, 2006. He testified that he \u201cfound [the respondent] to be cordial, respectful, interested in what [he] had to say, and very interested in working with the staff at the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>towards making good interventions with Marcus.\u201d He testified further that the respondent was very responsive to the interventions, universally following through on McGreen\u2019s suggestions and assisting by setting goals for Marcus, encouraging him to be cooperative, and giving Marcus feedback regarding his behavior. McGreen observed that Marcus was more cooperative when the respondent suggested behavior than when the same suggestions came from staff. He testified that the respondent was extremely reliable and always on time for visits, despite the fact that it was extremely difficult for her to get there, taking two, sometimes three, buses over a course of two hours in order to get to the hospital. Although other parents in similar situations in the past had become frustrated and had ceased coming, the respondent persisted. He testified that her commitment to Marcus was outstanding, and that she had been excellent to work with, doing whatever was asked of her and following through consistently. When questioned regarding how he found the respondent to be coping with the stress of assisting with Marcus\u2019 treatment, and juggling all of her other responsibilities, including studying for exams, McGreen stated that he found the respondent to be a very calm and even person, who neither overreacted nor underre-acted to stress in her life. On the basis of his interaction with her and observations of her, he stated that he found the respondent to be a very strong parent. He even went so far as to say: \u201c[I]f I had to give her a grade, it would be A+ as a parent, and compared to the other parents that I\u2019ve dealt with over two decades .... she really was outstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Also testifying regarding Marcus\u2019 stay at the hospital was Joan Narad, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the associate medical director at the hospital. She also worked as the unit psychiatrist for Marcus\u2019 unit in the hospital. She, too, testified regarding the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>dent\u2019s frequent visitation, and stated that the respondent was cooperative and eager to learn what would be most helpful to her son. She stated that she observed the respondent during visitation to parent effectively, following the direction of staff to set limits with him, and being very reliable. Narad noted that the respondent encouraged Marcus\u2019 academic interests, and functioned as an \u201ceffective member\u201d of the team. She further testified that the respondent had a \u201cdeep commitment\u201d to Marcus and that she was willing to go to great lengths to be his parent. Despite the stressful circumstances under which the respondent lived, Narad noted that the respondent functioned \u201cquite well.\u201d When asked how she would describe the respondent as a parent, Narad stated that she believed that the respondent was \u201ca parent who has learned a lot and has matured. . . . She\u2019s willing to take in information. She is willing to get help . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Another aspect of the record that does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion is the respondent\u2019s compliance with the specific steps ordered by the court. The respondent complied with all of the specific steps ordered by the court, with the exception of the step that required her to submit to substance abuse assessment. I first note that this step was not ordered as a final specific step in the order dated September 8, 2003. Moreover, as I explain in footnote 11 of this concurring opinion, the department conceded that the respondent maintained sobriety for the two years prior to trial. The remaining specific steps required the respondent to: keep all appointments set by or with the department; keep the department informed of her own whereabouts and that of the children; participate in counseling and make progress toward identified treatment goals; accept and cooperate with in-home support services referred by the department; cooperate with court-ordered evaluations and testing; obtain and cooperate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>with restraining/protective orders and safety plans to avoid domestic violence; sign releases; secure and maintain adequate housing and legal income; refrain from substance abuse; refrain from any involvement with the criminal justice system; inform the department of household changes; cooperate with the children\u2019s therapy; and visit the children as often as the department permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Because the trial court found that the respondent complied with most of the specific steps, I address only those steps that the court concluded that the respondent did not meet or only partially met. The court concluded that the respondent participated in individual therapy, but noted that Stone expressed concern regarding the respondent\u2019s progress on two occasions. Considering the whole of Stone\u2019s testimony at trial, which unequivocally supports the conclusion that the respondent made significant progress toward identified treatment goals, two isolated expressions of concern do not justify the determination that the respondent failed to comply with this specific step. The court also concluded that the respondent did not fully cooperate with Rogers in the testing process, citing to the fourth evaluation report, but it is unclear on what the trial court based this conclusion. The court also noted that the department did not ask the respondent to seek a restraining order against the boyfriend, yet faulted the respondent for failing to do so. Regarding the requirement that the respondent maintain adequate housing and legal income, the trial court faulted the respondent for failing to complete the nursing program, which she began in September, 2006, by the time of trial, which began in November, 2006, and for failing to find full time employment while enrolled in school. The court also concluded, despite the department\u2019s concession to the contrary, and despite the lack of any evidence that the respondent was engaged in substance abuse, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the respondent failed to comply with the specific step requiring her to cease substance abuse. As for the requirement that the respondent comply with the children\u2019s therapy, the court\u2019s finding that the respondent missed many scheduled family therapy sessions with Melody is completely at odds with the record. Weber did not remember how many therapy sessions with Melody had been planned, but she recalled that the respondent missed one therapy session with Melody and that the sessions were thereafter terminated. The court concluded that the respondent complied with all of the remaining specific steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The respondent went well beyond the specific steps ordered by the court. The testimony of the mental health care professionals, along with the testimony of McNamara and Stone, is consistent with the exceptional effort that the respondent made to obtain services to become a better parent for her children. The sheer list of services she sought out and participated in is, to say the least, <em>impressive. </em>Beginning in July, 2002, she participated in a mother/infant outreach program, which lasted until January, 2003. In August, 2002, the respondent was given the specific steps ordered by the court. The day after she was given the specific steps, the respondent contacted Kyle Klecak, the social worker assigned to the case at that time, in order to begin participating in any available services. That same month, the respondent was evaluated for substance abuse. Because she tested positive for heroin and marijuana, the respondent participated in treatment with a relapse prevention group and individual therapy at the Institute for Hispanic Families.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She also participated in a parenting program at the Institute for Hispanic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Families in November, 2002. During the parenting program, the respondent was randomly tested for drugs and alcohol and tested negative. Also in November, 2002, with the assistance of the department, she obtained an apartment and a rent subsidy, and eventually procured a five bedroom home. In February, 2003, the respondent began participating in the nonoffending parent group through which the respondent met Stone, who subsequently provided the respondent with individual therapy that was ongoing at the time of trial. In January, 2003, the respondent was working with the department of labor in trying to find employment, and completed computer training as part of that employment effort. During this time, the respondent attended weekly visitation with her children, and missed only one visit during the entire time that the visitation continued\u2014the day after the boyfriend came to her house, struck her and stole her van. In October, 2006, the respondent completed a program offered by the Village for Families and Children, commonsense parenting. From April, 2005, through September, 2005, she participated in the intensive family preservation program through the Village for Families and Children. Beginning in August, 2006, and continuing through trial, she utilized the services of the Catholic Charities family support team. In September, 2006, after taking classes at Capitol Community College while she was awaiting acceptance, the respondent began the nursing program at the college. She obtained employment through the work study program at the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In sum, the facts in the record are inconsistent with the conclusion that the respondent would not have benefited from further services. As I have detailed, the respondent made extraordinary efforts in obtaining services, the mental health care workers assisting the respondent with her reunification efforts held the virtually unanimous view that she had made significant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>meaningful progress in becoming a better parent, and the testimony of Stone and McNamara clearly indicated that the respondent had made the difficult acknowledgment that her children had been sexually abused by her boyfriend and that she had failed to protect them. On the basis of my scrupulous review of the record, I conclude that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the respondent would not have benefited from further services.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Finally, I believe that scrupulous review of the record reveals that the great weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was not in the best interests of the children. Stone testified that in her opinion, it was in the best interests of the children to be reunified with the respondent. She based her opinion on her observations of the strong bond between the respondent and her children, the significant support network that the respondent had established and the progress that the respondent had made toward becoming a parent who can physically and psychologically protect her children. Stone testified that the corporal punishment that the respondent used during the initial reunification with Marcus was not an ongoing concern. In her opinion, the respondent\u2019s actions during those incidents did not represent her normal parenting style, and instead were responses to extreme stress. She based this opinion on the fact that, during the second reunification with Marcus, no similar incidents had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">McNamara who was questioned as to whether the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interest of each individual child, testified in great detail that termination was not in each child\u2019s best interest. She based her opinion on the bond that the respondent shared with each child, the strong commitment she has to the children, her willingness to learn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and change in order to be reunified with them, and her ability to differentiate the children according to their age, according to their individual personalities, and to make herself available to them in ways that respond to each child\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Specifically, as to Jaime, McNamara testified that the bond between Jaime and the respondent is very strong, and that Jaime has told her that he wants to live at home with the respondent. She also based her opinion on the fact that Jaime is a very active child, and the respondent is able to set appropriate boundaries for him. She has observed the respondent encourage Jaime\u2019s learning needs, and noted that Jaime made progress in his speech development while he was briefly reunified with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">As to Melody, McNamara testified that the bond between her and the respondent is very strong, and Melody has expressed her desire to be reunified with the respondent. McNamara observed that Melody functioned with the other children as the \u201colder sister,\u201d and that the respondent was able to relate to her in that role, and also show interest in Melody\u2019s activities and interests, while at the same time providing an environment that minimizes Melody\u2019s tendency to \u201cact out.\u201d McNamara viewed it as significant that the respondent likely would continue her course of seeking out support networks, and use those skills to advocate for Melody in the school setting, and to encourage Melody to become involved in the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">As to Melinda, McNamara testified that there was a strong bond between her and the respondent, and between her and her other siblings. She testified that Melinda is a good student, and that the respondent, being a person who values education, would encourage that. Melinda also participates in church activities, another pursuit that the respondent values and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>foster and encourage. McNamara commented specifically on the respondent\u2019s willingness to participate in family therapy, and stated that such therapy would be an essential component of any plan to return Melinda, as well as the other children, to the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">As to Jenira, McNamara testified that the bond between her and the respondent, as well as that between her and her siblings, is very strong. McNamara opined that the respondent would encourage Jenira\u2019s budding intellectual curiosity and her interest in church activities. She testified that the respondent\u2019s tenacity and consistency would be a significant resource that would aid her in reunifying with Jenira, as well as the other children. She noted that over the years that the children had been in the department\u2019s custody, the respondent had missed only one visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">With regard to Neri Jasmin, McNamara testified that she shares a strong bond with the respondent, despite having been removed from the home at such a young age. She exhibits excitement and anticipation in relation to upcoming visits and interacts with the respondent as her mother. The same attributes that make reunification with the respondent in the best interests of the other children also persuade McNamara that reunification would serve Neri Jasmin\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">McNamara testified that, despite Marcus\u2019 behavioral problems, he has a strong bond with his siblings, and they with him. That bond, rather than his behavioral problems, according to McNamara, should be the focus in determining whether it is in the best interests of the children to be reunified with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">McNamara also testified regarding the seven factors that the trial court must consider in making its determination that termination is in the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>child. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (k).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As to the timeliness, nature and extent of the services offered and provided by the department, McNamara stated that, in her opinion, the nature of the services offered by the department had not been the most beneficial. The respondent, she observed, had been responsible for actively seeking out the many counseling, educational and community services that had assisted her in preparing to be reunified with the children. That initiative on the part of the respondent speaks strongly of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>commitment to reunification. Regarding the second factor, whether the department made reasonable efforts toward reunification, McNamara testified that, beyond stating that reunification was the projected goal, the department displayed little commitment toward effecting reunification. For instance, despite the need for increased visitation, and the respondent\u2019s commitment to visitation, she noted that there was no progression of visitation\u2014either by increasing the frequency and duration of the visits or by allowing some unsupervised visitation. She also testified as to the minimal amount of family therapy provided to the family, a service that the experts agreed was essential as part of a reunification plan. McNamara also pointed to the failed attempt at reunification with Jaime, Marcus and the respondent, stating that she had not been notified that Jaime had been reunified with the respondent, and found out about his removal only afterward. In her opinion, the department unnecessarily and prematurely removed Jaime on the basis of issues that could have been addressed while Jaime remained with the respondent. As to the third factor, McNamara testified that the respondent had complied with the specific steps ordered by the court, and that the respondent\u2019s compliance persuaded McNamara that the respondent was committed to doing whatever is necessary to achieve reunification with her children. As to the fourth prong, the feelings and emotional ties between the children and the parent, McNamara testified without hesitation that the ties between the respondent and her children are strong. The fifth factor, the age of the children, is also a factor that McNamara believed supported reunification, as the children are young enough that reunification is a reasonable goal. The sixth factor, the efforts that the respondent has made to adjust her circumstances, conduct and conditions to make it in the best interests of the children to return home, is one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>McNamara testified strongly favors the respondent, because of the exceptional efforts that the respondent has taken to improve herself as a parent. She also considered it highly significant that the respondent openly acknowledged to McNamara her role in and responsibility for the sexual abuse suffered by her children.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In contrast to the confident and informed testimony offered by McNamara and Stone that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights would not be in the best interests of the children, the trial court relied on Rogers\u2019 testimony alone that Melody was still experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder, and expressed anxiety regarding the return to the respondent. This must be understood in conjunction with the failure of the department to provide family therapy for Melody and the respondent, therapy that would have assisted Melody in dealing with her anxieties. Family therapy still would be an available option as part of a reunification program between Melody and the respondent. Also, contrary to Rogers\u2019 testimony, McNamara testified that the bond between Melody and the respondent is strong, and that Melody expressed a desire to be reunited with the respondent. Regarding Melinda, the court stated that she is fearful of being returned to the respondent. Again, this is an issue that should have been addressed in timely and consistent family therapy, and still could be. Additionally, McNamara testified that the bond between Melinda and the respondent is strong. As for Neii Jas-min, the court stated only that she was still an infant when removed from the respondent\u2019s care. McNamara observed, however, that despite Neri Jasmin\u2019s early removal, she is strongly bonded to the respondent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>to her siblings. The trial court acknowledged that the bond between Jaime and the respondent is strong, but relied on the failed reunification attempt in concluding that reunification was not in his best interest. The failure of the reunification, however, was in large part due to the department\u2019s premature removal of Jaime and Marcus, without attempting to address the issues while allowing the respondent to retain custody. Regarding Jenira, the court stated only that she views the foster parents as her psychological parents. This is discredited by McNamara\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, I emphasize the wisdom\u2014and the necessity\u2014of subjecting the factual record underlying this and other judgments terminating parental rights to a scrupulous review. A searching review of the record properly recognizes the extraordinary significance of the rights as well as the extreme and irreversible nature of termination. See <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 65; <em>M.L.B. </em>v. <em>S.L.J., </em>supra, 519 U.S. 118. If that level of heightened review were to apply to this appeal, I firmly believe that the proper resolution would be to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights. The record falls far short of providing substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the department met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the children, that the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from the offers of and provision of services to the point where she could be considered to be a parental resource for reunification, and that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of the children. After a scrupulous review of the record, I would conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s judgment was clearly erroneous. Because we currently do not conduct scrupulous review of the factual record in cases such as this one\u2014although I urge that we do\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>I have no choice but to concur with the majority opinion in affirming the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\"> One of the children, Melinda, has withdrawn from the children\u2019s appeals. See footnote 3 of the majority opinion. The other children are Melody, Jenira, Jaime and Neri Jasmin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 CD requires the department to make a three-pronged showing in apetition for termination of parental rights. See footnote 7 of the majority opinion. Each prong must be established by clear and convincing evidence. In the first prong, the department must show that it made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and reunify the child with the parent. If the department can show by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, however, it need not establish that it made reasonable efforts toward reunification. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (1). In the present case, although either finding would have been sufficient to resolve this prong, the trial court found that the department had made reasonable efforts, and also determined that the respondent was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts. Because either of these determinations would support the trial court\u2019s judgment, I address both in considering the first prong of the three-pronged showing required by the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> Because I conclude that, upon a scrupulous review of the record, the trial court\u2019s conclusions regarding the reasonableness of the department\u2019s efforts at reunification and the best interests of the children are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, it is unnecessary to address the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the statutory grounds set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii) and (C) were so supported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> The credibility of the witnesses was not the primary issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.

First, I note that, although the respondent initially denied it, she eventually admitted that she was addicted to heroin. It is not a stretch of credulity to believe that such an addiction would prevent her from being capable of caring for her children and protecting them from her abusive boyfriend. Second, I struggle to comprehend how one can understand, in the context of aproceeding for the termination of parental rights, that failing to prevent the sexual abuse of one\u2019s children due to an addiction to heroin is somehow an \u201cexcuse.\u201d The mere fact that the respondent provided a very credible explanation of how her failure came about does not in any way change the fact that she admitted that she had failed to protect her children. In fact, if the respondent\u2019s substance abuse contributed to her inability to protect her children, not only is it not an \u201cexcuse\u201d for her to accept that connection\u2014 it is an essential step in her rehabilitation as a parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> Although it is troubling that the respondent refused to submit to alcohol and drug testing in December, 2005, and January, 2006, the trial court noted that the department conceded that the respondent had maintained sobriety for two years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> \u201cIn the dispositional phase of a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is not in the best interest of the child.
