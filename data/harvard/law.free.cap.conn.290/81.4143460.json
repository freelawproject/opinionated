The named defendant, Felix C. Santaniello, and the defendant Felix R. Santaniello, administrators of the estate of Elizabeth Santaniello, appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the declaratory judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the National Grange Mutual Insurance Company, declaring that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the defendant insureds, Carbone\u2019s Auto Body, Inc. (Carbone\u2019s), and Nikolas Topintzis, in a wrongful death action brought against them by Felix C. Santaniello and Felix R. Santaniello.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the garage insurance policy (policy) that the plaintiff had issued to Carbone\u2019s did not provide liability coverage for a 1993 Plymouth Voyager (Voyager) operated by Topintzis because: (1) its dealer plate coverage had been deleted by subsequent endorsement; and (2) the garage operations provision of the policy does not extend to the sale of used cars. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The record, including the trial court\u2019s findings in its memorandum of decision, reveals the following facts and procedural history. On May 20, 2003, Topintzis purchased the Voyager from Carbone\u2019s for $320. Because Carbone\u2019s had not yet obtained the title to the Voyager from its wholesaler, Tony March Buick, Inc., Topintzis could not register it in his own name and operated it pursuant to a loaner agreement that he had entered into with Carbone\u2019s on that date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to that agreement, the Voyager was equipped with dealer plates, numbered DD 929, which the state had issued to Carbone\u2019s pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-60 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Six days later, on May 26, 2003, Topintzis was operating the Voyager on Interstate 91 heading southbound, and was involved in an accident that injured Felix C. Santa-niello and killed Elizabeth Santaniello. Thereafter, the defendants commenced a wrongful death action against Topintzis and Carbone\u2019s in the Superior Court for the judicial district of New Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The policy at issue herein was issued by the plaintiff to Carbone\u2019s on January 9, 2003, with an effective date of December 12, 2002. According to the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the \u201cpolicy . . . originally insured three rather than four sets of dealer plates for [Carbone\u2019s]. Although the application for insurance sought coverage for four sets of dealer plates, the plaintiff learned from Mitchell Marcus, the insurance agent with whom it worked, that the fourth plate would be permanently affixed to a 2000 International truck [a flatbed tow truck].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the policy separately listed and insured the truck, there was no reason for the policy to cover a fourth dealer plate and it accordingly did not do so. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cOn or about February 2, 2003, the plaintiff deleted coverage of the three dealer plates with the consent or authorization of Carbone\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> . . . The court credits the testimony of Jeffrey Bums [an underwriter for the plaintiff] that this deletion meant that there was no longer any separate coverage for dealer plates under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u201cCarbone\u2019s received notice of this deletion shortly after February 10, 2003, when Marcus mailed to Car-bone\u2019s the plaintiffs notice of change in policy, along with a covering memo[randum].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To be sure, Carbone\u2019s already had notice of this change because, as the court has found, Carbone\u2019s requested or at least authorized it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u201cAn inspection conducted on or about February 27, 2003, revealed that, notwithstanding this deletion of coverage with Carbone\u2019s approval and knowledge, Car-bone\u2019s was using \u2018four dealer plates ... as floaters . . . primarily on vehicles being towed.\u2019 Carbone\u2019s was thus not relying on a mistaken belief that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>was insuring one remaining dealer plate. Instead, Car-bone\u2019s was still using all four plates despite its request to delete coverage for three such plates and the notice it received that the plaintiff had done so. Further, Car-bone\u2019s was no longer paying, and the plaintiff was accordingly not receiving, a premium for any dealer plates.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Accordingly, the plaintiff brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Topintzis and Carbone\u2019s in the wrongful death action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the first count of the amended complaint, the plaintiff claimed that the Voyager was not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the relevant policy provisions. In the second count, the plaintiff claimed that Carbone\u2019s had materially misrepresented the nature of its business when it applied for the policy, which would bar coverage thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">After a two day trial, the trial court concluded that the Voyager was not covered under the policy because: (1) the dealer plate endorsement was not in effect at the time of the accident; and (2) the Voyager was not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the \u201cgarage operations\u201d provision of the policy because the sale and lease of used cars is not a use commonly \u201cin connection with,\u201d or \u201cnecessary or incidental,\u201d to Carbone\u2019s \u201crepair shop\u201d operations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court rendered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>declaratory judgment concluding that the policy did not provide coverage. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Before turning to the defendants\u2019 specific claims on appeal, we begin with the well established legal principles applicable to insurance coverage disputes, as well as the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[C]onstruction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo. . . . An insurance policy is to be interpreted by the same general rules that govern the construction of any written contract .... In accordance with those principles, [t]he determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. ... If the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, then the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning. . . . Under those circumstances, the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>is to be given effect according to its terms. . . . When interpreting [an insurance policy], we must look at the contract as a whole, consider all relevant portions together and, if possible, give operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the terms of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous, [a] court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms. ... As with contracts generally, a provision in an insurance policy is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading. . . . Under those circumstances, any ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured because the insurance company drafted the policy. . . . This rule of construction may not be applied, however, unless the policy terms are indeed ambiguous.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Zulick </em>v. <em>Patrons Mutual Ins. Co., </em>287 Conn. 367, 372-73, 949 A.2d 1084 (2008); see also id., 378 (not considering evidence of insured\u2019s subjective intent with respect to desired scope of coverage because policy was clear and unambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Finally, a trial court\u2019s resolution of factual disputes that underlie coverage issues is reviewable on appeal subject to the clearly erroneous standard. See <em>Holy Trinity Church of God, in Christ </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>214 Conn. 216, 222, 571 A.2d 107 (1990) (whether insureds were engaged in demolition \u201cactivities excluded by the policies is a factual question, to which the ordinary rules of appellate review apply\u201d); <em>ACMAT Corp. </em>v. <em>Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co., </em>88 Conn. App. 471, 481-83, 869 A.2d 1254 (sufficiency of evidence to prove existence of insurance policy), cert. denied, 274 Conn. 903, 876 A.2d 11 (2005). Such a \u201cfinding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [A] finding is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Echavarria </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>275 Conn. 408, 417-18, 880 A.2d 882 (2005) (whether notice of cancellation of policy was sent subject to clearly erroneous review). Thus, \u201c[i]t is well established that [i]t is within the province of the trial court, when sitting as the fact finder, to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility and effect to be given the evidence. . . . Credibility must be assessed . . . not by reading the cold printed record, but by observing firsthand the witness\u2019 conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . An appellate court must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>because [i]t is the [fact finder] . . . [who has] an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and the parties; thus [the fact finder] is best able to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to draw necessary inferences therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Thalassic Technologies, Inc., </em>285 Conn. 716, 728, 941 A.2d 309 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">We begin with the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the policy did not provide liability coverage for the dealer plates on the Voyager. Specifically, the defendants contend that: (1) the plaintiff failed to execute a clear and unambiguous endorsement that amended the policy to delete the dealer plate endorsement; and (2) even if the policy was amended properly, the original policy provided coverage for four dealer plates, and deleting coverage for three unspecified dealer plates still left coverage on the remaining set. The defendants argue further that this remaining set could have been affixed to the Voyager at the time of the accident, which creates an ambiguity that requires the plaintiff, as the insurer, to bear the burden of resolving the resulting confusion by providing coverage. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">We begin with the defendants\u2019 claim that the deletion of the dealer plate coverage was not a proper endorsement, and, therefore, did not effectively amend the policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Israel </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>259 Conn. 503, 789 A.2d 974 (2002), the defendants contend that the document issued by the plaintiff on February 2, 2003, \u201c[d]eleting three sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of dealer plates,\u201d is not a proper endorsement that clearly and unambiguously amended the policy. In response, the plaintiff distinguishes <em>Israel </em>and argues that it clearly and unambiguously amended the policy via an endorsement, despite the addendum\u2019s failure to use that particular word, because of the messages on the form that was used, as well as the transmission to Marcus and Carbone\u2019s of a revised premium balance. We agree with the plaintiff, and conclude that the addendum was an endorsement that clearly and unambiguously deleted dealer plate coverage from the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts. The total premium for the policy, as originally issued and effective on December 12,2002, was $14,171, and $7317 of that premium was attributable to the dealer plate endorsement that provided liability and uninsured motorists coverage for the \u201c[three] sets of dealer plates.\u201d Indeed, the schedule of covered autos specifically listed the 2000 International truck, coverage for which cost $4756, and also the three dealer plates costing $2439 each for a total of $7317.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The dealer plate endorsement itself was printed on form CA 2003 1097, which advised: \u201cThis endorsement changes the policy. Please read it carefully.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It then provided coverage for, inter alia, customers who had purchased cars, the registration of which had not yet taken effect.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Thereafter, on January 17,2003, Marcus sent a memorandum to Wendy Paro, an underwriter for the plaintiff, asking her to make the following changes to Carbone\u2019s policy, to be effective December 12, 2002: \u201cDelete [three] sets of dealer plates from the above policy, ASAP.\u201d On February 2, 2003, the plaintiff sent an addendum to Marcus refunding $7317 to Carbone\u2019s and stating: \u201cDescription of Change: MTC #1 <em>Effective 12/12/02\u2014Deleting three sets of dealer plates and form CA2003, which no longer </em>applies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, on February 10, 2003, Marcus forwarded that addendum to Carbone\u2019s, with a cover memorandum stating in relevant part: \u201cConfirming your [recent] request, we have deleted [three] sets of dealer plates from your policy. Attached is the corresponding endorsement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u201cA rider or endorsement is a writing added or attached to a policy or certif\u00edcate of insurance which expands or restricts its benefits or excludes certain conditions from coverage.\u201d 2 L. Russ &amp; T. Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed. 2005) \u00a7 18:17, p. 18-24. \u201cWhen properly incorporated into the policy, the policy and the rider or endorsement together constitute the contract of insurance, and are to be read together to determine the contract actually intended by the parties.\u201d Id., p. 18-26. \u201cBecause the policy is the contract, the intent to incorporate endorsements and riders into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the contract, and thus change its terms, must be made clear. The manner of making an endorsement is immaterial, as long as the intent that it be a part of the contract can be ascertained. Outside papers such as riders and slips must be clearly imported into the policy so as to leave no doubt of the intention of the parties.\u201d Id., p. 18-27. Moreover, \u201c[a] later endorsement supersedes a conflicting earlier one.\u201d 1 B. Ostrager &amp; T. Newman, Insurance Coverage Disputes (14th Ed. 2008) \u00a7 1.01 [a], p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We recently discussed the use of endorsements in <em>Israel v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. </em>Co., supra, 259 Conn. 507, wherein we concluded that an umbrella insurance policy was ambiguous because its provisions were \u201cinconsistent regarding the consequences of the [plaintiff insured\u2019s] failure to maintain the underlying coverage required by the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We concluded that the \u201cprovisions conflict[ed], creating an uncertainty as to the status of the umbrella coverage when the underlying coverage is not maintained and rendering the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ambiguous,\u201d and required \u201cthat the policy must be construed so as to provide [the plaintiff insured] with coverage.\u201d Id., 508. In so concluding, we rejected the defendant insurer\u2019s argument that the \u201cuninsured addendum,\u201d which provided that the failure to maintain the underlying coverage would completely vitiate the umbrella coverage, was an \u201cendorsement . . . [that] controls other, more general policy provisions\u201d because \u201c[i]t is clear from the text of the policy that when the [defendant insurer] issued a policy endorsement, they explicitly labeled the endorsement as such. There are two endorsements in the policy at issue in the present case, and they are entitled, respectively, \u2018Policy Endorsement\u2019 and \u2018Amendatory Endorsement.\u2019 In accordance with their status as policy endorsements, these sections clearly and unambiguously indicate to the reader that their teims supersede other terms in the policy. In contrast, the word endorsement does not appear in the uninsured addendum, and . . . that addendum in no way suggests that its terms control over other policy terms.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id., 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We conclude that <em>Israel </em>is distinguishable from the present case, despite the fact that the subsequent endorsement that deleted the original dealer plate endorsement did not use the formal amendatory language or labeling utilized in the endorsements initially attached to the policy. See footnote 16 of this opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and the accompanying text. In <em>Israel, </em>the conflicting provisions at issue were confusing because they both could be read as presently effective. In contrast, the deletion endorsement herein makes absolutely clear and unambiguous that it is deleting both the dealer plate endorsement printed on form CA 2003 <em>and </em>the three sets of dealer plates, as well as crediting back the relevant portion of the premium. A review of the initial schedule of covered autos makes clear that the policy initially covered a 2000 International truck and three sets of unidentified dealer plates. By way of comparison, the amended schedule of covered autos, issued with the endorsement that deleted the dealer plate coverage, lists only the 2000 International truck as still covered. Thus, the deletion endorsement at issue herein clearly and unambiguously effectuated a change to the underlying policy by deleting the floating dealer plate coverage in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Having determined that the dealer plate endorsement properly was deleted from the policy via the subsequent endorsement, we next address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the policy initially provided coverage only for three, rather than four dealer plates.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendants rely on the entry on the application requesting coverage for four dealer plates, and contend that the policy initially insured four dealer plates, meaning that the cancella<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>tion of coverage for three plates left one unidentified plate still covered, which then would require the plaintiff to extend coverage to the dealer plate on the Voyager. They argue that the ambiguity in the application should be resolved in favor of affording coverage because there are four sets of dealer plates, four entries on the declaration for which a premium was paid on the schedule of covered autos, and only three plates in the dealer plate endorsement, meaning that the policy is ambiguous with respect to the number of plates covered. The defendants further note the distinction between dealer plates authorized by \u00a7 14-60 (a); see footnote 4 of this opinion; and those ordinarily affixed to a vehicle, and contend that the dealer plates are intended to be moved between vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In response, the plaintiff contends that the number of insured plates was a \u201ccentral issue at trial,\u201d and emphasizes that it never conceded that coverage existed for the fourth set of dealer plates independent of the 2000 International truck. It contends that those plates were covered solely by virtue of their status as affixed to the truck. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the policy clearly and unambiguously limited coverage to \u201c[three] sets of dealer plates\u201d as described in the dealer plate endorsement, prior to its deletion. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">A review of the \u201cschedule of covered auto[s] you own\u201d in the initial policy makes clear that the policy, with the dealer plate endorsement, covered the 2000 International truck registered in Connecticut and three unidentified Connecticut plates. The premium for the truck is $4756 and the three unidentified plates cost $2439 each to insure\u2014a total of $7317. Reading this schedule in conjunction with the dealer plate endorsement, which provides liability coverage for $7020 and uninsured motorists coverage for the three plates for $297\u2014a total of $7317, makes clear and unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the policy\u2019s coverage of only three floating dealer plates\u2014coverage that was deleted in its entirety by the subsequent endorsement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See part IA of this opinion. The trial court, therefore, properly concluded that the policy never provided coverage for a fourth floating dealer plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 reliance on the application entry seeking coverage for four dealer plates. When there is a discrepancy between the application and the policy, \u201cthe policy, not including the application, is considered to embody the contract of the parties.\u201d 3 E. Holmes, Appleman on Insurance (2d Ed. 1998) \u00a7 15.17, p. 269; see also id. (application \u201cis usually given great weight in determining the intention of the parties, particularly where the insurance contract is sought to be reformed\u201d); 2 L. Russ &amp; T. Segalla, supra, \u00a7 21.25, pp. 21-47 through 21-48 (\u201c[i]f there is an irreconcilable conflict between an application and the policy proper, the latter ordinarily is regarded as controlling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Moreover, to the extent that the application entry is relevant given the unambiguous policy terms, the extrinsic evidence credited by the trial court readily indicates that the dealer plate coverage was never for more than three floating plates. The application as reviewed by Bums, the plaintiffs underwriter, indicates that the plaintiff contemplated that the policy was to cover four dealer plates: \u201c[three] floaters and one is on the vehicle listed on the auto application\u2014the 2000 International [truck].\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Bums\u2019 handwritten notes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>January 6, 2002, noting the existence of \u201c[four] dealer plates,\u201d and stating, \u201c[p]er agent\u2014[one] dealer plate on the truck,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> further support this conclusion. Indeed, Bums testified consistently at trial as well,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> permitting the trial court to conclude that the parties intended the policy to insure no more than three floating dealer plates, prior to its amendment deleting that coverage. See <em>Ceci </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co., </em>225 Conn. 165, 168-69, 622 A.2d 545 (1993) (constming policy \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable layperson in the position of the purchaser of the policy\u201d and noting that underwriter preparing underinsured motorist endorsement \u201chad considerable information about the insured,\u201d namely, that it was small family owned and operated business). Thus, keeping in mind that the appropriate viewpoint from which to read the policy and view the circumstances of its procurement is that of the insured, rather than an injured party seeking to collect from that insured; see, e.g., <em>Israel </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins.

In response, the plaintiff contends that the sale of used cars was \u201cnot necessary or incidental\u201d to Carbone\u2019s auto repair business, thereby precluding coverage under the \u201c \u2018[g]arage operations\u2019 \u201d clause under case law interpreting and applying such policy language. We agree with the plaintiff, and conclude that the policy\u2019s garage operations coverage does not cover the use of the dealer plates on the Voyager sold by Carbone\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">As noted by the trial court, the policy provides liability coverage for \u201ccovered autos\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 I of the policy, namely, symbol twenty-seven, \u201cSpecifically Described \u2018Autos,\u2019 \u201d symbol twenty-eight, \u201cHired \u2018Autos\u2019 Only,\u201d and symbol twenty-nine, \u201cNon-Owned \u2018Autos\u2019 Used In Your Garage Business.\u201d Section II A of the policy, which provides that liability coverage, states that the plaintiff \u201cwill pay all sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies caused by an \u2018accident\u2019 and resulting from <em>\u2018garage operations' </em>other than the ownership, maintenance or use of covered \u2018autos.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The defendants do not seriously dispute the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the Voyager may only be considered a \u201ccovered auto\u201d for purposes of the garage operations policy under symbol twenty-nine, \u201cNon-Owned \u2018Autos\u2019 Used In Your Garage Business.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>provides that \u201cNon-Owned \u2018Autos\u2019 Used In Your Garage Business\u201d are \u201c[a]ny \u2018auto\u2019 you do not own, lease, hire, rent or borrow <em>used in connection with your garage business </em>described in the Declarations.

According to the garage policy declarations, Carbone\u2019s is considered a \u201crepair shop\u201d for coverage purposes as a \u201cgarage business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The policy defines \u201c \u2018[g]arage operations\u2019 \u201d as \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use of locations for garage business and that portion of the roads or other accesses that adjoin these locations. \u2018Garage operations\u2019 [include] the ownership, maintenance or use of the \u2018autos\u2019 indicated in SECTION I of this Coverage Form as covered \u2018autos\u2019. <em>\u2018Garage operations' also include all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>operations necessary or incidental to a garage busi</em>ness.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, a significant threshold issue with respect to this claim on appeal is whether the provision of dealer plates for used cars that it has sold, prior to their registration by their purchasers, is \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201d to Carbone\u2019s \u201crepair shop\u201d business.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The policy\u2019s definition of \u201c \u2018[g]arage operations\u2019 \u201d as \u201call operations necessary or incidental to a garage business\u201d is one of broad applicability. With respect to the word incidental, that term in \u201cordinary speech\u201d \u201cmeans subordinate, nonessential, occurring merely by chance or without intention or calculation, or being likely to ensue as a chance or minor circumstance.\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Ins.

Thus, \u201cwhether an accident arose out of the operation of a service station must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the transaction, its connection with the business and whether it can be said to be a natural and necessary incident or consequence of the operation of the service station even though not a foreseen or expected consequence of that operation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rinehart </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>985 S.W.2d 363, 370 (Mo.

Indeed, the provision of dealer plates to a customer who has recently purchased a car, but has not yet registered it, has been held to be necessary or incidental to the garage operations of those engaging in the sale of vehicles. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. A.L.J.A., Inc., </em>905 F. Sup. 36, 43 (D. Mass. 1995) (provision of dealer plates to prospective purchaser of used vehicle, when sale could not be finished because of missing title certificate, was \u201c \u2018necessary or incidental\u2019 \u201d to merchant\u2019s garage operations to \u201csalvag[e] its goodwill and . . . eventually complete] the deal\u201d); <em>Hartford Ins.

The only two cases that we have found wherein dealer plate coverage was extended via the \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201d garage operations definition have \u201ccovered auto\u201d descriptions that are broader than the symbol twenty-nine definition at issue herein. Indeed, the policies at issue in those cases defined \u201ccovered auto\u201d most broadly, namely, as <em>\u201cany </em>auto\u201d or <em>\u201cany </em>motor vehicle . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>A.L.J.A., Inc., </em>supra, 905 F.

Thus, we find persuasive the plaintiffs reliance on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\u2019s recent analysis in <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>447 F.3d 615, 618-19 (8th Cir. 2006), wherein that court rejected an argument that the sale of an all-terrain vehicle was \u201c \u2018necessary or incidental\u2019 \u201d to a repair shop\u2019s garage operations. The court declined to extend the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>language this far, noting that the shop owner had the opportunity to elect coverage that clearly would have included \u201cDealer\u2019s Autos and Autos Held for Sale by Non-Dealers,\u201d but declined to do so. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 619. Similarly, in <em>American Economy Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Otte, </em>869 S.W.2d 179, 181 (Mo. App. 1993), the court rejected an attempt to extend the \u201c \u2018necessary or incidental\u2019 \u201d clause to the sale of a dune buggy by a repair shop, noting that, although \u201cthe established rule is to construe in favor of coverage . . . that rule is inapplicable where the policy form clearly provides the insured an opportunity to obtain the specific coverage claimed for an additional premium.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Thus, in the present case, Carbone\u2019s had the opportunity to purchase dealer plate coverage that appropriately would have covered the risks presented by the use of such plates in the sale of used cars.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> See <em>Toker </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>60 App. Div. 2d 251, 257, 400 N.Y.S.2d 85 (1977) (rejecting argument that dealer plate endorsement provides coverage only until vehicle is sold because \u201cof the common practice of permitting buyers to drive a car with dealer plates for a few days, and the common understanding that during that period the buyer is covered by the dealer\u2019s insurance\u201d). Indeed, Carbone\u2019s did in fact exercise its right to purchase such coverage, and then promptly acted to eliminate that coverage from its policy. See part I A of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the garage operations portion of the policy does not provide coverage for Topintzis\u2019 operation of the Voyager with dealer plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> The plaintiff also named Carbone\u2019s and Topintzis as defendants in this declaratory judgment action.

No dealer or repairer may loan a motor vehicle or number plate or both to any person except for the purpose of demonstration of a motor vehicle, or when a motor vehicle owned by or lawfully in the custody of such person is undergoing repairs, or when such person has purchased a motor vehicle, the registration of which by him is pending, and in any case for not more than thirty days in any year, provided such person shall furnish proof to the dealer or repairer that he has liability and property damage insurance which will cover any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of the loaned motor vehicle, motor vehicle on which the loaned number plate is displayed or both. Such person\u2019s insurance shall be the prime coverage. If the person to whom the dealer or repairer loaned the motor vehicle or the number plate did not, at the time of such loan, have in force any such liability and property damage insurance, such person and such dealer or repairer shall be jointly liable for any damage to any person or property caused by the operation of the loaned motor vehicle or a motor vehicle on which the loaned number plate is displayed. Each dealer or repairer shall keep a record of each loaned number plate showing the date loaned, the vehicle identification number of the vehicle on which such plate is displayed, the date returned and the name, address and operator\u2019s license number of the person operating any vehicle with such loaned number plate.

Marcus testified that there was no indication in the application or policy that any of those four plates were to be permanently affixed to any particular vehicle. Marcus testified that the discrepancy between the policy and the application was because it turned out that three sets of insured dealer plates were floating plates, and the fourth set of dealer plates permanently was assigned to the International truck. Accordingly, Marcus also testified that he had discussed the application with Jeffrey Burns, an underwriter for the plaintiff, and had informed him that one dealer plate was attached to the truck, although that information was not contained in the written application. Marcus did not inform Carbone\u2019s that, to be covered properly, the plate assigned to the truck needed to be permanently affixed on the truck, although he made that clear verbally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"> The plaintiff deleted the dealer plate coverage when Marcus, acting on behalf of Carbone\u2019s, submitted a memorandum requesting a revised endorsement that removed the three sets of dealer plates from the policy retroactive to December 12, 2002, which the plaintiff issued shortly thereafter. Marcus testified that he was not sure which particular plate number was affixed to the 2000 International truck, and that, because Carbone\u2019s did not specify which three plates should be removed from coverage, he similarly did not specify that in his communications with the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\"> Marcus testified that he did not hear from Carbone\u2019s again until July, 2003, when it requested that coverage be restored to the three sets of dealer plates because of concerns about this accident. That request, however, was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b106-13\"> We note that Alfred Carbone III, the former manager of Carbone\u2019s, testified that he had never spoken with Marcus about removing coverage from any of the dealer plates, and denied receiving any communications either from the plaintiff or Marcus to that effect. Carbone also denied asking them to put the plates back on after this accident. The trial court rejected this testimony as not credible, noting that \u201cthere would be no economic or other motive for Marcus to request a deletion without the consent of Carbone\u2019s, and there are ample economic reasons why Carbone\u2019s would request such a deletion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> This finding is consistent with both the inspection report and the testimony o\u00ed Alfred Carbone III that all four dealer plates were \u201cfloaters\u201d and none were permanently affixed to any one vehicle. Indeed, Carbone believed that the 2000 International truck was insured separately under the policy, and testified that he did not use a dealer plate on it because it had a separate regular plate permanently affixed to it. He said the dealer plates were used early in 2000 when Carbone\u2019s purchased the 2000 International truck, but only temporarily until it. was registered with state wrecker plates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\"> Despite the pendency of this dispute, the plaintiff provided a defense in the underlying wrongful death action pursuant to a reservation of rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> The trial court noted, inter alia, that garage operations coverage could be available if the Voyager was a \u201c[symbol] twenty-nine \u2018covered auto\u2019 \u201d under the policy, a category that covers \u201cNon-Owned \u2018Autos\u2019 Used In Your Garage Business,\u201d defined in relevant part as: \u201cAny \u2018auto\u2019 you do not own, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>lease, hire, rent or borrow used in connection with your garage business described in the Declarations. . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that \u201cthis type of covered auto must be \u2018used in connection with [the insured\u2019s] garage business described in [the] Declarations.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">The trial court stated further that the \u201c \u2018garage business\u2019 defined in the declarations of the policy is \u2018repair shop.\u2019 \u201d It compared the statutory definition of \u201c \u2018[r]epairer\u2019 \u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 14-51 (a) (3), to the definition of \u201c \u2018[u]sed car dealer\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 14-51 (a) (2), and concluded that \u201cthe statutes define \u2018used car dealer\u2019 to encompass repair work, but do not define \u2018repairer\u2019 to include sale or leasing. For these reasons, the [Voyager] was not used in connection with the repair shop business and was therefore not a [symbol] twenty-nine covered auto.\u201d The trial court further noted that, \u201c[a]lthough the evidence revealed that Carbone\u2019s was in fact a used car dealership, Carbone\u2019s simply did not obtain coverage, and pay the appropriate premium, for a policy that would cover all autos or even autos sold by dealers. Thus, under no theory did the policy provide coverage for the [Voyager].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> The trial court rejected, however, the plaintiffs separate claim that the policy was void because Carbone\u2019s had materially misrepresented the nature of its business in its application for coverage.

We observed that, \u201c[t]he \u2018Your Duties to Us\u2019 provision of the umbrella booklet and the \u2018Coverage U\u2019 section of the uninsured addendum provide the [defendant insurer] with inconsistent remedies for the [plaintiff insured\u2019s] failure to maintain the requisite underlying insurance on his automobile. The first provision indicates that in the event of an insured\u2019s failure to maintain underlying coverage, the insured will be responsible for any loss up to the amount of the required underlying coverage before the umbrella coverage takes effect. The latter provision provides that the insured forfeits umbrella coverage completely if he or she does not maintain the requisite underlying coverage.\u201d Id., 509.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> We also rejected the defendant insurer\u2019s argument that the language of the uninsured addendum \u201cclearly indicates to the reader that the condition contained therein is specific to that section and thus controls over the more general \u2018Your Duties to Us\u2019 provision in the umbrella booklet.\u201d <em>Israel </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. </em>Co., supra, 259 Conn. 511. We concluded that \u201cthe use of the phrase \u2018[a]ll other provisions of this policy apply,\u2019 without accompanying language indicating that the provisions of the \u2018Coverage U\u2019 section control over other generally applicable policy provisions, exacerbates the ambiguity by seemingly giving effect to the conflicting language in the umbrella booklet, leaving no basis for the [insured] to determine which provision is applicable.\u201d Id., 511-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> The defendants also contend in passing that, because the parties agreed that there were four dealer plates, the trial court improperly decided an issue not before it; see, e.g., <em>Sabrowski </em>v. <em>Sabrowski, </em>282 Conn. 556, 560-61, 923 A.2d 686, aff'd after remand, 105 Conn. App. 49, 935 A.2d 1037 (2007); in determining that there were only three dealer plates insured by the policy. This claim is without merit. The trial court, in its province as fact finder in this factually complicated case, necessarily had to resolve discrepancies between the application and the policy, as well as the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Determining the allotment of the dealer plates between floaters and the International truck was a necessary part of that task.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\"> We disagree particularly with the defendants\u2019 argument that the endorsement deleted only three dealer plates, leaving coverage for one set of plates. The language on the endorsement, specifically, its reference to <em>\u201cand form CA 2003,\" </em>in conjunction with the \u201cthree sets of dealer plates,\u201d makes clear that the endorsement deleted all coverage of that nature. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> Bums observed at trial that the policy charged separately for the fourth plate, which was affixed to the 2000 International track. He stated, however, that this was only for the purpose of calculating premiums, and that the policy did not require any particular plate to be affixed to the truck permanently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> The notes state further that the \u201cinsured keeps the dealer plates as [they are] cheap to keep but impossible to get.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\"> Burns did note, however, that the February 27,2003 insurance inspection report reflected that all four of the dealer plates were used as floaters at that time. He disagreed, however, with this portion of the report, based on what Marcus had told him about one of the plates being affixed to the truck, and elected to believe Marcus over the content of the report. He did not seek further clarification from Carbone\u2019s on this topic, though.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> Similarly, for garage operations coverage for \u201cother than covered \u2018autos,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 IIA of the policy provides in relevant part that the plaintiff \u201cwill pay all sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies caused by an \u2018accident\u2019 and resulting from \u2018garage operations\u2019 other than the ownership, maintenance or use of covered \u2018autos\u2019.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\"> As noted previously, the trial court concluded that the Voyager was not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the definitions of symbols twenty-seven and twenty-eight. See footnote 11 of this opinion. The defendants contend perfunctorily, in a footnote in their brief, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion with respect to symbol twenty-eight, \u201cHired \u2018Autos Only,\u2019 \u201d was improper. The policy defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u201cHired \u2018Autos Only\u2019 \u201d under symbol twenty-eight as: \u201cOnly those \u2018autos\u2019 you lease, hire, rent or borrow. This does not include any \u2018auto\u2019 you lease, hire, rent or borrow from any of your \u2018employees\u2019 or partners or members of their households.\u201d The trial court concluded that the Voyager was not covered under symbol twenty-eight because there were no \u201cindicia of a loan\u201d from Tony March Buiek, Inc. to Carbone\u2019s since Carbone\u2019s had obtained the vehicle from Tony March Buiek, Inc. only after paying a negotiated wholesale price for it, with the intention of reselling it, and the title documents \u201csimply trailed the actual exchange of ownership, a situation recognized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACX\">The defendants, however, rely on General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (d), which defines, for purposes of the financial responsibility statutes, \u201c \u2018[o]wner\u2019 of a private passenger motor vehicle\u201d as \u201cthe person who owns the legal title thereto, except where the motor vehicle is the subj ect of a security agreement or lease with option to purchase with the debtor or lessee having the right to possession, in which event \u2018owner\u2019 means the debtor or lessee.\u201d Even assuming the defendants\u2019 briefing of this claim to be adequate, we disagree with this claim for substantially the same reasons advanced by the trial court. See <em>DeRubbo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>161 Conn. 388, 393-94, 288 A.2d 430 (1971) (notwithstanding dealer\u2019s failure to provide customer with certificate of title in accordance with motor vehicle statutes, possession and title passed to customer in accordance with Uniform Commercial Code when customer operated car, with dealer plates, for several weeks and paid for it in full).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> Cf. <em>Julien Moore R-W Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>122 N.H. 328, 333, 444 A.2d 543 (1982) (\u201c [i]t is not uncommon for motor vehicle service stations and automobile repair shops to engage in the rental of trucks and automobiles, and a reasonable person could conclude that such rental activities are incidental to the garage operations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> We need not, therefore, consider the parties\u2019 statutorily based arguments with respect to whether the commonly understood definition of repair shop encompasses the sale of used vehicles. We note, however, that the extent to which Carbone\u2019s is a used car dealer, which the plaintiff would not have insured, rather than the repair shop contemplated by the policy, was a hotly contested factual issue before the trial court with respect to the plaintiffs material misrepresentation claims. Marcus, the insurance agent, testified that he was not aware that Carbone\u2019s sold cars in the scope of its garage operations, and that he would not have submitted the application to the plaintiff had he been aware that it was a used car dealer. Carbone\u2019s, however, had a used car dealer\u2019s license in December, 2002, and sold approximately 200 cars in 2003. Alfred Carbone III testified that he did not tell Marcus about this aspect of the business or provide copies of the license because Marcus did not ask.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Indeed, Bums testified that the plaintiff would not have issued the policy-had it been aware that Carbone\u2019s was a licensed used car dealer, and stated that, when the plaintiff issued the policy, Bums had understood Carbone\u2019s to be an auto repair facility working on cars and light trucks. Bums explained that the plaintiff did not become aware that Carbone\u2019s was not simply a repair shop until March, 2003, when he received an insurance inspection report that he had ordered about its operations to determine whether the auto body name was a misnomer, given that the plaintiff did not insure body shops. He concluded, based on the report, that the policy should not be renewed because Carbone\u2019s sold approximately fifty cars per year, and the plaintiff did not write coverage for auto body shops or used car dealers in 2003, despite the fact that Carbone\u2019s already had cancelled coverage on three of the dealer plates. The plaintiff determined that it would be difficult to cancel the policy because more than sixty days had passed from the effective date, so it elected for nonrenewal in the future rather than cancellation at that time. Because of our conclusion with respect to the coverage provided by the policy, even assuming the primary operations of Carbone\u2019s to be the sale of used vehicles, we need not, however, consider the resolution of these factual questions in any detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> Similarly, like the repair shop in <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>supra, 447 F.3d 619, Carbone\u2019s could have, but did not, purchase coverage under symbol thirty-one, which defines, as a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d \u201cDealers \u2018Autos\u2019 And \u2018Autos\u2019 Held For Sale By Non-Dealers Or Trailer Dealers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
