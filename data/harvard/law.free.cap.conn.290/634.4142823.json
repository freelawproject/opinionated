We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. On the evening of January 13, 2006, a police officer stopped the defendant while he was operating his car in the town of Wallingford. He was arrested after failing field sobriety tests, and subsequent chemical tests showed his blood alcohol content to be 0.198 and 0.173 percent. The state charged the defendant in a two part information with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and failure to display lights in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Subsequently, the department of motor vehicles (department) conducted an administrative hearing pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>suant to \u00a7 14-227b (g),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at which the hearing officer found that: (1) the police officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for a violation specified in that statute; (2) the defendant was placed under arrest; (3) the defendant submitted to chemical analysis, the results of which \u201cindicated a [blood alcohol content of 0.16 percent] or more\u201d; and (4) the defendant was operating a motor vehicle at the time of his arrest. The commissioner ordered that the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license be suspended for ten months pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The defendant subsequently moved, inter alia,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to dismiss all the charges against him on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>trying him for his alleged violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) would violate his state and federal constitutional protections against double jeopardy because he already had been \u201cconvicted\u201d of the same offense in the administrative proceedings that were conducted pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>235 Conn. 614, 626-28, 668 A.2d 1321 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1221, 116 S. Ct. 1851, 134 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1996), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>257 Conn. 769, 779-80, 778 A.2d 947 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1138, 122 S. Ct. 1086, 151 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2002), in which this court concluded that an administrative license suspension pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b was not a punishment and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s rights against double jeopardy were not violated by his subsequent prosecution for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a. Thereafter, the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">As we understand the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal, he contends that: (1) his federal constitutional protections against double jeopardy preclude his prosecution under \u00a7 14-227a because the commissioner\u2019s order suspending his license constitutes a \u201c l[c]onviction\u2019 \u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (21);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>criminal prosecution also is barred by the state constitution, which provides greater double jeopardy protections than does the federal constitution. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The defendant first contends that, since the commissioner\u2019s order suspending his license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (i) constitutes a \u201c \u2018[c]onviction\u2019 \u201d as defined by \u00a7 14-1 (21), it is a conviction for purposes of the federal double jeopardy analysis under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989), as modified by <em>Hudsonv. United States, </em>522 U.S. 93,118 S. Ct, 488, 139 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1997), thereby precluding further prosecution of the criminal charge under \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He further argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 614, is distinguishable because that case was limited to the issue of whether an administrative suspension was a punishment, rather than a second prosecution or conviction for the same offense. In response, the state contends that the present case is controlled by our decision in <em>Hickam. </em>The state further relies on <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>252 Conn. 38, 49, 743 A.2d 1110 (1999), for the proposition that, the language of \u00a7 14-1 (21) notwithstanding, administrative license suspension proceedings are civil and do not place the defendant or licensee in jeopardy. We agree with the state, and conclude that the commissioner\u2019s suspension of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (i) was not a criminal conviction and, therefore, the continued criminal prosecution under \u00a7 14-227a did not violate his federal and state constitutional rights against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. Butler, 262 Conn. 167, 174, 810 A.2d 791 (2002). \u201cThe fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: No person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .... The double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment is made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\u201cWe have recognized that the [d]ouble [j]eopardy [c] lause consists of several protections: It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bletsch, </em>281 Conn. 5, 27, 912 A.2d 992 (2007); see also, e.g., <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969), overruled on other grounds by <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 798-99, 109 S. Ct. 2201, 104 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1989). It is the second protection against double jeopardy that is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Our analysis necessarily begins with a review of our factually and procedurally similar decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 614, even though that case involved the third double jeopardy protection. In <em>Hickam, </em>as in the present case, the defendant had been arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a), and the commissioner had suspended her driver\u2019s license pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>to \u00a7 14-227b prior to her criminal trial. Id., 617. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, we noted that, under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 448-49, \u201ca civil or administrative sanction that serves a legitimate remedial purpose and is related rationally to that purpose does not give rise to a double jeopardy violation even if the sanction has some deterrent effect. Conversely, no matter what its label, a sanction or portion thereof that seeks only to punish triggers the protection of the double jeopardy clause.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 623. We obseived that \u201cmost courts that have spoken directly to the issue of whether an administrative license suspension following an arrest for driving while intoxicated raises a double jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>bar to prosecution have consistently relied upon <em>Hamper's </em>explicit holding and have determined that if a license suspension furthers the legitimate remedial goal of public safety, it is not punishment in the double jeopardy context even if it has an incidental deterrent or retributive effect.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 622. Noting that \u201cthe legislative history of \u00a7 14-227b reveal[ed] that a principal purpose for the enactment of the statute was to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>public by removing potentially dangerous drivers from the state\u2019s roadways with all dispatch compatible with due process\u201d; id., 624; we concluded that a postarrest license suspension under \u00a7 14-227b \u201cis sufficiently remedial so that the administrative suspension does not bar a future prosecution for the same conduct that gave rise to the suspension.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The defendant argues, however, that <em>Hicham </em>is distinguishable because the present case implicates the second double jeopardy protection, namely, that against multiple convictions or prosecutions for the same offense. We disagree. It is well settled that prosecutions or convictions for double jeopardy purposes arise only from proceedings that are \u201cessentially criminal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 528, 95 S. Ct. 1779, 44 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1975); id., 528-30 (juvenile delinquency proceedings are essentially criminal because of impact on respondent and procedural protections afforded). Further, we have recognized \u201crepeatedly that a license suspension hearing is <em>not </em>a criminal proceeding and that the subject of such a hearing is not entitled to all of the procedural protections that would be available in a criminal proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 49; id., 49-50 (reasonable and articulable suspicion not required to justify initial stop for purpose of administrative proceeding). Accordingly, we agree with those few sister state courts that have considered this precise issue, and we conclude that an administrative license suspension proceeding is not a criminal prosecution that gives rise to a conviction for double jeopardy purposes. <em>See Deutschendorf v. People, </em>920 P.2d 53, 57 (Colo. 1996) (\u201cBecause each of the cases before us involves a criminal prosecution following a civil proceeding, they do not constitute separate criminal prosecutions after acquittals for the same offenses. The petitioners were not \u2018prosecuted\u2019 by the [department of [rjevenue, nor did the administrative resolution of their civil cases in their favor constitute \u2018acquit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tais.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mertz, </em>258 Kan. 745, 750-51, 907 P.2d 847 (1995) (\u201ceven though the defendant\u2019s license has been administratively suspended, the defendant has not been \u2018prosecuted\u2019 for the \u2018offense\u2019 of driving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gustafson, </em>76 Ohio St. 3d 425, 436, 668 N.E.2d 435 (1996) (court proceeded to multiple punishments analysis after concluding that \u201c[d]ouble jeopardy prohibitions do not preclude the state from trying a defendant criminally . . . after an administrative license suspension\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Undaunted by this voluminous body of adverse case law, the defendant relies on \u00a7 14-1 (21), which defines a \u201c \u2018[c]onviction\u2019 \u201d as, inter alia, \u201can unvacated adjudication of guilt, or a determination that a person has violated or failed to comply with the law in a court of original jurisdiction <em>or an authorized administrative tribunal </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also footnote 10 of this opinion. The defendant\u2019s reliance on this definition, which is ambiguous when viewed in the context of the relevant statutes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is misplaced, as neither the text nor the legislative histories of \u00a7 14-1 (21) or \u00a7 14-227b evince any intention that an administrative suspension forecloses future criminal proceedings against the defendant for the same offense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>1 (21), although codified in the motor vehicle statutes\u2019 broadly applicable definition section, was originally enacted as No. 90-263, \u00a7 1 (a) (16) of the 1990 Public Acts (P.A. 90-263), which had adopted the Uniform Commercial Driver License Act. The legislature enacted P.A. 90-263 to comply with federal law<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that conditioned the receipt of certain highway funds on the states\u2019 enactment of commercial driver\u2019s license programs to address various safety problems, including the maintenance of multiple licenses in different states to minimize the administrative impact of checkered driving records. See, e.g., 33 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1990 Sess., pp. 3168-69, remarks of Senator Michael P. Meotti (discussing federal requirement that all states enact system for commercial driver license program under Uniform Commercial Driver License Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In addition, we note that the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d in the Uniform Commercial Driver License Act, or in \u00a7 14-1 (21), is taken nearly verbatim from the federal regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, which are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 383.5 (2008).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The term is utilized in the context of the commercial driver licensing statutes governing the notification of the department; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>44j;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the disqualification of license holders upon the \u201cconviction\u201d of certain offenses, either in Connecticut or in other states. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-44k <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, there is nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 14-1 (21) that suggests that the legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>for administrative suspensions to preclude subsequent criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Moreover, the legislative history of the amendments to \u00a7 14-227b, subsequent to the original enactment of what is now \u00a7 14-1 (21), makes clear the legislature\u2019s continued understanding that an administrative suspension does not foreclose criminal proceedings for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a. For example, when the legislature enacted No. 99-255 of the 1999 Public Acts, which, inter alia, lengthened administrative suspension periods for defendants with higher blood alcohol content; see General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (i); Senator Martin M. Looney noted that first time offenders who successfully complete the alcohol education program \u201care eligible to have the charge removed from their record and not to suffer the court imposed suspension. Although they do, of course, suffer an administrative suspension through the [department].\u201d 42 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1999 Sess., pp. 2908-2909; see also id., p. 2909, remarks of Senator Looney (noting that defendants who appear intoxicated and refuse testing receive \u201ca 180 day administrative suspension by the [department], entirely apart from whatever happens in the disposition of the court case\u201d); id., p. 2933, remarks of Senator Robert L. Genuario (\u201c[U]nder our law, first time offenders face two consequences. One is the judicial context, judicial consequence. And the other, by virtue of legislation passed by this General Assembly several years ago, is the administrative revocation of a license.\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Thus, we find persuasive <em>State </em>v. <em>Arterburn, </em>276 Neb. 47,48,751 N.W.2d 157 (2008), a recent decision rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d under the Nebraska commercial driver\u2019s license statute;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 60-4,168 (7) (Cum. Sup. 2006); renders an administrative license suspension a conviction for double jeopardy purposes. In <em>Arterburn, </em>the Nebraska Supreme Court concluded that it did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights against double jeopardy to prosecute him criminally for driving while intoxicated, despite the fact that he already had been disqualified from holding a commercial driver\u2019s license based upon the administrative license revocation that had followed his arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Arterburn, </em>supra, 52. Emphasizing that the \u201clanguage used by the [legislature in a statute is not always dispositive\u201d; id.; the court disagreed with the defendant\u2019s argument that the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201c \u2018conviction\u2019 \u201d in the statutory definition \u201cexpressly demonstrates that [it] intended disqualification for commercial licensees to be a criminal sanction. \u201d Id. The court stated that this argument \u201cfails to consider the intent of the commercial driver\u2019s license legislation ... to reduce or prevent commercial motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and injuries\u201d; id.; and also noted that the \u201cprocedural mechanisms established by the [legislature to enforce the statute,\u201d including the administrative forum and lower burden of proof, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>civil in nature.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id., 53. The court, therefore, concluded that it did not violate double jeopardy protections to prosecute the defendant criminally after he had been administratively disqualified from holding a commercial driver\u2019s license. Id., 57. Given the legislative history and language of our own statutes, especially when viewed in light of the now well established decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 614, we agree with <em>Arterb-um, </em>and conclude that an administrative license suspension under \u00a7 14-227b does not constitute a conviction for purposes of the federal double jeopardy protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The defendant next claims that, under the double jeopardy protections of the due process clause contained in article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution; see footnote 2 of this opinion; \u201cthe state constitution provides even greater protection to our citizens than does the [federal] [constitution and would not only extend double jeopardy protection to the [department] proceedings, but in addition, would provide increased double jeopardy protection beyond that offered by the strict and technical <em>[Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932)] test.\u201d Providing the bare rudiments of an analysis under <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), the defendant argues for the application, as a matter of state constitutional law, of our now defunct holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>213 Conn. 74, 92, 566 A.2d 677 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2586, 110 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1990), overruled in part on other-grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>257 Conn. 782, 794-95, 778 A.2d 938 (2001), that, under the federal constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201c \u2018if the same evidence offered to prove a violation of the offense charged in the first prosecution is the sole evidence offered to prove an element of the offense charged in the second prosecution, then prosecution of the second offense is barred on double jeopardy grounds, regardless of whether either offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s state constitutional arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">First, we have concluded in part I of this opinion that double jeopardy principles do not apply because successive prosecutions and convictions did not occur, as the administrative proceedings were civil in nature and did not give rise to a \u201cconviction.\u201d Thus, the precise analysis for determining whether the parallel proceedings under \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a and 14-227b implicate the \u201csame offense\u201d simply is not dispositive of the issues in this appeal. See also footnote 11 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Second, to the extent that the defendant claims that our state constitution provides him with greater protection in this context, namely, that the administrative proceedings should be considered a criminal prosecution giving rise to a \u201cconviction\u201d as a matter of state constitutional law, he has not explained why that claim is not foreclosed by our recent conclusion that: \u201cThe constitution of Connecticut does not contain an express prohibition against double jeopardy. Instead, we repeatedly have held that the due process guarantees, presently encompassed in article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, include protection against double jeopardy. . . . We have observed, however, that the absence of an explicit constitutional double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>jeopardy provision strongly suggests that the incorporated common-law double jeopardy protection <em>mirrors, rather than exceeds, </em>the federal constitutional protection. ... [A] historical review reveals that the exclusion of a textual ban on double jeopardy from the constitution of Connecticut was not the result of oversight but, rather, the product of a conscious decision by our constitutional forebears.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Michael J., </em>274 Conn. 321, 350-51, 875 A.2d 510 (2005).
