On April 8, 2005, the victim, Dwayne Massey, was shot in the head while he was walking with his cousin, Michael Santana, on Dover Street in New Haven. The defendant was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a), and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217 (a). Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress a tape-recorded statement that he had made to detectives from the city of New Haven while he was detained in South Carolina. In that statement, the defendant admitted to shooting the victim. The trial court denied the motion. Following a jury trial, the defendant was acquitted of the charge of murder but was found guilty of the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-55a. The jury also found the defendant guilty of carrying a pistol without a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>mit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-five years, and probation for a term of five years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress his tape-recorded statement. On appeal, the defendant argues that, because South Carolina does not afford the right to counsel during extradition proceedings,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant cannot have knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel with reference to the Connecticut criminal charges in this action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The record reveals the following additional facts that are relevant to our resolution of.this claim. Subsequent to the issuance of an arrest warrant for the defendant, Detective Andrew Muro of the New Haven police department notified the United States Marshals Service that the defendant was \u201cin the Carolinas . . . .\u201d Acting upon information from the New Haven police department, Deputy United States Marshal Stewart Cotting-ham, Jr., filed an application and affidavit for a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>warrant in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina for an address located at 615 Simmons Street, Florence, South Carolina. On May 18, 2005, Cottingham executed the warrant, whereupon the defendant was arrested and taken to the Florence County detention center. On May 19, 2005, the defendant waived extradition to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On that same day, New Haven Detectives Martin Dadio and Michael Quinn (detectives), met with the defendant in South Carolina to investigate the homicide. In a tape-recorded statement, the defendant admitted to the shooting. As part of that statement, the defendant also claimed that the shooting was in response to an incident in which the defendant alleged that Santana and the victim had been part of a group that had fired shots at him and others one or two weeks earlier. When the defendant\u2019s group and the victim\u2019s group recognized each other, the defendant asked for, and received a gun from a nearby friend, and then fired shots at the victim and his associates. The defendant claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">On March 3, 2006, the trial court held a hearing to address the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his tape-recorded statement. At that hearing, the detectives each testified as follows. The defendant, subsequent to his arrest in South Carolina, notified authorities in that jurisdiction that he wished to speak with New Haven police. Thereafter, the detectives flew to South Carolina, where they met privately with the defendant at police headquarters in Florence County. The detectives introduced themselves and announced the purpose of their visit. The defendant appeared interested and eager to talk to them. During that interview, the defendant was not handcuffed and neither detective was armed. The detectives read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a standard waiver form, and the defendant signed the form indicating that he waived those rights. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the defendant signed the waiver, his demeanor was calm, and there were no signs that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol, narcotics, or any other substances. At no time during the interview was the defendant deprived of any food or water, nor was he denied any requests that he made. Moreover, at no time did the detectives make promises or pressure the defendant to waive his rights. With respect to the defendant\u2019s background, he had prior experience with the criminal justice system, including prior misdemeanor and felony convictions, and had received a tenth grade education. After speaking with the detectives, the defendant agreed to provide a tape-recorded statement. At no time did the defendant request an attorney or indicate that he wanted to do so. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We first set forth the standard of review and applicable principles of law. \u201cThe admissibility of a confession is initially a question of fact for the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 40, 554 A.2d 263 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schroff, </em>206 Conn. 182, 195-96, 536 A.2d 952 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 162-63, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). In view of the constitutional dimension of the issue, the trial court\u2019s finding of [whether the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing] is, however, subject to an independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 478, 512 A.2d 189 (1986). We review the record in its entirety and are not limited to the evidence before the trial court at the time the ruling was made on the motion to suppress.\u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>215 Conn. 739, 742, 578 A.2d 1031 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 51, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cTobe valid, a waiver must be voluntary, knowing and intelligent. . . . The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. . . . Whether a purported waiver satisfies those requirements is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>288 Conn. 684, 697, 954 A.2d 135 (2008). Moreover, \u201c[i]n considering the validity of a waiver, we look to the totality of the circumstances of the claimed waiver.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>281 Conn. 613, 654, 916 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 868, 128 S. Ct. 164, 169 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cWhether the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under <em>Miranda </em>depends in part on the competency of the defendant, or, in other words, on his ability to understand and act upon his constitutional rights. . . . Factors which may be considered by the trial court in determining whether an individual had the capacity to understand the warnings include the defendant\u2019s experience with the police and familiarity with the warnings . . . his level of intelligence, including his IQ . . . his age . . . his level of education ... his vocabulary and ability to read and write in the language in which the warnings were given . . . intoxication . . . his emotional state . . . and the existence of any mental disease, disorder or retardation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 697-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly found that the defendant validly had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In this case, the defendant signed an express written waiver of his rights. \u201cAn express written or oral waiver is strong proof of the validity of the waiver.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 52. In addition, the record established that the defendant: (1) was familiar with the criminal justice system; (2) was reasonably intelligent, having achieved a tenth grade education; (3) expressed no uncertainty regarding his rights and appears to have fully understood them; (4) was not under the influence of alcohol or any narcotic substance when he was advised of his rights; and (5) did not suffer from any mental illness or defect that could have adversely affected his ability to comprehend fully his rights. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>supra, 288 Conn. 698-99 (upholding validity of waiver on similar grounds); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 52-53 (same). Consequently, in light of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that he cannot have waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights knowingly because South Carolina does not afford the right to counsel during extradition proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>dant predicates his argument on the theory that he reasonably could have believed that if he actually had invoked his right to counsel during the interview with the detectives, he would not have been provided with counsel in light of the South Carolina extradition practice. The defendant then argues that because he did not, in fact, have a right to counsel for purposes of extradition, he cannot have waived his rights knowingly with respect to the custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">This argument is without merit. In essence, the defendant confuses his fifth and sixth amendment rights to counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The fact that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time of his extradition proceedings has no bearing on the validity of his waiver of his fifth amendment right to counsel with respect to the custodial interrogation. The flaw in the defendant\u2019s argument is that he bases his contention on a mistaken belief that he did not have <em>any </em>right to counsel, including a fifth amendment right, while being interrogated on the charge of murder. As the United States Supreme Court made clear in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 469, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>(1966), however, \u201cthe right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the [f]ifth [ajmendment privilege under the system we delineate today.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 233, 460 A.2d 961 (1983) (\u201c[t]he rights of a defendant against self-incrimination prior to the formal commencement of a judicial criminal proceeding against him are, of course, protected by the <em>Miranda </em>warning requirements\u201d). To be sure, if the defendant had invoked his right to counsel, the detectives would have been required to honor it to the extent required by law. Otherwise the purported confession would have violated the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right to counsel. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>219 Conn. 743, 750, 594 A.2d 972 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the fact that the defendant had no right to counsel for the purpose of extradition confused him with respect to the waiver of his right to counsel during the interrogation by the detectives. The defendant never questioned the detectives as to how he could have a right to counsel during the interrogation even though he did not have a right to counsel with respect to extradition. Indeed, it is clear from the record that the defendant was aware of his right to counsel for purposes of his interview with the detectives, and that he waived that right. Specifically, on the waiver form, the defendant placed his initials next to the box indicating that he understood that he had a right to counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, when the detectives asked the defendant whether he had read and understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights and whether he had agreed to waive them, he unequivocally replied, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Because there is substantial and uncontroverted evidence to establish that the defendant knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s jury charge was improper because it failed to reinstruct the jury that the state bore the burden of disproving the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt after the jury sent the court a note asking to be reinstructed on the definition of reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cThe standard of review for claims of instructional impropriety is well established. [I]ndividual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>instruction misled the jury. ... In other words, we must consider whether the instructions [in totality] are sufficiently correct in law, adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peeler, </em>271 Conn. 338, 360-61, 857 A.2d 808 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 845, 126 S. Ct. 94, 163 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The record reveals that at the close of trial, the court charged the jury, inter alia, on the elements of the crimes charged, the definition of reasonable doubt and the application of the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. It is undisputed that the trial court\u2019s initial charge properly instructed the jury on the law relating to these concepts. During deliberations, however, the jury sent various questions to the court regarding aspects of the jury charge. In order to frame the issue properly, we detail the relevant questions and the court\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The jury\u2019s first relevant question stated: \u201cHow or when do you factor in self-defense? If we find guilty of any charge then how do we proceed? (in layman\u2019s terms beyond that).\u201d In response, the trial court reissued its initial five page instruction, in which it detailed how the claim of self-defense applied to each of the charges. Prior to reissuing that instruction, the trial court advised the jury that \u201cif there is still confusion, if there [are] still some issues in your mind, send me another note to that effect being as specific as you can as to what [the] particular question is.\u201d The trial court then followed its reinstruction on the issue of self-defense with another reminder to the jury that \u201cif there is still confusion in your minds or if you still have questions, come back with another note to me indicating that and I will do my best to perhaps approach it in a different manner.\u201d After the court sent the jury back to deliberate, the defendant voiced two concerns regarding the court\u2019s reinstruction on self-defense: (1) that it was not clear that the jury understood that the court\u2019s references to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cjustification\u201d meant the same as \u201cself-defense\u201d; and (2) that the jury was not clear that, at some point, it had to deal with the state\u2019s burden to disprove self-defense in its deliberations, specifically that it had to decide whether the state either \u201cfailed to disprove self-defense or disproved self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As a result of the defendant\u2019s concerns, the trial court called the jury back and issued two supplemental charges to address the defendant\u2019s concerns.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Some time later that day, the jury sent out an additional note stating: \u201cMay we have a definition of reasonable doubt?\u201d After the court indicated to counsel that it intended to reissue its original charge on the definition of reasonable doubt, the defendant requested that the court remind the jury that reasonable doubt applies to both \u201cthe elements and the self-defense instruction.\u201d The state objected asserting that \u201cI think that\u2019s already been covered.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court reissued its original charge on the definition of reasonable doubt without reference to its application to either the charged offenses or the claim of self-defense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>counsel took exception to the supplemental charge on the ground that it referenced reasonable doubt within the context of guilt only, without explicit reference to its application to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It is well established that \u201cindividual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>277 Conn. 735, 746, 894 A.2d 928 (2006). We conclude that the charge, when reviewed in its entirety, was proper. The trial court issued thorough and complete instructions at the outset and went to great lengths to address the jury\u2019s subsequent inquiries. As the state\u2019s brief aptly points out, the trial court expressly instructed the jury on <em>nineteen </em>occasions that the state bore the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For example, with respect to the charge on the count of murder, the court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he burden of proof on a claim of self-defense is on the state. The state must convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] was not justified in his actions under the law of self-defense.\u201d Similarly, after describing the ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ments of the claim of self-defense, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he state must disprove each of these elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In addition to the trial court\u2019s initial instructions regarding the state\u2019s burden with respect to the claim of self-defense, the trial court also reiterated that concept in response to the jury\u2019s question regarding the point at which it is proper to factor in self-defense. After the trial court reissued its previous summary on the application of self-defense, the trial court stated that \u201c[a]lso, if at any point you find that the state has not disproven justification beyond a reasonable doubt as to a particular charge, you would return a verdict of not guilty as to that charge and any remaining lesser included charges.\u201d Later, after the trial court called the jury back to address the two concerns raised by defense counsel, the court reiterated that the state bore the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See footnote 15 of this opinion. The jury did not make any further inquiries regarding the application of self-defense despite the trial court\u2019s two admonitions that it should do so if it remained confused. \u201cThe jury is presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 544, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Turning to the jury\u2019s request for the definition of reasonable doubt, we conclude that nothing within that question indicates that the jury was confused as to the state\u2019s burden with respect to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>State v. </em>Fletcher, 10 Conn. App. 697, 525 A.2d 535 (1987), aff'd, 207 Conn. 191, 540 A.2d 370 (1988), should persuade us to reach a different conclusion. In that case, the trial court improperly refused to give <em>any </em>further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>instruction in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry on issues related to self-defense and reasonable doubt. Id., 699-700. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court because it determined that the trial court erroneously believed that it had discretion to refuse to respond to a jury inquiry if it did not believe that the request was a unanimous product of all twelve jurors. Id., 701, 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The present appeal is distinguishable from <em>Fletcher </em>for two reasons. First, the trial court in this case <em>did </em>respond to the jury\u2019s inquiries and issued detailed instructions on the application of self-defense and on the definition of reasonable doubt. Second, the jury in the present case, unlike the jury in <em>Fletcher, </em>did not request a rereading of the charges and simultaneously express confusion as to the claim of self-defense. Id., 708. Instead, the jury in this case first asked the court to clarify \u201c[h]ow or when do you factor in self-defense,\u201d and the court, in response, issued a clear and concise summary of the application of self-defense to each charge. The jury did not indicate any further confusion as to the application of self-defense, despite the trial court\u2019s two invitations to ask follow-up questions if confusion remained on that issue. Later, in a separate and distinct inquiry, the jury asked for the definition of reasonable doubt. The trial court responded with an appropriate instruction that expressly referenced neither the elements of the crimes charged, nor the elements of self-defense. The jury did not issue any further inquiries. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>29 Conn. App. 754, 761-62, 618 A.2d 65 (1992) (\u201c[a]bsent a request by the jury seeking further instruction on the concept of self-defense or justification, or clear indication evincing confusion on the law relating to that defense, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are not abridged by the failure to reinstruct on the defense\u201d), cert. denied, 225 Conn. 904, 621 A.2d 287 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>106 Conn. App. 359, 364 n.2, 942 A.2d 480 (absent request or confusion, trial court not required to broaden scope of jury\u2019s inquiry), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 920, 949 A.2d 482 (2008); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stavrakis, </em>88 Conn. App. 371, 388, 869 A.2d 686 (same), cert.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Nothing in the court\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt could have misled the jury as to the state\u2019s burden with respect to self-defense, nor could any part of that instruction be interpreted to have abridged or modified the trial court\u2019s <em>nineteen </em>previous instructions that clearly indicated that the state bore the burden of disproving the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Specifically, we noted: At an arraignment, a defendant is advised of the charges against him and enters a plea. ... By contrast, at an extradition hearing, a defendant is not asked to plead or to make any other decisions that could affect his right to a fair trial. . . .

It is not hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy for the accused or any other persons who might be affected by your decision.
