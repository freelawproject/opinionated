On appeal, this court vacated the capital felony conviction and remanded the case for resentencing on the felony murder convictions. Id., 99. After resentencing, the petitioner filed a petition for a new trial, which the trial court denied. The petitioner then filed a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s ruling in the Appellate Court, which granted the motion for review but denied the relief requested therein. <em>Small </em>v. <em>State, </em>101 Conn. App. 213, 220, 920 A.2d 1024 (2007). This court then granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cDoes this court have jurisdiction to consider a petition for certification from the denial of relief on a motion for review? See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983)\u201d; and (2) \u201cIs the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling consistent with our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Casiano, </em>282 Conn. 614, 922 A.2d 1065 (2007)?\u201d <em>Small </em>v. <em>State, </em>283 Conn. 913, 913-14, 929 A.2d 728 (2007). We conclude that this court improvidently granted certification and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cOn February 16, 2001, the petitioner filed a petition for new trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 and Practice Book \u00a7 42-55, in which he alleged actual innocence on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The petitioner further alleged that the state failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and that the trial court improperly charged the jury on consciousness of guilt. On July 7, 2006, the court denied the petitioner\u2019s request for a new trial. Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal and an application for waiver of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>fees, costs and expenses and for the appointment of counsel on appeal. On August 9, 2006, the court found that the petitioner was indigent and, therefore, granted the application for waiver of fees, costs and expenses on appeal but denied his request for the appointment of appellate counsel. The court also denied the petition for certification to appeal on the ground that there were no questions involved that merited review by an appellate court. The petitioner filed with [the Appellate Court] a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s order denying the appointment of appellate counsel. Subsequently, the [trial] court articulated that it had denied the request to appoint counsel because the action was a civil proceeding ancillary to the original criminal matter, because five previous requests for the appointment of counsel had been denied and because there were no questions involved that should be reviewed by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Small </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 101 Conn. App. 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The petitioner\u2019s motion for review asked the Appellate Court to reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying his request for the appointment of counsel. Id., 216. The petitioner argued that \u201ca trial court has the discretion to appoint counsel pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a751-291 (11) and 51-293 (a) and that because the court found the petitioner indigent, it should have exercised that discretion to appoint counsel because he has limited resources to pursue an appeal while incarcerated.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court granted the motion for review; id., 220; but concluded that the trial court had no statutory authority to appoint counsel in a proceeding on a petition for a new trial. Id., 218-19. Accordingly, the Appellate Court denied the relief requested in the motion for review. Id., 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">This certified appeal followed. The petitioner claims that: (1) the Appellate Court improperly concluded that a petition for a new trial does not come within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>purview of the phrase \u201cany criminal action\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 51-296 (a); and (2) the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of the relief requested in the motion for review constitutes a final judgment subject to this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction under <em>Curcio. </em>After examining the entire record on appeal and considering the briefs and oral arguments of the parties, we have determined that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
