The state appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence on the ground that the trial court committed plain error when it sentenced the defendant as a repeat offender under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> without first obtaining a plea from the defendant and, if necessary, conducting a trial on the issue as Practice Book \u00a7 42-2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The state claims that it was not plain error for the trial court to forgo a \u201cpart B\u201d trial under the factual and procedural circumstances of this case. We agree with the state and, accordingly, reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On June 18, 2004, the defendant was arrested in the city of Danbury for operating a motor vehicle with a suspended driver\u2019s license. The passenger in his vehicle, Susan Curtis, also was taken into custody pursuant to an outstanding arrest warrant stemming from her failure to appear for a motor vehicle case in 1997. Subsequently, Curtis revealed to police that the defendant had given her a quantity of illegal narcotics to conceal when they were stopped by police. After a search of her person, the police recovered a package containing fourteen small bags that subsequently were determined to contain powdered and crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On the basis of these facts, the defendant was charged in the first part of a two part information with possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a), possession of narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b), and possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (a). Prior to trial, the defendant was advised that the state also had charged him in the second part of the information (part B), seeking an enhanced sentence for his alleged violation of the repeat offender provisions of \u00a7 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In a separate information, the state charged the defendant with violating the conditions of probation. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the course of the trial on the narcotics charges, the court held a violation of probation hearing outside the presence of the jury. At the hearing, the state offered into evidence a certified copy of an information and a conviction dated February 27, 2003, for the defendant\u2019s previous violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a). The state asked the court to take judicial notice of the conviction, and defense counsel expressed no objection to the request. The certified copy of the conviction was accepted as a full exhibit. The state also presented testimony from Rolanda Mitchell, a supervising probation officer with the office of adult probation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>who identified the defendant in court and testified that she had supervised him during a term of probation that he had served in connection with his 2003 conviction. The defendant offered no evidence to rebut the existence of the conviction, nor did defense counsel challenge Mitchell\u2019s identification of the defendant as the individual whom she had been supervising in connection with the 2003 conviction. At the close of the violation of probation hearing, the court decided to reserve decision on the violation of probation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Following a jury trial on the narcotics charges, the jury found the defendant guilty of all but the first count. In addition, the court found the defendant guilty of violating the terms of his probation stemming from his prior conviction. After the jury was excused, the senior assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney) raised the issue of part B of the information, stating: \u201cI would note, Your Honor, that, in [this case], there is a part B of [the] information, and it\u2019s my understanding that defense counsel wishes to waive a jury on that and have a court trial.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cI\u2019m waiving a juiy. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s appropriate to even have a part B in this case. . . . [T]he statute . . . does provide a specific penalty range for ... a second offense, but I don\u2019t see . . . where it requires a part B. I think that\u2019s a sentencing discretion. It\u2019s up to the judge, and it will come up in the [presentencing investigation report].\u201d The court responded that it was \u201calready aware . . . that [the defendant] has a prior conviction.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney expressed concern that the prior conviction alleged in part B of the information, on which the state based its argument for a sentencing enhancement, \u201cdoes require a finding by a fact finder.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney continued: \u201cI guess the concern is I don\u2019t want this then to be an issue on appeal. But as long as defense counsel [is] fine with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>it, and the defendant is fine with [defense counsel\u2019s] decision and interpretation of the law, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d At that point, defense counsel reiterated her desire to have the matter handled at the sentencing hearing. Finally, at the close of the proceeding, the state once again sought to confirm defense counsel\u2019s position with respect to the disposition of part B: \u201cI would also note that defense counsel is waiving a part B of the information, determining that it is not necessary for the sentence of up to thirty years.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court asked defense counsel if that was \u201ca fair statement,\u201d to which she responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">After the jury returned its verdict on the narcotics charges, the court found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial and at the violation of probation hearing. The court deferred sentencing on the violation of probation charge, however, so that it could review the presentencing investigation report and sentence the defendant on all charges after a full hearing. Ultimately, the court imposed an effective sentence of thirty years imprisonment, suspended after thirteen years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction on several grounds, and the Appellate Court rejected all but one of the defendant\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>101 Conn. App. 167, 168-69, 921 A.2d 640 (2007). Noting that this claim was unpreserved, the Appellate Court, invoking the plain error doctrine, none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>theless vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for a hearing on part B of the information and resentencing. Id., 186. The court concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to \u201cput the defendant to plea to accord him a hearing regarding his jeopardy as a repeat offender and to make a finding regarding his status as a repeat offender\u201d in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 constituted plain error, and that \u201cit would be an injustice for [the] court not to afford the defendant relief on the ground that he failed to preserve his claim.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court\u2019s ruling appears to be based on its conclusion that \u201c[a] court commits plain error when it fails to implement properly the mandatory provisions of clearly applicable rules of practice.\u201d Id., 185. We thereafter granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the court committed plain error when it sentenced the defendant as a repeat offender?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>283 Conn. 906, 927 A.2d 919 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On appeal to this court, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court had committed plain error. The state\u2019s brief focuses on whether it was plain error to allow defense counsel to waive a trial on part B of the information, and whether it was plain error to forgo a part B trial when the defendant already had been adjudicated a repeat offender on the basis of evidence presented at the violation of probation hearing. The defendant responds by asserting that the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings to such an extent that his due process rights were implicated and that reversal under the plain error doctrine is the proper remedy. The defendant also argues that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of a trial on part B of the information and stipulation to the defendant\u2019s prior conviction were equivalent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>an unconstitutional guilty plea under <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-43, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In our view, the failure of the trial court in this case to comply strictly with Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 \u201cdoes not constitute one of the truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>280 Conn. 69, 87, 905 A.2d 1101 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1269, 127 S. Ct. 1491, 167 L. Ed. 2d 236 (2007). Thus, we agree with the state that the trial court\u2019s actions did not warrant application of the plain error doctrine, and, therefore, we reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We begin our discussion by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. We previously have indicated that we apply an abuse of discretion standard to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision to invoke the plain error doctrine. For instance, in <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 520 A.2d 208 (1987), overruled on other grounds by <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 626 A.2d 719 (1993), we declared that \u201cthe scope of our review is limited to determining whether the Appellate Court abused its discretion in granting review under the plain error doctrine. The critical question, accordingly, is not whether this court would have granted review in the same circumstances . . . but whether, if we indulge every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>court properly exercised its discretionary power under [what is now] Practice Book \u00a7 [60-5].\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 196; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>269 Conn. 442, 451, 849 A.2d 375 (2004) (standard of review of Appellate Court\u2019s invocation of plain error doctrine is abuse of discretion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>257 Conn. 106, 111, 777 A.2d 580 (2001) (same). This approach was based on our reading of what is now Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d Although we continue to adhere to the abuse of discretion standard articulated in <em>Finley, </em>we take this opportunity to clarify its reasoning and expound on the plain error doctrine generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error-first must determine if the error is indeed \u201cplain\u201d in the sense that it is \u201cpatent [or] readily discemable on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also . . . obvious in the sense of not debatable.\u201d C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 8.7, p. 303; see also <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 100-101, 444 A.2d 907 (1982) (factual record inadequate to determine if plain error was committed when appellant failed to raise claim in complaint or request to charge). This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application. \u201cPlain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>dence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 25, 664 A.2d 719 (1995), quoting <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>212 Conn. 217, 222, 561 A.2d 941 (1989). Thus, in addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate. \u201cA party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 507-508 n.14, 857 A.2d 908 (2004). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 69, we described the two-pronged nature of the plain error doctrine: \u201c[An appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is <em>both </em>so clear <em>and </em>so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 87, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 235 n.85, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005). It is clear that an appellate court addressing an appellant\u2019s plain error claim <em>must </em>engage in a review of the trial court\u2019s actions and, upon finding a patent error, determine whether the grievousness of that error qualifies for the invocation of the plain error doctrine and the automatic reversal that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>accompanies it. We review these determinations on appeal for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We next turn to a closer examination of the plain error doctrine itself. This doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly. . . . Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion . . . that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 86-87, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>supra, 271 Conn. 507-508 n.14. \u201c[Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] . . . unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 87. Although we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 was clearly improper, we conclude that the Appellate Court abused its discretion in vacating the defendant\u2019s sentence because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the error in this case did not \u201cresult in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The record does not reflect that the violation of Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 in this case was plain error. Indeed, apart from the trial court\u2019s failure to comply strictly with the applicable rule of practice, which we do not condone, the defendant has failed to raise <em>any </em>doubt with respect to the validity of his prior conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s failure to comply with a rule of criminal procedure, without more, is insufficient to require reversal for plain error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Suggs, </em>194 Conn. 223, 226-27, 478 A.2d 1008 (1984) (\u201c[n]ot every deviation from the specific requirements of a Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Book rule necessitates reversal\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>254 Conn. 637, 647, 758 A.2d 842 (2000) (violation of mies of practice not ground for reversal when defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 913, 121 S. Ct. 1247, 149 L. Ed. 2d 153 (2001).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the present case, the defendant\u2019s brief is bereft of a single reason why the absence of a trial or plea canvass on part B of the information is such an obvious error that \u201cit affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>LaBrec, </em>270 Conn. 548, 559, 854 A.2d 1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Application of the plain error doctrine in the present case is, in our view, therefore, largely controlled by our reasoning in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 69. In that case, the defendant, Damon Fagan, had his sentence enhanced pursuant to part B of a two part information charging him with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40b, which provides an enhanced sentence for an offense committed while an offender is released on bond. Id., 74. After the juiy returned a guilty verdict on the underlying charges, the court \u201cinstructed the clerk to put [Fagan] to plea on part B of the information . . . .\u201d Id., 85. Fagan entered a plea of guilty, which the trial court accepted without conducting a canvass. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The court subsequently enhanced Fagan\u2019s sentence on the basis of his guilty plea; id.; and Fagan thereafter appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment on constitutional grounds. See id., 74, 84. Fagan argued that his plea of guilty in connection with part B of the information was constitutionally deficient because the trial court had failed to conduct an adequate plea canvass, thereby rendering his plea not knowing and voluntary. Id., 84. Because Fagan\u2019s claim was of constitutional magnitude, and not preserved at trial, he sought review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Although Practice Book \u00a7 42-2 was not implicated in <em>Fagan </em>because the sentencing enhancement was not the result of a prior conviction, we find that case analogous to the present appeal and are persuaded that its sound reasoning is well suited to our analysis. In <em>Fagan, </em>we began by noting the purposes served by the requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 36-14 that a two part information be used whenever the state seeks an enhanced penalty on the basis of prior criminal conduct. \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to ensure that the defendant is given adequate notice of the charge against him so that he properly may prepare his defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 92. In addition to providing the defendant with notice of the state\u2019s intention to seek an enhanced penalty, the use of part B of a two part information avoids the possibility of prejudicing the jury with knowledge of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>duct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 173, 113 A. 452 (1921) (Prior convictions must be presented in a separate part of the information because \u201c[i]t cannot be believed that an accused man would ever have a fair trial, resulting in a verdict not affected by prejudice or by considerations by which the jury should not be influenced, if, during that trial . . . evidence of his former convictions has been placed before [it]. It is beyond question that knowledge of such facts must necessarily prejudice the minds of his triers against the accused . . . .\u201d). These purposes informed our analysis in <em>Fagan </em>and are similarly relevant to the resolution of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Our conclusion in <em>Fagan </em>that the omission of a plea canvass with respect to part B of an information was not a violation of due process was supported by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 93. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the petitioner challenged an enhancement to his sentence on the basis of the trial court\u2019s determination, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his crime had been motivated by racial bias. See <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 470-71. The petitioner argued that the due process clause of the United States constitution requires such a finding to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 471. The court largely agreed, declaring that <em>\u201c[o] lher than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury . . . and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 490. Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Apprendi, </em>we concluded in <em>Fagan </em>that, \u201conce [Fagan was] convicted of having committed the crimes in part A of the information, [his] status at the time he committed those crimes involved a legal determination, not a factual one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>and that, accordingly, he was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of his status.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 94; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanko, </em>62 Conn. App. 34, 44, 771 A.2d 149 (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s status under [\u00a7 53a-40b] arises out of some antecedent encounter with the criminal justice system. The record of that antecedent encounter is a judicial record of which a court may take judicial notice.\u201d), cert. denied, 256 Conn. 905, 772 A.2d 599 (2001). Furthermore, in <em>Fagan </em>we endorsed the view that \u201cother facts . . . which may be used as a basis for a sentence enhancement, also fall within that exception [articulated in <em>Apprendi] </em>because they arise from and essentially are legal determinations analogous to a prior conviction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We continue to adhere to the view that, regardless of the dictates of Practice Book \u00a7 42-2, due process does not require a separate trial or judicial proceeding when the fact of a prior conviction is essentially uncontested. With that precept in mind, we turn to the facts of the present case. Although we agree with the Appellate Court that the trial court improperly failed to comply with the strictures of \u00a7 42-2, we do not agree that this impropriety was so egregious as to constitute plain error and mandate reversal. Due process does not require a trial to prove the fact of a prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra, 530 U.S. 490; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 93-94. We cannot agree, therefore, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>court\u2019s failure to implement the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 42-2 \u201ctrampl[ed] on [the] defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d thus \u201cconstitut[ing] plain error and requirfing] . . . reversal of the judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>supra, 101 Conn. App. 185, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Irala, </em>68 Conn. App. 499, 515, 792 A.2d 109, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 887, 123 S. Ct. 132, 154 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2002). There simply was no constitutional right on which the trial court could have trampled in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Although this conclusion obviates the need for us to discuss most of the defendant\u2019s sundry constitutional arguments, we do believe that it is appropriate to address his disputed claim that any stipulation at trial by defense counsel regarding his prior conviction was constitutionally void. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 238, the defendant argues that, in the absence of atrial, anything short of a knowing and voluntary plea by the defendant personally with respect to part B of the information was invalid. The state disputes this claim, arguing that part B of the information does not charge the defendant with a substantive criminal offense, which would require a full, <em>Boykin-type </em>plea canvass. Moreover, relying on <em>Fagan </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>the state asserts that defense counsel\u2019s waiver of a trial with respect to part B of the information was not defective because there is no constitutional right to a trial on the fact of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Boykin </em>is misplaced. <em>Boykin </em>concerned a criminal defendant (petitioner) who was charged with common-law robbery, an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>that, at that time, was punishable by death in the state of Alabama. Id., 239. At his arraignment, the petitioner pleaded guilty without being canvassed in any way by the trial judge or addressing the court. Id. Pursuant to Alabama law, a jury was impaneled to consider evidence regarding the nature of the offenses and the character and background of the petitioner and to determine the petitioner\u2019s sentence. See id., 240. During the sentencing hearing, the petitioner\u2019s counsel engaged in only \u201ccursory cross-examination\u201d of the state\u2019s witnesses, and the \u201cpetitioner neither testified himself nor presented testimony concerning his character and background.\u201d Id. The jury sentenced the petitioner to death; id.; and the Alabama Supreme Court upheld the petitioner\u2019s conviction and death sentence. See id., 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Under these extreme circumstances, the United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that it was plain error \u201cfor the trial judge to accept [the] petitioner\u2019s guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary.\u201d Id., 242. The court equated the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea with a waiver of several of his constitutional rights, including \u201cthe privilege against compulsory self-incrimination . . . the right to trial by jury . . . [and] the right to confront one\u2019s accusers\u201d; (citations omitted) id., 243; and declared that it could not \u201cpresume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.\u201d Id. The court held that \u201c[w]hat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d Id., 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The present case is readily distinguishable from <em>Boy-kin </em>in a number of respects. First, as we previously noted, the defendant in this case had no constitutional right to a trial on the issue of his prior conviction. See, e.g., <em>State v. Fagan, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 93-94. Any waiver of a trial on that issue, therefore, was not of constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>tional dimension. Second, there is no indication in the record, nor has the defendant made any claim, that the constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination was implicated at any point in the trial court proceedings. Finally, the defendant was afforded the opportunity to confront his accusers with respect to the alleged fact of his prior conviction. The defendant asserts that the violation of probation hearing was an insufficient substitute for the procedures mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 42-2. Although we agree that the violation of probation hearing did not strictly satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 42-2, we believe that it provided sufficient procedural safeguards to avoid casting any shadow on the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceeding or the just character of its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The defendant received the benefit of a hearing, outside the presence of the jury, to determine whether, if convicted of the present charges, he also would be guilty of a violation of probation stemming from his alleged prior conviction. At the violation of probation hearing, the defendant had an opportunity to challenge both the certified record of his conviction and the probation officer\u2019s identification of him as the individual serving probation for that conviction. Defense counsel presented no such challenge and expressed no objection when the state\u2019s attorney asked the court to take judicial notice of the certified copy of the defendant\u2019s conviction, which the court accepted and allowed as a full exhibit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, in cross-examining the probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>officer, defense counsel implicitly conceded the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We need not address, in any great detail, the defendant\u2019s additional claim regarding the impropriety of defense counsel\u2019s several stipulations regarding the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. It is sufficient to note that the defendant has failed to demonstrate how any alleged impropriety was so harmful or egregious as to qualify for the opprobrium of the plain error doctrine. We are unpersuaded by the two extra-jurisdictional cases that the defendant offers to bolster his assertion that defense counsel\u2019s stipulation to his prior conviction is an insufficient basis for the trial court to make a finding of recidivism. In both <em>Cox v. Hutto, </em>589 F.2d 394 (8th Cir. 1979), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Cheatham, </em>139 Idaho 413, 80 P.3d 349 (App. 2003), each court reversed a defendant\u2019s sentence that had been enhanced on the basis of prior convictions, the validity of which defense counsel stipulated to. These cases are distinguishable from the present appeal in one critical respect. In each case, the <em>only </em>evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions was the bare stipulations of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Hutto, </em>supra, 396 (\u201cThe constitutionally defective stipulation by [defense] counsel was the only evidence of [the defendant\u2019s prior] convictions at the state court trial. The error in receiving that stipulation was presumptively prejudicial unless the [s]tate can show that, absent the stipulation, it possessed at the time of trial evidence establishing at least the three prior convictions necessary to support [the defendant\u2019s enhanced] sentence.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cheatham, </em>supra, 418 (\u201cThis [c]ourt has found no case holding that a stipulation by defense counsel is alone sufficient to entirely waive a defendant\u2019s right to a trial on his status as a persistent violator .... [T]he waiver of [the defendant\u2019s] right to a trial on the persistent violator allegations was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>accepted solely upon defense counsel\u2019s stipulation ----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In the present case, the state did establish, with conclusive evidence at an adversarial hearing, that the defendant had a prior conviction for violating \u00a7 21a-277 (a). Moreover, despite several opportunities subsequent to the violation of probation hearing, the defendant never disputed the fact of his prior conviction. For instance, even though the state\u2019s attorney expressed his belief that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was required to be proven to a fact finder, defense counsel averred on two occasions that she was waiving a trial on part B of the information and that its significance should be left to the discretion of the trial court to determine at sentencing. Finally, at sentencing, defense counsel once again discussed the defendant\u2019s prior conviction as if it was an uncontested fact. Thus, any \u201cstipulation\u201d by defense counsel more closely resembles a tacit recognition of the irrefutability of the state\u2019s evidence rather than a naked admission of guilt such as that found in <em>Cox </em>and <em>Cheatham.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We are firmly convinced that, in light of the certainty of the evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s prior conviction, the defendant\u2019s failure to challenge such evidence at the violation of probation hearing or on any other occasion, defense counsel\u2019s numerous stipulations and concessions with respect to the prior conviction, and the defendant\u2019s failure to indicate to this court what purpose would now be served by a trial or plea canvass, the Appellate Court\u2019s invocation of the plain error doctrine, although understandable in light of the language of Practice Book \u00a7 42-2, was an abuse of discretion. The defendant simply has failed to meet his burden of \u201cdemonstrat[ing] that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toccaline, </em>258 Conn. 542, 553, 783 A.2d 450 (2001).

We granted certification to review the Appellate Court\u2019s plain error determination, and also decline to engage in a <em>Golding </em>analysis. We will discuss the constitutional aspects of the defendant\u2019s claim only insofar as necessary to address fully the certified issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\"> We have previously stated that \u201c[p]lain error review is . . . appropriate in matters of statutory construction because the interpretation of [a] statute and the resolution of [the] issue does not require further fact-finding . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 218-19 n.9, 751 A.2d 800 (2000). We now clarify, however, that even apure question of law coupled with a complete record is not a <em>guarantee </em>of plain error review. Under these circumstances, a court reviewing a claim under the plain error doctrine must still proceed to examine the <em>nature </em>of the error to determine if justice requires reversal.

For example, in <em>Jacqueline Properties, LLC </em>v. <em>Gartrell, </em>101 Conn. App. 6, 919 A.2d 1059, cert. denied, 283 Conn. 907, 927 A.2d 918 (2007), the court declared: \u201cA court\u2019s failure to follow the mandatory provisions of a statute prescribing trial procedures constitutes plain error subject to plenary review.\u201d Id., 9-10. In addition to being a misstatement of the law, this statement is essentially a non sequitur. It is well established that the plain error doctrine is \u201cnot ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. . . . [I]t is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, <em>although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, </em>nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 343 n.34, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). Plenary review, on the other hand, is a species of review that is generally reserved for questions of law that are properly raised or preserved for appeal. The two concepts are essentially mutually exclusive. See <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 218 n.11, 682 A.2d 106 (1996) (\u201cour plain error appellate rule by its terms does not apply to the typical claim that . . . would be denied plenary appellate review\u201d).
