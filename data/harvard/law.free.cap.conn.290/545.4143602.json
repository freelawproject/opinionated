The trial court rejected the plaintiffs constitutional claims, but concluded that it could not determine whether the defendant\u2019s decision to place the plaintiffs name on the registry was proper because one factor cited in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>decision was not supported by the record. Accordingly, the trial court remanded the case to the defendant for a determination of whether the plaintiffs name should appear on the registry in the absence of this factor. The plaintiff appeals, and the defendant cross appeals, from that decision. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that: (1) the trial court improperly determined that one of the factors relied on by the defendant in deciding that the plaintiffs name should be placed on the registry was not supported by the record and therefore improperly remanded the case to the defendant; (2) the defendant\u2019s finding that the plaintiff posed a risk to children such that his name should be placed on the registry was supported by the record; and (3) the trial court properly rejected the plaintiffs constitutional challenges to the registry scheme. Accordingly, we reverse in part the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was employed as a shift supervisor at the New Haven juvenile detention center (detention center) during the period pertinent to the issues in this appeal. In early 1999, the defendant commenced an investigation into conduct of the detention center\u2019s staff and management after receiving an anonymous complaint alleging abuse and neglect of juvenile detainees. As a result of that investigation, the defendant concluded that several allegations of abuse or neglect against the plaintiff had been substantiated and thereafter terminated his employment. One of those allegations related to an incident in May, 1998, in which a detainee, Felix P.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had been physically assaulted by another detainee whom the plaintiff had placed in Felix\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>room. The plaintiff thereafter unsuccessfully challenged his termination, first through arbitration and later through an action in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">At some point in early 2005, the plaintiff learned that his name had been placed on the registry maintained by the defendant. At that time, the defendant had no internal procedures in place to challenge such decisions. In June, 2005, the plaintiff sought to have his name removed from the registry by way of an action in federal court, claiming that the defendant had placed his name on the registry without affording him due process. While that case was pending, the legislature enacted Public Acts 2005, No. 05-207, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 05-207), which, inter alia, added the administrative procedures now set forth in subsections (b) through (i) of \u00a7 17a-101k. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Thereafter, the parties reached a settlement agreement under which the federal case would be dismissed with prejudice, and, in accordance with P.A. 05-207, the defendant would provide the plaintiff with an internal review of its allegations and, upon request, an administrative hearing if the review upheld the defendant\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">After the defendant conducted an internal review and notified the plaintiff that it had substantiated allegations of physical abuse by the plaintiff against Felix and two other detainees to support its decision to place the plaintiffs name on the registry,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff requested an administrative hearing. Thereafter, a hearing officer of the defendant conducted a hearing and issued a final decision. The hearing officer upheld the defendant\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was responsible for Felix\u2019 physical abuse, but reversed its finding with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>two other detainees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The hearing officer further found that the recommendation to place the plaintiff s name on the registry should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In support of its finding that the plaintiff was responsible for the abuse of Felix, the hearing officer made the following factual findings. On May 29, 1998, Felix had acted out verbally and physically when the plaintiff asked him to go to his room. Two officers had to escort Felix to his room, where the plaintiff put handcuffs and leg irons on him and directed him to remain on his bed. After Felix refused to remain on his bed and stood up, the plaintiff placed him back on the bed and left the room. Some time later, detention officers heard Felix \u201cbanging\u201d in his room and other detainees shouting, demanding to be let into Felix\u2019 room. The plaintiff went to Felix\u2019 room and told him that, instead of using restraints, he was going to place another detainee, Michael C., in the room to counsel him. Michael was much larger than Felix and known to be a bully. A detention officer heard the plaintiff tell Felix that he would not open the door again and that Michael would not be disciplined if he beat up Felix. Michael was left in the room with Felix while all but one officer left the floor for a staff meeting. Michael thereafter assaulted Felix to the extent that, two days later, his face still was swollen and bruised. The hearing officer did not find the plaintiffs claim credible that he had intended only for Michael to offer \u201cpeer counseling,\u201d noting the \u201cvirtual lynch mob atmosphere\u201d that had preceded the decision to put Michael in the room and Felix\u2019 smaller stature that undoubtedly had put him at a \u201cserious disadvantage . . . .\u201d Thus, the hearing officer found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the evidence supported the conclusion that the plaintiff had abused Felix by allowing a nonaccidental injury to be inflicted on one child by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">To determine whether it was appropriate to place the plaintiffs name on the registry, the hearing officer noted the following principles. Registry placement was required \u201cwhen there has been a determination that the person responsible for child abuse or neglect poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children.\u201d To determine whether there was such a risk in the present case, various criteria had to be considered, including the plaintiffs intent, the severity of the incident, the \u201cchronicity\u201d of the plaintiffs behavior\u2014meaning whether the substantiated abuse was not an isolated incident\u2014and whether excessive force had been used. Applying these factors, the hearing officer found: \u201c[The plaintiffs] conduct demonstrates either a conscious decision to use one child to harm another, or else a serious disregard for [Felix\u2019] well-being. The evidence supports a finding that this was not an isolated incident, but, rather, a pattern of behavior by the [plaintiff] to induce compliance on his unit. Other detainees feared for their own safety as a result of the [plaintiffs] conduct. All of these factors support the [defendant\u2019s] decision to place the [plaintiffs] name on the [registry] as a person responsible for the physical abuse of [Felix].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (a) and 17a-101k (e), the plaintiff appealed from the decision to the trial court, seeking reversal of the hearing officer\u2019s findings with respect to: (1) the physical abuse of Felix; and (2) the placement of the plaintiffs name on the registry. The plaintiff also claimed that the registry scheme was unconstitutional on several grounds. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs challenges to the constitutionality of the registry scheme and to the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was responsible for the physical abuse of Felix. The court did not decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>however, whether the hearing officer properly found that the plaintiffs name should be placed on the registry because the court concluded that one factor\u2014chronicity\u2014was not supported by the record; specifically, there was no evidence to support the hearing officer\u2019s finding that \u201cthis was not an isolated incident . . . .\u201d Because it did not know to what extent the chronicity factor had influenced the hearing officer\u2019s decision, the trial court remanded the case to the defendant \u201cfor further consideration of whether the plaintiffs name should appear on the registry list.\u201d The plaintiffs appeal and the defendant\u2019s cross appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In his appeal, the plaintiff asserts the following constitutional challenges to the registry scheme, as set forth under P.A. 05-207: (1) it violates the doctrine of separation of powers by delegating the legislature\u2019s authority to the defendant without setting forth intelligible principles to guide the defendant\u2019s registiy decisions and by delegating such authority to the defendant instead of the courts; (2) it is violative of due process because it is overbroad and vague; and (3) it constitutes a bill of attainder. In its cross appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly remanded the case to the hearing officer because the record was sufficient to support the chronicity factor and, in turn, the decision to place the plaintiffs name on the registry. In his response to the defendant\u2019s cross appeal, the plaintiff agrees that the remand was improper, but on the ground that the trial court properly concluded that the chronicity factor was not supported by the record and, in the absence of such evidence, the placement of his name on the registry was improper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>trial court improperly remanded the case and that the record supported the hearing officer\u2019s decision to place the plaintiffs name on the registry. We further conclude that the trial court properly rejected the plaintiffs constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Before reaching the substantive issues presented, we address a jurisdictional question that arises as a result of the procedural posture of the case. Because the trial court remanded the case to the defendant, this court sua sponte raised the question of whether the parties are appealing from a final judgment, as generally required for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 275 Conn. 580, 593, 881 A.2d 978 (2005). Both parties contend that the remand is a final judgment, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Section 17a-101k (e) provides that appeals from the defendant\u2019s decision to place a person\u2019s name on the registry are taken in accordance with \u00a7 4-183 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. Section 4-183 (j) (5) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall affirm the decision of the [administrative] agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are [inter alia] . . . clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record . . . . <em>If the court finds such prejudice, it shall sustain </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>the appeal and, if appropriate, may </em>render a judgment under subsection (k) of this section or <em>remand the case for further proceedings. For purposes of this section, a remand is a final judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 673-81, 855 A.2d 212 (2004), we reconsidered whether \u00a7 4-183 (j) had codified the test set forth in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 410, 521 A.2d 566 (1987), for determining whether a remand to an administrative agency constituted a final judgment. \u201cIn <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co., </em>we distinguished, for purposes of appellate finality, between two different types of such remands: (1) those in which the trial court had determined that the administrative ruling was in error and ordered further administrative proceedings on that veiy issue; and (2) those in which the trial court had concluded that the administrative ruling was in some way incomplete and therefore not ripe for final adjudication, for example, where the court required further administrative evidentiary findings \u2018as a precondition to final judicial resolution of all the issues between the parties.\u2019 [Id.], 410. In this regard, remands falling under the former category would constitute final judgments for purposes of appeal, but those falling under the latter category would not. Id.\u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 674. In <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>we confirmed the previous case law that had established that the phrase \u201cthis section\u201d in the final sentence of \u00a7 4-183 (j) meant subsection (j). Id., 674. Thus, a remand would constitute a final judgment only if it was ordered pursuant to subsection (j). Id. We further determined, however, that, contrary to statements in earlier cases, this sentence was not intended to codify the <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>test. Id., 675. We held, therefore, that \u201cwhere the court issues a remand pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (j), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>remand is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, <em>irrespective of both the nature of the remand and the administrative proceedings that are expected to follow it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Turning to the present case, the trial court did not state the basis of its authority to order the remand. Although subsection (j) is the only subsection of \u00a7 4-183 that expressly refers to remands, we have recognized that orders under subsection (h) fairly may be characterized as remands. See <em>Lisee </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>258 Conn. 529, 539, 782 A.2d 670 (2001). We conclude that the remand in the present case, however, falls more properly under subsection (j) of \u00a7 4-183 than subsection (h).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Subsection (h) permits the trial court, prior to a hearing on the merits and upon request of a party, to \u201corder that the additional evidence be taken before the agency,\u201d which in turn allows the agency to modify its findings or decision. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (h).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the present case, the trial court ordered the remand sua sponte, after hearings on the merits, and the parties agreed at oral argument before this court that the remand would not permit the hearing officer to consider new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Conversely, consistent with subsection (j), the trial court did conclude that \u201csubstantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences . . . [or] conclusions . . . are . . . clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5); by virtue of the court\u2019s conclusions that the hearing officer\u2019s finding regarding the chronicity factor was not supported by the evidence and that the decision to place the plaintiffs name on the registry could not be sustained if that finding was necessary to that decision. Moreover, although it does not fall squarely within the language of \u00a7 4-183 (j), we note that the defendant has been prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision to remand the case despite its conclusion that this finding was unsupported by the record. Indeed, both parties contend that the remand was improper\u2014the defendant contending that the finding of chronicity was supported by the evidence, and the plaintiff contending that, although the trial court properly concluded that there was no evidence to support the finding of chronicity, it should have concluded that, in the absence of such evidence, the hearing officer\u2019s decision to place his name on the registry was improper as a matter of law. Therefore, we conclude that the remand falls within \u00a7 4-183 (j), and, accordingly, is a final judgment for purposes of appeal, \u201cirrespective of both the nature of the remand and the administrative proceedings that are expected to follow it.\u201d <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>sion on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 270 Conn. 675. In light of this conclusion, we turn to the merits of the appeal and the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Because we eschew unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions; see <em>Tarro </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>279 Conn. 280, 286, 901 A.2d 1186 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCahill, </em>261 Conn. 492, 501, 811 A.2d 667 (2002); we begin with the issues raised in the defendant\u2019s cross appeal. The threshold question is whether the trial court properly concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the incident with Felix was \u201cnot an isolated incident\u201d\u2014the chronicity factor\u2014was not supported by the evidence. The defendant contends that the trial court improperly concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s finding of chronicity was not supported by the record because there was ample evidence of other incidents of abuse by the plaintiff. The defendant therefore contends that the trial court should not have remanded the case because the record supported the ultimate finding that the plaintiff poses a risk to the well-being of children to warrant placement of his name on the registry. In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly concluded that there was no evidence of other incidents of abuse, but should have sustained his appeal rather than remanded the case to the defendant. Although the plaintiff does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the record supported the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was responsible for physical abuse to Felix, he claims that, in the absence of evidence of chronicity, there was insufficient evidence that he poses a risk to the well-being of children. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">At the outset, it is important to underscore that the scope of judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>decision under \u00a7 4-183 \u201cis very restricted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jim\u2019s Auto Body </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>285 Conn. 794, 803, 942 A.2d 305 (2008). \u201c[R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. ... An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Goldstar Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>288 Conn. 790, 833, 955 A.2d 15 (2008). \u201cNeither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The hearing officer found that the episode with Felix was not an isolated incident because there had been \u201ca pattern of behavior by the [plaintiff] to induce compliance on his unit\u201d such that \u201c[o]ther detainees feared for their own safety as a result of the [plaintiffs] conduct.\u201d This fact had to be found only by a preponderance of the evidence. Id., 821. The hearing officer did not indicate which incidents had formed the basis of this finding or what evidence had been credited. The record, however, reflects the following evidence, which the plaintiff does not challenge. The defendant offered a special investigation report regarding abuse allegations at the detention center, prepared by the defendant\u2019s investigator, Wendy L. Bonola, which was supported by narratives of Bonola\u2019s interviews with detainees and detention center staff and by Bonola\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>testimony. Among the complaints that Bonola found credible were allegations that the plaintiff had threatened to put detainees in a room with other detainees to be assaulted when they were not behaving, that the plaintiff had watched passively as detainees assaulted each other, that the plaintiff had threatened to assault detainees personally when they misbehaved and had threatened to assault them personally if they reported mistreatment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact that such conduct could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>occurred at the detention center was supported by the fact that thirteen detention center employees had indicated in their interviews \u201cthat they have knowledge [that detainees] may be used to physically discipline other [detainees] who misbehave.\u201d Bonola testified that one supervisor had told her that tougher detainees reported to him that they were being placed in other detainees\u2019 rooms as enforcers and that this supervisor had expressed a concern that this was happening during a particular shift, which was the shift that the plaintiff supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The defendant\u2019s report also contained numerous allegations of conduct by the plaintiff toward female detain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>ees that generally can be characterized as degrading and emotionally abusive. Although these allegations do not provide direct support for the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had engaged in coercive conduct that caused detainees to fear for their safety, the hearing officer reasonably may have relied on those allegations to the extent that they might bear on the plaintiffs attitude and behavior toward the detainees. See <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>259 Conn. 288, 319, 788 A.2d 1199 (2002) (\u201crules of evidence do not apply in administrative hearings\u201d). Indeed, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor in the plaintiffs challenge to his termination, noted: \u201cThere is overwhelming credible evidence in official reports and statements, including a report by the [defendant], that [the plaintiff] physically abused and neglected juvenile detainees.\u201d <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Judicial Branch, </em>64 Fed. Appx. 256, 258 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In sum, the record supported the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the episode with Felix was not an isolated incident. The trial court rejected this finding for two reasons, both of which we reject. First, the court assumed that the sole basis for the hearing officer\u2019s finding was the defendant\u2019s interview with two detainees, Edward B. and John R.; see footnote 9 of this opinion; and concluded that the testimony from Bonola simply \u201crelates the children\u2019s \u2018understanding\u2019 that [the plaintiff] had stated his intent of placing one detainee in a room with another.\u201d Our review of the transcript of Bonola\u2019s testimony and the report in its entirety supports the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs threats to these two detainees was not meant to convey the innocuous act of placing detainees in a room together with no intended adverse consequences. There was abundant evidence that detention officers clearly had communicated that a threat to place detainees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>a room together was an implicit threat of, as one shift supervisor described to Bonola, \u201cwhat is commonly referred to as a beatdown . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs conduct with respect to Felix reasonably supports the inference that the plaintiffs threats to place detainees in a room together was intended to convey that message. Indeed, Bonola testified that John\u2019s request to transfer to another facility was granted after he expressed fear to detention center officials about the plaintiffs threat, an action that would indicate that such a fear was deemed sufficiently credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Second, the trial court noted that the arbitrator who had sustained the plaintiffs termination on the basis of the incident with Felix had not found that there were additional incidents. The arbitrator did not find expressly, however, that the plaintiff had <em>not </em>engaged in other acts that had caused detainees to fear for their safety. Rather, he found that the incident with Felix provided a sufficient basis to sustain the plaintiffs termination. The arbitrator did find expressly that the defendant had met all the elements necessary to prove just cause to terminate the plaintiff, one of which relates to whether the degree of discipline was reasonably related to the seriousness of the plaintiffs past offense <em>and the plaintiffs past record. </em>To the extent that the arbitrator opined that the plaintiff is not a \u201cmonster,\u201d that he \u201csincerely cared about the children in his care,\u201d that frustration had caused the plaintiff to \u201cbehave in a manner that was out of character,\u201d and that the plaintiff simply has too low a threshold for dealing with a population that has a \u201cpeculiar capacity to frequently push the patience of the average person beyond toleration,\u201d the hearing officer was not required to adopt the arbitrator\u2019s dicta or view of the evidence. Cf. <em>LaSalla </em>v. <em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc., </em>278 Conn. 578, 586-94, 898 A.2d 803 (2006) (issue and claim preclusion inapplicable to subsequent arbitration proceeding between same par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ties). Therefore, the trial court improperly concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the chronicity factor had been satisfied was not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the trial court improperly remanded the case for a new determination as to whether the plaintiffs name should be placed on the registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Turning to the question of whether the hearing officer properly found that the plaintiffs name should be placed on the registry because he poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children, we again note the following factors that the hearing officer weighed: the plaintiffs intent, the severity of the incident, the chronicity of the plaintiffs behavior and whether excessive force had been used. In addition to the chronicity evidence we previously have discussed, the evidence supports the conclusion that the plaintiff intended for Michael to assault Felix to coerce his silence and that Felix could have sustained more serious injuries given the size of his much larger opponent and the absence of any supervision at the time of the assault. The evidence further indicates that the plaintiff repeatedly refused to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, proffering a stoiy that neither the arbitrator nor the hearing officer credited, namely, that the plaintiff had sent Michael into the room only to \u201ccounsel\u201d Felix. In abuse and neglect cases, it is well established that the failure to accept responsibility reasonably may be considered as an indication that there is a risk that the abuse will continue.

Moreover, although Felix undoubtedly had engaged in behavior that would have tested and exceeded the patience of the average person, as any person whose profession requires direct contact with children or adolescents can attest, it is not unusual to encounter situations that require a heightened threshold for such recalcitrance. Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff poses a risk to the safety or well-being of children such that it was appropriate to place his name on the registry was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We therefore turn to the plaintiffs constitutional challenges to the registry scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that the registry scheme: (1) violates the doctrine of separation of powers because the legislature improperly failed to set forth intelligible principles to guide the defendant\u2019s registry decisions and improperly delegated judicial authority to the defendant; (2) violates due process because it is vague and overbroad; and (3) constitutes a bill of attainder. Although the plaintiff asserts that the scheme violates both the state and federal constitutions, he has failed to provide the analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-85, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), that is a prerequisite to asserting an independent claim under the state constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Asel-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>ton </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>277 Conn. 120, 153, 890 A.2d 1250 (2006). We therefore limit our analysis to the dictates of the federal constitution, and we conclude that the plaintiffs constitutional challenges lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Because this case presents the first occasion that this court has had to examine the registry scheme in a meaningful way, we briefly note by way of background the following information. The registry scheme is codified in two sections that work in tandem: General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-101g<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 17a-101k. Section 17a-101g sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>forth the defendant\u2019s responsibilities upon receiving a report of abuse or neglect of a child: classification; evaluation; investigation; and determination of whether abuse or neglect has occurred. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-lOlg (a) and (b). The statute directs that, \u201c[i]f the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>missioner [of children and families (commissioner)] determines that abuse or neglect has occurred, the commissioner shall also determine whether: (1) [t]here is an identifiable person responsible for such abuse or neglect; and (2) such identifiable person poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children and should be recommended by the commissioner for placement on the child abuse and neglect registry established pursuant to section 17a-101k.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101g (b). The defendant is directed under \u00a7 17a-101k (i) to adopt regulations to implement the provision of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">If the commissioner determines that a person should be listed on the registry, that information is confidential, except where authorized specifically by statute or regulation, and unlawful disclosure is a criminal offense. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (a). Statutes that authorize disclosure are limited to specific governmental agencies or persons directly involved with child protection and agencies that license persons providing child care services or that employ persons charged with child protection, such as the defendant, the department of public health and the department of social services. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-6a, 17a-28 (f), 17a-114 (b) (2), 17b-749k (a), 19a-77a (a) (8), 19a-80 (c), 19a-87b (b); see also General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101i (a) (addressing notice requirements upon defendant\u2019s finding of child abuse by school employee to school officials). These confidentiality parameters conform with those set forth under federal law to qualify states for federal grants for child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs. See <em>Groton Police Dept. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 104 Conn. App. 150, 162-63, 931 A.2d 989 (2007). Mindful of the potential effect of such disclosures, \u00a7 17a-101k (b) (3) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the issuance of a recommended finding that an individual is responsible for abuse or neglect of a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>pursuant to subsection (b) of section 17a-101g, the commissioner shall provide notice of the finding ... to the individual who is alleged to be responsible for the abuse or neglect. The notice shall . . . [ijnform the individual of the potential adverse consequences of being listed on the registry, including, but not limited to, the potential effect on the individual obtaining or retaining employment, licensure or engaging in activities involving direct contact with children and inform the individual of the individual\u2019s right to administrative procedures as provided in this section to appeal the finding . . . .\u201d With this background in mind, we turn to the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional challenges to the registry scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The plaintiff raises two claims that charge that the registry scheme is vague: one focuses exclusively on the statutory scheme and the other requires us to broaden our lens to consider also the regulatory scheme and related case law. We therefore begin with the narrower focus, namely, the plaintiffs contention that the registry scheme violates the constitutional guarantee of separation of powers because the scheme constitutes an improper delegation of legislative power to the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the registry scheme authorizes the defendant to adopt regulations to implement the scheme without setting forth intelligible principles to guide the defendant as to what type or degree of abuse or neglect would warrant placement of a person\u2019s name on the registry. We disagree that the scheme lacks sufficient direction to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The following principles are well settled. \u201cThe [c]on-stitution of this state provides for the separation of the governmental functions into three basic departments, legislative, executive and judicial, and it is inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>this separation, since the law-making function is vested exclusively in the legislative department, that the [legislature cannot delegate the law-making power to any other department or agency. ... A [legislature, in creating a law complete in itself and designed to accomplish a particular purpose, may expressly authorize an administrative agency to fill up the details by prescribing rules and regulations for the operation and enforcement of the law. In order to render admissible such delegation of legislative power, however, it is necessary that the statute declare a legislative policy, establish primary standards for carrying it out, or lay down an intelligible principle to which the administrative officer or body must conform, with a proper regard for the protection of the public interests and with such degree of certainty as the nature of the case permits, and enjoin a procedure under which, by appeal or otherwise, both public interests and private rights shall have due consideration. ... If the [legislature fails to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of the power delegated or if those limits are too broad, its attempt to delegate is a nullity.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>126 Conn. 623, 627-28, 13 A.2d 586 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\u201cIn delegating authority to an administrative board [however] the legislature cannot know or foresee all the possibilities that might arise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson Point Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 243, 267, 140 A.2d 874 (1958). \u201cThe test for constitutionally sufficient standards to govern the exercise of delegated powers requires only that the standards be as definite] as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 180, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In the present case, the legislature\u2019s stated purpose in requiring the defendant to maintain the registry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cto prevent or discover abuse of children . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (a). The predicate to consideration for placement of one\u2019s name on the registry is a \u201cfinding that an individual is responsible for abuse or neglect of a child pursuant to subsection (b) of section 17a-101g . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (b). Section 17a-101g (b) in turn requires the defendant, when conducting an investigation into allegations of abuse or neglect, to consider factors including, but not limited to, \u201ca determination of the nature, extent and cause or causes of the reported abuse or neglect .... After an investigation into a report of abuse or neglect has been completed, the commissioner shall determine, based upon a standard of reasonable cause, whether a child has been abused or neglected, as defined in [General Statutes \u00a7] 46b-120.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the commissioner determines that abuse or neglect has occurred, the commissioner shall also determine whether: (1) [tjhere is an identifiable person responsible for such abuse or neglect; and (2) such identifiable person <em>poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children </em>and should be recommended by the commissioner for placement on the child abuse and neglect registry established pursuant to section 17a-101k. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Certain findings of abuse may result in the placement of an abuser\u2019s name on the registry even prior to exhaustion of administrative remedies: \u201c[i]f the child abuse or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>neglect resulted in or involves (1) the death of a child; (2) the risk of serious physical injury or emotional harm of a child; (3) the serious physical harm of a child; (4) the arrest of a person due to abuse or neglect of a child; (5) a petition filed by the commissioner pursuant to section 17a-112 or 46b-129; or (6) sexual abuse of a child . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17-101g (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">These parameters are sufficiently clear to guide the defendant in light of the aim of the legislation. The defendant must consider the nature, extent and cause of the abuse or neglect\u2014terms defined by statute\u2014to determine whether the person responsible for the abuse poses a risk to the health, safety or well-being of children. This undoubtedly is a predictive exercise. As we previously have recognized, \u201cthe legislative process would frequently bog down if the General Assembly were constitutionally required to appraise beforehand the myriad situations to which it wishes a particular policy to be applied .... To require any more specificity in the standards . . . would hamper the flexibility needed for the [defendant] to [carry out its duties].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP v. Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 398-99, 512 A.2d 152 (1986). Accordingly, the registry scheme does not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We next turn to the plaintiffs claim that the registry scheme violates due process because it is vague and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>overbroad. The plaintiff does not point to specific language that is vague, but, rather, contends that the scheme generally fails to provide fair notice of what conduct will expose a person to the registry requirement. The plaintiff also contends that the scheme is deficient because it fails to provide an individualized assessment of the risk to the community posed by each person on the registry, citing <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>271 F.3d 38, 61 (2d Cir. 2001), rev\u2019d, 538 U.S. 1, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2003). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the vagueness doctrine is twofold. The doctrine requires statutes to provide fair notice of the conduct to which they pertain and to establish minimum guidelines to govern law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Surgeon, </em>284 Conn. 573, 583-84, 937 A.2d 24 (2007). \u201cBecause perfect precision is neither possible nor required . . . the [vagueness] doctrine does not mandate the invalidation of all imprecisely drafted [statutes]. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the [statute], the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a [statute\u2019s] meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thalheim </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>256 Conn. 628, 641, 775 A.2d 947 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201c[T]he degree of vagueness that the [constitution tolerates . . . depends in part on the nature of the enactment. . . .

Therefore, \u201c[c]ivil statutes . . . may survive a vagueness challenge by a lesser degree of specificity than in criminal statutes.\u201d <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 757, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>In addition to the statutory standards discussed in part III A of this opinion, \u00a7 17a-101k (i) directed the defendant to adopt regulations to implement the registry provisions of the statute. At the time of the administrative proceedings in this case, however, draft regulations were still under review.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To fill the gap while those regulations were pending, the defendant was guided by criteria set forth in its policy manual.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Those criteria included specific circumstances under which a perpetrator of abuse shall be included on the registry.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For all other circumstances in which the defendant has substantiated an allegation of abuse or neglect, the manual directs the hearing officer to \u201creview the case for a determination of whether the perpetrator poses a risk to the health, safety and well-being of children and should be recommended for placement on the [registry]\u201d on the basis of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>factors, including, \u201cthe intent of the perpetrator, the severity of the impact and the chronicity of the perpetator\u2019s conduct . . . .\u201d The manual lists questions relevant to those factors that are specific to sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. In addition to the manual and statutes, there is, of course, a well developed body of case law addressing parameters for findings of abuse and neglect, as well as cases addressing circumstances when the defendant may act prophylactically. See, e.g., <em>In re Stephen M., </em>109 Conn. App. 644, 651 and n.11, 953 A.2d 668 (2008) (citing \u201cdoctrine of predictive neglect\u201d); <em>In re T.K., </em>105 Conn. App. 502, 513, 939 A.2d 9 (\u201c[t]he doctrine of predictive neglect is grounded in the state\u2019s responsibility to avoid harm to the well-being of a child, not to repair it after a tragedy has occurred\u201d), cert. denied, 286 Conn. 914, 945 A.2d 976 (2008); <em>In re Michael D., </em>58 Conn.

To require the defendant to delineate every act that would lead to placement of a person\u2019s name on the registry would be impracticable when the issue is a prediction of risk. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 155, 165, 425 A.2d 939 (1979) (rejecting vagueness challenge to \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard in parental termination case, reasoning that \u201c[standards of mathematical precision are neither possible nor desirable in this field; much must be left to the trial judge\u2019s experience and judgment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Piscottano </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>511 F.3d 247, 280 (2d Cir. 2007) (\u201ca regulation need not achieve \u2018meticulous specificity,\u2019 which would come at the cost of \u2018flexibility and reasonable breadth\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Finally, we note that the plaintiff has made the cursory assertion that the registry scheme is overbroad, but has provided no analysis independent of his vagueness claim.

He also has failed to make clear how the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Safety, </em>supra, 271 F.3d 38, bears on his claim. That case addressed whether the statutory scheme commonly known as Megan\u2019s Law, which requires persons convicted of sex offenses to register with the department of public safety and mandates disclosure of that registry to the public, violates procedural due process and constitutes an ex post facto law. Id., 41. \u201cWe repeatedly have stated that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mucci, </em>288 Conn. 379, 383 n.4, 952 A.2d 776 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Finally, we consider whether the registry scheme constitutes a bill of attainder in violation of article one, \u00a7 10, of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cBills of attainder are legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial . . . .\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>328 U.S. 303, 315, 66 S.

Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 442, 85 S. Ct. 1707, 14 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1965). A bill of attainder has \u201cthree requirements, i.e., specification of the affected persons, punishment, and lack of a judicial trial.\u201d <em>Selective Service System </em>v. <em>Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, </em>468 U.S. 841, 847, 104 S. Ct. 3348, 82 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The plaintiff contends that the registry scheme is a bill of attainder because: it applies to easily ascertainable members of a group\u2014persons deemed child abusers by the defendant; it inflicts punishment\u2014the potential loss of employment; and it does so without providing a judicial trial\u2014there is no judicial mechanism to determine whether a person has committed a wrongful act or the particular level of risk posed. We conclude that, even if we were to assume that the scheme satisfies the first and third requirements of a bill of attainder, it does not meet the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u201c[T]he [Supreme] Court [has] applied three tests to determine whether legislative punishment of the type contemplated by the [b]ill of [attainder [c]lauses was imposed: [1] the historical test, involving punishment traditionally judged to be prohibited by the [b]ill of [attainder [c]lause, <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of [General </em>Services], 433 U.S. 425, 475, 97 S.

Ct. 301, 126 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The registry scheme does not meet any of these tests for legislative punishment. The scheme does not ban persons listed on the registry from employment in any field, and therefore cannot be deemed to constitute historical punishment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 381 U.S. 458-61 (denying labor union employment in all but clerical or custodial positions to members of Communist party constituted punishment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em>supra, 328 U.S. 316-18 (barring named individuals from government employment without judicial trial constituted punishment); <em>Ex parte Garland, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 374-81, 18 L.

Ed. 356 (1867) (barring clergymen from ministry in absence of subscribing to loyalty oath constituted punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Turning to the functional test, although the registry scheme acknowledges that a potential effect of placement of a person\u2019s name on the registry could be impairment of certain employment opportunities; General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (b) (3); the stated purpose of the registry is \u201cto prevent or discover abuse of children . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101k (a). The limited disclosure permitted under the scheme is to agencies overseeing employment opportunities involving direct contact with children. The absence of the potential to cause abuse or neglect to children undoubtedly would constitute a legitimate qualification for such employment. See <em>De Veau </em>v. <em>Braisted, </em>363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S. Ct. 1146, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1109 (1960) (\u201c[t]he question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct, is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession\u201d); <em>Hawker </em>v. <em>New York, </em>170 U.S. 189, 18 S. Ct. 573,42 L. Ed. 1002 (1898) (precluding convicted felon from practicing medicine not bill of attainder when relevant to qualification for profession). Thus, the burden imposed undoubtedly furthers the nonpunitive purpose of protecting children.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Finally, the legislative record reflects that the legislature\u2019s sole motivation in enacting the registry was to ensure that children were protected from the risk of harm. Indeed, the isolated references in the legislative record to the effect of the disclosure on the abuser indicates concerns that the disclosure should accurately reflect the facts, be limited to the extent necessary to protect children and occur only after procedural due process had been afforded to the alleged abuser. See 39 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1996 Sess., pp. 1942-43; 48 H.R. Proc., Pt. 20, 2005 Sess., pp. 6075-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The fact that this registry scheme does not inflict, punishment also is confirmed by case law holding that publicly available sex offender registries, which undoubtedly have more far reaching consequences than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the registry at issue in the present case, are not punitive. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 103, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L.

Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court intended to retain jurisdiction while the hearing officer reconsidered its decision about whether to place the plaintiffs name on the registry.

Edward indicated that on one occasion [the plaintiff] put him in room M4 after he was acting out and closed the door. Edward stated that a physical altercation occurred between him and the other [detainee in room M4] for approximately [three] minutes. [The plaintiff] opened the door and watched them continue to fight until Edward stated [that] he was tired and could not defend himself any longer. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AYf\">\u201c[Detainee], Michael [S.], stated that he had an altercation with [the plaintiff] because he would not pick up a trash can. Michael indicated that [the plaintiff] \u2018grabbed [him] and threw him to the ground\u2019 after telling the child twice to pick up the can. Michael stated he was then grabbed by the upper arms from behind and \u2018clipped.\u2019 The term \u2018clipped\u2019 means that [the plaintiff]] put his foot in between the child\u2019s and pushed his shoulder causing him to fall [forward], . . .</p>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">\u201c[Detainee], John [M.], stated that he saw [the plaintiff] throw Michael [S.] to the ground after he cursed at staff.

A former detainee also reported that the plaintiff would \u201cput girls together who have [a] \u2018beef \u201d and that the plaintiff and another staff member would let detainees fight for awhile without intervening if they did not like a particular detainee. Another detainee alleged that he \u201cwas scared of a kid in his room who was making sexual advances and [the plaintiff] denied the room change. [The plaintiff] is the one that put him in that room as punishment as he said, \u2018See how you like this gay kid.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"a2g-dedup-0\">Bonola testified: \u201cEdward [B.] basically told me that [the plaintiff] . . . threatens children frequently at [the detention center]. He recollected an incident where [the plaintiff] had threatened to put a child\u2014have him go to a child\u2019s room for what he understood was an alleged beatdown, if you want to call it that, or an enforcement situation .... Basically ... he was concerned about [the plaintiffs] treatment of the kids and the fact that he threatens them, he was frightened, and that there was a situation again of putting another youth in another youth\u2019s room for\u2014to be physically assaulted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">Bonola also testified that Nordstrom had recounted to her an incident in which the head of the detention center had asked Nordstrom to interview John R. after John made allegations against the plaintiff. Nordstrom had told Bonola that John \u201ctold [Nordstrom and the head of the detention center] that he was going to be placed [by the plaintiff] in a room with another child for the purpose of being beat up because he was excessively banging, and that [the plaintiff] had told him that it was going to happen so that he\u2019d stop excessively banging.\u201d Bonola\u2019s written narrative of the interview with Nordstrom further reflected that Nordstrom had stated that John \u201cstarted crying and stated that he didn\u2019t feel safe and wanted to be transferred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> The plaintiff frames his constitutional challenges in reference to P.A. 05-207 generally.

For purposes of clarity, we refer to his challenges as ones to the registry scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\"> The plaintiff does assert a claim that the registry scheme violates the doctrine of separation of powers specifically under articles second and fifth of the Connecticut constitution by improperly delegating exclusive judicial power to the defendant. Although the plaintiff seeks review of this unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and our inherent supervisory authority, the sum of the plaintiffs argument appears to be predicated on his <em>assertion that the </em>registry inflicts a form of punishment. The plaintiff has not indicated how our analysis of whether the registry inflicts \u201cpunishment,\u201d for purposes of his bill of attainder claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>should differ from our analysis of this claim.
