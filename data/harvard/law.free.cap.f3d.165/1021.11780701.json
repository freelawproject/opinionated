Talk appeals a grant of summary judgment dismissing her Americans with Disabilities Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Texas Commission on Human Rights Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claims against Delta Airlines, Inc. Talk charged that the airline discriminated against her and failed to reasonably accommodate her alleged disability. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-21\">A childhood vehicle-pedestrian accident severely injured Connie J. Talk\u2019s (\u201cTalk\u201d) right leg. As a result, her right leg is shorter than her left and her foot is in a permanently flexed, or \u201cequine\u201d position. She walks on the ball of that foot and must wear a built-up shoe. Despite this deformity, she walks with only a slight limp and has undergone no physical therapy or surgery in the last 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-22\">Talk began working for Delta Airlines, Inc. (\u201cDelta\u201d) in Houston as an associate reservations sales agent in 1984. She transferred to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (\u201cDFW\u201d) two years later; shortly after-wards, Delta promoted her to reservations sales agent. She voluntarily transferred to Wichita, Kansas, to work in Department 125 as a customer service agent and returned the following year to DFW in that capacity. For the past eight years, except for the time period that is the subject of this suit, Talk has remained in Department 125, where her job duties include working at the ticket counter, the gate, and the baggage service areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-23\">Delta instituted company-wide cost-saving initiatives and DFW flight reductions in the spring of 1995. The airline selected some Department 125 employees, including Talk, on an inverse seniority basis to transfer to its operations sector. It offered these affected employees a choice of cargo (Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>135) or ramp (Department 120) positions. Talk chose the cargo position and became a \u201cpermanent\u201d employee of Department 135 effective May 1,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">Delta requires Department 135 workers to wear steel-toed shoes to protect their feet from injury. Talk could not find a manufacturer to provide a built-up shoe with a steel toe. When she reported this to Willis Uggen (\u201cUggen\u201d), the Delta operations manager, he obtained a waiver for her to work without protective footwear. Before allowing her to begin work, Uggen requested a doctor\u2019s statement confirming that Talk could not wear steel-toed shoes. Talk provided Delta such a letter from her doctor, who also warned that an injury to her leg, including a severe bruise, could result in the loss of her leg. Uggen was concerned by this warning and contacted Delta headquarters. The airline then decided that Talk could not work in cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Talk entered a voluntary job placement process, an established Delta procedure for employees who are permanently unable to perform their assigned duties. The goal of the process is to find a new, permanent placement commensurate with the employee\u2019s abilities and restrictions. Talk filled out the Accommodation Request Form, asking to be placed in a position that did not require wearing steel toed shoes and that would not subject her to injury. She requested a flight attendant position or a Department 125 slot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">While Delta sought a permanent position for Talk, it also opened temporary gate agent positions at DFW. Several of the former Department 125 employees, who had transferred to ramp operations, were loaned to their old department to help during the summer rush period. Delta anticipated that they would return to their permanent ramp positions at the end of the busy season. Because Talk had entered the placement process, she was not considered for these temporary positions. Some seven months after Talk entered the placement process, Delta decided to reopen permanent Department 125 positions. It offered these positions to all the former employees who had been loaned temporarily to that department; Delta also offered Talk one of the Department 125 positions. She accepted the offer November 3, 1995 and remains in that position today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">From May 1,1995 until the end of November, while its personnel specialist Alison Phillips (\u201cPhillips\u201d) attempted to find permanent placement for her, Delta allowed Talk to use her 55 days of accrued sick leave at full pay. She received no benefits after that time until she began anew her DFW customer service agent\u2019s job December 1, 1995. During the seven-month placement process, Delta ascertained that DFW had no permanent Department 125 openings and expected none in the foreseeable future. Phillips, however, presented Talk with several alternatives. The airline offered her a permanent Department 125 position at LaGuardia Airport and at JFK in New York; she rejected the positions because of the expense of moving<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the high cost of living in that area. She also expressed concern that the cold climate would hurt her leg. Phillips located a permanent customer service agent position in Department 125 in Atlanta, which Talk also refused because Delta did not agree to pay moving expenses. Phillips next offered Talk a transfer to any available \u201ctemporary part-time\u201d or \u201cready reserve\u201d customer service agent position in any Delta city as well as a permanent reservation sales agent job at DFW. The latter paid a starting salary only slightly less ($50 a month) than she had previously earned. Talk declined to interview for the permanent DFW opening but expressed interest in a temporary, part-time position at DFW. Phillips offered Talk such a position, but when Delta reopened permanent Department 125 jobs at DFW, Talk accepted and returned to her original job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">After completing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission grievance process, Talk sued Delta. She alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the airline had failed to \u2022 offer her a reasonable accommodation for her disability after it was determined that her childhood injury prevented her from working in the Delta cargo area to which she had been involuntarily transferred. Because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>claimed a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) along with violations of the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d), Delta removed the action. The airline then moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The district court, for the purposes of the summary judgment motion, assumed that Talk was \u201cdisabled\u201d under the ADA and TCHRA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It granted summary judgment on the grounds that Talk\u2019s refusal to accept the reasonable accommodation Delta offered her rendered her unqualified under the ADA. The court also summarily dismissed the state law claim, finding that Delta had made a good-faith effort to find Talk a reasonable accommodation. Talk then moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied. She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>136 F.3d 1047, 1049 (5th Cir.1998). Summary judgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review fact questions in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and questions of law <em>de novo. Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, </em>53 F.3d 723 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the ADA, Talk must show that (a) she has a disability; (b) she is a qualified individual for the job in question; and (c) an adverse employment decision was made because of her disability. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). The threshold issue in a plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case is a showing that she suffers from a disability protected by the ADA or the TCHRA. <em>Rogers v. International Marine Terminals, Inc., </em>87 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir.1996)(ADA); <em>McIntyre v. Kroger Co., </em>863 F.Supp. 355, 357 (N.D.Tex.1994)(TCHRA). The ADA confers a special meaning to the term \u201cdisability\u201d, with which the Texas statute is in accord:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-14\">(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such an individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-15\">(B) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-16\">(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-17\">Talle claims that her deformed leg is such a disability. We examine that claim with the knowledge that the statute requires an impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-18\">The ADA defines neither \u201csubstantially limits\u201d nor \u201cmajor life activities,\u201d but the regulations promulgated by the EEOC under the ADA provide significant guidance. Whether an impairment is substantially limiting <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is determined in light of (1) the nature and severity of the impairment, (2) its duration or expected duration, and (3) its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The EEOC regulations adopt the same definition of major life activities used in the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cMajor life activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>means functions such as earing for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">To determine if Talk has presented facts that indicate her leg impairment is an ADA or TCHRA disability, we first examine whether her leg deformity is an impairment that substantially limits any major life function other than working.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Only if there is no evidence of impairment to the other major life functions is an impairment to working considered.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The record reveals that Talk complains of an impairment to her ability to walk. We have found few cases defining what constitutes a substantial limitation on a person\u2019s ability to walk.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that moderate difficulty experienced while walking does not rise to the level of a disability. Talk asserts that she \u201cwalk[s] with a limp and move[s] at a significantly slower pace than the average person.\u201d She also claims that extreme cold causes her difficulty in walking. We note, however, that Talk had earlier requested transfers to Boston and New York, cities with cold winter climates. Talk\u2019s special orthopedic shoe, she admits, allows her to \u201cmaintain[ ] full mobility.\u201d We find that, although Talk experiences some impairment to her ability to walk, it does not rise to the level of a substantial impairment as required by the ADA and TCHRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">We now examine the effect Talk\u2019s leg deformity had on the major life activity of working. With regard to working,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-8\">[Substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">Talk presents evidence that her disability prevents her from working in Delta\u2019s cargo area. She can not wear steel-toed shoes; her doctor cautions that a severe bruise or a new break could result in the loss of her leg. Although Delta at first waived protective footwear for Talk, it later determined that there should never be a waiver of this requirement. Thus, Talk was unable to work in Department 135. Evidence of disqualification from a single position or a narrow range of jobs will not support a finding that an individual is substantially limited from the major life activity of working. <em>Sherrod v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>132 F.3d 1112, 1120 (5th Cir.1998). When an impairment like Talk\u2019s affects only a narrow range of jobs, we regard it either as \u201cnot reaching a major life activity or as not substantially limiting one.\u201d <em>Chandler v. City of Dallas, </em>2 F.3d 1385, 1392 (5th Cir.1993). We find here that Talk\u2019s disability does not substantially limit her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">We find no record of such a limitation in summary judgment evidence. Additionally, we do not find that Delta regarded Talk as having such an impairment. The airline readily admitted that Talk could not work in Department 135, but it actively sought positions for her in other areas. Even today, Talk remains a Delta customer service agent. Consequently, she has not shown that she is substantially limited in a major life activity under ADA or TCHRA provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-15\">Because we find that Talk fails to meet the threshold requirement of having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, we have no need to reach Talk\u2019s claim that Delta did not offer her reasonable accommodations. Accordingly, for the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>sons above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-16\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1120-24\">.
