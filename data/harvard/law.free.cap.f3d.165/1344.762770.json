Because the Shyfaees established that Cheyenne\u2019s death was a vaccine injury in terms of \u2019300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">Cheyenne was born on February 8, 1993. He received a combination Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT) vaccine on April 1, 1993. His mother and grandmother testified as to the ensuing events.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 2 Cheyenne was less responsive and would not cry. On April 3 Cheyenne did not respond to his caregivers or to his environment; he did not move his head, grasp, vocalize, smile, or cuddle as before; he took no nourishment and very little water; he simply lay without response with glazed and staring eyes. When his diaper was changed, the leg in which the vaccine was injected jerked uncontrollably. On the evening of April 4, Cheyenne did move his eyes to some extent. However, Cheyenne developed a fever which rose precipitously in the early hours of the next day. On April 5, at 5:23 A.M., Cheyenne was brought to the emergency room with a temperature of 109 degrees Fahrenheit. He went into respiratory arrest immediately upon arrival. Despite ice applications and attempts at cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, Cheyenne was pronounced dead at 6:38 A.M. The death certificate listed cause of death as respiratory arrest due to 110 degree fever with dehydration and infection. An autopsy produced cultures demonstrating a modest growth of E.coli bacteria. June and Patricia Shyface claimed compensation under the Vaccine Act, relying upon either of the two methods of establishing entitlement under the Act. Under the Table method, the Shyfaees alleged that encephalopathy (an injury listed in the Vaccine Injury Table) occurred within the requisite 72-hour period, and that Cheyenne\u2019s death was a sequela of the encephalopathy. <em>See </em>\u2019300aa-14(a)(I). Under the non-Table method, the Shyfaees alleged that Cheyenne\u2019s death was caused by the DPT vaccination. <em>See </em>\u2019300aa-ll(e)(l)(C)(ii). The Secretary of Health and Human Services recommended denial of the claim, on the ground that the E.coli infection (sepsis) was the principal cause of Cheyenne\u2019s death and was unrelated to the DPT vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">An evidentiary hearing before the special master was held on September 16, 1996. William Torch, M.D., a pediatric neurologist, testified for the Shyfaees. Dr. Torch testified that Cheyenne\u2019s death was caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>high fever, resulting from a combination of the DPT vaccination and the E.coli infection. Dr. Torch testified that Cheyenne would not have died but for the DPT vaccination, that he would not have died but for the E.coli infection, and that it was the combination of the two that caused his death. Dr. Torch testified that he could not determine whether the DPT vaccination or the E.coli infection was the predominant cause of Cheyenne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">Lucy P. Rorke, M.D., a pathologist, and John McDonald, M.D., a pediatric neurologist, testified for the Secretary. Dr. Rorke testified that although there was no pneumonia evident in Cheyenne\u2019s air passages, it existed in the cell linings. Dr. Rorke acknowledged that Cheyenne\u2019s temperature was very unusual and that in her experience, infants with bacterial infections do not have a temperature of 110 degrees. Dr. McDonald opined that when one observes sepsis, whether at mild or moderate levels, one need look no further for another cause of death. Dr. McDonald testified that it has not been proven that DPT can cause permanent injury or death. Thus both Dr. Rorke and Dr. McDonald testified that an E.coli pneumonia caused Cheyenne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The special master, considering this testimony, found that a preponderance of the evidence showed that Cheyenne sustained an encephalopathy, a Table injury, within the requisite 72-hour period. The special master also found that Cheyenne\u2019s death was causally related to the administration of the DPT vaccine, and that it was less likely that the E.coli infection alone caused Cheyenne\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-6\">Dr. Torch argues persuasively that sepsis alone could not have caused Cheyenne\u2019s death; his temperature was much higher than would be expected in the case of an E.coli infection alone, particularly at the moderate levels of infection indicated by test cultures. The ultimate cause of death, hyperpyrexia, more likely was brought on by a combination of the two factors, E.coli and the pertussis vaccine both of which are known pyrogens (capable of causing fever) ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">The special master determined that contrary to the Secretary\u2019s position, Cheyenne did not suffer an \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cfulminating\u201d sepsis, since the levels of E.coli found during autopsy were \u201cquite modest\u201d and \u201cfar less\u201d than expected in a case of overwhelming sepsis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">The court gives weight to the fact that the levels of bacteria found on autopsy were quite modest, far less than expected in an overwhelming E.coli infection. Only a small number of bacteria were found in the bladder and the lung \u2014 certainly not an overwhelming condition. Dr. McDonald described one case of fatal E.coli infection observed in his own professional experience, but admitted that unlike this present case, \u201cquite a bit\u201d of E.coli bacteria was found in the lungs and blood samples. No other organisms were confirmed in Cheyenne\u2019s case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">The special master determined that the Secretary failed to prove that an overwhelming sepsis was the principal cause of death, and that the findings of the pathologist who performed the initial autopsy supported Dr. Torch\u2019s testimony that sepsis alone could not explain Cheyenne\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-10\">Respondent\u2019s claim that the infection was \u201cfulminating\u201d or \u201coverwhelming\u201d is without sufficient foundation. When asked, Dr. Rorke admitted that the primary reason she suspects an \u201coverwhelming\u201d sepsis is not based on the pathological findings, but on the fact that the child died. Dr. McDonald also admitted as much. Reliance on such basis amounts to impermissible speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-11\">The court also gives weight to the fact that the pathologist who actually performed the initial autopsy, Dr. McKinley, is in apparent agreement with petitioners\u2019 expert, Dr. Torch. Dr. McKinley concluded that the autopsy findings were insufficient to explain Cheyenne\u2019s death. He was puzzled that the infant\u2019s reaction was out of proportion with what was found on autopsy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ase-dedup-0\">The special master concluded that the Shy-faces proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Cheyenne suffered an encephalopathy within three days of his vaccination and that this Table injury was the cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>his death. The special master also concluded that the Shyfaces proved that \u201cCheyenne\u2019s death was, in fact, causally related to the administration of the vaccine.\u201d The statutory compensation was awarded to the Shy-faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The Court of Federal Claims reviewed the special master\u2019s decision. The court noted that the Secretary \u201c[did] not challenge the special master\u2019s factual determinations regarding the existence of an encephalopathy and fever, both of which were based on the credibility of testimony given by Patricia and June Shyface and their expert, Dr. Torch.\u201d Instead, the Secretary objected to the special master\u2019s decision on the legal grounds that the Shyfaces had not proven an encephalopathy under the recently revised Vaccine Injury Table regulations, <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u2019100(b)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had not proven that the vaccine had actually caused Cheyenne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The Court of Federal Claims remanded for further findings of fact and conclusions of law. Referring to the Table and non-Table methods, the court ruled that \u201cthe special master must ascertain whether and exactly how petitioners sustained their burden under either method, or both.\u201d The court determined that the special master had failed to apply the recently revised Vaccine Injury Table regulations, 42 C.F.R. \u2019100.3(b)(2), to determine whether the severity and dura-tional elements of encephalopathy were present. The court also held that the special master, in addressing the actual causation, non-Table injury method, did not explain \u201chow, on the basis of Dr. Torch\u2019s testimony, petitioners have shown actual causation, or a direct nexus between the vaccine and Cheyenne\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">On remand, the special master applied the revised regulations and determined that the Shyfaces did not prove that Cheyenne met the recently revised requirements of a Table injury of encephalopathy, and that the Shy-faces did not prove that the vaccine was the predominant cause of Cheyenne\u2019s death. The special master reviewed Dr. Torch\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-11\">Dr. Torch does not retreat from his opinion that the vaccine carries the weight of the blame for Cheyenne\u2019s death. However, his testimony, as a whole, supports both sources as cause:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-12\">[Q] Is there any way of telling ... any scientific way of determining which of those two is more responsible for the high temperature. [A] I don\u2019t believe so. I don\u2019t know how much you could attribute to each etiology. I cannot go so far that one predominated over the other in terms of the death itself. But he would not have died without the vaccine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Tr. at 100-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">The special master determined that the Shy-faces had not met their burden of proving causation, in view of the evidence that both the vaccine and the infection contributed to Cheyenne\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-15\">In reading the printed text of the transcript, one does not sense fully the level of conviction with which Dr. Torch presented his opinion that \u201cbut for\u201d the vaccine, Cheyenne would not have died. Upon review, however, I now find that Dr. Torch\u2019s testimony is insufficiently persuasive to establish that death, in fact, was caused by the vaccine. Petitioners evidence of a vaccine-related cause stands possibly in equipoise, but no better. As even Dr. Torch conceded, it is impossible to know with any degree of confidence, which source is the predominant cause of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-16\">Respondent\u2019s evidence is equally persuasive. Without the benefit of the statutory presumption conferred by the presence of a Table injury, and because petitioners have the burden of affirmatively proving a vaccine-related cause, it is my opinion that petitioners cannot prevail on the record as it stands. I base my conclusion on my determination that petitioners have failed to carry their burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a1e-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number><em>The </em>Court of Federal Claims, sustaining the special master\u2019s denial of compensation, held that it must be shown that the vaccine was the actual cause of death, and that the \u201cbut for\u201d standard is insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-4\">Both before the special master and again in the motion for review, petitioners argue that the regulation does not require them to prove that the vaccine was the sole cause of death, but only that it was a significant cause of death. According to the petitioners, the special master erred by evaluating whether the DPT vaccination was the \u201cpredominant] cause\u201d of the infant\u2019s death, rather that assessing if \u201cbut for\u201d the vaccination, the infant would not have died. The concept of \u201cbut for\u201d causation derives from traditional negligence standard in tort law. The Vaccine Act, however, is a no-fault compensation scheme whereby relief is granted only when the vaccine is shown actually to have caused a vaccine-related injury. The standard of \u201cactual causation\u201d is more stringent than the \u201cbut for\u201d standard, which is reasonable given the no-fault nature of the Vaccine Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">(Citations omitted.) The trial court entered judgment for the Secretary, and the Shyfaces appealed their non-Table claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The issue is whether the Shyfaces established entitlement to compensation by proving that Cheyenne\u2019s DPT vaccine was a but-for cause of his death. Because the Shyfaces established that the DPT vaccine was a but-for cause of and a substantial factor in Cheyenne\u2019s death, we conclude that the Shyfaces are entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">The Shyfaces argue that there was a preponderance of evidence that the DPT vaccine \u201ccaused\u201d Cheyenne\u2019s death as contemplated in the words of the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">\u2019300aa-ll(c) Petition content</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-11\">A petition for compensation under the Program for a vaccine-related injury or death shall contain\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">(I) except as provided in paragraph (3), an affidavit, and supporting documentation, demonstrating that the person who suffered such injury or who died\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-13\">tfc <em>i'fi </em>\u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-14\">(C)(ii)(I) sustained, <em>or </em>had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition not set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table but which was caused by a vaccine referred to in subpara-graph (A), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-15\">(II) sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or significant aggravation of which did not occur within the time period set forth in the Table but which was caused by a vaccine referred to in subparagraph (A)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">The Shyfaces state that the Court of Federal Claims erred in ruling that this causation required that the DPT vaccination was the \"predominant cause\u201d of Cheyenne\u2019s death. According to the Shyfaces, the law of torts is the source of the statute\u2019s rule of causation, and tort law does not require that the DPT vaccine was the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d of Cheyenne\u2019s death, but only that the DPT vaccine was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Cheyenne\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">The Shyfaces cite <em>Grant v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>956 F.2d 1144 (Fed.Cir.1992) as supporting the position that the statutory causation requirement is drawn from tort law. The <em>Grant </em>court, in discussing the required showing of causation in non-Table injuries, cited <em>Hasler v. United States, </em>718 F.2d 202, 205 (6th Cir.1983), a Federal Tort Claims Act decision arising from vaccination against swine flu. <em>Hasler </em>applied the law of Michigan, the state in which Grant could have pursued a traditional tort claim. Accordingly, the Shyfaces argue that in the case at bar, the court should look to Montana law to determine whether there was a sufficient showing of causation. Montana applies the \u201cbut for\u201d test for causation. <em>See Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 370, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>916 P.2d 122 (1996). The Shyfaces argue that the special master\u2019s determinations establish that Cheyenne\u2019s DPT vaccine was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Cheyenne\u2019s death, and that in accordance with Montana law liability has been established. The Shyfaces add that the \u201cbut for\u201d test finds support in the Restatement (Second) of Torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The Secretary disagrees, citing our decisions in <em>Grant, supra, </em>and <em>Munn v. Secretary of Department of Health and Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863 (Fed.Cir.1992). In <em>Grant </em>we stated that the Vaccine Act \u201cdoes not relax proof of causation in fact for non-Table injuries.\u201d 956 F.2d at 1147. In <em>Munn </em>we stated: \u201cThe claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine, and not some other agent, was the actual cause of the injury. Given the vagaries of human illnesses, particularly in young children, that is not always an easy burden to carry.\u201d 970 F.2d at 865. The Secretary states that the Shyfaces had to demonstrate that the vaccine caused the injury, applying the preponderance of the evidence standard, meaning that they had to demonstrate \u201cthat the vaccine is more likely than any other factor to have been directly responsible for the injury.\u201d That is, the Secretary argues that precedent requires more than showing that the injury would not have occurred but for the vaccination. In <em>Abbott v. Secretary of Department of Health and Human Servs., </em>27 Fed.Cl. 792 (1993), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part and remanded, </em>19 F.3d 39 (Fed.Cir.1994), when a child drowned in a bathtub after suffering a seizure that was presumptively vaccine-related, the Court of Federal Claims held, and the Federal Circuit affirmed, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">[The child\u2019s] death was not due to pathological forces set in motion by his vaccine injury. Rather, his death was the result of a suffocation brought on by an external force \u2014 the filling of his lungs with water. ... His death, therefore, was an accident, precipitated perhaps by his disorder but not the <em>medical </em>consequence of that disorder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Similarly, the Secretary argues, Cheyenne\u2019s death was not due to forces set in motion by the vaccine, but rather by an existing and overwhelming sepsis. The Secretary argues that Cheyenne\u2019s death was not the \u201cmedical consequence\u201d of a vaccine injury, even if he suffered a vaccine-associated fever from which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">The Secretary adds that application of the \u201cbut for\u201d test would fundamentally undercut the Vaccine Act\u2019s framework as established by Congress. The Secretary argues that the Shyfaces reliance on Montana law and the Restatement is misplaced, since the Vaccine Act is not a negligence-based system and does not employ negligence-based standards. The Secretary argues that the petitioners should be held to the same standard of proof as the Secretary in the rebuttal case. The statute provides that the petitioner must establish causation by a preponderance of the evidence, and compensation may be awarded only if there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the injury was due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine:</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">\u2019300aa-13(a) General Rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ade-dedup-0\">(1) Compensation shall be awarded under this Program to a petitioner if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-10\">(A) that the petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence the matters required in the petition by section 300-aa-ll(c)(l) of this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-11\">(B) that there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the illness, disability, injury, condition, or death described in the petition is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-12\">The special master or court may not make such a finding based on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or by medical opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">The Secretary points out that in rebutting with evidence of factors unrelated to the vaccine, it is not enough for the Secretary to establish that other factors merely contributed to producing the injuiy. Instead, the Secretary must prove that the \u201cfactors unrelated\u201d were \u201cprincipally responsible\u201d for causing the injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>\u2019300aa-13(a)(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term \u201cfactors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine\u201d-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-4\">(A) does not include any idiopathies, unexplained, unknown, hypothetical, or un-documentable cause, factor, injury, illness, or condition, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-5\">(B) may, as documented by the petitioner\u2019s evidence or other material in the record, include <em>infection, toxins, </em>trauma (including birth trauma and related anoxia), or metabolic disturbances which have no known relation to the vaccine involved, but which in the particular case are shown to have been the agent or agents <em>principally responsible for causing </em>the petitioner\u2019s illness, disability, injury, condition, or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">(Emphases added.) The Secretary argues that the statutory use of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d in both \u2019300aa-13(a)(l)(A) (referring to the petitioner\u2019s burden) and \u2019300aa-13(a)(l)(B) (referring to the Secretary\u2019s burden) indicates that the petitioners should be held to the same burden in proving causation as the Secretary is held in proving \u201cfactors unrelated.\u201d The Secretary states that the statute is not satisfied if the petitioner shows only that the vaccine contributed equally to the injury and was a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">There is a dearth of precedent discussing the requirements for <em>prima facie </em>causation. The court in <em>Grant </em>stated that \u201cthe Vaccine Act does not relax proof of causation in non-Table injuries.\u201d The Shyfaees state that in accordance with <em>Munn </em>they proved \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine, and not some other agent, was the actual cause\u201d of Cheyenne\u2019s death. Addressing the Secretary\u2019s argument that petitioners should be held to the same burden of proof when proving causation as the Secretary is held when proving \u201cfactors unrelated\u201d, the Shyfaees argue that the elevated burden placed on the Secretary in proving a \u201cfactor unrelated\u201d is imposed by statute and is unique to the Secretary\u2019s proof of a \u201cfactor unrelated\u201d. The Shyfaees argue that the statute requires that petitioners \u201cdemonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d, \u2019300aa-13(a)(l)(A), that the injury \u201cwas caused by a vaccine\u201d, \u2019300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii). In contrast, the statute requires that in rebutting <em>prima facie </em>causation, the Secretary must prove by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d, \u2019300aa-13(a)(1)(B), that agents other than the vaccine are \u201cprincipally responsible for causing the petitioner\u2019s illness\u201d, \u2019300aa-13(a)(2)(B). Thus, according to the Shyfaees, the statute in formulating the Secretary\u2019s burden combines \u201cprincipally responsible\u201d with the term \u201ccausing\u201d to yield a higher standard than \u201ccausation\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">In <em>Knudsen v. Secretary of Department of Health and Human Servs., </em>35 F.3d 543 (Fed.Cir.1994), this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-10\">As the Knudsens agree, the standards that apply to a petitioner\u2019s proof of actual causation in fact in off-Table cases should be the same as those that apply to the government\u2019s proof of alternative actual causation in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 549. The Shyfaees argue that notwithstanding this language, <em>Knudsen </em>did not hold broadly that the standard for a petitioner\u2019s proof of actual causation in non-Table eases should be the same as the standard for the Secretary\u2019s proof of alternative actual causation; <em>Knudsen </em>turned on whether the Secretary, in proving \u201cfactors unrelated\u201d, \u2019300aa-13(a)(2), was required to identify the specific virus that was principally responsible for causing the petitioner\u2019s encephalopathy. According to the Shyfaees, the \u201cstandards\u201d referred to in the quoted portion of <em>Knudsen </em>refer to the level of detail or specificity required concerning how the vaccine or other agent caused an injury. Thus the Shyfaees argue that <em>Knudsen </em>did not establish the burden of proof for all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">The Vaccine Act allows a petitioner to establish <em>prima facie </em>entitlement to compensation using the non-Table method, <em>i.e., </em>by showing that the injury was \u201ccaused\u201d by the vaccine. <em>See </em>\u2019300aa-ll(e)(l)(C)(ii). The parties offer divergent interpretations of the statutory word \u201ccause\u201d. This issue of statutory interpretation receives plenary review. Because the statute does not elaborate on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>requirement of causation in the proof of a non-Table case, we turn to the legislative history of the Vaccine Act. <em>See Grant, </em>956 F.2d at 1147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">The legislative history provides some guidance in ascertaining Congressional intent with respect to the \u201cbut for\u201d standard proposed by the Shyfaees and the \u201cpredominant cause\u201d standard proposed by the Secretary. The House Report concerning \u2019300aa-ll states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-5\">If the petitioner sustained or had significantly aggravated an injury not listed in the Table, he or she may petition for compensation. If the petitioner sustained or had significantly aggravated an injury listed in the Table but not within the time period set forth in the Table, he or she may petition for compensation. <em>In both of these cases, however, the petition must affirmatively demonstrate that the injury or aggravation was caused by the vaccine. </em>Simple similarity to conditions or time periods listed in the Table is not sufficient evidence of causation; <em>evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medical testimony is necessary to demonstrate causation for such a petitioner. </em>(Such a finding of causation is deemed to exist for those injuries listed in the Table which occur within the time period set forth in the Table.) The Committee does not intend, however, to suggest that variance from the Table should act as a presumption against the petitioner but rather only that <em>such a petitioner is not to be deemed eligible for compensation without further showings of causation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">H.R.Rep. No. 99-908 at 15 (1986) U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1986, at 6287, 6356 (emphases added). The legislative history of \u2019300aa-13, the provision relating to the Secretary\u2019s rebuttal of a <em>prima facie </em>case, is also helpful, for although it does not deal with all of the legal nuances of causation, it reaffirms the burden on the Secretary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-7\">In its determination that the injury was not caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine, the court may rely on evidence of other infections, traumas, or conditions-but is not to include speculative or hypothetical matters or explanations. <em>If the injury is not demonstrated to have been caused by other, defined illnesses or factors </em>and the injury is demonstrated to have met the other requirements of Section 2111 [codified at \u2019300aa-ll] and the Table, the injury is to be <em>deemed to be vaccine-related.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-9\">The Committee recognizes that there is public debate over the incidence of illnesses that coincidentally occur within a short time of vaccination. The Committee further recognizes that the deeming of vaccine-relatedness adopted here may provide compensation to some children whose illness is not, in fact, vaccine-related.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 18 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1986, at 6359 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">As we have mentioned, the Shyfaees argue that determination of causation in non-Table eases invokes the law of the state in which the tort claim would have been brought, and that in Montana the \u201cbut for\u201d test controls causation. The Secretary replies that in a non-Table case involving concurrent causes, unless the petitioner can prove that the vaccine was the predominant or principal cause of injury, the petitioner has not presented the requisite <em>prima facie </em>case and the Secretary need not demonstrate an alternate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">The absence of elaboration of the law of causation in the legislative history leads us to conclude that the Vaccine Act\u2019s requirement of causation in non-Table cases was not viewed as distinct from causation in the tort law. However, at the threshold, we do not agree with the Shyfaees that the applicable law is the law of the state in which the tort claim could have been brought. The purpose of the Vaccine Act was to establish a compensation program under which awards could be made to vaccine-injured persons \u201cquickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 99-908 at 3 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1986, at 6344. National uniformity in administration is implicit in the statutory scheme. This purpose would not be served by requiring recourse to varying state negligence laws in determining causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">A uniform approach, one which implements the statutory purpose, is that of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. The general provision for the requirement of causation in establishing tort liability provides useful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>analogy to the overall terms of the Vaccine Act. The Restatement proposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-4\">\u2019430. Necessity of Adequate Causal Relation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-5\">In order that a negligent actor shall be liable for another\u2019s harm, it is necessary not only that the actor\u2019s conduct be negligent toward the other, but also that the negligence of the actor be a <em>legal cause </em>of the other\u2019s harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">\u2019430 (emphasis added). The Restatement then defines \u201clegal cause\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-7\">\u2019431. What Constitutes Legal Cause The actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-8\">(a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-9\">(b) there is no rule of law relieving the actor from liability because of the manner in which his negligence has resulted in the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-10\">\u2019432. Negligent Conduct as Necessary Antecedent of Harm</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-11\">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-12\">(2) If two forces are actively operating, one because of the actor\u2019s negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor\u2019s negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">Thus the Restatement provides that the \u201cbut for\u201d criterion is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish causation due to a negligent action; that action must also be a substantial factor in causing the injury. <em>See </em>\u2019431 cmt. a (\u201cIn order to be a legal cause of another\u2019s harm, it is not enough that the harm would not have occurred had the actor not been negligent. Except as stated in \u2019432(2), this is necessary, but it is not of itself sufficient. The negligence must also be a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiffs harm.\u201d) On this definition, we disagree with the Shyfaces that but-for causation is sufficient to establish liability, for as the Court of Federal Claims observed, \u201cthe standard of \u2018actual causation\u2019 is more stringent than the \u2018but for\u2019 standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">We adopt the Restatement rule for purposes of determining vaccine injury, that an action is the \u201clegal cause\u201d of harm if that action is a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in bringing about the harm, and that the harm would not have occurred but for the action. <em>See </em>\u2019431. The Restatement recognizes that concurrent forces may bring about a single harm, requiring weighing the contributing factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-16\">There are frequently a number of events each of which is not only a necessary antecedent to the other\u2019s harm, but is also recognizable as having an appreciable effect in bringing it about. Of these the actor\u2019s conduct is only one. Some other event which is a contributing factor in producing the harm may have such a predominant effect in bringing it about as to make the effect of the actor\u2019s negligence insignificant and, therefore, to prevent it from being a substantial factor. So too, although no one of the contributing factors may have such a predominant effect, their combined effect may, as it were, so dilute the effect of the actor\u2019s negligence as to prevent it from being a substantial factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">\u2019433 cmt. d. The Restatement ftirther provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-18\">In order that a negligent actor may be liable for harm resulting to another from his conduct, it is only necessary that it be a legal cause of the harm. It is not necessary that it be <em>the </em>cause, using the word \u201cthe\u201d as meaning the sole and even the predominant cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-19\">\u2019430 cmt. d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\">This rule that the vaccine must be a substantial factor in bringing about the harm accords with the legislative history of the Vaccine Act. Implementing this principle in terms of the Vaccine Act statutory provisions, establishment of <em>prima facie </em>entitlement to compensation according to the non-Table method would require the petitioner to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the vaccine was not only a but-for cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. As discussed in <em>Grant, </em>956 F.2d at 1148, in order to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>that the vaccine was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury, the petitioner must show \u201ca medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury.\u201d There must be a \u201clogical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">The Shyfaces established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the DPT vaccination was a substantial factor contributing to and bringing about Cheyenne\u2019s death. The facts are undisputed. The special master found that Cheyenne would not have died but for the DPT vaccination, and that the DPT vaccine contributed to Cheyenne\u2019s death by causing him to experience an exceptionally high fever. The special master also found that the sepsis was not the predominant cause of his death. Thus although the Shyfaces did not prove that the DPT vaccine was the only or predominant cause of his death, the requirements of the Vaccine Act are met <em>prima facie </em>upon proof of the substantial factor criterion. We have not been shown reversible error in the special master\u2019s finding that the Secretary failed to prove that factors unrelated to the vaccine were principally responsible for Cheyenne\u2019s death. See \u2019300aa-18(a)(2)(B). Therefore, the Shyfaces established entitlement to compensation by showing that the DPT vaccine was both a but-for cause of and a substantial factor in Cheyenne\u2019s death. The petitioners shall be awarded the statutory compensation for the vaccine-related death of Cheyenne.
