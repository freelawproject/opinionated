This statute, enacted in 1930, provides for the licensing of persons engaged in the business of buying or selling perishable commodities in interstate commerce. It also outlines certain courses of conduct as being unlawful, and then authorizes the issuance of regulations the better to carry the legislation into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">Among the provisions in the statute is \u00a7 499e providing that liabilities for violations of the Act may be enforced by complaint to the Secretary followed by <em>de novo </em>appeal to the appropriate district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">The complaint related to three shipments by Joseph A. Re\u00edan doing business as Re-\u00edan Produce Farms of Amite, Louisiana, to Georgia Vegetable Company of Tifton, Georgia. For convenience we will designate these shipments as Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The Secretary made findings of fact concerning these three shipments, a part of which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-20\">Shipment 1: On or about June 26, 1980, the parties entered into an agreement whereby respondent (Georgia Vegetable) was to sell for complainant\u2019s account one lot of green peppers. On that date complainant shipped from a Louisiana loading point one truckload of green peppers consisting of 1,102 cartons of large U.S. No. 1 peppers and 200 cartons of medium U.S. No. 2 peppers. The truck contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ing these peppers arrived at respondent\u2019s place of business at an unknown time and date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\">The peppers on this truck were received and accepted by respondent, and sold by respondent on or about June 28, 1981, to buyers in Georgia, North Carolina, Kansas City and Houston. Respondent remitted a total of $7526.70 to complainant for 802 cartons of large and 200 cartons of medium peppers sold, leaving 300 cartons of large peppers unaccounted for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">Shipment 2: On June 30, 1980 complainant and respondent entered into an oral contract for the sale by complainant and purchase by respondent of another truckload of peppers at a price of $9.50 per carton delivered to Tifton, Georgia. On that date, complainant loaded and shipped from a loading point in the State of Louisiana one truckload of peppers consisting of 1,064 cartons of large U.S. No. l\u2019s conforming to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">This June 30, 1980 shipment reached the respondent\u2019s place of business in Tif-ton, Georgia at an unknown time and date and was received and accepted by respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">Respondent has remitted $5,006 to complainant for this lot of peppers, leaving a balance due of $5,102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">Shipment No. 3: On June 26, 1980 the parties entered into an oral contract for the sale of one truckload of peppers, to be delivered to respondent\u2019s customer Castellini in Cincinnati, Ohio. Under this contract the price is $9.25 per carton for large U.S. No. 1 peppers, and $5.50 per carton for medium U.S. No. 2 peppers, delivered. On that same date, complainant loaded out from its Louisiana loading point 903 cartons of large U.S. No. 1 peppers and 290 cartons of medium U.S. No. 2 peppers into a truck operated by Walker Truck Lines, Mississippi License 2471.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">That truck arrived in Cincinnati at an unknown time and date. It was received and accepted by respondent\u2019s customer in Cincinnati, but at that time the customer expressed some doubt about the product by telephone to respondent in Georgia and also to complainant. Complainant asked for a federal inspection, but this was not obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">At an unknown time and date, respondent remitted to complainant the amount of $6,132.25, leaving a balance of $3,815.50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">For reasons, differing with respect to each of the three shipments, as discussed below, the Secretary entered a reparations order in favor of Re\u00edan for the sum of $14,461.68 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">In its suit to set aside the reparations order, Georgia Vegetable challenged the facts as found by the Secretary and, without making any mention of the regulations issued under \u00a7 499e, asserted, in general terms, that the transactions had all been handled in accordance with a custom which had grown up between the parties over a period of some 15 years of dealings. It also alleged that the stated custom between these parties had in fact become a custom of the trade, which should control the relations between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">On his part, Re\u00edan seeks to have us hold that a custom of dealing between the parties could not constitute a waiver or estop-pel against his relying upon the regulations and that a custom of the, trade could not prevent him from relying upon the regulations. Because of the specific findings by the Secretary, Relan\u2019s express request in his defensive pleadings in the district court action that the court affirm in full the action of the Secretary, and the failure of Re\u00edan to file a cross-appeal complaining of the failure of the Secretary to base his findings on the failure of Georgia Vegetable to comply with other regulations, not specified by the Secretary, we conclude that we do not reach these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">In his responsive pleading, appellant Re-\u00edan dealt with each shipment separately and after asserting factual matters with respect to each concluded with the following statement: \u201cBy way of further answer the respondent adopts and incorporates the findings and conclusions of the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>of Agriculture and prays that they adopted and affirmed by this court.\u201d In addition, under the heading \u201cArgument\u201d in the defensive pleading, he stated again: \u201cThe respondent adopts and incorporates the findings and conclusions of the Secretary of Agriculture (as they appear in Exhibits B and C) and prays that the findings of said judicial officer be adopted and affirmed by this court.\u201d Thus, four times in his defensive pleading, appellant made it plain that the decision of the Secretary, and the basis for the decision was adopted by him as his stated position in the district court hearing. be</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\">Now, on appeal, Re\u00edan cites a number of regulations as codified generally under 7 C.F.R. 46.2 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The problem facing appellant here is that the Secretary based none of his awards in his reparation order on either of these regulations. Thus, the district court was not put on notice of the fact that they were involved in the case to be tried by it. A careful reading of the entire transcript of the trial makes it clear that at no time was the trial court expressly put on notice of the contentions of the appellant that the failure of Georgia Vegetable Company to comply with either of these regulations entitled Re\u00edan to have the Secretary\u2019s order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">The standard of review before the district court was established by the statute: \u201cSuch suit in the district court shall be a trial <em>de novo </em>and shall proceed in all respects like other civil suits for damages, except that the findings of fact and order or orders of the Secretary shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499g(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Because the Secretary\u2019s order cited explicit grounds for his determination that Re\u00edan was entitled to recovery on each of the three shipments and since we conclude that it is only these grounds that may be considered on this appeal, <em>Wolf v. Frank, 477 </em>F.2d 467 (5th Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 975, 94 S.Ct. 287, 38 L.Ed.2d 218, we quote the language of the Secretary\u2019s order dealing with each specific shipment. Under the heading \u201cConclusions\u201d the order provided as follows. As to Shipment No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHW\">... It is not clear from the record that respondent ever rendered a timely accounting for this transaction. What is clear is that it shipped more than half of the peppers out of Georgia; <em>i.e. </em>to Houston, Kansas City, and North Carolina points, in violation of a PACA regulation 7 C.F.R. 46.29(a), which requires the consignor\u2019s permission to sell consigned produce outside the consignee\u2019s market area. Clearly no permission was given here since complainant is insisting that he should have received the prices prevailing in the nearest Georgia market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">We agree that the respondent\u2019s handling of this transaction is below the standard of care and diligence contemplated by the above numbered regulation. Respondent should have made a diligent effort to obtain the best prices possible____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">As to the second shipment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">For the truck shipped on June 30, 1980 which respondent received in Tifton, Georgia, respondent resisted paying the full invoice amount because of the poor arrival condition. Respondent alleges that after discussion with complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>some of the product was dumped and some of it sold and that he had already paid \u201cmore than the pepper was worth.\u201d Complainant\u2019s opening statement is a rambling and in part, incoherent response to respondent\u2019s answer regarding this transaction, but complainant seems to be saying that respondent should have obtained a federal inspection on the lot to support any deductions from the purchase price. Respondent did attach a copy of a July 2, 1980 report of inspection of some Louisiana peppers made in its cooler in Tifton, Georgia. The report does describe a somewhat decayed product. However, since the cartons did not have complainant\u2019s name or brand on them there is no proof that the peppers inspected were from the lot shipped by complainant on June 30. We must conclude that respondent, having failed to show a breach of contract \u2014 a poor arrival condition of the product \u2014 is liable for the full purchase price. <em>Jimmy Griz-zard Sales v. Lloyd Myers, </em>40 A.B. 830 (1981). Its failure to pay that sum to complainant is a violation of \u00a7 2 of the Act for which reparation should be awarded, (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">As to shipment 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">Respondent is in much of the same situation for the peppers which complainant shipped on June 26, 1980 to respondent\u2019s customer in Cincinnati. Respondent states that these were first refused by its customer as bad on arrival, but later the customer paid $6,132.25 for this lot, which amount respondent then remitted to complainant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-6\">Apparently respondent is trying to escape responsibility for this transaction by converting it into a consignment, but has not proved that complainant agreed to this. Complainant does not exactly deny this but states that it had requested a federal inspection and never received it. We conclude that complainant\u2019s agreement for consignment handling, if there was one, was conditioned on respondent\u2019s furnishing proof of bad arrival. Since respondent never complied with this condition, the transaction remained an outright sale under the terms of which respondent is liable for the full purchase price. Its failure to pay the same is a violation of section 2 of the Act for which reparation should be awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">In a trial <em>de novo </em>evidence in addition to that introduced before the Secretary may, of course, be offered and considered in the <em>de novo </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Once again, we go back to the three separate shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Shipment No. 1: The Secretary\u2019s order as to this shipment was based upon a violation of PAC regulation 7 C.F.R. 46.29(a), \u201cwhich requires the consignor\u2019s permission to sell consigned produce outside the consignee\u2019s market area.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This, then, presented to the trial court for determination the question whether Re\u00edan granted his permission for the sales that were made outside the Atlanta market.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">The trial court\u2019s findings of fact as to this shipment include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-13\">B. Upon receiving that shipment, several employees of Georgia Vegetable noted some decay in the peppers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-14\">C. Robert Grice, the president of Georgia Vegetable then called Re\u00edan and rejected the shipment as being non-conforming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-15\">D. Re\u00edan then requested Georgia Vegetable <em>to salvage as much of the pepper as they could to sell it at the best price available. </em>Georgia Vegetable then asked if Re\u00edan wanted a federal inspection but Relan\u2019s response was not to do so as that would only cost them additional money, (emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">The only question here is whether the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding that Re\u00edan requested Georgia Vegetable \u201cto salvage as much of the pepper as they could to sell it the best price available,\u201d (sic) because we consider such language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>would be an agreement by Re\u00edan to sell outside the Atlanta market.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The record amply supports this finding. In the cross-examination of Re\u00edan, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">Q. I said isn\u2019t it true on this load 1, all Georgia Vegetable was supposed to do was to get the best price available that he could for the pepper, and then account to you for what that price that he received was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">A. Account to me for what it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXzB\">Q. Yes, sir, is that a true statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT2-\">A. Yes, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Testimony by Robert Grice of Georgia Vegetable was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">... A. I said \u201cCharlie, I know that you sent this load of pepper on consignment but I just wanted to report to you that there might be a little problem in it, but we\u2019re going ahead and try to ship it on out, because we have got orders and trucks here waiting on it.\u201d And I said \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with it\u201d and he said \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJXK\">There being no indication in the testimony of either of the parties that any limitations were to be imposed upon the area in which the peppers were to be sold, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of fact is adequately supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Shipment No. 2: The Secretary\u2019s order as to this shipment was based upon his finding that \u201cthere is no proof that the peppers inspected were from the lot shipped by complainant on June 30.\u201d The absence of such proof was rectified at the trial in the district court. There was ample evidence that the inspection report with respect to the 300 cartons showed that they were a part of Shipment No. 2. Although no specific finding was made by the trial court to this effect, it must be implied from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Shipment No. 3: The Secretary\u2019s finding as to this shipment was based on his assumption that the original sales contract between Re\u00edan and Georgia Vegetable was the contract claimed upon. In fact, however, the trial court determined that when Georgia Vegetable received a report from Castellini, the consignee of the shipment, that it contained some bad peppers Georgia Vegetable asked Re\u00edan to negotiate directly with Castellini with respect to the shipment, and Re\u00edan agreed to do so. In effect, the trial court\u2019s decision left open the issue as to whether Castellini should have obtained a government inspection before rejecting the shipment, because no claim by Re\u00edan against Castellini was before the court. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that a novation was made between Re\u00edan and Castellini.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In addition, however, Re\u00edan complains that he was importuned by Georgia Vegetable to deal with Castellini only by the making of a false (albeit in good faith) statement to Re\u00edan. The false statement relied upon by Re\u00edan is the fact that Castel-lini had had a federal inspection before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>rejecting the shipment. A careful reading of the transcript shows, however, that Georgia Vegetable did not state to Re\u00edan that there had been a federal inspection. Rather, the most that was proved was that Grice told Re\u00edan that Castellini had told him (Grice) that there had been a federal inspection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In addition to the findings of fact which we find warranted the district court\u2019s judgment, the court made the following two findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">4. The parties have developed a pattern and course of dealing between themselves over a period of many years and the court concludes that these transactions involved in this case were handled in the same or a similar manner to that which they have been using in the past and the defendant is estopped from complaining about any violations of the regulations of the Perishable Agriculture Commodities Act because of that course of dealing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">5. The actions of the parties were in accordance with the established trade customs in the industry as to the handling of all three of the loads and the defendant is estopped to complain about the procedures followed in the handling of these loads of peppers because they do conform to trade custom existing in the industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The court treated these findings as es-topping the shipper from relying on the regulations. Re\u00edan complains that as to number 4, no estoppel was shown, because there is no proof that there was any act or declaration of Re\u00edan to support a finding of intended deception, which he says is necessary before an equitable estoppel can arise, citing <em>Cobb Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. American Mfrs. Mutual Insurance Co., </em>459 F.Supp. 328 (N.D.Ga.1978), <em>affd </em>624 F.2d 722 (5th Cir.1980). He also argues that no course of dealing between the parties can be permitted to prevent a shipper like Re-Ian from relying on the mandates of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Re\u00edan makes the same argument with respect to finding no. 5, dealing with \u201ctrade customs,\u201d or \u201ccustoms in the industry.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">As stated above, since these findings were unnecessary to support the judgment below, we do not reach these issues. However, since appellant\u2019s brief here largely dwells on these arguments, it is not inappropriate to express our grave doubt about the proposition that a usage of the trade could eliminate the effectiveness of the prohibitions of the statute and regulations, which were enacted for the very purpose of preventing the kind of disputes that arose between these parties. <em>Chidsey v. Guerin, </em>443 F.2d 584 (6th Cir.1971); <em>George Arake-lian Farms, Inc., </em>536 F.2d 856 (8th Cir. 1976). Since a usage of the trade becomes an implied term of any contract in the particular trade, whether known to a shipper or not, recognition of such a usage to deny the rights to a new shipper would be tantamount to a <em>pro tanto </em>repeal of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-5\">. Two of these regulations are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">7 C.F.R. 46.22 <em>Accounting for Dumped Produce </em>...

Grice testified that he received a call from the Castellini Company and then testified as follows: \"And he said, \u2018Robert this pepper is real bad\u2019 and he said 'this is what the inspection reads\u2019 and it amounted up to approximately 47 percent bad pepper, and he said, 'there ain\u2019t no way that the Castellini Company can accept this load of pepper like this.\u2019 So, in turn, I called Mr. Charlie down there, and I told him that is what Mr. Carl Klein had told me, and I said, 'Charlie, I\u2019m going to have to give the pepper back to you, because I don\u2019t know where else to go with it and this won't suit my customer.' and Charlie said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know what else I would do with it,\u2019 he said, 'Do you reckon the Castellini Company would handle this load of pepper for my account?\u2019 I said, \u2019Well, Charlie, you can call Mr. Carl Klein and see\u2019, and I said, \u2018Wait five or ten minutes before you call him and I\u2019ll call him and tell him that you are good people out there and maybe he\u2019ll keep the load of pepper and help you with it.\u2019 So, in turn, I called Carl back and told him that Mr. Re\u00edan would like for him to handle that load of pepper for them if he would, and I said, \u2018Mr. Re\u00edan is going to call you just in a few minutes.\u2019 So, Charlie did call him and then in, I guess, I don't know, it might have been 15 or 20 minutes, Charlie did call me back, and he said, \u2018Robert, I\u2019ve got Mr. Carl to handle that load of pepper for us,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I appreciate you helping me with it,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m sorry we had problems, but I\u2019m glad that you got them to keep it,\u2019 \u201d and so that was the conversation on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\">.
