Williams appeals from an order granting plaintiff GTE Corporation\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The principal issue on appeal is the relevance of delay in seeking relief from trademark infringement as a factor in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AsE\">In December 1982 GTE brought suit seeking damages and injunctive relief against Williams for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127, and for common law trademark infringement under pendent jurisdiction. GTE claimed that Williams had infringed its rights in the trademark \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d by using that name to market mobile telephone equipment and services in the Wasatch Front area of Utah. A little over a month later GTE moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"AyRo\">The hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction took place in March 1983. In memoranda filed before the hearing both parties acknowledged that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish: (1) that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the preliminary injunction is not granted; (3) that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction will not be adverse to the public interest. <em>Lundgrin v. Claytor, </em>619 F.2d 61, 63 (10th Cir.1980). After the hearing and after reviewing the memoranda and documents filed in the case, the trial court granted GTE\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"AQOP\">From 1935 to 1959 \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d was the name of the corporation that is now GTE Corporation. It then became \u201cGeneral Telephone and Electronics Corporation,\u201d and in 1982 it became \u201cGTE Corporation.\u201d Most of GTE\u2019s regional subsidiaries have names that begin with the words \u201cGeneral Telephone Company of.\u201d The corporation applied for a federal registration for the trademark \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d in 1981 and received it in 1982. GTE, through subsidiaries, provides mobile telephone equipment and services, but does not provide such equipment and services in Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"aro-dedup-0\">Williams has been in the mobile telephone business since 1954 and has been using the name \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d since approximately 1974. Williams uses \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d only for marketing; for other purposes he uses the name \u201cIndustrial Communications.\u201d Because Williams claimed his lack of knowledge would prevent GTE from succeeding on the merits, both parties agreed to focus on whether Williams had knowledge of GTE\u2019s use of the mark \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d when he began doing business under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"auf-dedup-0\">The court found that the name \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d was well known nationally in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It found that Williams knew of a company using the name \u201cGeneral Telephone and Electronics\u201d before he began using the name \u201cGeneral Telephone,\u201d but made no finding on Williams\u2019 denial of knowledge of GTE\u2019s use of \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d as a name and trademark. The trial court also found that GTE had known about Williams\u2019 use of the mark \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d since 1979. As conclusions of law, the trial court set out the four factors necessary to support a preliminary injunction. It found that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d GTE would succeed on the merits. The court concluded that GTE would suffer irreparable harm if it did not order the preliminary injunction but did not explain the basis for its conclusion. Subsequently, upon consideration of Williams\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal, the court expressed doubt about the adequacy of the record to support a preliminary injunction and, therefore, granted the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">On appeal Williams contends that the trial court did not properly consider whether denial of a preliminary injunction would irreparably harm GTE and whether the balance of hardships tipped in GTE\u2019s favor. Specifically, Williams contends that the trial court did not accord appropriate weight to GTE\u2019s delay in bringing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy; it is the exception rather than the rule. <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>695 F.2d 536, 539 (11th Cir.1983). In determining whether a preliminary injunction is warranted, a court must be guided by normal equitable principles and must weigh the practicalities of the situation. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Theodore Hamm Brewing Co., </em>314 F.Supp. 697, 699-700 (D.Conn.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The key to proving trademark infringement is showing a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the product or service. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. GTE suggests that the trial court\u2019s finding of a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that GTE would succeed on the merits diminishes the importance of a showing of irreparable injury. The likelihood of success, though, is only one factor to be considered on a motion for a preliminary injunction. Irreparable injury is equally important. <em>American Radio Association v. Mobile Steamship Association, </em>483 F.2d 1, 4 (5th Cir.1973). The apparent weakness of Williams\u2019 case does not obviate GTE\u2019s burden of showing irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Some cases suggest that a preliminary showing of likelihood of confusion alone is a sufficient showing of irreparable injury to support a preliminary injunction. <em>Paco Rabanne Parfums v. Norco Enterprises, Inc., </em>680 F.2d 891, 894 (2d Cir.1982) (likelihood of damage to good will and reputation caused by confusing similarity entitles a plaintiff to a preliminary injunction); <em>P. Daussa Corp. v. Sutton Cosmetics (P.R.) Inc., </em>462 F.2d 134, 136 (2d Cir.1972) (confusing similarity is itself sufficient injury to support a preliminary injunction); <em>Wesley-Jessen Division of Schering Corp. v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., </em>698 F.2d 862, 867 (7th Cir.1983) (a trademark owneris inability to control the quality of the infringing party\u2019s product is irreparable injury). Presumably the trial court was relying on such cases when it stated at the beginning of the hearing that it did not think the showing of irreparable harm had to be great in a trademark case. However, we do not read those cases as saying that irreparable harm is an insignificant factor in considering motions for preliminary injunctions in trademark cases; rather, they stand for the proposition that infringement alone can constitute irreparable injury and that the movant is not required to show that it lost sales or incurred other damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Delay in seeking relief, however, undercuts any presumption that infringement alone has caused irreparable harm <em>pendente lite; </em>therefore, such delay may justify denial of a preliminary injunction for trademark infringement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">\u201cAlthough plaintiff contends that it will be irreparably harmed should defendants\u2019 activities not be enjoined, it has waited nearly a year before seeking any relief. Delay of this nature undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary relief and suggests that there is, in fact, no irreparable injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-11\"><em>Le Sportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, Inc., </em>478 F.Supp. 602, 609 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (footnote omitted). <em>See also Exxon Corp. v. Xoil Energy Resources, Inc., </em>552 F.Supp. 1008, 1012 (S.D.N.Y.1981); <em>Programmed Tax Systems, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., </em>419 F.Supp. 1251, 1255 (S.D.N.Y.1976); J. Gilson, <em>Trademark Protection and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>Practice </em>\u00a7 8.07[1] (1984) (\u201cUndue delay in seeking [a preliminary injunction] once plaintiff has, or should have, knowledge of the infringement will probably result in its denial.\u201d); <em>cf. Ideal Industries v. Gardner Bender, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 1018, 1025 (7th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 924, 100 S.Ct. 3016, 65 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1980) (delay is a factor to be considered in assessing irreparable injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Williams had been using the name \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d for at least eight years before GTE brought suit. The trial court found that GTE had known about Williams\u2019 use of the mark since at least 1979, three years before GTE brought suit or notified Williams of its objection to his use of \u201cGeneral Telephone.\u201d This indicates GTE officials felt no sense of urgency. The confusion or potential confusion has existed for a decade. Any injury that GTE would suffer before trial on the merits would be a relatively short extension of the injury that GTE knowingly suffered for three years before it filed suit. Most of the advantage from Williams\u2019 use of the name \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d has already accrued to him, and control of the quality of the products and services sold under the name \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d in the Wasatch Front area of Utah has long been in Williams\u2019 hands. The harm to GTE and the public \u201ccannot be materially aggravated or extended in the interim.\u201d <em>Ward Baking Co. v. Oak Park Baking Co., </em>278 F. 627, 628 (D.Del.1922). Thus, GTE\u2019s delay in bringing suit diminishes the significance, for purposes of a preliminary injunction, of a showing of confusing similarity. GTE does not sell mobile telephone equipment and services in the Salt Lake City area. GTE has suggested no lost sales or other damage to reputation likely to occur <em>pendente lite. </em>We must conclude, therefore, that the harm to GTE from denial of a preliminary injunction would be inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Also, a preliminary injunction would impose substantial hardship upon Williams. If Williams must change his trade name now, it is probably unrealistic to expect he would change the name back to \u201cGeneral Telephone\u201d again if he won on the merits. The burden on the party seeking a preliminary injunction is especially heavy when the relief sought would in effect grant plaintiff a substantial part of the relief it would obtain after a trial on the merits. <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Theodore Hamm Brewing Co., </em>314 F.Supp. 697, 699 (D.Conn.1970). <em>See </em>J. Gil-son, <em>Trademark Protection and Practice </em>\u00a7 807[1] (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">In holding that delay is an important consideration in the assessment of irreparable harm for purposes of a preliminary injunction, we do not consider whether the defense of laches would bar relief at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am4R\">\u201c[W]hile laches may not be sufficient to bar a permanent injunction it may well be a bar to preliminary relief. A preliminary injunction is sought upon the theory that there is an urgent need for speedy action to protect the plaintiff\u2019s rights. By sleeping on its rights a plaintiff demonstrates the lack of need for speedy action and cannot complain of the delay involved pending any final relief to which it may be entitled after a trial of all the issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-9\"><em>Gillette Co. v. Ed Pinaud, Inc., </em>178 F.Supp. 618, 622 (S.D.N.Y.1959). <em>See also </em>J. Gilson, <em>Trademark Protection and Practice </em>\u00a7 8.12[12][Z][iv] (1984). Also, although the term \u201claches\u201d is sometimes used simply to mean delay, the defense of laches is sometimes said to require detrimental reliance, an issue we do not have before us. <em>See Helene Curtis Industries v. Church &amp; Dwight Co., </em>560 F.2d 1325, 1334 (7th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1070, 98 S.Ct. 1252, 55 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">We hold that when movant shows no specific harm other than the harm that is presumed to exist when there is a likelihood of confusion, movant\u2019s delay in bringing suit is an important factor in determining irreparable harm. We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the burden of hardships weighed in GTE\u2019s favor and thus erred in granting a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>REVERSED and REMANDED with directions to deny the preliminary injunction <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
