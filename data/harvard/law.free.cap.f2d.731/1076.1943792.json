Poliak, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b1136-6\">BECKER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">I. <em>Preliminary Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVka\">This case arises under section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\u00ae (1976), which enables the National Labor Relations Board or its designated agent to seek interim injunctive relief from a federal district court pending the Board\u2019s own administrative adjudication of an unfair labor practice complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the jurisprudence has evolved, interim injunctive relief may be granted under section 10\u00ae without the showing of irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits, which are the ordinary requisites for a preliminary injunction. Instead, a federal district court must merely find \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe an unfair labor practice has occurred and must determine that the relief sought is \u201cjust and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">In this case, Regional Director Gerald Kobell, as agent for the Board, contended before the district court that interim relief was required under section 10\u00ae to thwart a joint venture by a failing bus line and the company that took over its operations to divest themselves unlawfully of a particular union as the bargaining representative of their drivers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a three-day hearing, the district court denied the section 10\u00ae injunction because it found no reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the NLRA had occurred and because it concluded that it was not just and proper to grant relief. The Director appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-13\">The appeal is complex and requires us to address difficult and important issues concerning the propriety of section 10\u00ae relief and the scope of appellate review over district court determinations in this field. It will therefore be helpful to sketch at the outset the manner in which the opinion will be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-14\">We begin in Part II with a review of the evidence adduced at a hearing before the district court to show an alleged plot by appellee Holland Industries and its \u201cShort-way\u201d subsidiary to refuse discriminatorily to hire unionized employees of the operation it was assuming and thereby to evade the obligation that otherwise might well have existed to bargain collectively with the union those employees had previously elected as their representative. We then proceed in Part III to analyze whether the district court committed reversible error in finding no reasonable cause to believe that the defendants had committed unfair labor practices. This analysis shall sequentially entail (A) a discussion of the meaning of \u201creasonable cause\u201d under section 10\u00ae, (B) an examination of the scope of our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>over district court determinations with respect to \u201creasonable cause,\u201d and (C) an application of that standard to the determination of the district court in this case. In this part we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision that no reasonable cause existed was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We then proceed in Part IV to a similar analysis of whether the district court also erred in denying relief on grounds that it was not \u201cjust and proper.\u201d Here too our analysis begins with a discussion of the concept \u201cjust and proper,\u201d including a discussion of the broad purposes of section 10(j). We next examine the scope of our review over district court determinations that a given form of relief is not just and proper, and end this part of the opinion by applying the selected standard of review to the determination of the district court in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the relief requested by the Regional Director was not just and proper under the particular circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">II. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">Since 1962, under operating authority granted by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\u201cPUC\u201d), appellee Suburban Lines has operated a charter bus service and a commuter bus service between Washington, Pennsylvania and-Pittsburgh. Since 1969, the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1543 (\u201cATU\u201d) has represented Suburban\u2019s 38 drivers and mechanics and has entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements with Suburban.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The most recent agreement, which expired December 31, 1982, provided for wages averaging $8.60 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">During 1981 and 1982, Suburban Lines did not fare well financially.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In April of 1982, J.C. Hilty, the president and general manager of Suburban (and owner of 77 of the 737 shares of its stock), answered a job advertisement in Bus Rider magazine placed by appellee Holland Industries. Holland is a New York and Toledo-based firm, which through several subsidiaries operates a number of bus lines throughout the nation. Many of these subsidiaries had collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of the Teamster\u2019s Union at wage rates then averaging less than five dollars per hour. The record does not disclose what response, if any, Holland gave to Hilty\u2019s submission. It is apparent from the record, however, that prior to July 15, 1982, Holland must have communicated at least something to some responsible official of Suburban. On that date, at a meeting presided over by Hilty, the Suburban board of directors discussed an offer by Holland to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>purchase Suburban. While the minutes of that meeting, which are a matter of record, do not disclose the board\u2019s opinion of the Holland offer, there was at least discussion of a counteroffer being made to Holland and an estimate made of the liquidation value of Suburban\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">On August 9, 1982, several significant events occurred. First, an attorney for Suburban, acting as incorporator, filed articles of incorporation for \u201cShort Way Suburban Lines, Inc.,\u201d a wholly owned subsidiary of Holland Industries. Second, the Suburban stockholders held a special meeting and voted to accept a plan of liquidation approved earlier that day by the Suburban board of directors. According to Francis Olczak, a union driver for Suburban and owner of 10 shares of its 737 shares of stock, Hilty stated at the shareholders\u2019 meeting that Shortway had agreed to hire him (Hilty) as manager but that Holland, the acquiring company, would not be hiring any of the Suburban drivers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">There was also evidence produced at the evidentiary hearing before the district court from which it might be inferred that, while all of this was happening at the shareholder and director level of Suburban, Hilty began an effort to persuade or coerce the Suburban drivers into accepting the Teamsters as their bargaining representatives. According to testimony and an affidavit of Suburban driver Paul Phillips, Hilty told him that the new company would deal only with Teamsters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, according to Olczak, Hilty told him on August 13 that Holland Industries \u201cwould deal only with the Teamsters Union,\u201d and that Holland would hire the Suburban drivers only if they would \u201cgo Teamsters.\u201d Olczak further testified that Hilty asked him to poll the other drivers to see if they would agree to changing their bargaining representative. Olczak testified that he complied with Hilty\u2019s request and that a week later he told Hilty that none of the other drivers would agree to switching their bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">Evidence was also adduced that Holland Industries then decided that none of its Shortway employees would come from Suburban.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the testimony of Karl Thomas Wegerbauer, president of Holland Industries and of Shortway, this decision, which was reached sometime in early September, not to hire Suburban employees was not caused by any lack of applications from Suburban drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">On September 8 the Suburban board of directors met again. The directors approved sale of the company to Shortway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>for approximately one million dollars, twice the liquidation value estimated at the earlier July 15 meeting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On September 14 the deal was finalized. Sale of the company, which was to take place on October 30, was contingent, however, on approval by the PUC of permanent transfer of Suburban\u2019s routes to Shortway. On September 15, the appropriate filings were made to the PUC in support of this transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">Between September 14 and October 30, Suburban and Shortway continued what the Regional Director regards as a clandestine and illegal venture to evade the obligations created by <em>NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc., </em>406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972) and <em>Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Joint Executive Board, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974). Those cases impose a duty upon an employer who takes over a unionized operation and who conducts essentially the same business there as its predecessor to bargain collectively with the representative elected by the workers of the predecessor, provided that those workers constitute a majority of the successor\u2019s workforce. The Regional Director argues, in essence, that by discriminatorily refusing to hire Suburban employees \u2014 a plan accomplished by lying to them about when applications were due and when jobs were available \u2014 Shortway sought to evade its obligations under <em>Burns </em>and <em>Howard Johnson </em>and to rid itself of the high-priced ATU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">In support of this theory, the Regional Director notes that Holland/Shortway began hiring admittedly less experienced drivers in Detroit to take over operation of Suburban\u2019s Pennsylvania routes. According to uncontroverted testimony of Louis Keplar, Hilty \u2014 who arguably knew that Holland had already decided not to hire any Suburban drivers, <em>see supra </em>at 1080\u2014 told Keplar in late September that the new company would be getting in touch with him and that \u201cthere was no reason to hound [Hilty] every day.\u201d Then, in early October, according to testimony from Suburban driver Phillips, Hilty told Phillips that the Suburban drivers would have jobs, though not for a month or so. According to testimony of Warren S. George, vice-president of the ATU, on October 15 Short-way attorney Sanford Pollack returned a telephone call and told George that, while Shortway was \u201cpresently training drivers in the Toledo/Detroit area for [the Pennsylvania] jobs,\u201d it would consider the Suburban drivers for subsequent openings. Pollack also sent George a letter dated October 19 containing job applications and stating, \u201cWe anticipate to begin operation with a complete staff and, therefore, see no urgent need in the return of the enclosed.\u201d What Pollack did not reveal was that Short-way had not yet completed its hiring for the Pennsylvania jobs; between October 15 and 25 Shortway hired five more drivers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In sum, the Regional Director would have liked the district court to have found an illegal attempt to lull ATU members into a false sense of security and then to lie to ATU members \u2014 or at least speak recklessly \u2014 about the availability of employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Meanwhile, the deal between Suburban and Shortway was running into difficulty. On October 29, following a hearing at which the ATU had lodged a protest against the proposed sale, the PUC directed Suburban not to abandon service pending the PUC\u2019s final decision on transferring operation of the bus routes to Shortway. Temporary authority for Shortway to operate the routes, which the PUC had granted on October 15, remained in force. Thus, at least until the PUC decided differently, Shortway could operate the routes. But until the PUC approved permanent transfer of the routes to Shortway, the September 14 agreement did not permit consummation of the sale of Suburban to Short-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Faced with the PUC obstacle, Shortway and Suburban executed a second deal on October 29. Under the new agreement, Suburban would lease its buses and equipment to Shortway in return for a fixed rental. The lease would last as long as Shortway had temporary authority to operate the Suburban routes. Shortway began operations the next day. It also recognized the Teamsters as the bargaining representative for its employees. The Teamsters and Shortway agreed that the Shortway drivers would operate under a collective bargaining agreement in effect with another Holland subsidiary. Wages under this collective bargaining agreement averaged $4.80 per hour, considerably less than that paid by predecessor Suburban to the drivers, who were affiliated with the ATU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">Between November 1, 1982, and January of 1983, a rather curious event occurred: Shortway fired or transferred back to Detroit 27 of the 31 drivers it had originally hired.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It has since hired four of the former Suburban employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">Formal legal proceedings challenging the propriety of the events described above began on November 9,1982, when the ATU filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB. After an investigation, the NLRB, acting through Regional Director Kobell, filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the defendants. The complaint, dated December 30, 1982, accused them of violating sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(2), 8(a)(3), 8(a)(4), and 8(a)(5) of the NLRA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(l)-(5). Three months later, on March 4, 1983, the Regional Director petitioned the district court for the Western District of Pennsylvania for interim injunctive relief under section 10(j).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>The Regional Director requested, among other items, that the district court order the bus companies to make reinstatement offers to the displaced Suburban drivers, that the bus companies be required to recognize the ATU as the bargaining representative of the employees driving the old Suburban routes, and that the collective bargaining agreement between Suburban and the ATU be reinstated as governing the terms and conditions of the current employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">The district court held three days of hearings on the complaint (April 18, 19 and 20) during which it heard testimony from fifteen witnesses called by the Director. The bus companies moved at the close of the Director\u2019s case for a directed verdict (or for the dismissal of the complaint). On April 20, 1983, the district court granted the bus companies\u2019 motion and dismissed the Regional Director\u2019s petition for interim injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Although the grounds upon which the district court dismissed the complaint will be taken up in detail below, they may be summarized as follows. First, while not specifically finding any of the testimony mentioned above to lack credibility or relevance, the district court nonetheless held that there was no reasonable cause to believe that an unfair labor practice had occurred. Although accepting arguendo (1) that the employees of the new company were less competent than the old Suburban employees; (2) \u201cthat the new owners of the bus line did not encourage the former employees to seek employment; \u201d and (3) that \u201cthe former employees may have been confused as to how to go about applying,\u201d the district court nonetheless stressed that Shortway had never actually refused to hire any Suburban applicant. The district court also suggested that the old Suburban employees would not have been willing to work at the Shortway wage rates anyway and further held that there was no showing that anti-union animus solely motivated Shortway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">As a further basis for denying interim injunctive relief, the district court held that the relief sought by the NLRB was not \u201cjust and proper.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the district court reasoned that a backpay award by the NLRB could fully remedy any discriminatory refusals to hire and that the ATU was a \u201csmall and intimate\u201d union that could reconstitute itself upon favorable action by the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">\u2022III. <em>Reasonable Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">To have prevailed in the district court, the Regional Director needed to show that the evidence described above gave reasonable cause to believe that an unfair labor practice had occurred. We turn to an exploration of the meaning of this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">A. <em>The Meaning of \u201cReasonable Cause\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">It is settled that the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard under section 10(j) bars the district court from behaving as if it had general jurisdiction over the nation\u2019s labor laws. The district court may not decide whether or not to issue relief based on its own belief as to whether an unfair labor practice has been committed. <em>See, e.g., Boire v. Inter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number><em>national Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, </em>479 F.2d 778, 792 (5th Cir.1973); <em>Schauf-fler v. Local 1291, </em>292 F.2d 182 (3d Cir. 1961) (10(7) case). The amount of evidence required by the \u201creasonable cause\u201d determination is less than that required to prove a violation. Yet, except to note that it is a \u201clow threshold of proof,\u201d <em>see Eisenberg v. Wellington Hall Nursing Home, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 902, 905-06 (3d Cir.1981), this circuit has not yet resolved the precise meaning of \u201creasonable cause\u201d in section 10(j) cases. We believe, however, that doctrine developed in cases brought under section 10(7) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(7), a companion provision directing the NLRB to seek interim injunctive relief when certain specified unfair labor practices are reasonably believed to have occurred, is helpful in ascertaining that meaning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">We see no reason why courts should accord \u201creasonable cause\u201d a different meaning in 10(j) cases than they do in 10(7) cases. In <em>Wellington Hall, </em>651 F.2d at 905, this court noted that in an earlier case, <em>Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>519 F.2d 138, 143 (3d Cir.1975), \u201cwe held that reasonable cause to believe a violation of the act has occurred, a standard for injunc-tive relief originally developed in cases arising under section 10(7) of the Act, is also applicable to section 10(j) proceedings.\u201d While this equation of the standard in section 10(j) cases with the standard in 10(7) cases does not, of course, mandate that all features of the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard must be the same, it is worth observing that there is nothing in those cases that suggests the appropriateness of any distinction. In a leading section 10(7) case, <em>Hirsch v. Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, </em>530 F.2d 298, 302 (3d Cir. 1976), the court held that the burden of proof faced by a regional director is \u201crelatively insubstantial.\u201d Moreover, the court held that the district court need not be satisfied with the \u201cvalidity of the legal theory upon which [the Regional Director] predicates his charges.\u201d So long as the legal theory presented by a regional director is \u201csubstantial and not frivolous,\u201d the district court may grant appropriate relief in a section 10(7) case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">Because of what we regard as the coincidence of the reasonable cause standard under section 10(7) of the NLRA and under section 10(j) of the Act, we believe that a district court need make one of two findings before denying relief. It must find there to be no legal theory implicit or explicit in the regional director\u2019s argument that is substantial and not frivolous. Alternatively, the district court must find insufficient evidence \u2014 at least taking the facts favorably to the Labor Board \u2014 to support any non-frivolous theory appropriate to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">B. <em>The Standard of Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">While the federal courts do not differ greatly on the precise meaning of \u201creasonable cause\u201d in section 10(j) or section 10(7) cases, they are split on the standard of review that the courts of appeals are supposed to apply when examining the refusal of a district court to find reasonable cause. The Eighth and Ninth Circuits have held appellate review over the reasonable cause determination, at least in section 10(7) cases, to be plenary. <em>See Wilson v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees Union, </em>491 F.2d 200, 203-04 (8th Cir.1974); <em>Local No. 83, Construction Building Materials &amp; Miscellaneous Drivers Union v. Jenkins, </em>308 F.2d 516, 517 n. 1 (9th Cir.1962) (dictum). These courts have reasoned that, because there is a \u201ccongressional policy favoring the grant of such injunctions in appropriate circumstances,\u201d review ought not be limited to the clearly erroneous standard as it is in cases granting relief. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>NLRB urges us to adopt their view.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">On the other hand, the Second Circuit, in a recent opinion by Judge Friendly, and the Fifth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Goldberg, have recognized that the district court\u2019s finding of \u201creasonable cause\u201d has both a factual and legal component. <em>See Kaynard v. Mego Corp., </em>633 F.2d 1026 (2d Cir.1980) (Friendly, J.) (10(j) case); <em>Boire v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers, </em>479 F.2d 778, 788 (5th Cir.1973) (10\u00a9 case). Accordingly, they have applied a bifurcated standard of review under which the factual findings of the district court about what happened and what is likely to happen are reviewable under the \u201cclearly erroneous standard\u201d as are all factual questions, whereas the substantiality of a regional director\u2019s legal theory tying the facts to a violation of the labor laws is deemed a legal issue, subject to plenary review. For the reasons outlined below, we reject the view of the Eighth and Ninth Circuits and adopt that of the Second and Fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">To begin with, the conclusion drawn by the Eighth and Ninth Circuits that appellate courts have plenary review over district court determinations that no reasonable cause exists does not necessarily follow from their assumption \u2014 which we do not, in any event, accept as necessarily true \u2014 that Congress favored injunctions in section 10\u00a9 cases. Whatever Congressional policy exists in favor of injunctions would appear to be satisfied by the district court\u2019s application of a low \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard to Labor Board requests for section 10\u00a9 relief. To leap from a general policy to a particular doctrine requires a mediating theory not yet presented by the Board. Moreover, we note our discomfiture at establishing an asymmetric standard of review \u2014 one which allows the district court great discretion in granting injunctive relief, but almost no discretion in denying it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We will want a very good reason to introduce such an abnormality into the law of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">Instead, we believe that in 10\u00a9 cases, as elsewhere, the scope of appellate review should be determined by the degree of trust we possess as a general matter in the district court\u2019s ability to make varying types of decisions correctly and the nature of the decisions made by the district court in the particular ease. As we have suggested above, the district court\u2019s reasonable cause determination really involves two separate determinations: is there a substantial legal theory explicit or implicit in the case that would support a finding that an unfair labor practice had occurred? If a substantial legal theory exists, do the facts satisfy the theory? The first of these questions, which requires characterization of the legal theory, is itself a \u201clegal\u201d issue; discerning the plausible penumbras of Labor Act provisions is a task that a three-judge appellate tribunal with responsibility to secure uniformity in the law is better equipped to perform than a trial court. The second of these questions, whether the facts as found satisfy the theory, is largely a factual one; a determination of the sufficiency and credibility of the evidence is a task that a trial court is better equipped to perform than an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>In sum, because of the dual nature of the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard, an appellate court\u2019s review must also be dichotomous. If it believes the district court erred in determining whether the legal theory implicit or explicit in the Labor Board\u2019s case was substantial or not, it must \u2014 absent other special factors \u2014 reverse the district court. But only if it believes the district court <em>clearly erred </em>in finding the facts and whether the facts satisfied the theory may the appellate court reverse.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">C. <em>Applying the Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"avv-dedup-0\">Having set forth the appropriate standard of review, we now apply it to the case at bar. The district court\u2019s bench opinion can be fairly read as resting its finding of no reasonable cause on three underlying conclusions. First, it noted that, because no Suburban employee had actually applied for a job with Shortway during the relevant time period, there had been no \u201crefusal to hire by the new employer [Shortway].\u201d Second, it found that any anti-union animus that did exist on the part of the bus lines was not the sole reason for their failure to hire, a requirement the court grounded on footnote 8 of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Joint Executive Board, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders International Union, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974). Third, it apparently concluded that, because of what it regarded as the Suburban employees\u2019 steadfast refusal to accept employment at the Shortway wage rates, any improper behavior by Shortway was not a but-for cause of the harm alleged. We consider these predicate conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">1. <em>No Actual Refusal to Hire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">Implicit in the first reason set forth above as justifying a no-reasonable-cause finding is a legal theory: absent an application by a potential employee and rejection of that application by .the employer, there can be no discrimination in regard to hire constituting an unfair labor practice. We believe the district court erred in adopting this legal theory and in rejecting the opposing legal theory of appellant as insubstantial. It seems clear that there <em>can </em>be \u201cdiscrimination in regard to hire\u201d constituting at least a violation of section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA even when the employer never formally rejects an individual application. <em>See Piasecki Aircraft Corp. v. NLRB, </em>280 F.2d 575, 583, 585, 590 (3d Cir.1960) (lack of response by unionized employees of predecessor employer to offer by successor employer to accept applications held not to cure successor\u2019s previous discriminatory refusal to hire, at least where previous unfair labor practice created perception of futility among union employees). Posting a sign, for example, that reads \u201cNo Blacks Need Apply\u201d or that reads \u201cNo Union Members Need Apply\u201d and that succeeds in its objectives is just as effective (and just as offending) a method of discrimination as a pointblank refusal to hire an individual black or union-affiliated applicant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>It is equally non-frivolous, we think, to argue that, as a matter of law, an employer violates section 8(a)(3) if, by intentionally or recklessly misstating the times that applications are due or by intentionally or recklessly misrepresenting that all the jobs previously offered have been filled, the employer effectively prevents members of a certain union from applying for jobs. Finally, though perhaps not as conventional as the above-mentioned legal theories, it is also non-frivolous to argue that, by discriminating in regard to its methods of notifying potential employees of job openings\u2014 notifying potential employees in Detroit, for example, of job openings in Pennsylvania, but not even making a phone call to the head of a union representing soon-to-be unemployed, admittedly competent Suburban drivers \u2014 an employer discriminates \u201cin regard to hire ... to discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Kallmann v. N.L.R.B., </em>640 F.2d 1094 (9th Cir.1981) (fact that only nine of forty former employees applied for job with successor employer does not preclude bargaining order against successor employer where absent discriminatory practices \u2014 including unusually placed and misleading job advertisements \u2014 majority of old workforce would have been hired); <em>Packing House &amp; Industrial Services v. NLRB, </em>590 F.2d 688, 695 (8th Cir.1978) (effort spent in obtaining less experienced workers from distant city without corresponding attempts to contact predecessor\u2019s employees held to be relevant evidence of discriminatory refusal to hire).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Accordingly, since the NLRB\u2019s legal theory was substantial and not frivolous, we believe the district court erred in denying section 10(j) relief to the NLRB on the basis that no Suburban employee had applied for employment with Shortway. Unless some other basis can be found for sustaining the judgment of the district court, the case must be remanded for decision under the legal theories we deem substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">2. <em>The Sole Motive Theory and the Howard Johnson Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4Aa\">The district court also erred in implicitly treating as frivolous the NLRB\u2019s claim that anti-union animus did not have to be the sole motive for discriminatory behavior in order for an unfair labor practice to be found. To begin with, the authority cited against the NLRB\u2019s proposition, footnote 8 in the <em>Howard Johnson </em>opinion, does not cover the ground contended for. What the Supreme Court said in this footnote was that \u201ca new owner could not refuse to hire the employees of his predecessor solely because they were union members or to avoid having to recognize the union.\u201d But a statement does not necessarily imply its converse; that is, the Supreme Court\u2019s proclamation does not necessarily imply that a new owner could refuse to hire the employees of his predecessor if it did not do so <em>solely </em>because they were union members or to avoid having to recognize the union. Accordingly, the district court erred in holding <em>Howard Johnson </em>to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">Moreover, there are significant indications that the converse of <em>Howard Johnson </em>is not a correct statement of the law. Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>preme Court cases from <em>Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945), to <em>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 2471, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983), establish that anti-union animus need not be the sole motivation behind a discriminatory practice \u2014 or at least a discriminatory discharge \u2014 in order to find a violation of section 8(a)(3). Thus, without deciding on the precise standard to be applied in mixed motive cases, it is clearly non-frivolous to maintain that anti-union animus need not be the sole motive for an employment decision in order for that decision to constitute an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">3. <em>No But-for Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">As noted above, the district court also rested its finding of no reasonable cause on the conclusion that, because of what it regarded as the Suburban employees\u2019 steadfast refusal to accept employment at the Shortway wage rates, any improper behavior by Shortway was not a but-for cause of the alleged harm. While we acknowledge that a finding of no but-for causation might render insubstantial any legal theory advanced by a regional director, the evidence needed to support such a finding was absent here. In support of its finding, the district court cited \u201cparticularly revealing\u201d testimony of Mr. Keplar, president of the ATU, that he would not work at the \u201cShortway rate.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">The testimony relied upon by the district court is an insufficient grounding for its decision. To begin with, Mr. Keplar\u2019s individual antipathy toward working at what turned out to be the Shortway wage should not be taken as disposing of the issue of whether <em>other </em>ATU employees would be willing to work at the reduced wage rate offered by Shortway. More importantly, the district court\u2019s analysis constitutes legal error, because it does not account for the effect of the alleged unfair labor practice in setting the wage rate that the Suburban drivers found unacceptable. If Shortway had not refused to hire the Suburban drivers, under the <em>Burns </em>doctrine the ATU might have been installed as the bargaining representative of the Shortway employees. The ATU might well have been able to extract a higher wage rate from Shortway than was pressed for by the Teamsters. Accordingly, it constituted legal error to rely on the fact that the Suburban drivers refused to accept the wage rate imposed after Shortway initially refused to hire them as proof that there was no but-for causation between the allegedly discriminatory initial refusal to hire and the ultimate inability of the Suburban drivers to regain their old positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-17\">To summarize our disposition of the appeal at this point, we have found that the reasons offered by the district court for not finding reasonable cause to believe an unfair labor practice had occurred were legally insufficient. However, several factors prevent this determination from resulting in our vacatur of the district court judgment. First, even under the legal theories we deem substantial here, the district court might find the evidence before it insufficient to demonstrate the applicability of those theories. Second, and very importantly, because the district court dismissed the case at the close of the Regional Director\u2019s evidence, the defendants have not had the opportunity to present evidence related to several affirmative defenses they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>intended to offer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Third, and also importantly, even if the district court erred in finding no reasonable cause to believe an unfair labor practice had occurred, its judgment could be sustained if it correctly found that no injunctive relief was just or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">IV. <em>Just and Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"AuXW\">A. <em>The Scope of Appellate Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AT_\">The parties stake out the following positions concerning the standard of appellate review over the district court\u2019s determination that the injunctive relief sought by the Regional Director was not \u201cjust and proper.\u201d The NLRB, which lost below, argues that our review should be plenary: we should reverse if we think the relief it requested was \u201cjust and proper.\u201d By contrast, the bus lines argue for a very narrow scope of review: we should reverse only if we determine that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">The positions of both the NLRB and of the bus lines have as an unstated premise the notion that the amorphous phrase \u201cjust and proper relief\u201d is one susceptible to definition. The Board\u2019s call for \u201cplenary review\u201d is, of course, a demand that we determine ourselves what relief is just and proper; the bus line\u2019s call for an abuse-of-discretion standard requires us to find some base point of justice and propriety from which to measure the district court\u2019s departure. Despite this implicit reliance, however, neither side has made much of an effort at attempting to define \u201cjust and proper\u201d relief, either by reference to substantive criteria or by suggesting processes the district court might undertake in its effort to achieve such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">The parties are not to be faulted, however, for this logical lacuna. As we shall now show, the circuit court jurisprudence has not been terribly helpful in giving content to the phrase \u201cjust and proper\u201d as a method of cabining the otherwise unfettered discretion of the district court to fashion labor law under section 10(j) wholly according to its own notions of fairness and efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">The cases cited by the Regional Director as supporting plenary review over the just and proper determination by the district court, <em>Brown v. Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>218 F.2d 542 (9th Cir.1954) and <em>Local 83, Construction Drivers Union v. Jenkins, </em>308 F.2d 516, 517 n. 1 (9th Cir.1962) are neither controlling in this circuit nor unambiguous in their holdings. It is hardly clear whether the <em>Brown </em>court, in reversing the district court\u2019s determination to deny 10(j) relief, held that an appellate court had plenary review over the district court\u2019s just and proper determination and found the district court to be in error, or whether the Ninth Circuit applied the abuse of discretion standard contended for by the employers in that case and found the denial of section 10(j) relief by the district court to be an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is also possible that, in the early days of section 10(j) law, the courts simply did not focus on whether a separate stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>dard of appellate review should exist over the just and proper determination. <em>Local 83 </em>is, if anything, less helpful to the NLRB.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While it is true that in dictum and in a footnote the Ninth Circuit said that it would not apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard when reviewing denials of section 10(0 relief, it appears that the Ninth Circuit was explicitly referring to the reasonable cause determination and not to the just and proper determination. <em>See supra </em>note 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">On the other hand, there are appellate cases that might be construed as creating an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard over the just and proper determination, and yet these cases are careful not to equate the range of permissible discretion in section 10(j) cases, in which the district court is acting in some sense as a reviewing court, with that normally available to the district court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Eisenberg v. Wellington Nursing Home, </em>651 F.2d 902 (3d Cir.1981). As one member of this panel has sagely recognized, \u201c[kjnowing simply that one is invested with discretion does not tell much. The crucial inquiry, necessarily, is the extent of the discretionary power conferred.\u201d R. Aldisert, <em>The Judicial Process </em>742 (1976). In <em>Wellington Hall Nursing Home, </em>Judge Gibbons, writing for this Court stated that it was \u201can abuse of <em>the discretion that section 10(j) affords\" </em>for the district court to deny a reinstatement remedy. 651 F.2d at 907. Presumably because the district court\u2019s error was sufficiently egregious to make resolution of the issue unnecessary, that panel did not decide just how much discretion section 10(j) afforded the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">We do not believe we could pretend to legitimacy, or, concomitantly, that there would be much to be gained were we to attempt to give concrete character to the phrase \u201cjust and proper\u201d by a process of reasoned elaboration relying on dictionary definition or other tools of literalism. Rather, as in <em>Hecht v. Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944), this is an instance where courts do better not so much to focus upon the particular words of the governing statute, but upon the general communication the law-making bodies were attempting to send to the courts and the public in passing the relevant act. The process to be undertaken, be it on the district or appellate levels, is much like determining the meaning of an unknown (and even unknowable) phrase from context and on the basis of shared understandings. <em>See generally </em>R. Dickerson, <em>The Interpretation and Application of Statutes </em>103-36 (1975). This process is not determinate enough to allow an appellate tribunal to reverse a district court merely because, as a matter of first impression, it would have found differently. It does allow the appellate court, however, at least to ensure that the district court is speaking the same language as those passing the statute. The appellate court can and should ensure that, in the words of <em>Hecht v. Bowles, </em>the district court has focused upon \u201cthe large objectives of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">We now sketch out the primary understanding that should animate the district court in the exercise of its discretion over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>just and proper relief in section 10(j) cases. The district court should cognize that section 10(j) was designed to enable the Labor Board to vindicate its ultimate remedial power by affording limited interim relief in instances where the passage of time reasonably necessary to adjudicate the case on its merits convinced both the Board and the federal courts that the failure to grant such relief might dissipate the effective exercise of such power.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> By the same token, the relief to be granted is only that reasonably necessary to preserve the ultimate remedial power of the Board and is not to be a substitute for the exercise of that power.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">In order to ensure meaningful appellate review over exercises of discretion guided by the above principles, the district court in making its judgment regarding the justice and propriety of 10(j) interim relief should substantially relate its understanding of this broad principle of section 10(j) law to the result it reaches in the particular ease. The discussion need not be- elaborate nor should appellate tribunals insist on formalistic incantation of the principles we sketch out today. Rather, in reaching its conclusion, the district court should discuss and determine whether the failure to grant interim injunctive relief would be likely to prevent the Board, acting with reasonable expedition,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> from effectively exercising its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>ult\u00edmate remedial powers. The reviewing court, in applying the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard set out in <em>Wellington Nursing Home, </em>should not disturb factual findings made for this purpose unless clearly erroneous. And it should not reverse the decision of the district court reached thereby (i.e., whether interim injunctive relief appears warranted) unless the undisturbed factual findings do not substantially relate to the conclusion reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">B. <em>Applying the Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"aps-dedup-1\">Although not as precise on the subject it would have been if it had had the benefit of our opinion, the district court in this case has essentially satisfied our concerns. It obviously understood the importance of preserving the ultimate remedial powers of the NLRB as well as the importance of not allowing section 10(j) to become the normal method for resolving labor disputes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The only close question is whether there is a substantial relationship between the facts found and the conclusion reached. For the reasons that follow, we are satisfied on this point as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">1. <em>Reinstatement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">At two points in its bench opinion, the district court offered justifications for its decision not to compel respondents to make offers of reinstatement to the former Suburban employees. At one point, the district court found that, because a final NLRB adjudication (enforced by the court of appeals) would permit reinstatement and appropriate back pay awards to the injured Suburban employees, <em>see Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941), its own failure to grant interim reinstatement relief could not produce irreparable injury. The court further expressed worry that erroneously granted interim relief would irreparably injure those originally hired by Shortway, and Shortway itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>If this first justification offered by the district court for its refusal to grant interim reinstatement relief stood completely alone, we would be obliged to reverse under any standard of review. However compelling may be the arguments of the district court for denying reinstatement relief, and however often courts in other jurisdictions may have accepted them, <em>see, e.g., Mack v. Air Express International, </em>471 F.Supp. 1119, 1125 (N.D.Ga.1979);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Crain v. Fabsteel Co., </em>427 F.Supp. 316, 318 (W.D. La.1977),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> after the <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>decision, they are contrary to the settled law of this circuit. As a panel of this Court explained in <em>Wellington, </em>an exclusive or even predominant focus on the relief to be granted to individual employees is incorrect because it ignores the harm to the bargaining process that may accompany delayed relief. 651 F.2d at 906-07. The basic theory is that denial of interim reinstatement effectively denies employees the fruits of the collective bargaining process that otherwise would have been available to them prior to ultimate reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Later in its opinion, however, the district court offers a second justification for denying interim reinstatement. This justification appears to take account of the potential for harm to the collective bargaining process that might otherwise accompany delayed reinstatement of union-supporting employees. The district court wrote, \u201cGiven the size and intimacy of A.T.U. Local 1543, we have no reason to think that it could not swiftly and effectively reconstruct itself should the Board uphold its charge.\u201d In effect, the district court carved out a \u201csmall and intimate\u201d exception to the <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>doctrine. Since no one can seriously contend that the district court clearly erred in its finding that the union local was small and intimate, the only question left for us is whether it was within the permissible discretion of the district court to carve out such an exception from the <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>rule, that is, whether this finding substantially related to the conclusion that interim relief was not needed in the case to vindicate the ultimate remedial power of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">The Regional Director argues forcefully that we should not acquiesce in the district court\u2019s theory concerning interim reinstatement relief. It notes that given high unemployment, particularly in Western Pennsylvania, \u201cmany of the idled Suburban employees, faced with the need to secure employment, will decide to \u2018vote with their feet\u2019 and find jobs in other areas, which jobs they may be reluctant to given up in order to return to work for Suburban or Shortway.\u201d (Pet.Br. at 39-40). \u201cAs a result,\u201d the argument continues, \u201cwhen the Board finally orders reinstatement and bargaining with the Union \u2018the base of Union support would be scattered to the four winds\u2019 and any bargaining would be on a radically different footing than that [which would be conducted were interim reinstatement ordered].\u201d (Pet.Br. at 40, quoting <em>Wilson v. Liberty Homes, Inc., </em>108 LRRM at 2708).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>The problem with the Regional Director\u2019s argument is that it lacks support in the record. There was no expert testimony or documentary evidence put forth \u2014 or at least none cited to us \u2014 showing the proclivity of employees to scatter to the four winds.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">While we would be more comfortable with the district court\u2019s conclusion if it had more empirical evidence to support its thesis that a small and intimate union would be.better able than the average union to reform itself after the NLRB ultimately awarded reinstatement, in the absence of contrary evidence and given the seeming reasonableness of the conclusion and the district court\u2019s superior vantage point, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s predictive factual finding was clearly erroneous or that it was not a substantial basis for its conclusion. Nor can we say that the district court abused its discretion in finding these factors sufficient to rebut the presumption created by <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>that ultimate reinstatement is unlikely adequately to vindicate the remedial powers of the Board. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying section 10(j) relief.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">2. <em>Other Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Our holding that the district court was within its discretion in denying interim reinstatement to the employees of Suburban disposes of several other contentions raised by the Board. Where the district court legitimately refuses to order the successor company to hire the employees of its predecessor, it makes absolutely no sense to order the successor to bargain with the representative of the unhired employees of the predecessor.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It makes even less sense under such circumstances to impose the terms of the contract between Suburban and the ATU on the current employer (Shortway) and the bargaining representative of its employees, the Teamsters. Finally, given that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying interim relief against the successor company, Short-way, we have no occasion here to decide whether, if Shortway was liable, Suburban would be liable on grounds that it engaged in a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with Shortway. <em>Cf. Alkire v. NLRB, 716 </em>F.2d 1014 (4th Cir. 1983) (analyzing similar issue on an alter ego theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">This case is a difficult and close one. Restricting our attention solely to the record before us and not supplementing our views with the record that has subsequently been developed in administrative proceedings, we believe the district court erred in failing to find reasonable cause to believe that an unfair labor practice had been committed. However, we cannot say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>the district court impermissibly erred, in the absence of any contrary factual showing, in holding that, because this small and intimate union could easily reconstitute itself upon a grant of relief by the NLRB, interim reinstatement relief under section 10\u00ae of the NLRA was not just and proper. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-11\">The Board shall have power, upon issuance of a complaint as provided in subsection (b) of this section charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice to petition any United States district court, within any district wherein the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or wherein such person resides or transacts business, for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order. Upon the filing of any such petition the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction to grant to the Board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1136-16\">. This action is apparently part of a trend. According to one scholarly work, which was based on interviews with leading officials of the NLRB, a spate of 10(j) cases have arisen in which \"employers suffering business declines at plants with expensive union contracts have tried during the contract period to subcontract unit work, shut down a department, or move.\" <em>See </em>C. Helm, The Practicality of Increasing the Use of NLRA Section 10(j) Injunctions 85-86 &amp; nn. 255-56 (April 15, 1983) (unpublished manuscript on file at Harvard Law School Library).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">. The facts presented herein are taken from the testimony before the district court. As set forth below, appellees did not have an opportunity to call witnesses on their own behalf but did have the opportunity to cross examine witnesses called by the appellant. Since the time of the hearing before the district court, there has also been an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge of the NLRB. The facts revealed at that hearing differ in significant respects from those before the district court. While we note these divergences where appropriate, our formal review of the evidence is confined <em>to </em>that presented to the district court. Judge Aldisert notes in his concurrence that, in our narration of the facts of this case, we have gone beyond the findings of fact explicitly made by the district court and have relied on the testimony and evidence that was of record before the district court. While the traditions of appellate opinion writing would alone justify this practice (provided, of course, we distinguished between findings of fact and evidence before the court), there are special reasons that it has been necessary to supplement our narrative in this fashion. As Judge Aldisert correctly observes, we hold in this opinion that the district court erroneously rejected legal theories proffered by the Regional Director. As we shall note, however, <em>see infra </em>at 1084, this error by the district court is not prejudicial unless there were facts in evidence before the district court that made the wrongly rejected legal theories appropriate to the case at bar. Accordingly, we have attempted to present the facts in evidence before the district court that demonstrate the relevance of the wrongly rejected legal theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1137-14\">. The financial reports of its accountants show, for example, that in the first quarter of 1982 Suburban suffered a net operating loss of $16,-158, or about 3% of the then estimated stockholder\u2019s equity of $552,365. The first quarter of the previous year had been even worse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">. The bus lines objected to the admissibility of this testimony as hearsay.

There is testimony, however, that would support an inference that he did not make such remarks. Hilty testified, for example, that Shortway did not offer him a position until September 14 and that he did not formally learn until that date that the employees of Suburban would not have jobs with Shortway. There is also testimony that would support Olczak\u2019s recollection, though. Hilty testified that at sometime between May and November, a Suburban driver (Don Smith) told him that there was a rumor that Shortway would bring in the Teamsters. Further, there is the following colloquy on cross examination, which might suggest that Hilty knew of Suburban\u2019s plans before September 14 and that he disclosed these plans to the drivers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azm-dedup-1\">Q.

The report of the administrative law judge, which dismissed the Regional Director\u2019s complaint, does not contain any mention of this ongoing hiring. On the contrary, after examining the evidence before him, the administrative law judge found no indication \"that anyone was attempting to conceal from the Suburban employees that Respondent Shortway was accepting applications. The employees of Respondent Suburban knew as early as July that there was a possibility that Respondent Suburban was to be sold and that the purchaser might be Shortway or Holland Industries.\u201d <em>Suburban Lines, </em>Case 6-CA-15917, slip op. at 15 (December 22, 1983).

It is, of course, quite possible that the misstatement by Mr. Pollack was not the result of deceit or reckless misstatement either on his part or on the part of the bus lines.

We have never been informed precisely why this firing of the Shortway workers is relevant to the 10(j) petition. We presume, however, that the NLRB adduces this evidence to buttress its contention that Shortway's hiring of non-Suburban employees could not be justified by legitimate business purposes. If we are to believe the NLRB\u2019s characterization of Shortway as an essentially evil actor plotting to subvert the labor laws, we might also infer from the evidence adduced that Shortway fired or transferred the inexperienced employees it had initially hired as soon as it was confident that one of two conditions applied: either enough former employees of Suburban would have found work elsewhere so that it no longer had to discriminate and keep incompetent employees in order to prevent application of the <em>Burns </em>doctrine, or enough time had elapsed since the purchase of Suburban that even if a majority of its workforce consisted of Suburban employees, the <em>Burns </em>successorship doctrine would no longer apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1140-10\">. Despite the purported importance of relief in this case, the NLRB has not made rapid progress in processing the complaint toward a final administrative adjudication. It delayed three months before bringing this action. Hearings were not held before the administrative law judge until May and June, 1983, approximately six months after the Regional Director filed his administrative complaint. The delay between the filing of the administrative complaint and the hearing is apparently average for the NLRB, <em>see </em>Weiler, <em>Promises to Keep: Securing Workers' Rights to Self-Organization Under the NLRA, </em>96 Harv.L.Rev. 1769, 1799-1801 (1983); C. Helm, The Practicality of Increasing the Use of NLRA Section 10(j) Injunctions 6-7, 26-34 (April 15, 1983) (unpublished manuscript on file at Harvard Law School Library), and suggests the inaccuracy of counsel\u2019s representations that the case was being handled on an expedited basis. It was not until August 26, 1983, approximately eight months after the complaint was filed, that briefs went before the administrative law judge. On December 22, 1983, almost a year after the filing of this important case supposedly demanding immediate relief, the NLRB\u2019s administrative law judge, in a careful, 22-pagc opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>found no merit to the Regional Director\u2019s complaint and dismissed it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"AVFX\">In spite of the adverse holding by the administrative law judge, the Regional Director has not withdrawn his appeal. And despite the purported importance of immediate relief, the Regional Director has requested an extension of over one month to file exceptions to the decision of the administrative law judge. Counsel for the respondents has suggested that \"this requested extension represents an unconscionable delay in light of Petitioner-Appellant\u2019s continued efforts to secure Section 10(j) injunctive relief.\u201d In view of our disposition of the merits of this <em>cast, </em>we need not evaluate this contention. We do note, however, that if the Board proceeds at its customary glacial pace \u2014 and given a backlog of some 1,500 cases, the unsatisfactory responses of Board counsel on this point, and the past performance of the Regional Director, it is hard to expect otherwise \u2014 it will not be until at least early May of 1984, <em>see </em>Weiler, <em>supra, </em>some fifteen months after the administrative complaint was filed, that the NLRB may possibly grant relief in this case, which supposedly demands immediate relief from the courts on an attenuated (\"reasonable cause to believe\u201d) standard of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">. The major distinction between \u00a7 10(7) and \u00a7 10(j) is that for the unfair labor practices listed in 10(7) the NLRB <em>must </em>seek interim injunctive relief from the district court, while section 10(j) gives the NLRB discretion whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>or not to seek interim injunctive relief for unfair labor practices not listed in section <em>10(1).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">. In support of this view, the Regional Director apparently argues that, because the Third Circuit equated the scope of appellate review in section 10(j) cases with the scope of appellate review in section 10(1) cases, and because the scope of appellate review in section 10(/) cases where an injunction has been denied is plenary, that we should grant plenary review in section 10Q) cases. If this is in fact his argument, he is wrong. First, the characterization of <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>is inaccurate. We held there only that the <em>district court\u2019s </em>reasonable cause standard in section 10(j) cases should be the same as the <em>district court's </em>reasonable cause standard in section 10(1) cases. More to the point, even if the scope of review in section 10(/) cases and section 10(j) cases is the same, there is a split in the circuits as to what that review should be, and this circuit has never held that the scope of review in 10(/) cases is plenary. Thus, the second premise underlying the argument is either false or irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">. As a practical matter, such an asymmetry might well reduce the real burden on the NLRB in 10(j) cases to something lower than even \"reasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">. Application of the suggested dual standard is fully consistent with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Wellington Nursing Home, </em>for in that case, there was no legal issue of substance in question. The opinion of the court shows the case to involve a simple discriminatory discharge. The only issue of importance to the reasonable cause finding was whether the Board\u2019s circumstantial evidence of intent sufficed. The panel, applying a clearly erroneous standard, held that it did. 651 F.2d 902 (3d Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">. The concurrence of Judge Aldisert argues that our holding on this score implies that a successor company has some duty to hire employees of its predecessor. Otherwise, the concurrence asserts, we could not ignore the district court's finding (which was not clearly erroneous) that no employee of Suburban applied to Shortway. We do not believe the implication suggested by Judge Aldisert necessarily follows either from our opinion or from our acquiescence to the cited finding of the district court. There may indeed be no duty of a successor employer to hire the employees of its predecessor. As we have tried to make clear, however, this statement of law does not mean that the successor employer may take any affirmative or discriminatory steps to prevent employees of the predecessor corporation from applying for work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">. We believe that both these legal theories were adequately presented to the district court. In his oral argument opposing respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for injunctive relief, the NLRB attorney recounted what he regarded as the concealment of Suburban and Shortway and said that it would have been futile for Suburban employees to apply. Specifically, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-7\">We have cited numerous cases in our brief including the Love\u2019s Barbecue case and including the Foodway of El Paso case, where even though individuals who had not applied for employment, the board and courts have ordered that employer to reinstate the individuals because of the type of conduct that the employer engaged in in concealing or misleading the employees or the union as to how to secure employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdiV\">This presentation to the trial judge is more than adequate to preserve the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1145-13\">.

Because we find that the district court\u2019s denial of interim injunctive relief can be sustained simply by applying the principle of section 10(j) law we have just discussed, we have no need here to consider fully whether there is not another principle of section 10(j) law that could guide the district court\u2019s discretion in determining the justice and propriety of interim injunc-tive relief. An argument can be made, though, that the district court should cognize in addition that section 100) was reserved for the extraordinary case and that it was not intended to undermine the normal processes of labor law adjudication: administrative resolution by the NLRB followed, if necessary, by enforcement in the courts of appeals. Section 10(j) was largely a compromise measure designed to placate pro-union opponents of section 10(7), which limited the Norris-LaGuardia Act\u2019s prohibition on temporary injunctions. While section 10(2) directed the NLRB to seek temporary injunctive relief when labor unions committed various transgressions, section 10(j) at least authorized it to seek temporary injunctive relief when employers committed unfair labor practices. Support for the understanding that section 10(j) was intended to be reserved for extraordinary cases could also be drawn from the recent demise of the Labor Law Reform Act that would have forced Board officials to seek 10(j) injunctions in almost all discriminatory discharge cases. <em>See </em>H.R. 8410, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 10 (1977) (amending section 10(2)). <em>See also </em>C. Helm, <em>supra </em>note 2, at 1078 &amp; n. 8 (discussing proposed change).</p>\n<p id=\"avy-dedup-1\">The principle we have suggested may be implicit in section 10(j) appears to be similar to that which motivated the Eighth Circuit in <em>Minnesota v. Mfg. Corp. v. Meter, </em>385 F.2d 265 (8th Cir.1967), to require that the case be \"extraordinary\u201d before 10(j) relief would be granted. The focus we foresee, however, would not be on the egregiousness of the unfair labor practice \u2014 the reasonable cause standard would settle the issue of wrongdoing \u2014 but on the <em>unusual </em>likelihood (compared to other cases before the Board) of ultimate remedial failure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">. The district court need not, that is, accept delay in the NLRB adjudicative process as an immutable law of nature. If the district court has good reason to believe that interim injunc-tive relief would not be necessary were the Board to proceed at a rate consonant with effective use of its resources, it may deny interim injunctive relief even where the Board, by act<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>ing at its customary pace, prevents itself from effectively exercising the powers bestowed upon it by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"AOWU\">Moreover, as we intimated in the <em>Wellington Nursing Home </em>decision, <em>see </em>651 F.2d at 907 (citing <em>Boire v. Pilot Freight Carriers, </em>515 F.2d 1185, 1193 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 2646, 49 L.Ed.2d 385 (1976)), delay by the Board constitutes relevant (though not dispositive) evidence that interim injunctive relief is not truly necessary. The theory here, we stress, is not one of laches \u2014 that traditional basis for denying equitable relief applies only where there is prejudice to the opposing party\u2014 but rather that the district court may legitimately think it suspicious that the party who asks to preserve the status quo through interim injunctive relief has allowed the status quo to change through unexplained delay. We have commented on the Board\u2019s delay in this case, but, in view of our disposition on other grounds, need not consider this point further.</p>\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-1\">Judge Aldisert in his concurrence has argued forcefully that the Board is guilty of laches in this case. We question, however, whether the bus lines have made the necessary showing of prejudice <em>caused by the Board\u2019s delay. </em>The \u201cprejudice\u201d cited by the concurrence would seem to be inherent in any interim reinstatement order issued under section 10(j) whether or not the Board delayed. This \"prejudice,\u201d however, has already been rejected in this circuit as a basis for automatically denying section 10(j) relief. <em>See infra </em>typescript at 1094. We also question whether there was an adequate factual record presented in this case for the bus lines to satisfy their burden of proof, for purposes of laches, that the Board was guilty of unreasonable delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">. The key passage of the district court's opinion summarizing its belief reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asi-dedup-0\">Petitioner has earnestly argued that any relief eventually granted in the underlying case will be rendered meaningless by the passage of time. Petitioner further contends that the status quo as of October 29, 1982, must be restored. We are constrained to disagree. We are at a loss to understand why ultimate relief from the Board will be in any way meaningless. If the members of the charging party have obtained better jobs in the interim, they will, of course, be free to keep them, but we see no reason why back pay and reinstatement will not make them just as whole as any relief we could grant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-13\">Given the size and intimacy of A.T.U., Local 1543, we have no reason to think that it could not swiftly and effectively reconstruct itself should the Board uphold its charge. Today, April 20, 1982, we are nearly six months beyond the status quo the petitioner wishes us to \u201cmaintain\" by affirmative injunction. Given the highly effective remedies available from the Board should it find for the charging party, we could not deem it just and proper to order the sweeping relief requested by the petitioner, even were there sufficient facts to support this reasonable cause finding.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">.

The trial court had no doubt that the sale was \u201can arm\u2019s length transaction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1299, and it found \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that the sale \u201cwas a joint venture as charged by the Petitioner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1300. Holland utilized 10 of its existing employees for the Short Way operation and hired 20 employees from the Detroit area. In October, 1982, the hourly pay scale of the old Suburban employees was: drivers, $8.74; first-class mechanics, $9.11; regular mechanics, $8.90; fuelers and washers, $8.54; and an additional $.55 per hour was paid by the company into the pension fund. The wage scale of the drivers in the Teamsters local was about $4.80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>per hour. Significantly, the court found that \u201c[a]bout October 20, Warren George, international vice president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, received job applications for Local 1543 employees to apply to the new company.

But I agree with the majority that the district court properly determined that \u201ceven were reasonable cause present in this case, the injunctive relief sought would not be just and proper in any respect.\u201d App. at 1309. I address first general \u00a7 10(j) case law and the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">The seminal case of <em>Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>519 F.2d 138 (3d Cir. 1975), explains the distinction between federal court proceedings brought by the NLRB under \u00a7\u00a7 10(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 10\u00ae. <em>Hartz Mountain </em>emphasizes that \u201c[i]llegal organizational or jurisdictional strikes, secondary boycotts and hot cargo contracts are the specified wrongs that are the subject matter of Section 10(Z),\u201d and \u201c[i]n its nature any such conduct impinges directly upon the public interest in the free flow of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141. But there is a different emphasis in \u00a7 10\u00ae cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-12\">Section 10\u00ae, different from Section 10((), creates jurisdiction to grant \u201cjust and proper\u201d temporary relief pending Board decision upon any unfair labor practice charge, even though no disruption of commerce is charged. Thus, the exigencies of determining what relief, beyond enjoining disruption of commerce, is \u201cjust and proper\u201d are likely to be of critical importance when relief is sought under Section 10\u00ae____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-14\"><em>Id. </em>In considering a \u00a7 10\u00ae injunction petition, therefore, this court teaches that the district courts must determine, case-by-case, what judicial action will be \u201cin the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142. Accordingly, we must ask whether it is \u201cjust and proper\u201d in the sense of being in \u201cthe public interest\u201d that an injunction issue here pending the NLRB\u2019s resolution of the underlying unfair labor practice controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Our inquiry is especially critical because in making its request for injunctive relief in March 1983, the Regional Director did not seek to preserve the <em>status quo </em>\u2014 the usual relief sought in preliminary injunctions\u2014 but instead sought to jettison extensive changes that had been made five months prior thereto by the bus line\u2019s new owner. He requested a successor company to discharge its present employees and rehire former employees of the predecessor company who had not applied for employment with the successor. And he requested the district court to do all this far in advance of any finding of an unfair labor practice. Granting injunctive relief prior to the Board\u2019s resolution of the underlying unfair labor practice charges is very drastic under ordinary circumstances, but nevertheless authorized by Congress; yet under the unusual circumstances here, it indeed would be very strong medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">The role of the appellate court in \u00a7 10(j) cases has been delineated by this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arcy\">In <em>Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>519 F.2d 138, 143 (3d Cir.1975), we held that reasonable cause to believe a violation of the act has occurred, a standard for injunctive relief originally developed in cases arising under section 10(\u00bf) of the Act, is also applicable to section 10\u00a9 proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\"><em>Eisenberg v. Wellington Hall Nursing Home, Inc., </em>651 F.2d 902, 905 (3d Cir.1981). We have said the scope of review in \u00a7 10(\u00bf) cases is the familiar clearly erroneous standard. <em>Hirsch, </em>530 F.2d at 303; <em>Schauffler, </em>292 F.2d at 187. As guidance to district courts, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-7\">Since the \u00a7 10(0 proceeding is thus ancillary to the main unfair labor practice action committed to the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, the Regional Director faces a relatively insubstantial burden of proof when he petitions a district court for temporary injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 10(0- He need not prove that a violation of the NLRA has in fact occurred. Nor must he convince the district court of the validity of the legal theory upon which he predicates his charges. \u25a0 Both questions are for the Board\u2019s determination in the first instance, subject to the right of appellate review. Rather, he need only demonstrate that he has reasonable cause to believe that the elements of an unfair labor practice are present and that the legal theory upon which he proceeds is \u201csubstantial and not frivolous\u201d. <em>Samoff v. Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of Phila. &amp; Vicinity, </em>475 F.2d 203 (3d Cir.1973), <em>vacated for mootness, </em>414 U.S. 808, 94 S.Ct. 151, 38 L.Ed.2d 44 (1973); <em>Schauffler v.

Finally, this court, speaking through Judge Gibbons, has held that in a \u00a7 10\u00a9 case \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s determination that this low threshold of proof was met is reviewed by a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Wellington Hall, </em>651 F.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-12\">With respect to the standard of review, the Regional Director wants the best of both worlds. He asks us to preserve his low threshold burden of proof at trial but to reject the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d review standard when he loses there. He advocates a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d standard of review, requesting this court to apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d review standard only when he wins in the court below, and a much broader scope of review when he loses. He seeks to extend the approach of two sister circuits, which distinguish between granting and denying relief in \u00a7 10(Z) cases, to the \u00a7 10\u00a9 context. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Milk Drivers &amp; Dairy Employees Union, </em>491 F.2d 200 (8th Cir.1974); <em>National Maritime Union of America v. Commerce Tankers Corp., </em>457 F.2d 1127 (2d Cir.1972). But I refuse to endorse an \u201cunchanneled, undirected, and un-chartered\u201d concept that is both \u201cinarticula-ble and unreasoned.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even-handed jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>tice is still the polestar in this court. I adhere to Judge Gibbons\u2019 forthright statement in <em>Wellington Hall </em>and join in the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">The Regional Director based his petition for temporary injunctive relief on the theory that the companies had committed unfair labor practices by: (1) transferring assets in a manner designed to thwart the Transit union; and (2) refusing to hire Suburban employees. The district court found that the Regional Director failed to demonstrate that he had reasonable cause to believe that those unfair labor practices had been committed. It found no evidence of a \u201cjoint venture\u201d between the selling and buying companies designed to thwart the Transit union that would support the first alleged unfair labor practice charge; it also found no evidence of a discriminatory refusal to hire. In sum, the trial court found the Regional Director\u2019s case to be insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">Subjecting the district court\u2019s findings of fact to the appropriate standard of review, I cannot conclude that those findings are clearly erroneous. Because the sale of Suburban to Holland was a bona fide arm\u2019s length transaction, the trial court\u2019s finding that no \u201cjoint venture\u201d was created to thwart the union must be sustained. In addition, because no employees filed employment applications with Short Way until the changeover in October, 1982, and the court finding no other facts to support the plaintiff\u2019s theory, there could be no discriminatory refusal to hire. As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-7\">We do not, however, read this low standard of proof as mandating the regional director to pursue flights of fancy or to simply ignore all the evidence suggesting a conclusion contrary to the one he has chosen to draw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-8\">Even were we to find in the record sufficient evidence to support a reasonable cause finding by the regional director, Section 160(j) gives us only the power to grant such injunctive relief as we deem just and proper. In our view, the only factual finding in this case which could have rendered substantial equitable relief just and proper would have been a finding that Shortway Suburban/Shortway Airport Limousine systematically discriminated against all the old Suburban A.T.U. Local 1543 employees and absent such discrimination all of the old workers would have been hired. Such a finding was the core premise of the petitioner\u2019s argument for injunctive relief____ [In its trial memorandum] the petitioner argued \u201cthat it is reasonable to believe that but for Respondent Single Employer\u2019s discrimination refusal to hire the Respondent Suburban employees, the charging party would have continued to enjoy majority representative status.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AODz\">The problem with petitioner\u2019s analysis is that while the evidence of discriminatory hiring was inadequate to support reasonable cause, the evidence that the alleged discrimination prevented the hiring of all of the old Suburban employees was simply nonexistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">App. at 1306-07. To me, Judge Cohill\u2019s statement is unassailable. And this, of course, brings me into sharp conflict with the majority\u2019s analysis in Part III C of its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">My primary difficulty is with what the majority calls the \u201cthree underlying conclusions\u201d of the district court\u2019s finding of no reasonable cause. The majority writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9F\">The district court\u2019s bench opinion can be fairly read as resting its finding of no reasonable cause on three underlying conclusions. First, it noted that, because no Suburban employee had actually applied for a job with Shortway during the relevant time period, there had been no \u201crefusal to hire by the new employer [Shortway].\u201d Second, it found that any anti-union animus that did exist on the part of the bus lines was not the sole reason for their failure to hire, a requirement the court grounded on footnote 8 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Joint Executive Board, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders International Union, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974). Third, it apparently concluded that, because of what it regarded as the Suburban employees\u2019 steadfast refusal to accept employment at the Shortway wage rates, any improper behavior by Shortway was not a but-for cause of the harm alleged. We consider these predicate conclusions in turn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\">Maj. op. at 1086-1087. I am not satisfied that the majority\u2019s paraphrase of the district court\u2019s analysis candidly reflects the reasoning or the determination of the trial court. Dictates of dispassionate appellate review compel a reference to the <em>exact </em>language of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Judge Cohill writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-6\">The charging party through the government asserts that the new company refused to hire former employees of Suburban because of its animus against the Local 1543. There is not one scintilla of evidence that a single Suburban employee sought employment from the new company prior to October 30. Since then several have applied for jobs and been hired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-7\">The government also sought to prove that the employees of the new company were less competent than the old Suburban employees. We are willing to accept that as a fact for purposes of this discussion. We are also willing to assume that the new owners of the bus line did not encourage the former employees to seek employment, and that the former employees may have been confused as to how to go about applying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-8\">What we don\u2019t have is a refusal to hire by the new employer. Indeed several former employees of Suburban have been hired, and, as noted, the president of the charging party refused a job that was offered to him because the pay was not high enough to suit him, and he remains unemployed to this day through his own choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-10\">It is well established that a business entity taking over the assets or operations of a preexisting company has the right not to hire any of the old employees, if it so desires. See <em>Howard Johnson Company v. Detroit Joint Board, </em>417 U.S. 249 at page 262 [94 S.Ct. 2236 at page 2243, 41 L.Ed.2d 46] (1974); NLRB against <em>Burns International Security Services, </em>406 U.S. 272, at pages 280-281, n. 5 [92 S.Ct. 1571, at pages 1578-1579, n. 5, 32 L.Ed.2d 61] (1972). While the Supreme Court has recognized that an anti-union, discriminatory refusal to hire is an unfair labor practice, it is important to note that under Howard Johnson the discrimination must be the sole reason for the failure to hire. See 417 U.S. at 262, n. 8 [94 S.Ct. at 2243, n. 8].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-11\">In the case before us, there is simply no evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Shortway Suburban/Shortway Airport Limousines decision to employ the workers it selected for its Western Pennsylvania operations was dictated solely by a desire to thwart the A.T.U., Local 1543.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-12\">Absent adequate evidence showing discriminatory hiring by Shortway Suburban/Shortway Airport Limousines and further evidence establishing a causal link between such discrimination and the failure of the A.T.U., Local 1543, to represent a majority of the new employees, most of the injunctive relief sought by the petitioner would represent a wholly speculative exercise of our equity powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-13\">App. at 1301-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-14\">This language discloses that only the first of the majority\u2019s three characterizations of the district court\u2019s \u201cunderlying conclusions\u201d was accurately or properly paraphrased. An examination of the district court\u2019s opinion reveals that the court did not find \u201canti-union animus that did exist on the part of the bus lines.\u201d And it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>is improper to suggest that it did. Moreover, the court made no conclusion that there was \u201cany improper behavior by Shortway\u201d or that such behavior \u201cwas not a but-for cause of the harm alleged.\u201d Thus, I cannot agree with the majority that these were \u201cpredicate conclusions\u201d of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">To suggest that the district court found \u201canti-union animus\u201d or \u201cimproper behavior\u201d are conclusions artificially and self-constructed by the majority. At the very best, the technique is known as the fallacy of irrelevance, often referred to as irrelevant conclusion or <em>ignoratio elenchi: </em>the material fallacy of attacking something that has not been asserted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the vernacular, this is known as erecting a strawman and then striking it down.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">At bottom, what distinguishes the majority\u2019s discussion from the district court\u2019s is the difference between an expression of conjecture<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the application of theory applied to the facts found in this case. Struggle though it does through its labyrinthine argument, the majority never comes to grips with the facts found by the district court in this ease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-6\">There is not one scintilla of evidence that a single Suburban employee sought employment from the new company prior to [the consummation of the sale] on October 30. Since then <em>several have applied for jobs and been hired.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">App. at 1301 (emphasis added). This critical finding can be ignored only if you accept the Regional Director\u2019s underlying major premise, apparently accepted by the majority, that there is some duty for a successor company to hire employees of its predecessor. Such a notion runs completely counter to <em>Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Joint Executive Board, Hotel &amp; Restaurant Employees &amp; Bartenders International Union, </em>417 U.S. 249, 94 S.Ct. 2236, 41 L.Ed.2d 46 (1974) and <em>N.L.R.B. v. Burns International Security Services, Inc:, </em>406 U.S. 272, 92 S.Ct. 1571, 32 L.Ed.2d 61 (1972). These cases teach that there is nothing in the federal labor laws that requires that an employer who has purchased the assets of a business \u201cbe obligated to hire all the employees of the predecessor though it is possible that such an obligation might be assumed by the employer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Distilled to its essence, the majority argument contends that the district court rejected the <em>theory </em>of the Regional Director, <em>see </em>majority op. typescript at 1087-1089; in my view, the court did not reject the plaintiff\u2019s theory but instead determined that no evidence supported the theory. And the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>has made no determination that any narrative or historical facts found by the court were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">The district court held that even if there were evidence to support a finding of reasonable cause, the injunctive relief sought would not be just and proper in any respect. Here I join the majority\u2019s discussion and offer only additional observations. A permissible reading of the district court\u2019s opinion suggests that, in reaching this conclusion, it considered basic principles of equity and concluded, without stating in <em>ipsis verbis, </em>that the doctrine of laches precluded relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The equitable doctrine of laches involves three elements: (1) delay in asserting a right or claim, (2) that was inexcusable, and (3) that prejudiced the defendant. <em>University of Pittsburgh v. Champion Products Inc., </em>686 F.2d 1040 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1087,103 S.Ct. 571, 74 L.Ed.2d 933 (1982); <em>Gruca v. United States Steel Corp., </em>495 F.2d 1252, 1258 (3d Cir.1974); <em>Sobosle v. United States Steel Corp., </em>359 F.2d 7, 12-13 (3d Cir.1966); <em>Kane v. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, </em>189 F.2d 303, 305 (3d Cir.1951) (in banc). <em>See also </em>E. RE, REMEDIES 535-39 (1981). By its very nature, the doctrine addresses itself to the sound discretion of the trial judge. Absent an abuse of discretion, therefore, we should not disturb the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Gardner v. Panama R.R., </em>342 U.S. 29, 30, 72 S.Ct. 12, 13, 96 L.Ed. 31 (1951) (per curiam); <em>Gruca, </em>495 F.2d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-18\">Measuring the district court\u2019s opinion against these precepts, I am impressed that the court noted that \u201cToday, April 20,1982, we are nearly six months beyond the status quo the petitioner wishes us to \u2018maintain\u2019 by affirmative injunction.\u201d App. at 1309. As noted by the majority in Part II of its opinion, the Transit union first filed its charge with the NLRB on November 9, 1982; the Regional Director filed an unfair labor complaint before the Board on De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>cember 30, 1982, but did not seek the mandatory federal court relief until almost three months later, on March 4, 1983. The district court handed down its decision on April 20, 1983. The Regional Director did not immediately appeal to this court. He waited until a month later, May 19, 1983. On June 3, 1983, he moved to expedite the appeal, and the motion was granted by a panel of this court on June 29, 1983. The Regional Director\u2019s sense of urgency then apparently having dissipated, he successfully moved to file his brief and appendix out of time. This appeal was argued on an expedited basis on September 27, 1983. Meanwhile, in the administrative proceedings, the General Counsel did not schedule the initial day of hearing until May 4, 1983, a hearing date more than four months after the issuance of the complaint. After the AU rendered his decision on December 27, 1983, the Regional Director requested an extension of over one month to file exceptions to the decision. Thus, while the district court was asked by the NLRB to furnish relief pending the administrative hearing, and while this court was asked to expedite the appeal, the NLRB had decelerated from its usual snail\u2019s pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">Evaluating the NLRB\u2019s action only from the time the charge was filed with the Board to the date the complaint was filed in federal court \u2014 and disregarding the stalling that has occurred since \u2014 this case unquestionably reeks of delay. Thus, the first criterion of the laches doctrine is satisfied. As the Board offered no reasons to justify its tardiness, I find the delay also to be inexcusable, thus satisfying the second criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">I do not believe that this is the type of delay envisioned by Congress in enacting \u00a7 10(j). The Senate Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-6\">Experience under the National Labor Relations Act has demonstrated that by reason of lengthy hearings and litigation enforcing its orders, the Board has not been able in some instances to correct unfair labor practices until after substantial injury has been done. Under the present act the Board is empowered to seek interim relief only after it has filed in the appropriate circuit court of appeals its order and the record on which it is based. Since the Board\u2019s orders are not self-enforcing, it has sometimes been possible for persons violating the act to accomplish their unlawful objective before being placed under any legal restraint and thereby to make it impossible or not feasible to restore or preserve the status quo pending litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">S.Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 27 (1947). The right to injunctive relief presumes timely NLRB administrative processes. Congress apparently was not concerned primarily about the footdragging of the NLRB in filing a complaint in federal court and its inexcusable failure to schedule a timely administrative hearing- \u2014 as evidenced here \u2014 but about the delay between the Board\u2019s decision and its later enforcement by the United States Court of Appeals. In any event, I associate myself completely with what District Judge Duffy said in <em>Seeler v. H.G. Page &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>540 F.Supp. 77 (S.D.N.Y.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-9\">Although Congress specifically noted that some interim relief may be necessary because of \u201cthe relatively slow procedure of the Board hearing,\u201d this remedy does not apply where the Board itself does not treat the ongoing violations with urgency. It took nearly four months for the Board to request injunc-tive relief. The hearing before the administrative law judge is tentatively scheduled for June 15, 1982. I do not believe any additional \u201cunion erosion\u201d will occur in the next month that the Board has not already deemed permissible by waiting four months to come into federal court. Congress may have enacted 10(j) to compensate for an admittedly slow administrative adjudication process, but it did not intend to countenance undue delay in requesting interim injunc-tive relief. The Board\u2019s inaction in this case is the most compelling evidence against the need for intervention by this court. Thus, pending the administrative hearing and decision, it does not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>that the union will require or deserves injunctive relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 79 (citation omitted). These sentiments have been endorsed by this court in <em>Wellington Hall, </em>651 F.2d at 907, and <em>Hartz Mountain, </em>519 F.2d at 144. In the latter case, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-j\">we think a pledge of expeditious administrative action is necessarily implicit in a petition for a Section 10(j) injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azx-dedup-2\">519 F.2d at 144. <em>See also Siegel v. Marina City Co., </em>428 F.Supp. 1090 (C.D.Cal.1977) (three-month delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">This brings me to the final criterion of the laches doctrine \u2014 prejudice to the defendant caused by plaintiffs inexcusable delay. The district court found as a fact that the former owner no longer has anything to do with the operation and that at the time of the hearing, the new owner had been operating the bus line for almost six months. The prejudice to the defendants from this delay is obvious. If injunctive relief were now granted, Short Way would be required to make massive changes in its work force and in the operation of its business. It would have to change, without an election, its bargaining representative and, without collective bargaining, its wage rates. It would have to fire its present experienced employees and hire others. It would have to do all this in advance of a final administrative adjudication of the underlying unfair labor practice charges. Thus, even presuming the Regional Director met his threshold burden of proving reasonable cause, I have no difficulty in determining that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying injunctive relief on the basis that laches rendered such relief unjust and improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">Under the circumstances presented here \u2014 laches in filing the complaint and the dreadful tardiness in processing the unfair labor practice charge before the Board\u2014 this court has been justified in delaying its decision until receipt of hard information concerning the status of the administrative proceedings. It is not enough to express in the strongest terms revulsion at having expedited this appeal while the NLRB failed to expedite its proceedings. Such blatant lack of candor exposes a cynicism that simply will not be tolerated where the executive branch thwarts an attempt by the judicial branch to vindicate the congressional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-9\">It may be well to emphasize this court\u2019s ruling case law on the limitation to district court injunctions under \u00a7 10(j). Speaking through Judge Hastie, we have said that \u201ca pledge of expeditious administrative action is necessarily implicit in a petition for a Section 10(j) injunction. Otherwise, a temporary injunction, entered without reaching the ultimate merits of a dispute may become, in effect, a final disposition of the controversy.\u201d <em>Hartz Mountain, </em>519 F.2d at 144. Without attributing \u201cto anyone an intention to abuse the process of the district court, that can be the result if a Section 10(j) injunction remains in effect overlong,\u201d <em>id., </em>we then laid down a rule for the district courts in this judicial circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6-m\">[a \u00a7 10(j) ] injunction should include an explicit time limitation, not longer than six months, on the restraint it imposes. If it is believed that injunctive relief or its continuation is warranted after the findings and recommendations of the administrative law judge have been entered, upon proper petition in an appropriate case a district judge may grant or continue a Section 10(j) injunction for an additional period of not more than six months to permit Board action upon those recommendations. Moreover, these six-month limitations shall not preclude a district judge from extending the life of any Section 10(j) injunction for an additional thirty-day period upon a showing that administrative action on the underlying controversy seems to be imminent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-10\"><em>Id. </em>By analogy, a six-month period having expired from the date of the district court's hearing, the NLRB\u2019s right to any injunction may be totally forfeited because of the delay in the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">This too must be said. I am a longtime resident of Greater Pittsburgh and what I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>know as a person, I will not ignore as a judge. In my lifetime, I have borne witness to the disappearance from our streets of a score of privately-owned commuter bus lines. I have seen the local, state, and federal governments \u2014 and their taxpayers \u2014 required to fill the gap. They have had to provide passenger service through governmental authorities and government corporations. So all-pervasive is this trend that I need no citation of authority to note that, with minuscule exceptions, the transportation of passengers to, from, and through metropolitan areas has had to become a function of government heavily subsidized by the public fisc. Moreover, I need no citation of authority to record the precarious circumstances of America\u2019s largest bus line, the Greyhound Corporation, in 1983, when the company successfully contended that it could survive as an ongoing entity only with a \u201cgiveback\u201d of wage cuts of 7.8 percent and a 4 percent employee contribution to the pension plan. After a seven-week strike, the employees accepted a collective bargaining agreement incorporating these features.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the case at bar, Judge Cohill found that \u201cSuburban had been losing money. To require the new employer to be bound by the terms of a contract to which it had not been a party might well sound the death knell for the new company.\u201d App. at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Based on the record before the district court, I am convinced that granting the requested injunction prior to any finding of an unfair labor practice could well cause the disappearance of one of the last two or three private commuter bus lines still operating in Greater Pittsburgh. It may well be that as this unfair labor practice proceeding wends its way through the administrative maze at its irresponsibly glacial pace, a final decision of the NLRB may produce exactly that. If this be the case, so be it. But I believe it to be more desirable that the last rites over a lonely survivor of private industry be pronounced by the executive branch of government \u2014 after the administrative process has run its course\u2014 than by federal judges relying on the Regional Director\u2019s evanescent, tissue-thin arguments presented below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">.
