Most of the arguments raised by the appellant Chic Magazine, Inc. in the petition for rehearing were fully considered by the panel in rendering our opinion. We write to address a single issue: Chic\u2019s contention that the jury award for invasion of privacy may not be affirmed because it was based on instructions authorizing recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>on either a \u201cfalse light\u201d or an \u201cappropriation\u201d theory and because there was no evidence to support a recovery for appropriation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">When two claims have been submitted to the jury, whether on a general verdict or, as here, in a single interrogatory, a new trial may be required if one of the claims was submitted erroneously. <em>United New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilot Ass\u2019n v. Halecki, </em>358 U.S. 613, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed.2d 541 (1959). In <em>Halecki, </em>the Supreme Court said, \u201cA new trial will be required for there is no way to know that the invalid claim ... was not the sole basis for the verdict.\u201d On the other hand, a general verdict can be upheld, even when a claim erroneously has been submitted \u201cwhere it is reasonably certain that the jury was not significantly influenced by issues erroneously submitted to it.\u201d <em>E.I. Du Pont de Nemours v. Berkley &amp; Co., Inc., </em>620 F.2d 1247, 1258 n. 8 (8th Cir.1980). <em>See, e.g., Collum v. Butler, </em>421 F.2d 1257, 1260 (7th Cir.1970); <em>Gardner v. General Motors Corp., </em>507 F.2d 525, 529 (10th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">Despite Chic\u2019s objections, we are totally satisfied, or, expressed in the words of the Eighth Circuit, \u201creasonably certain,\u201d that the verdict for Mrs. Braun in this case was not based solely upon the theory of appropriation of her likeness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was little if any evidence presented at trial tending to show that Mrs. Braun had been damaged by appropriation. The entire focus of Mrs. Braun\u2019s case was her contention that the publication of her picture in <em>Chic </em>created a false impression of her and damaged her reputation. The district court instructed the jury that in awarding compensatory damages for invasion of privacy it could consider Mrs. Braun\u2019s \u201cpersonal humiliation, mental anguish and suffering.\u201d In addition, in answer to a separate interrogatory also relating to Mrs. Braun\u2019s invasion of privacy claim, the jury found that <em>\u201cChic </em>published Mrs. Braun\u2019s picture in a manner highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d This finding is necessary to a false-light invasion of privacy claim, but does not form part of the claim for appropriation of likeness. <em>See Restatement (Second) Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 652C, 652E (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Finally, the jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories relating to defamation, a cause of action closely related to false-light invasion of privacy, indicate to us that the basis of the award for invasion of privacy was the false impression of Mrs. Braun that the jury believed to have been created by Chic\u2019s publication of her picture. \u201cTo permit ... issues which occupied positions of ... relative insignificance in the trial to be treated now as so important as to make their submission to the jury prejudicial would not serve the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Collum v. Butler, </em>421 F.2d at 1260. We find unreasonable Chic\u2019s assertion that the outcome of the trial would have been affected if the appropriation issue had not been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">SUGGESTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC DENIED; PETITION FOR REHEARING DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">. The jury verdict of actual damages for invasion of privacy was based on a special interrogatory which asked: \"Do you find that <em>Chic's </em>publication of Mrs. Braun's picture created a false impression of her or was an unauthorized appropriation of her picture, reputation or accomplishments?\u201d The special interrogatory for punitive damages for invasion of privacy was worded similarly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AmW8\">. In response to <em>Chic's </em>petition for rehearing, Mrs. Braun has not argued that the evidence presented at trial would support a verdict based on the theory of appropriation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
