Appellant alleged in his complaint that 1) the Mayor discharged him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>from his position as Town Director of Personnel and School Director; 2) the Mayor did not provide a hearing or other typical amenities of \u201cdue process;\u201d and 3) after the discharge the Mayor broadcast over the radio that appellant had been involved in certain dishonest activities. These facts, in appellant\u2019s view, show an infringement of his Fourteenth Amendment rights not to be deprived of \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d The district court concluded that appellant\u2019s complaint, read in the light of undisputed facts, did not show any protected \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interests. Hence, there was no unlawful infringement of appellant\u2019s federal rights. We agree that the court properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Appellant argues that his interest in his government job amounted to a \u201cproperty\u201d interest that the Fourteenth Amendment protects. To show this here, he must show that under Commonwealth law he did not serve in his job at his employer\u2019s \u201cwill,\u201d but he could be removed only \u201cfor cause.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344-47, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077-79, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976); <em>Beitzell v. Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d 870, 874 (1st Cir.1981). The district court, whose judgment on these matters we respect, <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. at 345-46, 96 S.Ct. at 2077-78; <em>Gual Morales v. Hernandez Vega, </em>604 F.2d 730, 732 (1st Cir. 1979), found that Commonwealth law made appellant an \u201cat will,\u201d not a \u201ctenured,\u201d employee. And, we see nothing erroneous about that legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The personnel law in effect when appellant was first hired (July 1980), when he was transferred to a new job (January 1981), and when he was discharged (October 1981), is contained in the Puerto Rico Public Service Personnel Act of 1975. 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1301 <em>et seq. </em>That Act divides municipal personnel into two categories, \u201ccareer\u201d employees and \u201cconfidential\u201d employees. 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1421. Confidential employees \u201care those who intervene or collaborate substantially in the formulation of public policy, who advise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency.\u201d 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1350. The Act specifies that \u201cconfidential\u201d employees are \u201cof free selection and removal.\" <em>Id. </em>The parties do not dispute that appellant\u2019s job has the characteristics that the Act\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d employee description sets forth. And, if that section applies to appellant, the remainder of the Act makes clear that he could be fired without \u201ccause.\u201d <em>See Guerra Garcia v. Collazo Collazo, </em>113 D.P.R. \u2014, 82 JTS 90 (May 28, 1982); <em>Morales Narvaez v. Oficina del Gobernador, </em>112 D.P.R. 761, 766-67 (1982); <em>Pierson Muller v. Feijoo, </em>106 D.P.R. 838, 852 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Appellant makes three arguments to the contrary. First, he claims that the Act does not apply to him because a different act in effect in 1980 and 1981 \u2014 the old Puerto Rico Municipal Law (repealed by Act No. 146 of June 18,1980, effective July 1, 1981) \u2014 gave him tenure rights. That law states that \u201cmunicipal officers and employees may be removed from office by the Mayor, for just cause,\u201d it says that the Mayor\u2019s appointees shall serve throughout his term \u201cunless sooner removed for just cause,\u201d and it specifies certain procedures for use when \u201ccause\u201d is at issue. 21 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1553 and 1263 (repealed 1980). If this law applies, appellant may well have tenure rights. But, a closer examination of Puerto Rico\u2019s law indicates that the Personnel Act, not the old Municipal Law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">The Personnel Act, which took effect in 1976, specifically states as an objective the application of its principles to \u201call public employees, whether they are Commonwealth or municipal.\u201d 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1311(2). It defines municipalities as \u201cindividual administrators,\u201d the subject of numerous specific Act provisions. 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1343. And, it expressly states that \u201cthe employees of municipal government shall be classified as career or confidential employees.\u201d 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 1421. The force of these provisions would seem significantly eroded, were they not to apply to a mayor\u2019s appointees. Thus, the Commonwealth Supreme Court has held that the Act applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to municipal employees \u2014 at least to those, like appellant, appointed after 1976 when the Act took effect. <em>Franco v. Municipio de Cidra, </em>113 D.P.R. \u2014, 82 JTS 112 (June 29, 1982); <em>Pizarro v. Municipio de Carolina, </em>112 D.P.R. 822 (1982); <em>Colon Perez v. Municipio de Ceiba, </em>112 D.P.R. 740 (1982); <em>Delbrey v. Municipio de Carolina, </em>111 D.P.R. 492 (1981); <em>Delgado Rivera v. Igle-sias Perez, </em>109 D.P.R. 5 (1979). And, in so holding, it effectively decided that the 1976 Act superseded conflicting provisions in the Municipal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Second, appellant argues that the Act does not apply to him because it does not, in and of itself, categorize municipal employees as \u201ccareer\u201d or \u201cconfidential;\u201d rather, it says that municipal employees \u201cshall be classified as\u201d the one, or the other; it calls for a \u201cplan\u201d of classification, 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1347(1) and 1351(1), and the Town of Gurabo had not made a classification plan. The Commonwealth Supreme Court, however, has rejected this argument as well, for it has held that the \u201cclassification\u201d provisions of the Act apply of their own force; they apply even if the town has not made the plan that the Act calls for. <em>Franco v. Municipio de Cidra, supra; Delgado Rivera v. Iglesias Perez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Third, appellant argues that a new Municipal Law, which came into effect in July 1981, helps him. It says that \u201cmunicipal ... officials shall maintain the rights acquired\u201d under the old Municipal Law; and, it says that municipal officials holding positions under the old Municipal Law \u201cshall continue in their posts until the term of their appointment expires.\u201d 21 L.P.R.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3501(f) and 3359(g). The quoted language makes clear, however, that the new law gives appellant no greater right than he had under the old. And, since the old Municipal Law gives him no greater right than he had under the Personnel Act, he was without tenure and the Fourteenth Amendment does not automatically require a hearing before his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Appellant claims that, in making defamatory comments on the radio, the May- or deprived him of a protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d The Supreme Court, in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), suggested that the Fourteenth Amendment may offer protection against government actions that defame an individual \u2014 at least where the defamation is of the sort that could \u201cseriously damage [a person\u2019s] standing and association in his community.\u201d In <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1161, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), however, the Court stated specifically that \u201creputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as employment [is not] either \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause.\u201d Rather, the injury to reputation must occur together with some other \u201calteration of status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706-10, 96 S.Ct. at 1163-65. Where the other \u201calteration\u201d involves a job, the Court said, \u201cthe defamation had to occur in the course of the termination of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 96 S.Ct. at 1165. Thus, the question for us, under <em>Paul, </em>is whether the defamation, as alleged in the complaint, occurred \u201cin the course of the termination\u201d of appellant\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">We believe that it did not. The Mayor\u2019s comments were made on the radio, after the discharge; they were not made as part of the discharge proceeding. Moreover, they were made by the Mayor, not by a newsreporter describing the discharge proceeding. There is nothing in the complaint to suggest'that the discharge-made public comments, such as those of the Mayor, necessary, inevitable, or even likely. Where one knows in advance that a discharge will likely lead to publicly-known governmental claims that an employee is, say, dishonest (and if such claims are in fact made), it makes sense to require some form of hearing; the employee can dispute the claims publicly and has a chance to save his reputation, if not his job (though the Supreme Court has not expressly held even this in respect to an \u201cat will\u201d employee). Unless, however, defamatory assertions are made before or during the discharge or one has good reason in advance to believe that the discharge of an \u201cat will\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>employee will produce such <em>public </em>claims, a pre-termination-hearing requirement as a general matter is less necessary. To require it would simply erase in many instances the constitutional distinction between the \u201cat will\u201d and the \u201ctenured\u201d employee. We can find no authorization in the ease law for our doing so. It is equally difficult to find any basis for requiring a hearing after the termination, but before the remarks, unless \u201creputation\u201d separately enjoys constitutional protection \u2014 a premise that <em>Paul </em>denies.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">All this leads us to conclude that the \u201cdefamation\u201d was separate from the employment termination; and that it is a fit subject for an action under Commonwealth tort law, 31 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 5141; 32 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 3141, not for the procedures that the \u201cdue process\u201d clause of the Fourteenth Amendment typically requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
