We <em>affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, </em>and <em>remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYf\">I</p>\n<p id=\"ABhH\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"auh-dedup-2\">Plaintiff-appellee Seattle Box Company, Inc. (\u201cSeattle Box\u201d) and defendant-appellant Industrial Crating and Packing, Inc. (\u201cIndustrial\u201d) are Washington State corporations which provide oil pipe bundling services to oil companies. Both corporations have their principal places of business in Washington State.</p>\n<p id=\"ag9-dedup-0\">Seattle Box filed this action on July 2, 1980, alleging that Industrial infringed U.S. Patent No. 4,099,617 (\u201cthe \u2019617 patent\u201d) entitled \u201cShipping Bundle for Numerous Pipe Lengths.\u201d Seattle Box brought the action in its capacity as assignee of the rights in the \u2019617 patent. On August 19, 1980, the United States Patent and Trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>mark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) reissued the \u2019617 patent, with broadened claims, in U.S. Patent No. Re. 30,373 (\u201cthe \u2019373 reissue patent\u201d). Seattle Box also was the assignee of the rights in this patent. On October 10, 1980, Seattle Box amended its complaint to allege infringement of the \u2019373 reissue patent. Industrial answered and counterclaimed, alleging patent invalidity, noninfringement, and patent misuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The district court held in favor of Seattle Box on May 4, 1982, and after an accounting for damages, entered judgment on February 9, 1983. Industrial presses only the issues of patent invalidity and noninfringement here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">A. <em>The Invention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Until at least 1975, oil companies commonly transported oil pipes of various diameters and with weights upwards of 40 pounds per foot, as loose joints about 40 feet in length. Since no packaging procedure capable of safely and securely handling oil country pipe then existed, many pipes were irreparably damaged in transit and during loading and unloading operations. Rennels, a representative for Atlantic Richfield Company (\u201cARCO\u201d), in late 1975 recognized ARCO\u2019s pipe transport problems and discussed with the patentee, Ferdinand J. Nist, Jr. (\u201cNist\u201d), ARCO\u2019s need for a pipe bundling method which would get oil pipe to the Alaskan North Slope without bends, dents, or damaged ends. Although at the time of this discussion Nist had no experience in packaging oil pipes, he nevertheless undertook the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">After extensive experimentation, which the district court opinion sets forth in great detail, Nist settled on a system in which he placed a tier of pipes across parallel horizontal wooden beams, or \u201csleepers.\u201d To ensure that adjacent pipes remained separated, Nist placed between them a double-concave wooden spacer block, depicted in Figure 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Nist stacked several tiers of these crossing rows of sleepers and pipes in order to make one pipe bundle. To prevent the weight of the upper pipes from crushing the lower pipes in either a bundle or a stack of bundles, Nist made his spacer blocks with a height at least equal to the pipe\u2019s diameter; the spacer blocks, therefore, absorbed most of the weight of the overhead load.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Figures 2-4 below depict a pipe bundle made according to the Nist method. In these figures, pipes 18, 36, and 44 lie across wooden sleepers 10, 30, 40, and 50. Double-concave spacers 22 separate the pipe. Finally, strapping materials 38, 46, 52, 59, and 60 hold together the entire bundle.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">B. <em>The Patent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Seattle Box filed an application for a patent on Nist\u2019s invention on February 17, 1977. Claim 1 of this application stated that the double-concave spacer block had a \u201cheight substantially equal to the thickness of the tier of pipe lengths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Seattle Box\u2019s patent attorney, however, narrowed Claim 1 during the application\u2019s prosecution so as to specify that the spacer block had a height only \u201cgreater than the diameter of the pipe.\u201d Soon after the attorney made this narrowing amendment, although not necessarily because of it, the patent examiner allowed each of the application\u2019s claims. The \u2019617 patent issued on July 11, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">On December 1, 1978, Seattle Box filed an application to have the \u2019617 patent reissued with broader claims. Nist averred in support of this application that neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>patent examiner nor the cited prior art required the narrow scope of the issued claims, and that the limitation on the height of the spacer block in his Claim 1 was unnecessary and \u201carose through inadvertence by counsel.\u201d Nist additionally stated that \u201cin reality each overlying or superposed sleeper need only be separated from its underlying companion a distance equal to but not less than the diameter (i.e., the thickness) of the pipes in each tier interposed between the sleepers to avoid forces being applied to squeeze the pipe in bundle stacks or handling operations * 's *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The PTO granted the application for the reissue patent and issued the \u2019373 reissue patent on August 19, 1980. In addition to allowing Seattle Box to amend Claim 1 to specify a spacer block \u201cof a height <em>substantially equal to or </em>greater than the thickness of the tier of pipe length\u201d [emphasis in original], the PTO also allowed five wholly new claims, Claims 8-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The reissued, amended Claim 1, upon which claims 2-6 depend, is a product claim for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">1. A shipping bundle formed of a plurality of lengths of pipe of a common size, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">a base formed of a first plurality of transverse sleepers located in spaced-apart parallel arrangement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN0\">a tier of pipe lengths resting on said base, adjacent pipe lengths of said tier being separated by blocks in transverse series, each block having opposed concavities substantially embracing the curved sides of said adjacent pipe lengths;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"am_-dedup-0\">each of said series of blocks being located to stand on one of said sleepers and being of a height <em>substantially equal to or </em>greater than the thickness of the tier of pipe lengths;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay_\">a second plurality of sleepers, each traversing said pipe tier in overlying alignment with a sleeper of said first plurality, the sleepers of said second plurality being supported on the series of separating blocks; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">a bundling strap tightly encircling each sleeper of said first plurality, the separating blocks resting thereon, and the respective overlying sleeper. [Emphasis in the claim.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The reissued, new Claim 8, upon which claims 10 through 12 depend, is a claim for a process using:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">8. The method of bundling a plurality of lengths of pipe of a common size, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\">forming a first bundle base by laying down a first plurality of transverse sleepers in spaced-apart parallel locations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">depositing a first tier of pipes on said bundle base and at each location concavely chocking adjacent pairs of pipes of said tier in spaced-apart relation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alu-dedup-1\">traversing the first tier of pipes with a second plurality of transverse sleepers aligned with said first plurality at each location and vertially [sic] spaced apart by said chocking from said first plurality a distance substantially equal to or greater than the diameter of said pipes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-14\">tightly encircling the pipes of said first tier with strapping adjacent at least two of said locations; and, tightly encircling the sleepers at each location with strapping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">Claims 7 and 9, withdrawn before trial, are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-18\">The parties argue three main issues in this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-19\">1. Did the trial court err in not holding the Nist \u2019373 reissue patent invalid (a) for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, (b) for indefiniteness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, or (c) under the recapture rule for obtaining through reissue claims of improper scope?</p>\n<p id=\"b880-20\">2. Did the trial court err in (a) finding that Industrial presently infringes claims of the \u2019373 reissue patent and (b) enjoining that infringement?</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>3. Did the trial court err in (a) finding that Industrial infringed claims of the \u2019617 patent before the \u2019373 reissue patent issued and (b) holding Industrial liable for that infringement?</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\n<em>Validity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">A. <em>Section 103 </em>\u2014 \u201cObviousness\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">We are, once again, confronted with a challenge to a trial court\u2019s judgment on the issue of obviousness. We begin, as usual, with a careful review of the district court\u2019s fact-findings made according to the Supreme Court\u2019s prescribed ritual: \u201cthe scope and content of the prior art are to be determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.\u201d <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 693, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, 148 USPQ 459, 467 (1966). We cannot and will not set these fact-findings aside unless the appellant persuades us that the findings are <em>clearly </em>erroneous. <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>52(a). Since Industrial has not left us here with a definite and firm conviction that the trial judge has committed a mistake, we rely fully on the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">1. <em>Factual Determinations</em></p>\n<p id=\"alv-dedup-1\">a. <em>Scope and Content of the Prior Art</em></p>\n<p id=\"alp-dedup-0\">Before trial, Industrial identified as prior art some seventy United States patents, three West German patents, a 1960 Association of American Railroads (\u201cAAR\u201d) publication entitled \u201cRules Governing the Loading of Steel Products Including Pipe on Open Top Cars,\u201d and a United States Government leaflet on storage and materials handling. It is undisputed that no single prior art reference exhibits all the features of the invention claimed in the \u2019373 reissue patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">At trial, Industrial focused the court\u2019s attention on several prior art references which the patent examiner had not considered and which Industrial deemed significantly more pertinent than those references the examiner did cite. Industrial concentrated, in particular, on four references which the patent examiner did not cite: the AAR publication; British Patent <em>No. </em>561,-423, issued 1944; and Parker U.S. Patents Nos. 1,801,451, and 1,821,234, issued 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">The district court expressly held that this art was not more pertinent than the art which the patent examiner cited. The parties here have completely fashioned their argument around this art, however. We assume, therefore, that this art is appropriate for purposes of reviewing the district court\u2019s holding of nonobviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">The AAR publication discloses the use of (1) wooden sleepers between rows of pipe, (2) strapping material passing at various levels around the tiers of pipe, and (3) \u201cwood chock blocks\u201d cut to fit the contour of the pipe. The wood blocks, however, are <em>nailed </em>to only the <em>ends </em>of the sleepers; they are not placed between individual pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">The British Patent No. 561,423 discloses sheet metal spacers formed with double-concave faces which match the curvature of bundled cylindrical articles.</p>\n<p id=\"pAlB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"AUS5\">Parker Patents Nos. 1,821,234 and 1,801,-451 disclose spacers having double-concave sides to hold conduits in a spaced relationship. The Parker patents also disclose spacers used to support two tiers of pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"AfX\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">b. <em>Differences Between Prior Art and \u2019373 Reissue Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The trial court found that although most of the elements of Nist\u2019s invention were known, nothing in the prior art disclosed a double-concave block adapted to provide vertical support for a layer or more of pipe located on sleepers above a bottom layer of pipe. The prior art, that is, nowhere taught using wooden spacer blocks with a weight bearing capacity to support sleepers.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">c. <em>Level of Skill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">The district court found \u201cthe level of skill in the pipe packaging art at the time Nist made this invention to be that * * * [of] persons familiar with the packaging of tubular goods for safe transportation from a packaging site to a remote location, with such persons having engineering or mechanical skills acquired by actual experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">d. <em>Other Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">The district court made several additional fact-findings which are relevant when reviewing an invention\u2019s obviousness. The court noted, in particular, that Nist solved after extensive experimentation a long-felt but unsolved need for an improved pipe bundle, and that Seattle Box enjoyed commercial success with its claimed bundle.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">2. <em>Legal Determinations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">The district court held that Industrial did not meet its burden of overcoming the '373 patent\u2019s statutory presumption of validity, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. Industrial simply reargues to us its position that the facts clearly show the obviousness of the invention, relying on the \u201cpertinence\u201d of its newly discovered prior art. Industrial makes two fundamental errors, however. First, Industrial seems to forget that the district court expressly held that Industrial\u2019s art was <em>not </em>more pertinent than the art which the patent examiner cited. This court does not consider evidence <em>de novo. Rosemount, Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1540, at 1543 (Fed.Cir. 1984). Second, even if the art were more pertinent, this fact alone does not rebut the statutory presumption of validity. <em>Leinoff v. Louis Milona &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 734, 738, 220 USPQ 845, 847-48 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>In denouncing the district court\u2019s adverse holding, however, Industrial argues that the district court improperly adopted, and thus incorrectly relied on, the testimony of Seattle Box\u2019s expert. This argument has no merit. A trial judge has sole discretion to decide whether or not he needs, or even just desires, an expert\u2019s assistance to understand a patent. We will not disturb that discretionary decision except in the clearest case. This is not such a case. Here, the trial judge reasonably could have believed he needed the testimony of experts to aid him with the sometimes complex patent specifications and prior art references.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Industrial bore the burden in trial of persuasion that one of ordinary skill in the art <em>would have found </em>the subject matter claimed, <em>as a whole, </em>obvious <em>at the time </em>the invention was made. Industrial did not meet this burden; the facts do not clearly show it did. The invention comprises some features found in the prior art and some that are new and, in our view, not even suggested by the prior art. <em>In re Sernaker, </em>702 F.2d 989, 217 USPQ 1 (Fed.Cir. 1983). The prior art did not suggest the combination of features made here. We affirm the district court\u2019s analysis of and holding on Industrial\u2019s section 103 defense. B. <em>Section 112 </em>\u2014 \u201cIndefiniteness\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Industrial argues that the use of the term \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d in the \u2019373 patent\u2019s claims makes the claimed subject matter indefinite and the claims invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. Industrial contends, it appears, that since its patent counsel was uncertain as to just how equal \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d is, the claims must be indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Definiteness problems often arise when words of degree are used in a claim. That some claim language may not be precise, however, does not automatically render a claim invalid. When a word of degree is used the district court must determine whether the patent\u2019s specification provides some standard for measuring that degree. The trial court must decide, that is, whether one of ordinary skill in the art would understand what is claimed when the claim is read in light of the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The trial court found here that an expert would know the limitations of the claims. The specification clearly sets forth, for example, that the divider blocks are intended to absorb the weight of overhead loads. Furthermore, even if Industrial needed to experiment so as to determine the limits of the \u2019373 patent\u2019s claims, the claims would not be invalid under section 112. <em>See, e.g., W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Garlock, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 1540, 1557, 220 USPQ 303, 316 (Fed.Cir.1983). Industrial has not carried its burden of persuading us that the \u2019373 patent is invalid for indefiniteness. C. <em>Recapture Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Industrial argues that the PTO incorrectly allowed the broadened reissue claims with a scope equivalent to the scope of the preamended claims in the original patent application. The recapture rule does not apply here, however, because there is no evidence that Seattle Box\u2019s amendment of its originally filed claims was in any sense an admission that the scope of that claim was not in fact patentable. <em>See In re Petrow, </em>402 F.2d 485, 488, 159 USPQ 449, 451 (CCPA 1968); <em>see also Ball Corp. v. United States, </em>729 F.2d 1429 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">\n<em>Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">The court must consider Industrial\u2019s liability for infringement, if any, during two distinct time frames. The first period extends between the date the original patent issued, July 11, 1978, and the date the reissue patent issued, August 19, 1980. Seattle Box\u2019s only enforceable patent rights during this period arise from 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252, which allows claims in a reissue patent to reach back under certain circumstances to the date the original patent issued. The second period begins on the date the reissued patent issued, August 19, 1980. During this period, Seattle Box\u2019s broadened patent claims cover a double-concave block with a height \u201csubstantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>equal to or greater than\u201d the diameter of the separated pipes. We consider the two time periods <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">A. <em>Activities Occurring Before the \u2019373 Reissue Patent Issued.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Industrial asserts that the district court erred in finding it liable for infringement done before the '373 reissue patent issued. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">An original patent cannot be infringed once a reissue patent has issued, for the original patent is surrendered. At one point in the history of the American patent law, this surrender precluded any action for infringement for acts done prior to the surrender. Courts would not allow a patentee to <em>bring </em>an action in response to acts done before the reissue patent issued since no patent existed upon which one could allege infringement. Courts, moreover, would dismiss for a failure to state a cause of action any action <em>filed </em>before the patent was surrendered since the patent sued on no longer existed. Courts acted, in other words, as if the original patent never was. <em>See </em>Federico, <em>Intervening Rights in Patent Reissues, </em>30 <em>Geo.Wash.L.Rev. </em>603, 605 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">To ameliorate the harsh effect of a patent\u2019s surrender, Congress has legislated that under certain circumstances claims of the original patent have a form of continuity if carried over to the reissue patent. Congress has incorporated its most recent version of this rule into 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252, the first paragraph of which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq3\">The surrender of the original patent shall take effect upon the issue of the reissued patent, and every reissued patent shall have, the same effect and operation in law, on the trial of actions for causes thereafter arising, as if the same had been originally granted in amended form, but <em>in so far as the claims of the original and reissued patents are identical, </em>such surrender shall not affect any action then pending nor abate any cause of action then existing, and the reissued patent, <em>to the extent that its claims are identical with the original patent, </em>shall constitute a continuation thereof and have effect continuously from the date of the original patent. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Congress, in this statute, has explicitly limited claim continuity to claims in the reissued patent <em>identical </em>to claims in the original patent. The statute does not allow the claims of the original patent some other form of survival. The original claims are dead. The statute permits, however, the claims of the reissue patent to reach back to the date the original patent issued, <em>but only if </em>those claims are identical with claims in the original patent. With respect to new or amended claims, an infringer\u2019s liability commences only from the date the reissue patent is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">At issue in this case is Congress\u2019 meaning of the word \u201cidentical.\u201d The district court interpreted \u201cidentical\u201d to mean \u201cessentially identical,\u201d noting that other courts have interpreted the word \u201cidentical\u201d in section 252 in a way which does not limit claim continuity to literally identical claims. It cited <em>Austin v. Marco Dental Products, Inc., </em>560 F.2d 966, 195 USPQ 529 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 918, 98 S.Ct. 1477, 55 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978) and <em>Akron Brass Co. v. Elkhart Brass Manufacturing Co., </em>353 F.2d 704, 147 USPQ 301 (7th Cir.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\"><em>Akron Brass </em>and <em>Austin </em>permitted changes in a reissue patent\u2019s claims, however, only if <em>without substance. </em>In <em>Akron Brass, </em>a reissued claim substituted the word \u201cqutlet\u201d for the word \u201cinlet\u201d in the original claim. Since it was already clear what was intended, the court there noted, substitution of \u201coutlet\u201d for \u201cinlet\u201d in no way enlarged or modified the substance of the claim. In <em>Austin, </em>the court found a claim in the reissued patent \u201cidentical\u201d to one in the original patent where a modification was made to \u201cmake more precise the language used without substantive changes in the claims.\u201d 560 F.2d at 973, 195 USPQ at 534. '</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">Since we are not asked to, we do not have to decide exactly what \u201cidentical\u201d does mean. It is clear, though, that \u201ciden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>tical\u201d means, <em>at most, </em>\u201cwithout substantive change.\u201d Seattle Box, in broadening its claims\u2019 scope to cover not only spacer blocks \u201cgreater than\u201d but also \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the diameter of the pipes in a bundle, has, in our view, made substantive change to its claims. The original claims cannot reasonably be read as intending, but for some inaccuracy in their expression, the same coverage as the reissue claims. Here, the addition is not a matter of a mere clarification of language to make specific what was always implicit or inherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We hold, therefore, that Seattle Box\u2019s broadened reissue claims, with the added words \u201csubstantially equal to,\u201d are not \u201cidentical\u201d to its original claims, assuming \u201cidentical\u201d means \u201cwithout substantive change.\u201d The district court erred in interpreting \u201cidentical\u201d in section 252 to mean \u201cessentially identical.\u201d Thus, Seattle Box cannot collect damages for any activities performed before its new and broadened claims issued in the reissue patent. We reverse the trial court\u2019s award of damages against Industrial for acts done prior to the date the reissue patent issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">B. <em>Activities Occurring After the \u2019373 Reissue Patent Issued.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Industrial argues that since Seattle Box gave up its claim to spacer blocks \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the diameter of the separated pipe during prosecution of the \u2019617 patent, the doctrine of file wrapper estoppel prevents Seattle Box from \u201crecapturing\u201d that language under the doctrine of equivalents. Industrial contends, furthermore, that even if we affirm the district court\u2019s finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the doctrine of intervening rights, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252, saves Industrial from liability. We consider the infringement argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">1. <em>Infringement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The trial court found that Industrial\u2019s pipe bundles \u201cclearly included each of the elements of claims 1 through 5, 8, 10 and 11 of Re. 30,373.\u201d Industrial admits that its bundles utilize the general elements of the claims in issue, namely, sleepers, pipes, double-concave spacer blocks, and strapping material. In dispute is the scope of Seattle Box\u2019s reissued claim 1 which requires as a necessary element of the invention a spacer block \u201cbeing located to stand on one of said sleepers and being of a height <em>substantially equal to or </em>greater than the thickness of the tier of pipe lengths.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Industrial asks us to decide whether the \u2019373 reissue patent\u2019s claims can have the effect of covering spacer blocks which are \u201cslightly shorter\u201d than the diameter of oil pipes which they separate. Industrial argues, first, that since Seattle Box gave up the phrase \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d during its prosecution of the original patent application, it cannot assert that scope here. Industrial appears throughout its argument to forget that Seattle Box does not allege in this action infringement of its original claims, but rather, alleges infringement of presumably valid <em>reissue </em>claims. These claims <em>specifically </em>extend to spacer blocks \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the separated pipes\u2019 diameters. Seattle Box has every right to assert the full scope of its claims here.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Industrial next argues that its spacer blocks are not substantially equal to the diameter of the separated pipes, as the claims require. Industrial contends that on the advice of its patent counsel, and specifically to avoid infringement, it instructed its spacer block manufacturer to make the spacer blocks for 5V2\" pipes at least one-sixteenth of an inch <em>less than </em>the pipe diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The district court found that the \u201cslightly shorter, double-concave Industrial blocks would correspond to the \u2018substantially equal to\u2019 limitation * * * \u201d under the doctrine of equivalents. The court\u2019s belief that it found infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, however, is wrong. The doctrine of equivalents only comes into play when there is no literal infringement. <em>See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, </em>717 F.2d 1351, 1361, 219 USPQ 473, 480 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>(Fed.Cir.1983). Since \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d embraces \u201cslightly less than,\u201d the district court\u2019s finding that Industrial\u2019s \u201cslightly shorter\u201d spacer blocks <em>were </em>\u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the pipe diameter is a finding of literal infringement which is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The district court, expressly found infringement, though, only in regard to spacer blocks one-sixteenth of an inch less than the diameter of the separated pipe. This finding we affirm. The report of the Special Master concerning Seattle Box\u2019s lost profits, however, indicated that after trial had ended, Industrial made 84 pipe bundles with spacer blocks <em>one-quarter </em>of an inch less than the diameter of the separated pipe. The Special Master correctly refused to consider whether <em>these </em>blocks infringed the '373 reissue patent; he simply detailed the profits lost due to these bundles. The district court awarded damages for these bundles without making any express finding as to whether they infringed the '373 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">As we indicated earlier, the trier of fact must determine the scope of an imprecise phrase such as \u201csubstantially equal to,\u201d which, by its very nature, has a fact-dependent meaning. The fact that a spacer block one-sixteenth of an inch less than a pipe diameter infringes a claim does not necessarily indicate that a spacer block one-quarter of an inch less than a pipe diameter also infringes that claim. There is a new literal infringement issue to decide: are spacer blocks one-quarter of an inch less than the diameter of the separated pipe \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the diameter of those separated pipes? The trier of fact must make express findings in response to this question. Such findings help delineate the metes and bounds of the claim, and enable the alleged infringer to determine what it must do to avoid infringement. We therefore vacate the award of damages as to the 84 bundles using spacer blocks one-quarter of an inch less than the diameter of the separated blocks and remand for the necessary findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We limit the remand in this case, however, to a determination of whether the quarter-inch short spacer blocks literally infringe the claims in issue. Normally, if the trier of fact has found that there is no literal infringement, it may consider whether there is infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. Here, however, Seattle Box expressly stated during prosecution of its reissue patent that a sleeper \u201cneed only be separated from its underlying companion a distance equal to <em>but not less than </em>the diameter <em>(i.e., </em>the thickness) of the pipes in each tier interposed between the sleepers.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] Since the claims issued for a separation \u201csubstantially equal to\u201d the pipes\u2019 diameter, we recognize that some leeway is appropriate in determining literal infringement. Where no literal infringement exists, however, Seattle Box\u2019s statement during its prosecution of the reissue patent estops it from asserting that its claims have a broad effect under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">2. <em>Section 252 </em>\u2014 Intervening <em>Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">When a reissue patent issues, a new patent with presumably valid claims exists. The reissue patent has \u201cthe same effect and operation in law, on the trial of actions for causes <em>thereafter arising, </em>as if the same had been originally granted in amended form, * * * \u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">The language quoted above expressly prevents a court from giving any consideration to the protection of intervening rights. The second paragraph of section 252 modifies the first paragraph, however, so as to protect intervening rights. The second paragraph provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-11\">No reissued patent shall abridge or affect the right of any person * * * who made * * * or used prior to the grant of a reissue anything patented by the reissued patent, to continue the use of * * * the specific thing so made * * * or used, unless the making [or] using * * * of such thing infringes a valid claim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>reissued patent which was in the original patent * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The statute sets forth a single straightforward test for determining whether the doctrine of intervening rights protects an alleged infringer. The only question to ask under this test is whether claims of the original patent which are repeated in the reissue patent are infringed. Section 252 assumes that a patentee having valid claims in a patent will retain those claims in the reissued patent. If valid claims in the original patent appear unaltered in the reissue patent, the doctrine of intervening rights affords no protection to the alleged infringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We have already held, however, that the claims appearing in Seattle Box\u2019s reissued patent are substantively different than those in the original patent. That is, Seattle Box repeats <em>no </em>claim from its original patent in its reissued patent. Industrial, therefore, may properly raise a defense of intervening rights. <em>See Cohen v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 525, 203 Ct.Cl. 57, 179 USPQ 859 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">When the doctrine of intervening rights is properly raised, the court must consider whether to use its broad equity powers to fashion an appropriate remedy. The second paragraph of section 252 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">[The court] may provide for the continued manufacture, use or sale of the thing made * * * or used as specified, or for the manufacture, use or sale of which substantial preparation was made before the grant of the reissue, and it may also provide for the continued practice of any process patented by the reissue, practiced * <em>* </em>prior to the grant of the reissue, to the extent and under such terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of investments made or business commenced before the grant of the reissue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The court is given the discretion to fashion a remedy from a wide range of options available to it. The court may, for example, (1) confine Industrial to the use of those double-concave blocks already in existence, (2) permit Industrial to continue in business under conditions which limit the amount, type, or geographical location of its activities, or (3) permit Industrial to continue in business unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The trial court, properly to exercise its equity powers, must carefully weigh standard equitable considerations. Since the trial court incorrectly held section 252 inapplicable here, it has yet to make any findings as to the equities of this case. Accordingly, we vacate this portion of the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">We affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the \u2019373 reissue patent is valid. We affirm its finding that some of Industrial\u2019s spacer blocks infringe the patent, but vacate the finding of infringement as to other blocks. We reverse the district court\u2019s finding of liability for any activities Industrial performed <em>before </em>the \u2019373 reissue patent issued. Finally, we vacate the district court\u2019s conclusions as to the scope of relief to which Seattle Box is entitled for infringement <em>after </em>the \u2019373 reissue patent issued. We remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.
