Because we find in the record insufficient evidence to support the conviction, we reverse and remand to the district court for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-35\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-36\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. In the fall of 1980, the appellant, Alcide W. Hernandez, a deputy sheriff of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, became involved in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>investigation of marijuana importation. Other groups of law enforcement officers, including the Louisiana state police and deputies from St. Tammany Parish, became suspicious of the St. Bernard Parish deputies\u2019 activities. Allegations of wrongdoing resulted in the indictment and conviction in December 1982 of Hernandez and four other members of his group for federal conspiracy and drug offenses. One of the witnesses at Hernandez\u2019 drug trial was Frederick Drennan, a St. Tammany Parish deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">Following the drug trial, Hernandez contacted a friend, Gerald Moran, with the alleged purpose of enlisting Moran\u2019s help in influencing Drennan to change his testimony so that Hernandez could obtain a new trial in the drug case. According to Moran, Hernandez asked him if he knew anyone who knew Freddie Drennan. Moran acknowledged that he knew a Marshall Brown, who was an inmate at the St. Tammany Parish jail. Hernandez then asked Moran to find out how well Brown knew Drennan, \u201cand see what it would take for him to change his testimony.\u201d According to Moran, Hernandez repeated his request on four or five occasions and said, \u201che wasn\u2019t worried about what it would take to see what he would say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Pursuant to Hernandez\u2019 requests, Moran contacted Brown. Brown encountered Drennan in passing and mentioned to Dren-nan that some people from St. Bernard Parish were asking about him. It was several days later before Drennan saw Brown again. At that time, Drennan asked Brown about the people asking questions: \u201cI said, what do they want? He [Brown] says they want to know if you can be bought, if you will change your testimony.\u201d Drennan told Brown not to do anything. Drennan then contacted his supervisors, who called in the FBI. Brown, cooperating with the FBI, recorded three conversations between Moran and himself during which Moran made it clear that he was working for Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">In January 1983, the federal district judge in Hernandez\u2019 original drug trial ordered a new trial because of newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequent to the granting of the new trial, Hernandez told Moran that Drennan\u2019s testimony was not as important any more, but that he still wanted Moran to pursue having Drennan change his testimony. Hernandez insisted, however, that all he wanted was the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">By this time, the Government had arrested Moran, who agreed to cooperate in the bribery investigation. Moran then recorded two conversations with Hernandez. In the final recording, on February 11, 1983, Hernandez, who feared detection, directed Moran to \u201cBlow it off, yeah. Before you and Marshall [Brown] and everybody wind up in ... trouble. You know!\u201d Regarding what they would say to Drennan, Hernandez instructed Moran, \u201cJust tell Marshall [Brown] to tell him, ah, if he feels that he told the truth, fine. Just forget about it. If you want to, tell him that I consulted my lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-11\">Based on these facts, Hernandez was indicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-12\">(d) Whoever, directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any person, or offers or promises such person to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent to influence the testimony under oath or affirmation of such first-mentioned person as a witness upon a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, before any court ... shall be fined not more than $20,000 or three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d). On May 19, 1983, a jury convicted Hernandez of violating this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">On appeal, Hernandez argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the guilty verdict. Alternatively, Hernandez contends that his conduct amounted only to preparation to commit the offense, and that he withdrew prior to commission of the crime. Because we agree with Hernandez that the facts as proved by the Government are not sufficient to constitute the violation of corruptly influencing a witness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d), we do not address Hernandez\u2019 alternative arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-9\">We recognize, of course, that Section 201 is to be broadly construed in order to effectuate its legislative purpose of deterring corruption. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>572 F.2d 455, 580 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>576 F.2d 931, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Gent v. United States, </em>439 U.S. 870, 99 S.Ct. 200, 58 L.Ed.2d 182 (1978). Furthermore, Section 201 requires only that something of value be offered or promised, not that a bribe actually be paid. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>658 F.2d 181, 191 (3d Cir.1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The crime is consummated whether or not the offer is accepted by the offeree. <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>431 F.2d 754, 760 (2d Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 950, 91 S.Ct. 1613, 29 L.Ed.2d 120 (1971). On the other hand, preparations for the commission of the crime are not parts of the crime. <em>Krogmann v. United States, </em>225 F.2d 220, 227 (6th Cir.1955); <em>United States v. Kemmel, </em>188 F.Supp. 736, 740 (D.C.Pa.1960), <em>affd </em>295 F.2d 712 (3d Cir.1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 988, 82 S.Ct. 604, 7 L.Ed.2d 525 (1962). \u201cThe critical event in the commission of the crime is the actual giving or the offer to give or transfer money or other thing of value, absent which no offense is committed under the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>510 F.2d 1190, 1194 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1001, 95 S.Ct. 2400, 44 L.Ed.2d 668 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-12\">The Second Circuit, in <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>discusses what constitutes an \u201coffer\u201d under Section 201. 431 F.2d at 760. According to the <em>Jacobs </em>court, the crime is completed when the offeror \u201cexpresse[s] an ability and a desire to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Jacobs, </em>an offer of $5000 was clearly made to an Internal Revenue Service agent. The court found it immaterial that the IRS agent held out for more money and that the offerors were unable to raise the funds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-13\">Similarly, in <em>United States v. Shulman, </em>624 F.2d 384 (2d Cir.1980), where the Second Circuit applied the <em>Jacobs </em>standard, the court concluded that the offer was complete where, after preliminary negotiations, the offeror authorized the payment of a bribe and the go-between so informed the offeree. <em>Shulman, </em>624 F.2d at 388. In <em>Shulman, </em>the offeree was an Internal Revenue Agent who asked for a bribe, in return for lowering the IRS evaluation of a piece of property for estate tax purposes. The offeror authorized the bribe, and the go-between stated to the IRS agent that \u201cthe money that he wanted was ... available, and [the IRS agent] should start working on the figures and get them lowered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Shulman, </em>a clear offer of money was made when the go-between expressed to the offeree an ability and a desire to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-15\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). The standard for sufficient evidence is that which a reasonable trier of fact could find establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we cannot find anything in the record to show that an offer or promise was ever made. The only two contacts between Brown, the go-between, and Drennan, the alleged offeree, consisted of (1) Brown\u2019s statement in passing to Drennan that some people from St. Bernard Parish were asking about Drennan; and (2) Brown\u2019s reply to Drennan\u2019s question concerning what these people wanted to know: \u201cthey want to know if you can be bought, if you will change your testimony.\u201d Such an inquiry does not \u201cexpress[] an ability and a desire to pay\u201d a bribe. At most, the phrase \u201cthey want to know\u201d constitutes mere preparation to commit the crime \u2014 a preliminary \u201cfeel out\u201d of Drennan. It does not rise to the level of the offer conveyed in <em>Jacobs </em>and <em>Shulman. </em>Even construing the statute broadly, there must be an offer; we cannot hold this inquiry sufficient to constitute an offer under Section 201(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">The Government focuses on the conversations, actions and interactions of Hernandez, Brown and Moran, and argues that there was abundant evidence of Hernandez\u2019 intent to bribe Drennan. However, even assuming that a jury could properly have concluded that Hernandez <em>intended </em>to offer a bribe to Drennan, an additional critical question is whether such an offer was ever actually made to Drennan. <em>United States v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>510 F.2d at 1194. The Government cannot create the offer to Drennan out of discussions between Hernandez, Moran and Brown. What is crucial is what Brown said to Drennan. The statute was not violated because Brown never conveyed an offer to Drennan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">Because the record contains insufficient evidence to show that a bribe was offered to a witness, we reverse and remand to the district court for entry of a judgment of acquittal. <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">. At the new trial in the drug case, the four officers, including Hernandez, were acquitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">. Originally the indictment also contained a charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 for corruptly endeavoring to influence a witness. That count was deleted and the Grand Jury returned a superseding indictment containing only the \u00a7 201(d) charge on April 15, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">. <em>Dixon </em>and the other cases cited construing \u00a7 201 involve \u00a7 201(b), the offense of bribing a public official. Because the language describing the substantive offense in \u00a7 201(b) is the same as that in \u00a7 201(d) involving bribery of a witness, and because the general purpose of the subsections is the same, <em>see Evans, </em>572 F.2d at 480, we look to cases construing subsection (b) for guidance in construing subsection (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
