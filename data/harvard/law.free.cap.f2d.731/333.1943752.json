The report, presented on ABC\u2019s \u201c20/20\u201d television program, inquired into allegations that Judge James Barbuto of Akron, Ohio had regularly granted leniency to criminal defendants in exchange for sex. The report included a brief, secretly recorded exchange with the plaintiff, Sandra Bod-die, an alleged participant in the scandal. The plaintiff brought suit against - ABC; Charles C. Thompson, the executive producer and chief investigative reporter for the report; and Geraldo Rivera, the senior producer and correspondent for the report. The plaintiff sought damages for defamation, false light, invasion of privacy and violation of title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 (popularly known as the Federal Wiretap Statute). Prior to trial, the district court dismissed, <em>sua sponte, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the Wiretap Statute, and at trial the jury returned a verdict for the defendants on the remaining claims. The plaintiff appeals only the dismissal of the claim under the Wiretap Statute. We reverse the court\u2019s dismissal and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">As part of an investigation into the allegations surrounding Judge Barbuto, defendants Rivera, Thompson and other investigators conducted an interview with plaintiff Boddie. Boddie consented to be interviewed by the journalists in her home, but when questioned, she refused to appear on camera. Unbeknown to Boddie, the journalists recorded the interview by using a hidden videotape camera and concealed microphones. The sound picked up by the microphones was transmitted to a receiver in a nearby van and there recorded. A segment from this interview, including the videotape and audio recording, was shown in the televised report, \u201cInjustice For All.\u201d It is undisputed that Boddie knew that the journalists were from ABC\u2019s \u201c20/20\u201d program but that she was not informed that the interview was being recorded for broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">In the first count of her complaint, Bod-die alleged that the defendants\u2019 broadcast placed her in a false light and invaded her privacy. In the second count, Boddie alleged that the defendants\u2019 report defamed her by making false statements about her personal life and her participation in the alleged leniency scheme. Following a seven-week trial the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on the claims in the first two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Boddie\u2019s third count which was, as stated, dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>before trial, charged that the defendants\u2019 surreptitious recording of the interview violated the Federal Wiretap Statute. In particular, Boddie claimed that the recording of the interview violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(l)(a), (c), (d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">(a) willfully intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire or oral communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">* :N * , i.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-16\">(c) willfully discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire or oral communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire or oral communication in violation of this subsection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-17\">(d) willfully uses, or endeavors to use, the contents of any wire or oral communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire or oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>communication in violation of this subsection:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Boddie also charged that the defendants\u2019 activities were contrary to regulations of the Federal Communications Commission that prohibit the use of electronic devices for eavesdropping without the consent of the parties engaged in the conversation, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.701, 15.4, 15.11, 15.154 (1982). Violation of these regulations, Boddie claimed, was contrary to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 which provides civil penalties for infringement of FCC regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The district judge dismissed the third count on its own motion. Stating that the \u201carea of law is one with which the Court is eminently familiar,\u201d the judge held that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action. The court ruled that the alleged violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 502 gives rise to no private cause of action. This provision, the court held, is remedial, adding that, \u201cthe only people who I have ever heard of bringing anything under Chapter 5 is the United States Government.\u201d The same reasoning, the court ruled, applies to the provisions of the Wiretap Statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, that \u201care criminal statutes which reflect the material that is included in the Communications Act in Chapter 5.\u201d Violations of the eavesdropping regulations of the FCC, the court ruled, must be remedied by an administrative action of the Commission \u201cwhich has primary jurisdiction for enforcing those regulations.\u201d The court later denied a motion to reconsider its dismissal of the third count and refused the plaintiff\u2019s request to submit to the jury evidence of the alleged violations of the FCC regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">The district court was clearly incorrect in ruling that the Federal Wiretap Statute provides no private cause of action. In the third count of her complaint, Boddie cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520 which authorizes a civil cause of action for any person \u201cwhose wire or oral communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of this chapter.\u201d The action runs against any \u201cperson who intercepts, discloses, or uses ... such communications,\u201d and the plaintiff may recover actual damages, punitive damages, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">The defendants maintain that the dismissal was, nevertheless, correct because they were privileged as parties to the conversation to record the exchange with Bod-die. The defendants also maintain that there was no unlawful interception and that Boddie had no expectation of privacy as required by statute. Boddie contends that the defendants\u2019 recording was an unlawful interception of a communication that she reasonably expected was not being intercepted. Boddie further contends that the existence of a privilege to record the interview turns on the defendants\u2019 purpose. Determination of the defendants\u2019 purpose, Boddie argues, is a question of fact reserved for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">A. Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">The Federal Wiretap Statute sets forth the privilege for a consenting party to a conversation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>given prior consent to such interception <em>unless suck communication is intercepted </em>for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State or <em>for the purpose of committing any other injurious act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d) (emphasis added). The defendants, relying on this court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>decision in <em>Smith v. Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star, </em>475 F.2d 740 (6th Cir.1973), maintain that they are entitled, as parties to the interview, to a complete privilege against the claim under the Wiretap Statute. In that case, Howard Wunker recorded a telephone conversation with Rufus Lee Smith in which Smith indicated that he could \u201cfix\u201d a divorce case. Wunker released the tape recording to the defendant newspaper which published the contents. On appeal, this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the newspaper. In an earlier decision in a separate action that was not appealed, <em>Smith v. Wunker, </em>356 F.Supp. 44 (S.D.Ohio 1972) (discussed below), the district court held that Wunker\u2019s actions had not violated the Federal Wiretap Statute. In <em>Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star, </em>this court ruled that because the recording was not obtained in violation of the statute, \u201cthe appellant cannot seek damages from the newspaper for publishing the conversation.\u201d 475 F.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Defendants in the instant case contend that <em>Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star </em>established a one-party consent privilege that is not limited by a party\u2019s purpose in recording the conversation as specified in \u00a7 2511(2)(d). In that opinion, this court did state that a \u201cparty to a conversation is privileged to record it.\u201d 475 F.2d at 741. But this statement and similar observations in that case were not necessary to the outcome which turned on the district court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith v. Wunker </em>that the recording was not unlawful. Thus, we do not find <em>Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star </em>persuasive authority for ignoring the clear language of the statute that conditions the privilege on the purpose of the intercepting party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Defendants contend, despite the language of \u00a7 2511(2)(d), that the statute reaches only eavesdropping by an unauthorized third party and that a recording by a party to a communication is therefore not an unlawful interception. This contention was the basis of the district court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith v. Wunker. </em>There the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendant, ruling that as a party to the conversation the defendant was not \u201ceavesdropping\u201d or \u201cwiretapping.\u201d 356 F.Supp. at 47. The court reached this conclusion by relying on the reasoning and eases cited in the Senate report to the bill, S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2112, 2182. The committee version of the bill provided that it would not be unlawful for a party to any oral communication or a person authorized by a party to any oral communication to intercept such a communication. The district court failed to note, however, that the bill was subsequently amended on the floor of the Senate with the provision set forth in \u00a7 2511(2)(d). The sponsor of the amendment, Senator Hart, explained that the committee\u2019s version left a \u201cgaping hole, which would permit surreptitious monitoring of a conversation by one of the parties to the conversation.\u201d The amendment, according to Senator Hart, would prohibit an interception \u201cwhen the party acts in a way with an intent to injure the other party to the conversation in any other way.\u201d 114 Cong. Rec. 14,694 (1968). The effect of the amendment is to prohibit \u201cany interception, use or disclosure of oral or wire communications with the consent of one of the parties where the purpose is to commit any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>criminal, tortious or injurious act.\u201d <em>Meredith v. Gavin, </em>446 F.2d 794, 798 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The statute does not define \u201cinjurious act.\u201d Senator Hart explained that \u00a7 2511(2)(d) prohibits a recording made \u201cfor the purpose of blackmailing the other party, threatening him, or publicly embarrassing him.\u201d 114 Cong.Rec. at 14,694. Senator Hart added that the statute permits recordings \u201cwhere the party acts out of a legitimate desire to protect himself and his own conversations from later distortions or other unlawful or injurious uses by the other party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a recording of a telephone conversation to preserve evidence of extortion directed against the recorder is lawful. <em>Moore v. Telfon Communications Corp., </em>589 F.2d 959 (9th Cir.1978). <em>See also Meredith v. Gavin, </em>446 F.2d 794 (8th Cir.1971) (Preservation of evidence to show that the plaintiff was attempting to defraud the recorder is a lawful interception.). <em>Accord, By-Prod Corp. v. Armen-Berry Co., </em>668 F.2d 956 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Because the district court in <em>Smith v. Wunker </em>failed to consider the full statutory language of \u00a7 2511(2)(d) as it was enacted, the case was wrongly decided. Our court, in <em>Cincinnati Post &amp; Times-Star, </em>considered itself bound by the prior determination that the recording was not illegal. However, the language and legislative history of the statute clearly demonstrate that the privilege is not extended if the intercepting party acted with the purpose of committing a criminal, tortious, or injurious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Defendants maintain that their purpose in recording the conversation was both lawful and proper and that the jury verdict in their favor on the tort claims precludes any further consideration of this issue. The statute, however, proscribes not only interceptions where the party acts with \u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201ctortious\u201d purpose, but where the party acts with a \u201cpurpose of committing any other injurious act.\u201d Bod-die alleged in her third count that the defendant\u2019s purpose was \u201cto cause the Plaintiff insult and injury.\u201d The defendants contend that they intended no injury to Boddie and that they acted only in good faith to preserve evidence of Judge Barbuto\u2019s allegedly illegal activities. This dispute, we believe, raises questions of fact for the jury. We cannot, on the basis of the record before us, make this determination as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">B. Expectation of Privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Defendants contend that the interview was not protected under the statute because Boddie had no expectation of privacy. The statute defines \u201coral communication\u201d as \u201cany oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2). The statute defines \u201cintercept\u201d as the \u201caural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4). The record shows that Boddie was aware that she was speaking with reporters from ABC. But it remains an issue of fact for the jury whether Bod-die had an expectation that the interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>was not being recorded and whether that expectation was justified under the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s premature dismissal of the claim prevents us from holding that, as the defendants contend, the evidence could not support such an expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The district court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the FCC regulations prohibiting eavesdropping, ruling that primary jurisdiction for the enforcement of the regulations was vested in the Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff maintains that evidence of the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of these regulations would establish the defendants\u2019 improper purpose under the Wiretap Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We agree with the defendants that the court acted properly in excluding from trial plaintiffs allegations that the defendants violated the FCC regulations. The Wiretap Statute requires the plaintiff to show that the defendants intended an illegal, tortious or injurious act other than the recording of the conversation. <em>See Stamatiou v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>400 F.Supp. 431, 436 n. 3 (N.D.Ill.1975), <em>affd mem., </em>534 F.2d 330 (7th Cir.1976). Even if we assume that the defendants, by the mere interception, violated these regulations, the question remains under \u00a7 2511(2)(d) whether the defendants intended to use the recorded conversation to injure Boddie. <em>By-Prod Corp. v. Armen-0Berry Co., </em>668 F.2d 956, 960 (7th Cir.1982). Thus, the regulations cannot serve as evidence of the defendants\u2019 purpose to commit a tortious or injurious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s third count is Reversed, and this case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">. The plaintiff\u2019s third count also included claims that the defendants had violated 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 and Ohio Ri-v.Codi; \u00a7 2933.58. The plaintiff does not contest the court\u2019s dismissal of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">. A district court should proceed with great caution when dismissing a claim <em>sua sponte. </em>The importance of this practice is demonstrated by this case. The court\u2019s refusal to consider the language of the statute, which plaintiff\u2019s counsel diligently sought to bring to its attention, is not explained by the record. The court indicated that it would supply a memorandum on this issue, but it never did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">. In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>542 F.2d 661 (6th Cir.1976), this court refused to ignore the explicit language of the statute in order to recognize an exemption for interspousal wiretaps. <em>But see Simpson v. Simpson, </em>490 F.2d 803 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 897, 95 S.Ct. 176, 42 L.Ed.2d 141 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\">. Our holding is consistent with <em>Brown v. American B'dcasting Cos., </em>704 F.2d 1296, 1305 (4th Cir. 1983). There, the defendants recorded a meeting between congressional investigators and the plaintiff with the consent of the investigators. The appeals court reversed the summary judgment for the defendants, holding that the defendants' purpose in taping and broadcasting the meeting presents a factual issue for the jury. <em>See also Benford v. American B\u2019dcasting Cos., </em>502 F.Supp. 1159, 1162-63 (D.Md.1980), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>661 F.2d 917 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1060, 102 S.Ct. 612, 70 L.Ed.2d 599 (1981) (Defendants\u2019 purpose in taping the meeting raises a genuine issue of material fact for the jury.). The determination of whether an interception was made with a purpose to commit any criminal, tortious or injurious act must be made on a \"case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>540 F.2d 319, 325 (8th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1000, 97 S.Ct. 530, 50 L.Ed.2d 611 (1976); <em>Meredith v. Gavin, </em>446 F.2d 794, 798 (8th Cir.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">. As noted in <em>Bianco v. American B\u2019dcasting Cos., </em>470 F.Supp. 182, 185 (N.D.I1I.1979), the statute requires that the plaintiff show only no expectation that the oral communication was being intercepted through the use of electronic devices. Thus, there \"may be some circumstances where a person does not have an expectation of total privacy, but still would be protected by the statute because he was not aware of the specific nature of another's invasion of his privacy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">.
