Krupansky of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio that vacated the Secretary\u2019s denial of Mrs. Kaufman\u2019s claim for Medicare benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395-1395xx (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981), provides Medicare benefits for inpatient hospital services for up to 150 days during one \u201cspell of illness,\u201d and post-hospital extended care services for up to 100 days during one \u201cspell of illness.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395d (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). The term \u201cspell of illness\u201d is defined as a period of consecutive days,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-14\">(1) beginning with the first day (not included in a previous spell of illness) (A) on which such individual is furnished inpatient hospital services or extended care services, and (B) which occurs in a month for which he is entitled to benefits under part A, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-17\">(2) ending with the close of the first period of 60 consecutive days thereafter on each of which he is neither an inpatient of a hospital nor an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(a) (1976). The issue in the present case is whether a \u201cspell of illness\u201d terminates where, following hospitalization, a Medicare claimant takes up residence in a skilled nursing facility, but receives custodial, rather than medical or therapeutic services there.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-19\">The facts of this case are not disputed. Mrs. Kaufman began residing at Menorah Park Jewish Home for the Aged, a skilled nursing facility, in April of 1969. She was hospitalized several times between April of 1969 and September of 1971, principally for psychiatric treatment. Upon each discharge from the hospital, Mrs. Kaufman returned to Menorah Park where she received custodial, as opposed to medical, care. The Secretary denied benefits to Mrs. Kaufman for the last of her stays in the hospital on the ground that the claimant had exhausted her 150 days of benefits. This decision was upheld by the Health Care Financing Administration and the Administrative Law Judge. The Administrative Law Judge agreed with the Secretary that Mrs. Kaufman\u2019s various hospital stays comprised a single \u201cspell of illness\u201d since Mrs. Kaufman on each occasion returned to Menorah Park and thus never interrupted the \u201cspell of illness\u201d for the requisite 60 day period. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(a) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-20\">Mrs. Kaufman sought review in the district court of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s determination. Judge Krupansky vacated the Secretary\u2019s decision on the ground that, since Mrs. Kaufman had received no medical or therapeutic care at Menorah Park but merely resided there, she was not an \u201cinpatient\u201d of a skilled nursing facility within the meaning of 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(a) (1976). The district court defined an inpatient as one who receives food, lodging, <em>and treatment </em>in a hospital or infirmary. <em>Kaufman v. Harris, </em>No. C80-320, slip op. at 6 (N.D.Ohio Jan. 4, 1983). Thus Mrs. Kaufman\u2019s \u201cspell of illness\u201d had terminated 60 days after she returned to Menorah Park from the hospital and the court concluded that Mrs. Kaufman was eligible for further Medicare benefits. The Secretary appeals this decision and contends that a Medicare claimant is an \u201cinpatient\u201d of a skilled nursing facility so long as he or she resides there, regardless of the level of care received.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In <em>Friedberg v. Schweiker, </em>721 F.2d 445 (3rd Cir.1983), the Third Circuit, under circumstances nearly identical to those presented in this case, rejected the Secretary\u2019s contention that so long as a Medicare claimant resides in a skilled nursing facility, the \u201cspell of illness\u201d does not terminate. The <em>Friedberg </em>panel was persuaded by the reasoning of United States District Judge Stanley S. Brotman and declined, as another district court has characterized it, \u201c[t]o woodenly apply the literal interpretation of the statute, which makes geography determinative of a person\u2019s state of health, [and] is contrary to the spirit and intent of this legislation.\u201d <em>Gerstman v. Secretary of H.E.W., </em>432 F.Supp. 636, 639 (W.D.N.Y.1977). Although <em>Friedberg </em>had not been published at the time of the lower court\u2019s decision in the present case, it is clear that Judge Krupansky found the same logic compelling in his decision to vacate the Secretary\u2019s final order. Other district courts which have considered this problem have likewise rejected the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Medicare statute. <em>E.g. Steinberg v. Schweiker, </em>549 F.Supp. 114 (S.D.N. Y.1982); <em>Levine v. Secretary of H.E.W., </em>529 F.Supp. 333 (W.D.N.Y.1981); <em>Gerstman v. Secretary of H.E.W., </em>432 F.Supp. 636 (W.D.N.Y.1977); <em>Eisman v. Mathews, </em>428 F.Supp. 877 (D.Md.1977). <em>Contra, Stoner v. Califano, </em>458 F.Supp. 781 (E.D. Mich.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Upon consideration of all of the foregoing authority, we are of the view that the opinion of Judge Brotman, appended to the decision of the Third Circuit in <em>Friedberg, </em>is persuasive both in its logic and scholarship. The Secretary\u2019s position here appears inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. We also are reluctant to conclude that Congress intended to premise the payment of Medicare benefits solely on the place a claimant chooses to reside, regardless of the level of medical care received there. If the Secretary feels aggrieved by this decision, she can of course apply for certiorari. In the meantime, our decision here maintains harmony among the circuits upon a matter which requires uniform national application. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
