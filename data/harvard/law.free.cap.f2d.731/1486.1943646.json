Wainwright, </em>725 F.2d 1282 (11th Cir. 1984). In section IV of our opinion, at 1298-99, we concluded that the contended failure of the police officer to advise Alvord of his right to have a lawyer appointed if he could not afford one would not render his statement inadmissible. Alvord argues that <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974), does not support our conclusion.<footnotemark>22a</footnotemark> In appraising this contention, we have made a further complete review of Alvord\u2019s trial, and we substitute the following for the second full paragraph of section IV of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-11\">We find both of Alvord\u2019s arguments that are directed to the adequacy and form of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings to be without merit. First, it is clear that the failure of the officer to obtain a written waiver in no way rendered the statement inadmissible. <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). Second, the record does not support Alvord\u2019s contention that the officer failed to advise him of his right to have counsel appointed if he could not afford one. The state trial court conducted a hearing, out of the presence of the jury, to determine the admissibility of the officer\u2019s testimony. There was no testimony that the officer did not give full <em>Miranda </em>warnings and advice. The officer stated at the hearing that he advised Al-vord of his rights as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-15\">Q. Okay. And did you, in fact, talk to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-16\">A. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-17\">Q. Okay. <em>Did you advise him of his rights?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-18\">A. <em>Yes, sir, I did.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-19\">Q. And what did you tell him regarding his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-20\">A. First of all I advised him that, who I was. I advised him who I was and that I was a detective with the Police Department in Lansing. I advised him that he didn\u2019t have to talk to me, that anything he said would be used in court against him. I advised him that he had to, he had a right to an attorney. He had a right to have an attorney present before he answered any questions or made any statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1543-21\">Q. All right. Did he request to have an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>A. No sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-4\">Q. Did he request to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-5\">A. No, sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-6\">Q. Did you or anyone in your presence promise him anything in order for him to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-7\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-8\">Q. Did you or anyone in your presence threaten him to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-9\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-10\">Q. Did you promise him immunity if he made a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-11\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-12\">Q. Did you coerce him in any way to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-13\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-14\">Q. Did he indicate whether or not he understood his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-15\">A. Yes, sir. he told me he was aware of his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-16\">Q. All right. And then what did you say to the defendant, Gary Alvord?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-17\">A. At this time I advised him that I wanted to talk to him about a safe job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-18\">Q. Okay. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-19\">A. Just looked at me and said, \u201cI am a rapist, not a God-damn thief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-20\">Q. And what did you say at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-21\">A. I said, \u201cWhat do you mean by that\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-22\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-23\">A. He then said, <em>\u201cI </em>am wanted in Florida for three murders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-24\">Q. And what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-25\">A. I said, \u201cI thought it was two.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-26\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-27\">A. He said, \u201cMaybe they forgot one.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-28\">Q. And what did you say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-29\">A. I looked at him and said, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-30\">Q. And what did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-31\">A. He said, \u201cThey will have to prove it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1544-34\">Q. Okay. Anything further regarding the conversation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1544-35\">At this point, the officer testified that Al-vord indicated that he had nothing more to say. There was no other testimony taken on the sufficiency of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-36\">The trial judge refused to admit any testimony as to Alvord\u2019s prior misconduct (which consisted of the officer\u2019s statement that Alvord was suspected of committing a burglary) except Alvord\u2019s comment that he was a rapist. In the presence of the jury (with the exception of the burglary testimony) the officer\u2019s testimony was in all material respects the same as his testimony at the exclusion hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-37\">In this habeas corpus proceeding, Alvord must prove his right to relief by a preponderance of the evidence. It is not the state\u2019s responsibility to prove that Alvord received the proper warnings; it is Alvord\u2019s responsibility to prove that he did not. <em>Corn v. Zant, </em>708 F.2d 549, 563 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Hill v. Linahan, </em>697 F.2d 1032, 1036 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Henson v. Estelle, </em>641 F.2d 250, 253 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1056, 102 S.Ct. 603, 70 L.Ed.2d 593 (1981). Alvord relies solely on the above excerpt as proof of his contention that the officer did not advise him of his right to have counsel appointed for him. At the evidentiary hearing in the district court, 564 F.Supp. 459, Alvord made no effort to elaborate on the officer\u2019s testimony as it appears in the state transcript.<footnotemark>22b</footnotemark> From the transcript, we conclude that Alvord failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-38\">The transcript demonstrates that the officer affirmatively testified that he advised Alvord of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See supra </em>italicized portion of transcript excerpt. Despite this affirmative testimony, Alvord seeks to establish that the officer did not properly repeat the warnings by relying on the officer\u2019s testimony that he informed Alvord of his \u201cright to have an attorney present before he answered any questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>or made any statement.\u201d Alvord relies, apparently, on the officer\u2019s failure specifically to mention that Alvord was entitled to <em>appointed </em>counsel; this does not prove that the officer did not properly inform Alvord of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">The officer testified without qualification that he gave Alvord the proper warnings. The failure of the officer to use the word \u201cappointed\u201d when reviewing the contents of those warnings does not establish that his previous testimony was incorrect or incomplete. First, the officer did not attempt to explicitly state the warnings, and he was not requested to do so. Alvord\u2019s attorney cross-examined the officer, but never attempted to establish the deficiency Alvord now asserts. He attempted to establish other deficiencies in the warning. Second, the officer\u2019s informal reference to Alvord\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to counsel certainly is a clear enough shorthand method for referring to the right to counsel regardless of ability to pay. The officer testified to an unqualified \u201cright\u201d to counsel; this is not a case, as was <em>Lathers v. United States, </em>396 F.2d 524, 533 (5th Cir.1968), in which the officer testified, \u201cwe don\u2019t furnish attorneys ... they have the prerogative to call one.\u201d Indeed, the Supreme Court, itself, has summarized the essence of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a fashion remarkably similar to that used by this officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1545-6\">\u201cIn <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>the court determined that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 prohibition against compelled self-incrimination required that custodial interrogation be preceded by advice to the putative defendant that he has the right to remain silent and also the <em>right to the presence of an attorney. </em>384 U.S. [436], at 479 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694], The Court also indicated the procedures to be followed subsequent to the warnings. If the accused indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u201cthe interrogation must cease.\u201d If he requests counsel, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 474 [86 S.Ct. at 1627].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1545-7\"><em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 481-82, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1883, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (emphasis added). The officer\u2019s summary of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which was as complete as the Court\u2019s, was adequate. Absent any caveat to his testimony that Al-vord had been given his rights, there is no proof that he was not. Alvord has thus failed to meet his burden of proving that he did <em>not </em>receive the proper warnings. With these additional observations, the petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-9\">DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-10\">No member of this panel or judge in regular service on the court having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 26), the suggestion for rehearing en banc is</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"22a\">\n<p id=\"b1543-13\">. In his petition for rehearing, Alvord points out that the Court in <em>Michigan v. Tucker </em>relied in part on the timing of Tucker's arrest. Tucker was arrested before the Court issued its decision in <em>Miranda; </em>however, because he was tried after <em>Miranda, </em>the decision applied at his trial. <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>417 U.S. at 435, 94 S.Ct. at 2359. The Court stated that the protections of <em>Miranda </em>are not constitutional, but \u201cprophylactic,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 439, 94 S.Ct. at 2361, thus causing some commentators to question the constitutional basis of the <em>Miranda </em>rule and its continuing vitality in habeas corpus proceedings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Stone, <em>The </em>Miranda <em>Doctrine in the Burger Court, </em>1977 Sup.Ct.Rev. 99, 115-25. Nevertheless, the Court also stated that \"[w]e consider it significant that the officers\u2019 failure to advise respondent of his right to appointed counsel occurred prior to the decision in <em>Miranda,\" </em>417 U.S. at 447, 94 S.Ct. at 2365, thus limiting its holding so that it does not directly govern this case. We perceive the effect of the <em>Michigan v. Tucker </em>case to be, at best, unclear; we therefore decide on rehearing to refuse to rely on that case. We need not address <em>Michigan v. Tucker's </em>applicability in this case given our present resolution of the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22b\">\n<p id=\"b1544-32\">. On cross-examination, the officer reiterated that Alvord had assured him that he understood his constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
