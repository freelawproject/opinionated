(Freixenet) appeal from two orders of the District Court in Freixenet\u2019s suit against Canals &amp; Nubiola, S.A. (C &amp; N) and others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first order denied a request for a preliminary injunction against C &amp; N\u2019s alleged trade dress infringement. The second granted C &amp; N\u2019s request for a partial summary judgment on Freixenet\u2019s rights to the use of the color black in its wine bottles. We affirm the order denying a preliminary injunction but dismiss the appeal from the order granting partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-24\">The Facts and the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b217-25\">Freixenet, S.A. manufactures a variety of Spanish wines. Freixenet U.S.A., Inc., a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary, imports those wines for distribution in the American market. Freixenet has been commercially active in this country since 1970. Its most popular wine to date has been a sparkling wine known as \u201cFreixenet Cordon Negro.\u201d Since its introduction in 1977, more than 2.5 million bottles of \u201cFreixenet Cordon Negro\u201d have been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-26\">One of the striking features of \u201cFreixe-net Cordon Negro\u201d is the design of its trade dress. While the bottle is of the standard champagne shape, its color is a frosted or matte black. The foil covering the cork is black, as is the background color on the labels. There are two labels on the bottle. The top label is a chevron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>thinly bordered in gold, with the Freixenet seal in the middle and the Freixenet name on the sides. The main label is in an un-bordered black. \u201cFreixenet\u201d and \u201cCordon Negro\u201d are prominently displayed in buffed gold lettering, the former in an elaborate script. The label identifies the wine as \u201cmethode champenoise\u201d and \u201cfermented in this bottle.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is also a gold seal on the top of the bottle. Overall, \u201cFreixenet\u201d appears five times on the face of the bottle \u2014 once on top, twice on the top label, once on the main label, and once on the punt.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">C &amp; N is also a producer of Spanish wine. C &amp; N has packaged Spanish sparkling wine in frosted black bottles since 1980. C &amp; N\u2019s bottle appears to be virtually the same as Freixenet\u2019s but the labels differ in a number of respects. The top label (or \u201cneck label\u201d) is not a chevron, but a band, which appears to wrap completely around the neck of the bottle. The label is bordered with a thick shiny gold line. Imprinted on the label is the French designation \u201cVin Brut.\u201d Halfway down the bottle a second label runs diagonally from left to right. Between thick gold borders it reads \u201cImported Sparkling Wine.\u201d The main label appears to be a third smaller than Freixenet\u2019s. The label has a circular gold seal with the C &amp; N logo in the background, and thick gold borders. The lettering is white, and the wine is clearly identified as \u201cGranvas.\u201d The background is black.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">C &amp; N argues that it sells its wine in a frosted black bottle because of \u201cthe feelings and impressions\u201d of elegance and sophistication that black evokes in a purchaser of liquor.\u201d Freixenet charges that C &amp; N uses the frosted black bottle to take advantage of Freixenet\u2019s success and to confuse customers into buying C &amp; N wine.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Freixenet\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction alleged that the C &amp; N trade dress violated its rights under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), and under the New Jersey common law of unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 18, 1983, the district court denied Freixenet\u2019s motion. The court held that Freixenet had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the \u201clabeling of the two bottles is so dissimilar as to distinguish the respective brands\u201d in the minds of the consuming public. App. at 232a. The court also ruled that Freixenet could not establish secondary meaning in its trade dress because to do so would give it \u201cexclusive rights to the marketing of Spanish sparkling wines in black bottles of standard shape.\u201d App. at 230a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">On April 18, 1983, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a partial summary judgment that \u201cas a matter of law, no party, including plaintiffs, may have a monopoly on a color including the color black ----\u201d App. at 238a. Freixenet has appealed both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">Our review of the denial of a preliminary injunction is narrow. We cannot reverse unless the trial court has committed an obvious error in applying the law or a serious mistake in considering the proof. <em>SK &amp; F Co. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, </em>625 F.2d 1055, 1066 (3d Cir. 1980); <em>A.O. Smith Corp. v. FTC, </em>530 F.2d 515, 525 (3d Cir.1976). To obtain a prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>nary injunction, a party must demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of eventual success on the merits as well as a probability of irreparable injury if relief is not granted. The trial court must also consider the likely consequences of the decision on other parties and the overall public interest. <em>See generally Kershner v. Mazurkiewicz, </em>670 F.2d 440, 443 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc., </em>630 F.2d 120, 136 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1014, 101 S.Ct. 573, 66 L.Ed.2d 473 (1980); <em>Constructors Ass\u2019n of Western Pa. v. Kreps, </em>573 F.2d 811, 815 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A. Likelihood of Success on Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Freixenet alleges that C &amp; N\u2019s conduct violates both the New Jersey common law of unfair competition and \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A finding that C &amp; N infringed a protected trade dress requires a demonstration that Cordon Negro\u2019s trade dress was non-functional, that it had acquired secondary meaning, and that it was likely to be confused with C &amp; N\u2019s product by members of the consuming public. The district court ruled that a frosted black champagne bottle was not a functional feature, and since C &amp; N prevailed on other grounds it has not appealed. <em>See Keene Corp. v. Paraflex Industries, Inc., </em>653 F.2d 822, 824 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Ives Labs, Inc. v. Darby Drug Co., </em>601 F.2d 631, 642 (2d Cir.1979), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>456 U.S. 844, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982); <em>Mogen David Wine Corp., </em>328 F.2d 925 (C.C. P.A.1964); <em>Le Sportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, Inc., </em>478 F.Supp. 602 (S.D.N.Y. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The dispositive issue is the possibility of consumer confusion as to source. Regardless of how much secondary meaning it possesses, a product\u2019s trade dress will not be protected from an imitator that is sufficiently different in its features to avoid such confusion. <em>See, e.g., Le Sportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, Inc., </em>478 F.Supp. 602 (S.D.N.Y.1979). In the instant case the district court found that the labels of plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 sparkling wine bottles were so dissimilar that consumers were not likely to confuse the two. Freixenet argues that the district court \u201cnever properly addressed the issue____\u201d (Appellants\u2019 br. at 32). The court\u2019s opinion denying the preliminary injunction discloses otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">Plaintiffs have ... failed to adequately demonstrate that wine customers will confusedly buy defendants\u2019 product in lieu of its own. Plaintiffs bluntly submit that \u201clikelihood of confusion is independently established by a simple visual comparison of the Canals &amp; Nubiola frosted black bottle with the FREIXE-NET frosted black bottle ____\u201d I find that a simple visual comparison \u201cestablishes quite the opposite: the labeling of the two bottles is so dissimilar as to distinguish the respective brands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 contention that some wine buyers fail to even glance at labels, but merely ask liquor store owners to find them the \u201cwine in the black frosted bottle\u201d is insufficiently substantiated (especially in view of defendants\u2019 conflicting affidavits) to support a finding of irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">App. at 231a. Thus the court clearly held that the labels of the two bottles were so dissimilar as to rule out any possibility of confusion. Our own analysis of the evidence in this record leads us to conclude that the court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">Freixenet also argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard. It contends that six separate criteria should have been considered, including intent of the defendant, similarity of the products, retail outlets and purchasers, and evidence of actual confusion (Appellants\u2019 br. at 34-35). All these elements are helpful in arriving at a finding as to the likelihood of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>confusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it should not be necessary to consider all six when some are dispositive. <em>See, e.g., Le Sportsac, Inc. v. Dockside Research, supra, </em>478 F.Supp. at 609. In the instant ease the district court found (for the limited purposes of a preliminary injunction motion) that the differences in the labels were too great to support a finding of likelihood of confusion. It <em>also </em>considered Freixenet\u2019s evidence of actual confusion and found it insufficiently credible to overcome C &amp; N\u2019s conflicting affidavits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s finding that the appellants\u2019 evidence did not demonstrate probability of consumer confusion is not clearly erroneous and its conclusion that there was consequently no likelihood of success on the merits is supported on this record. This is a conclusion sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction. We express no opinion as to the final merits of Freixenet\u2019s claim of consumer confusion should it make a different and more extensive record at final hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">C &amp; N\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment asked for a determination that \u201cas a matter of law, no party, including plaintiffs, may have a monopoly on a color including the color black____\u201d The grant of partial summary judgment is not a final judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and hence is not appealable. <em>See Richerson v. Jones, </em>551 F.2d 918, 921-22 (3d Cir.1977). Freixenet contends, however, that the court\u2019s ruling went beyond C &amp; N\u2019s motion. Relying on its findings in the preliminary injunction opinion, the court held that \u201cas a matter of law ... plaintiffs\u2019 trade dress cannot acquire a secondary meaning protectable from copying and ... defendant\u2019s trade dress does not infringe on plaintiff\u2019s rights or constitute unfair competition.\u201d App. at 237a. Freixenet urges that while couched in terms of a grant of partial summary judgment, the decision in fact completely forecloses any further proceedings on its claim, and should be treated as a final judgment. See <em>Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">To establish secondary meaning, \u201ca manufacturer must show that, in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\u201d <em>Inwood Laboratories v. Ives Laboratories, </em>456 U.S. 844, 851 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 2182, n. 11, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982); <em>Ideal Toy Co. v. Plawner Toy Mfg. Corp., </em>685 F.2d 78, 82 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co., </em>294 F.2d 694, 697 (2d Cir.1961). In determining the existence of secondary meaning the court \u201cmay consider factors such as length of use, buyer association, extent of sales and advertising, and the fact of copying.\u201d <em>Ideal Toy Corp. v. Plawner Toy Mfg. Corp., supra, </em>685 F.2d at 82; <em>Faberge, Inc. v. Saxony Products, Inc., </em>605 F.2d 426, 428 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Locatelli, Inc. v. Tomaiuoli, </em>129 F.Supp. 630, 634 (D.N.J.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">In this instance the district court, according to Freixenet, appears to have merged the issue of secondary meaning with the issue of similarity of dress. The problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>arises from its attempt \u201cto determine exactly which features constitute the \u2018distinctive\u2019 aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 packaging.\u201d App. at 229a. It agreed with Freixenet that the product had to be considered as a whole, but found that the labels of the two wines were so dissimilar \u201cthat their inclusion in the trade dress would actually work to the plaintiffs\u2019 disadvantage. In addition, there is nothing remotely unique about plaintiffs\u2019 bottle configuration.\u201d App. at 229a. Accordingly, the court found that there were only three aspects of Freixe-net\u2019s product presentation that could arguably constitute a distinctive trade dress\u2014 bottle color, color of the foil cork, and the frosted surface treatment. These elements were found to be non-protectable since colors are not protectable.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Such an approach elides the difference between secondary meaning and consumer confusion. Freixenet can credibly allege that its total package \u2014 including labels\u2014 has acquired secondary meaning. That is, it is possible that consumers associate black frosted champagne bottles adorned with black foil and black, borderless labels containing buffed gold lettering and an elaborate FREIXENET script, with Freixe-net itself. This is a different issue than the issue of whether or not C &amp; N\u2019s label is so dissimilar from Freixenet\u2019s as to obviate any possibility of consumer confusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Since, however, the motion for summary judgment was addressed to the use of a black bottle, we do not understand the court to have foreclosed a showing that its overall trade dress has acquired a secondary meaning protectable from copying. The appellant is free to present further evidence of both consumer confusion by the two brands and that of a secondary meaning attached to Cordon Negro\u2019s composite trade dress. That being so, we reject Freixenet\u2019s contention that we should treat the partial summary judgment as if it disposed of the entire case, and will dismiss the appeal from the grant of partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">We will affirm the denial of a preliminary injunction. We will dismiss the appeal from the grant of partial summary judgment that Freixenet cannot acquire a monopoly in the use of a black bottle, but not otherwise.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-27\">.
