The Bank contends that the district court possessed no authority under section 108(b) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, the governing statute in this case, to extend the period of redemption. We agree with the Bank and reverse that part of the district court\u2019s order granting the Martinsons additional time to redeem their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-30\">In late 1980, the Bank obtained a judgment of foreclosure upon real estate that the Martinsons had mortgaged to secure repayment of a loan. On February 17, 1981, the Bank purchased the real estate at the foreclosure sale, in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>North Dakota foreclosure procedures. Under North Dakota law, the Martinsons retained a statutory right to redeem their property within one year, or by February 17, 1982. <em>See </em>N.D.Cent.Code \u00a7\u00a7 28-23-11, 28-24-01 to 28-24-02 (1974). On October 17, 1981, when four months remained on the period for redemption, the Martinsons filed a petition in bankruptcy under chapter 11. The Martinsons did not redeem their property within those four months, but on December 4, 1981, with seventy-five days remaining on the statutory period of redemption, they petitioned the bankruptcy court to restrain the Bank from obtaining full title to the mortgaged property at the expiration of the redemption period. On March 12, 1982, several weeks after the period of redemption had passed, the bankruptcy court granted the Martinsons relief, ruling that the Bankruptcy Reform Act\u2019s automatic stay provision, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), operated to suspend the running of the redemption period as of October 17, 1981, the day the chapter 11 petition had been filed. The Bank appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">On January 12, 1983, the district court reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Rejecting the application of the automatic stay provision, the district court ruled that section 108(b) of the Act governed the suspension of the time in which the Martinsons could exercise their right of redemption. <em>See Johnson v. First National Bank, </em>719 F.2d 270, 277-78 (8th Cir. 1983). Section 108(b) provides that when the debtor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">may file any pleading, demand, notice, or proof of claim or loss, cure a default, or perform any other similar act, and such period has not expired before the date of the filing of the petition, the trustee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may only file, cure, or perform, as the case may be, before the later of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">2) 60 days after the order for relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUmC\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Because the statutory redemption period expired more than sixty days after the filing of the petition for bankruptcy, the district court ruled that \u201c[t]he time provided by section 108 for extension under the circumstances of this case is the end of the one year redemption period, <em>including any suspension that has occurred on or after the filing of the Chapter 11 petition.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) After observing that seventy-five days remained in the redemption period when the Martinsons sought an order restraining the Bank from obtaining full title to their property (December 4, 1981 to February 17, 1982), the district court allowed the Martinsons seventy-five days from the date of its order, or until March 28, 1983, to exercise their right of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Nothing in the language of section 108(b) authorized the district court to extend the redemption period in this case. Section 108(b) provides in mandatory terms that when the period in which the debtor may \u201ccure a default\u201d has not expired as of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the trustee or debtor \u201cmay only\u201d cure the default \u201cbefore the later of 1) the end of such period, including any suspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case; and 2) 60 days after the order for relief.\u201d Because the statutory redemption period expired on February 17, 1982, more than sixty days after the filing of the petition for bankruptcy, section 108(b) permitted the Martinsons only until that date to redeem their property. Although section 108(b)(1) provides for the extension of the period of redemption when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>there has been a \u201csuspension of such period occurring on or after the commencement of the case,\u201d the redemption period was not suspended on December 4, 1981, when the Martinsons filed a complaint requesting an order restraining the Bank from obtaining full title to the property. Because the bankruptcy court\u2019s order suspending the redemption period came after the expiration of the redemption period, the suspension language of section 108(b)(1) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the Martin-sons\u2019 right to redeem their property expired on February 17, 1982, and that the district court erred in allowing them additional time to exercise a right of redemption. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the district court\u2019s January 12, 1983 order granting the Martinsons until March 28, 1983 to redeem their property, and direct the district court to enter an order consistent with this opinion which establishes that the Martinsons\u2019 right to redeem terminated on February 17, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-20\">.
