Greenwood (Billy), a minor, by and through his parents, John and Freda Greenwood (Greenwoods) appeals from an adverse jury verdict and related judgment in a products liability action predicated upon strict liability. Jurisdiction rests upon diversity of citizenship. The facts will be discussed only insofar as relevant for purposes of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">On May 25, 1976, Jeff Morris, thirteen years of age, was mowing the Morris yard, pursuant to his father\u2019s instructions, on a riding mower manufactured by appellee, McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. (McDo-nough). Jeff had previously operated the mower approximately thirty hours over a three to four year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">On this particular day, Troy Greenwood, Billy\u2019s older brother, was riding on the mower with Jeff. The Morrises and Green-woods were next door neighbors. While operating the mower, Jeff watched the left front wheel to make certain that he was getting an even cut. Jeff was aware that Billy, two years of age, and several other children, were playing at and around a swing set in the back yard, approximately twenty-five feet from the area where he was mowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">While Jeff was mowing the yard, Billy, undetected by Jeff, approached the mower to pick up a doll in the path of the mower. Immediately prior to the accident, Jeff, upon realizing that Billy was in the path of the mower, shouted \u201cwatch out!\u201d Fearing that he could not stop before hitting Billy, Jeff turned the mower to the right to avoid hitting Billy. During the course of the turn, the left front tire of the mower went over Billy\u2019s left foot. Billy subsequently kicked at the mower with his right foot but both feet went under the mower where they contacted the mower blade, resulting in the loss of both feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">At the time of the accident, Freda Greenwood was in her home doing housework. Although she was aware that Troy and Billy were playing in the Morris\u2019 yard, she was unaware that Jeff was mowing the yard until Troy notified her \u00f3f the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Within their complaint, the Greenwoods alleged that (1) the mower was of defective design and workmanship, and negligently constructed (2) the defects of the mower were hidden and latent and could not be discovered by general observation or superficial examination (3) the defects were due to McDonough\u2019s negligence (4) the mower was not fit for its intended purpose (5) Billy sustained permanent disability and (6) that, as Billy\u2019s parents, they sustained severe emotional shock and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Within its answer, McDonough denied that the mower was negligently or improperly designed or that it was unfit for its intended use. McDonough also alleged that the combined negligence of Ira Morris, as the owner of the mower, and Jeff Morris, as the operator of the mower, and that of John and Freda Greenwood, caused the injuries and damages to Billy.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Following several pretrial motions, the case proceeded to trial on the basis of strict liability. The Greenwoods alleged that the mower was defective because (1) the blade was below the deck of the mower (2) the blade bar, as manufactured, was not within McDonough\u2019s manufacturing tolerances thus causing the blade level to be below the deck, aggravating the injury to the left foot (3) the blade was improperly designed (4) the blade brake-clutch was defectively designed in its failure to provide a deadman control for stopping and (5) the blade brake-clutch was defectively designed in durability.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The trial extended over a three-week period. The parties presented substantial evidence supportive of their respective contentions. McDonough\u2019s defense throughout trial was that the mower was not negligently designed and that the combined negligence of the Morris\u2019 and Greenwood\u2019s gave rise to the accident and injuries sustained by Billy. The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury included Instruction No. 8 on strict liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">Even though you'may find and believe that the defendant exercised all possible care with regard to the product, under the strict liability theory defendant is legally at fault and therefore liable for plaintiff\u2019s injuries if the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous when it left defendant\u2019s control and the defective condition caused, in whole or in part, plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">A defendant may be liable under the strict liability theory if the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous and the defective condition caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries even though plaintiff did not buy the machine or enter into any contractual relation with defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">(R., Vol. II at p. 296).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The jury, in accordance with the law of Kansas, was allowed to compare the fault of McDonough, Jeffrey Morris, Ira Morris, and Freda Greenwood. The jury returned a verdict finding McDonough, 0% negligent, Jeffrey Morris, 20% negligent, Ira Morris, 45% negligent, and Freda Greenwood, 35% negligent. The jury also assessed damages at $0.00. Upon being instructed by the trial court that inasmuch as Billy had lost both feet he had definitely suffered some damages, the jury reconvened for further deliberations, and found that Billy had been damaged in the amount of $375,000.00. The district court thereafter entered judgment that Billy take nothing, that the action be dismissed on the merits, and that McDonough recover its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">On appeal, the Greenwoods contend the trial court erred, <em>inter alia, </em>in (1) denying their motion to approach the jurors and in denying leave to subpoena the jurors to give testimony at the hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial, and (2) in admitting McDonough\u2019s expert testimony that the blade bar was not that shipped with the machine, inasmuch as McDonough failed to provide said information in interrogatory responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">The Greenwoods contend the district court erred in denying their motion to approach the jurors and in denying leave to subpoena the jurors to give testimony at the hearing on their motion for a new trial. The Greenwoods also contend they are entitled to a new trial for juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">The judgment against Billy and in favor of McDonough was entered on April 25, 1980. On April 29, 1980, the Greenwoods filed a motion to approach the jurors contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">In support of this Motion, plaintiff shows to the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>5. That plaintiffs are of recent information and belief that the jury foreman\u2019s, Mr. Payton, son may have been injured at one time, which fact Mr. Pay-ton did not state in response to juror voir dire questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">(R., Vol. II at p. 325).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">During his voir dire, counsel for the Greenwoods related:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Now the judge asked you about facts of the accident. There were several newspaper articles about four years ago. This accident occurred at Cullen Village out just south of town and involved loss of both feet to young Mr. Billy Greenwood ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">(R., Vol. XXI at p. 37).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Thereafter, the district court, in its voir dire, asked the prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">Now, how many of you have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained any severe injury, not necessarily as severe as Billy, but sustained any injuries whether it was an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that resulted in any disability or prolonged pain or suffering, that is you or any members of your immediate family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">(R., Vol. XXI at p. 39).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">One juror answered affirmatively, and after additional questioning by the Green-woods\u2019 attorney as to his impartiality, was allowed to remain on the jury. Payton did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">On April 30, 1980, the district court entered a memorandum and order denying the Greenwoods\u2019 motion to approach the jurors. The district court summarized its denial of the Greenwoods\u2019 motion by observing that interviews of jurors by persons connected with a case are not favored except in extreme situations, <em>citing to Stein v. New York, </em>346 U.S. 156, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953); <em>McDonald v. Pless, </em>238 U.S. 264, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915). The district court also adopted, by appending, <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>No. CIV-0888 (W.D.Okla. June 20, 1979), declaring it \u201ccontrolling here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">On May 1, 1980, the Greenwoods filed a second motion to approach the jurors, alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-14\">Counsel for plaintiff shows to the court that to our best recollection and belief, Juror Payton did not answer counsel\u2019s question in the affirmative as to whether he or any member of his immediate family had ever been seriously injured. The Affidavit of John G. Greenwood attached affirms that Juror Pay-ton\u2019s son was seriously injured in a truck tire explosion. Had voir dire questions been answered truthfully, further examination may have revealed grounds to challenge Juror Payton for cause, or affected counsel\u2019s decisions with respect to peremptory challenges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-15\">(R., Vol. II at p. 345).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">On May 5, 1980, the district court entered an order granting, in p\u00e1rt, the Green-woods\u2019 second motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-17\">Upon due consideration, but cognizant of the parties\u2019 need for a speedy ruling, the Court, in an abundance of caution, has determined to grant the motion in a limited degree. The motion will be generally overruled with the exception that counsel for plaintiff will be allowed to inquire of juror Ronald Payton regarding alleged injuries sustained by his son from the explosion of a truck tire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-18\">The inquiry should, of course, be brief and polite. Defense counsel must be present. The witness should not be unnecessarily inconvenienced. The inquiry should be undertaken telephonically or at a place convenient to the juror. The juror should not be summoned to Topeka solely for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-19\">Counsel should be informed that the Court\u2019s review of the court reporter\u2019s notes of voir dire indicates that plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s question should have elicited a response from the juror only if (1) his son was in an accident as alleged <em>and </em>(2) the son sustained a disability or suffered prolonged pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-20\">(R., Vol. II at p. 348).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-21\">Counsel for the Greenwoods and McDo-nough subsequently arranged for a confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ence cali interview with juror Payton. During the course of the interview, which was not preserved as part of the record, juror Payton related that his son had received a broken leg as the result of an exploding tire. According to counsel for the Greenwoods, Payton related that \u201cit did not make any difference whether his son had been in an accident and was seriously injured\u201d, \u201cthat having accidents are a part of life\u201d, and that \u201call his children have been involved in accidents.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to McDonough\u2019s counsel, Payton \u201cdid not regard it [son\u2019s broken leg] as a \u2018severe\u2019 injury and, as he understood the question, did not result in any \u2018disability or prolonged pain and suffering\u2019. As far as Mr. Payton is concerned he answered counsel\u2019s question honestly, and correctly, by remaining silent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing in the record reflects that the Greenwoods made any effort to record or preserve the interview. Having moved for the interview with Pay-ton, the Greenwoods\u2019 counsel was responsible for preserving a proper record for the trial court\u2019s consideration and for our review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Both parties cited <em>Photostat Corporation v. Ball, </em>338 F.2d 783 (10th Cir.1964) in support of their respective positions that Payton\u2019s failure to relate his son\u2019s accident during voir dire did, or did not, prejudice the Greenwoods\u2019 right of peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In <em>Photostat, </em>we held that when four prospective jurors in a negligence case arising out of an automobile accident withheld information as to their personal involvement in accidents with resultant claims, for which they were paid, a defendant was entitled to a new trial because of the prejudice to his right of peremptory challenge, even assuming that the jurors had good intentions and were not disqualified for cause. Within <em>Photostat </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">We have said that a \u201cjuror\u2019s answer to questions touching his state of mind is primary evidence of' his competency\u201d, and in case of doubt, justice demands that the challenge for cause be allowed. <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>10 Cir., 158 F.2d 417, 421. In <em>Consolidated Gas and Equipment Company of America v. Carver, </em>10 Cir., 257 F.2d 111, we recognized the burden on the complaining litigant in a post-verdict hearing to show that failure of a juror to fully and truthfully answer questions propounded to the panel concerning his experience in similar litigation resulted in prejudice to his cause. We embraced the settled rule which moves the court to act only upon a showing of probable bias of the juror with consequent prejudice to the unsuccessful litigant. Courts act on probabilities, not possibilities, and if the suppressed information is so \u201cinsignificant or trifling\u201d as to indicate only a remote or speculative influence on the juror, the right of peremptory challenge has not been affected. See also <em>Crutcher v. Hicks </em>(Ky.), 257 S.W.2d 539, 38 A.L.R.2d 620.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">The prospective juror in <em>Consolidated Gas and Equipment Company of America v. Carver, </em>supra, was then a plaintiff in a state court suit for actual and exemplary damages. And, the suit in which he was a plaintiff and the one in which he was a prospective juror \u201cbore marks of similarity\u201d. In these circumstances we were of the view that if the juror had disclosed the pendency of his action in the state.court, he would have been excused for cause, and if not for cause, the defendant would have exercised one of his peremptory challenges; that <em>\u201c[wjhether so intended or not, the effect of the silence of the juror was to deceive and mislead the court and the litigants in respect to his competency. </em>And such deception and misleading had the effect of nullifying the right of peremptory challenge as completely as though the court had wrongfully denied such right.\u201d Id. p. 115.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">In this post-mortem inquiry, we cannot know of course what counsel would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>done with the suppressed information. Nor can we take his post-mortem word for it. <em>But we need not presume to speculate on the judgment he would have made. It is enough, we think, to show probable bias of the jurors and prejudice to the unsuccessful litigant if the suppressed information was of sufficient cogency and significance to cause us to believe that counsel was entitled to know of it when he came to exercise his right of peremptory challenge. </em>If so, the suppression was a prejudicial impairment of his right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Id. at 786-87, (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Under <em>Photostat, </em>the failure of a juror to fully and truthfully answer questions propounded to the panel is deemed reversible error upon a showing of probable bias of the juror with consequential prejudice to the unsuccessful litigant. Insignificant or trifling suppressed information indicative only of a remote or speculative influence on the juror is not deemed prejudicial. Suppressed information is accordingly actionable only if it is of \u201csufficient cogency and significance\u201d to cause us to believe that counsel was entitled to know of it when he came to exercise his right of peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In our prior opinion in this case, 10th Cir., 687 F.2d 338, the panel majority held (Barrett, Circuit Judge, dissenting) that under the <em>Photostat </em>standards, juror Pay-ton\u2019s failure to answer the question posed on voir dire prejudiced the Greenwoods\u2019 right to peremptory challenge, thus necessitating a new trial. The majority, in reversing and remanding, reasoned that (1) the unrevealed information was of \u201csufficient cogency and significance\u201d that the Green-woods\u2019 counsel was entitled to know of it in deciding how to use his peremptory challenges, (2) the test is an objective one, (3) the unrevealed information indicated probable bias of juror Payton because it revealed a particularly narrow concept of what constitutes a serious injury, (4) the prejudice to the Greenwoods was exacerbated by the fact that Mr. Payton became the jury foreman, (5) good faith on juror Payton\u2019s part in not intentionally concealing the information is irrelevant, and (6) if an average prospective juror would have disclosed the information, and that information would have been significant and cogent evidence of the juror\u2019s probable bias, a new trial is required to rectify the failure to disclose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">The United States Supreme Court granted McDonough\u2019s petition for writ of certio-rari; the Court thereafter reversed the opinion of this court. <em>See McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 845, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984). Mr. Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, Powell, Stevens and O\u2019Connor joined. Mr. Justice Blackmun filed a concurring opinion, in which Justices Stevens and O\u2019Con-nor joined. Mr. Justice Brennan filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Marshall joined. The opinion of the Court read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">This Court has long held that \u201c \u2018[a litigant] is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one,\u2019 for there are no perfect trials.\u201d (citations omitted.) Trials are costly, not only for the parties, but also for the jurors performing their civic duty and for society which pays the judges and support personnel who manage the trials. It seems doubtful that our judicial system would have the resources to provide litigants with perfect trials, were they possible, and still keep abreast of its constantly increasing case load. Even this straightforward products liability suit extended over a three-week period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">We have also come a long way from the time when all trial error was presumed prejudicial and reviewing courts were considered \u201ccitadels of technicality.\u201d <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 759 [66 S.Ct. 1239, 1245, 90 L.Ed. 1557] (1946) ____ The harmless error rules adopted by this Court and Congress embody the principle that courts should exercise judgment in preference to the automatic reversal for \u201cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ror\u201d and ignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">&amp; sj. S-S !}: !}S ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">The critical question posed to juror Payton in this case asked about \u201cinjuries ... that resulted in any disability or prolonged pain or suffering ____\u201d Juror Payton apparently believed that his son\u2019s broken leg sustained as a result of an exploding tire was not such an injury. In response to a similar question from petitioner\u2019s counsel, however, another juror related such a minor incident as the fact that his six-year-old son once caught his finger in a bike chain____ Yet another juror failed to respond to the question posed to juror Payton, and only the subsequent questioning of petitioner\u2019s counsel brought out that her husband had been injured in a machinery accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">The varied responses to respondents\u2019 question on <em>voir dire </em>testify to the fact that jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror\u2019s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection that our judicial system can be expected to give. A trial represents an important investment of private and social resources, and it ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have obtained from a juror on <em>voir dire </em>examination. Whatever the merits of the Court of Appeals\u2019 standard in a world which would redo and reconstruct what had gone before upon any evidence of abstract imperfection, we think it is contrary to the practical necessities of judicial management reflected in Rule 61 [Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 61] and \u00a7 2111 [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111]. We hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire, </em>and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror\u2019s impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7S\"><em>Id. </em>at---, 104 S.Ct. at 848-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">The Greenwoods contend that the trial court erred in allowing McDonough\u2019s expert, Jackson, to testify at trial that the blade bar on the mower at the time he inspected it was not the blade bar that was shipped on the mower.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">During the course of discovery, the Greenwoods deposed Harold P. Jackson, Chief Engineer and Director of Research Development for McDonough, giving rise to the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">Q I will say it the other way around. Was the machine in substantially the same condition as it left the factory, to the best of your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-15\">A (Jackson) To the best of my knowledge. The only thing that I saw, it looked as if the right side of the deck \u2014 this is the opposite side from where the accident happened \u2014 had been hit against something and sprung out of shape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-16\">(R., Vol. V at p. 78).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">Jackson subsequently testified at trial, over the Greenwoods\u2019 objection, that the blade bar on the machine at the time he inspected it after the accident was \u201cnot the blade bar that was shipped with the machine.\u201d (R., Vol. XXIII at p. 1444).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">The Greenwoods contend that the admission of such testimony during the course of the trial gave rise to reversible error pursuant to <em>Smith v. Ford Motor Company, </em>626 F.2d 784 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 1363, 67 L.Ed.2d 344 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">The plaintiff\u2019s injuries in <em>Smith </em>were the result of an automobile accident. In <em>Smith </em>we held that when a party relates within a pretrial discovery order that one of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>expert witnesses, a doctor, will testify exclusively to his treatment of a patient and his prognosis, it is prejudicial error to permit the doctor to testify at trial relative to the proximate cause between the automobile seat belts employed and certain injuries sustained. In <em>Smith, </em>the only causative evidence presented to the jury relative to the plaintiffs injuries, beyond the stipulated occurrence of the accident, was the doctor\u2019s challenged testimony that certain injuries occurred because the seat belt was not functioning properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Specifically, the doctor in <em>Smith, </em>in response to the question as to what caused the injuries to the spleen and pancreas, testified \u201cthat the probability is overwhelming that the injury to the pancreas resulted from the automobile accident and specifically, the evidence is good that the seat belt was involved in that injury.\u201d 626 F.2d at p. 790. We held that this testimony, admitted over objection, gave rise to reversible error inasmuch as it was presented by a doctor who was listed in the pretrial disclosure order as an expert who would testify <em>only </em>to treatment and prognosis. Ford Motor had previously deposed three other doctors, all witnesses of Smith, relative to treatment and prognosis. Accordingly, we concluded that the admission of his testimony relative to causation (as distinguishable from treatment and prognosis) constituted such surprise as to rise to prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We do not believe that <em>Smith </em>applies here. During Jackson\u2019s deposition he stated that the blade on the mower at the time he inspected it had a blade travel lower than that of the original manufacture. He did not state that the blade bar on the mower was not the blade bar shipped with the mower. During trial, Jackson testified that the blade bar on the mower at the time he inspected it, although of McDonough manufacture, was not the blade bar shipped with the mower. He also stated that he was told that the blade bar on the mower at the time he inspected it was the blade bar on the mower at the time of the accident. Jackson did not testify that the different blade bar caused the blade travel to be lower than that of original manufacture, nor did he retract from his deposition statement that the mower blade had a blade travel lower than that of original manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Jackson was, accordingly, consistent in his testimony that the blade had a blade travel lower than that of the original manufacture. This testimony was supportive of the Greenwoods\u2019 position. Under these circumstances, Jackson\u2019s trial testimony that the blade bar on the mower was not the one shipped with the machine can not be deemed prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Although counsel for the Greenwoods objected and alleged surprise when Jackson testified that the blade bar was not the one shipped with the mower, there has been a failure to establish that Jackson\u2019s testimony was prejudicial. The Greenwoods did not move for a continuance nor have they displayed the manner in which Jackson\u2019s observation prejudiced them or what steps they may have pursued to cure the alleged prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">As set forth, <em>supra, </em>the district court instructed the jury that McDonough would be liable for Billy\u2019s injuries if the mower was defective and unreasonably dangerous when it left McDonough\u2019s control and if the defective condition caused, in whole or in part, Billy\u2019s injuries. The court\u2019s instructions are in accord with our prior decisions. <em>See Barber v. General Electric Company, </em>648 F.2d 1272 (10th Cir.1981); <em>Fabian v. E.W. Bliss Company, </em>582 F.2d 1257 (10th Cir.1978); <em>Bruce v. Martin-Marietta Corporation, </em>544 F.2d 442 (10th Cir. 1976); <em>Symons v. Mueller Company, </em>526 F.2d 13 (10th Cir.1975); <em>Sterner Aero AB v. Page Airmotive, Inc., </em>499 F.2d 709 (10th Cir.1974). The Greenwoods failed to establish McDonough\u2019s liability. Thus, we hold the contention that Jackson\u2019s trial testimony gave rise to reversible error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Billy\u2019s injuries were caused when his feet moved under the mower shell and contacted the mower blades. The cause of the accident, <em>i.e., </em>contact with the mower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>blades, is not in dispute. The Greenwoods do not contend that Billy would not have been injured if a different blade bar had been on the mower. Rather, they contend, and possibly correctly, that the blade bar on the mower at the time of the accident aggravated Billy\u2019s injuries. However, this is of no moment, when, as here, the Green-woods failed to establish that McDonough was strictly liable for the injuries received in the accident, even though Jackson consistently testified that the blade on the mower had a blade travel lower than that of original manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">We have considered Greenwoods\u2019 remaining allegations of error and find them individually and collectively without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AX5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-10\">. Appellants\u2019 brief at p. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-14\">.

The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror\u2019s impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-9\"><em>McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 845, 850, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Counsel conceded that \u201c[a]s far as Mr. Payton is concerned he answered counsel\u2019s question honestly, and correctly, by remaining silent.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 18. That ends the matter. The first leg of the test was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The surprise testimony of defendant\u2019s expert witness, Mr. Jackson, was certainly not irrelevant to the question of whether the lowered blade aggravated the injury or who was responsible for the blade being in that condition. The question on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that evidence when it had not been included in discovery responses or in the pretrial order. Taken in context with plaintiff\u2019s failure to seek a continuance or other remedy to respond to the evidence, the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">While the challenged testimony by Mr. Jackson appears to contradict Mr. Jackson\u2019s deposition statement that the machine was in the same condition as when it left the factory, the harm might have been cured by impeachment. It was no surprise that Mr. Jackson\u2019s testimony would relate to the condition of the machine when it left the manufacturer. Under the circumstances, the failure to exclude the evidence as the sole remedy was not an abuse of discretion. While <em>Smith v. Ford Motor Co., </em>626 F.2d 784 (10th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 918, 101 S.Ct. 1363, 67 L.Ed.2d 344 (1981), is similar, it is not so close as to be controlling. The shift in subject matter, as opposed to detail, is the factor which distinguished that case from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">None of the other issues raised on appeal is individually or collectively of enough merit to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
