No. 95-250, \u00a7\u00a7 201-213, 92 Stat. 163, 172-82;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 201(6). He now seeks benefits under the Redwood Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-5\">A discharge, even for cause, may qualify an employee for benefits under \u00a7 201(12) of the Redwood Act, which defines \u201ctotal layoff\u201d as \u201ca calendar week during which affected employers have made no work available to a covered employee.\u201d Martin argues that an employer \u201cmakes no work available\u201d to an employee when the latter does not simply quit but is affirmatively discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-6\">The Secretary, however, denies that a discharge for cause is a layoff. Our analysis does not turn on whose reading of the statute we find more reasonable. Instead, \u00a7 213(f) of the Redwood Act commands us to. accept the interpretation offered which most favors the class of employees as a whole, as long as that interpretation is reasonable. <em>Barker v. Donovan, </em>721 F.2d 271, 273 n. 1 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Bradford v. Donovan, </em>695 F.2d 409, 410 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Drapich v. Donovan, </em>693 F.2d 1296, 1298 n. 3 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"A5rv\">Here, Martin\u2019s interpretation that \u201clayoff\u201d encompasses the employer\u2019s affirmative act of discharging him is reasonable. This interpretation does not, however, make the Redwood Act a windfall for every employee discharged for cause, since other sections of the statute also restrict eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-8\">Redwood Act \u00a7 203 provides that a layoff of an affected employee between May 31, 1977 and September 30, 1980 is conclusively presumed to be due to park expansion. The presumption, however, arises only if the employee was not laid off \u201cfor a cause that would disqualify employee for unemployment compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, under Redwood Act \u00a7 205, an affected employee is only eligible for benefits if the layoff was of a kind that also creates eligibility under the California Unemployment Insurance Code. \u00a7 205(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-11\">Martin was initially determined ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits because he was discharged for misconduct. He was informed he could appeal this determination to an administrative law judge, but did not. The notice to Martin did not warn that failure to appeal might bar a challenge to a later finding of ineligibility for Redwood benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-12\">The Secretary suggests that the state determination of discharge for misconduct concludes Martin\u2019s rights on this appeal. Administrative res judicata, however, is not applied with rigidity. Its application must be \u201ctempered by fairness and equity.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Schweiker, </em>665 F.2d 936, 940 (9th Cir.1982). Both administrative res judicata and administrative collateral estoppel \u201care qualified or rejected when their application would contravene an overriding public policy or result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tipler v. E.I. duPont deNemours and Co., </em>443 F.2d 125, 128 (6th Cir.1971)). Fairness in the administrative decision-making process is our principal concern, outweighing the importance of administrative finality. <em>Thompson v. Schweiker, </em>665 F.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-13\">Failure to appeal the initial unemployment insurance determination within twenty days did not bar the administrative law judge\u2019s (AU) determination of Martin's eligibility for Redwood benefits. The bar should not be imposed when its twenty day period ran before Martin knew of his ineligibility for Redwood benefits. We will not work that harsh result under the guise of administrative res judicata. <em>Cf. Egbert v. Donovan, </em>720 F.2d 1122, 1123 (9th Cir. 1983) (at some point, equitable concerns bar the Secretary's redetermination of a claimant\u2019s eligibility after she has been declared eligible for benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>Drinking on the job or intoxication may under appropriate circumstances constitute cause for discharge that renders a terminated employee ineligible for unemployment. benefits. <em>See </em>Cal.Admin.Code tit. 22 R. 1256 \u2014 37(b)(1). Thus a discharge on that ground may preclude the receipt of Redwood benefits. <em>See </em>Redwood Act \u00a7\u00a7 203, 205(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">The AU reached the merits of Martin\u2019s claim and held that \u201cthe claimant was not intoxicated at work\u201d and that \u201c[sjince the claimant\u2019s discharge resulted from matters other than misconduct which could disqualify him from unemployment benefits, the claimant was incorrect [sic] disqualified for park benefits.\u201d The Secretary, for reasons we have discussed, did not reach the merits of the AU\u2019s decision and thus did not review the AU\u2019s findings as to the reasons for Martin\u2019s discharge. He must now do so. The Secretary\u2019s determination is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1472-14\">.
