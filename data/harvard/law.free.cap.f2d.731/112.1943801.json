PRATT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Aiz7\">Plaintiffs, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s Bank, Ltd. (Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s) and Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons, Ltd. (Ferer-London), appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Honorable Thomas P. Griesa, <em>Judge, </em>entered after a jury trial, dismissing their joint actions against defendant, The Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase). Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Ferer-London sued Chase for money had and received, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, misrepresentation, and for rescission of releases exchanged between Chase and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Plaintiffs alleged that money lent by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s to Ferer-London had been converted by Ferer-London\u2019s American parent corporation, Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Co. (Ferer-Omaha), which had used the money to repay loans owing to Chase, and that Chase knew the money actually belonged to plaintiffs. At the close of evidence the trial court directed a verdict in Chase\u2019s favor on the breach of fiduciary duty and negligence counts. Thereafter, the court set aside the jury\u2019s special verdicts, which found that Chase had misrepresented or concealed material facts connected with the release, and instead held that the release was not tainted with fraud, was valid, and barred Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s entire action. Finally, the trial court determined that Ferer-London failed to prove its count for money had and received, and it dismissed both complaints. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajc\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ANr\">Before addressing the legal issues, we must undertake a detailed review of the essential facts. Ferer-Omaha is a Nebraska corporation that bought and sold metal both in the United States and abroad. Defendant Chase Manhattan Bank is a national bank with offices in New York and London. Chase provided much of the financing for Ferer-Omaha\u2019s operations, and had a perfected security interest in all of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"ajc-dedup-0\">Plaintiff Ferer-London is an English corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferer-Omaha. . Ferer-London was also engaged in the metal trading business. Fer-er-London\u2019s purchases were financed in part by Chase, and in part by plaintiff Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, an English bank with offices in London and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">A. <em>Chase\u2019s Credit Arrangement with Ferer-Omaha</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMB\">In April 1970 Ferer-Omaha entered into a credit and security agreement with Chase and the United States National Bank of Omaha (USNB), a local bank acting as agent for Chase. Chase perfected its security interest in Ferer-Omaha\u2019s property by filing financing statements in Nebraska, New York, and other jurisdictions where Ferer-Omaha did business. Chase and USNB provided Ferer-Omaha with a revolving line of credit which permitted Fer-er-Omaha to borrow up to $5 million determined by a \u201cborrowing base\u201d formula. The borrowing base consisted of 90% of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s accounts receivable and an allowance of $1 million for inventory. In exchange, Ferer-Omaha agreed to assign its accounts receivable directly to Chase. Assignments and copies of the invoices representing the amounts due on the accounts were sent weekly to Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"A1u\">Chase\u2019s control over the accounts receivable assigned to it was achieved through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the use of a \u201clock box\u201d, which was really nothing more than a post office box in Chase\u2019s name. Ferer-Omaha\u2019s invoices bore a legend that requested its customers to remit payment directly to the lock box in New York City. Use of the lock box insured that Chase and USNB retained control over the receivables and also served to expedite receipt and recordation of payments. Chase collected checks from the lock box and deposited them into a cash collateral account maintained by it for Fer-er-Omaha. While the funds in the cash collateral account belonged to Ferer-Oma-ha, transfers from that account were controlled by Chase pursuant to the borrowing base formula. If there was insufficient collateral to support the debt owed to Chase, it had the option of applying funds from the cash collateral account to reduce the loans in accordance with the credit and security agreement. The evidence showed, however, that the funds received in the cash collateral account were usually transferred immediately to Ferer-Omaha\u2019s operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">B. <em>Course of Dealing Between Ferer-Omaha and Ferer-London</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In late 1970 Ferer-Omaha\u2019s president, Harvey Ferer, formed an English subsidiary, Ferer-London, to assist Ferer-Omaha in the metal trading business. Harvey Fer-er also planned to use Ferer-London to trade in metal futures contracts on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Chase extended a small line of credit to Ferer-Lon-don, and financed specific copper purchases by Ferer-London on a transaction-by-transaction basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The usual operating arrangement between Ferer-Omaha and Ferer-London was that the copper purchased by Ferer-London would be transferred to Ferer-Omaha for refining and sale to end users. Ferer-Oma-ha paid for the shipping and refining, and determined the selling price of the copper. After receipt of the sales proceeds, Ferer-Omaha would be reimbursed for its expenses, Ferer-London would be repaid the original purchase price, and any profit would then be divided between parent and subsidiary. The arrangement between the companies was never set out in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Ferer-Omaha usually invoiced its sales of Ferer-London\u2019s copper on Ferer-London invoices. Although Ferer-London\u2019s invoices did not bear the legend directing payment to the Chase lock box, most of the purchasers of the Ferer-London copper through Ferer-Omaha followed their customary practice and sent payments there anyway. The funds would pass through the collateral account, into the operating account, and Ferer-Omaha would then repay Ferer-Lon-don from that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">C. <em>The Codelco Copper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">In 1973 Harvey Ferer, acting for Ferer-Omaha, contracted with Corporaci\u00f3n del Cobre (Codelco) in Chile for the monthly purchase of partially refined copper. Fer-er-Omaha did not have sufficient credit at Chase to purchase all of the copper it contracted for, so at Harvey Ferer\u2019s request, Ferer-London purchased some of the monthly shipments. Two Ferer-London purchases from Codelco were financed by Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">In August 1973 Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s began financing Ferer-London\u2019s purchases of copper from Codelco. The terms of the loans from Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s to Ferer-London were not reduced to writing anywhere other than in the credit applications Ferer-Lon-don filed to procure letters of credit from Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s. With respect to the Codelco copper Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s never filed a financing statement, security agreement, or any other document to perfect a lien in England or in any jurisdiction in the United States until after most of the Codel-co copper had been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">At first Codelco did not realize that it was dealing with both Ferer-Omaha and Ferer-London as buyers. Consequently, some of the earlier contracts mistakenly named Ferer-Omaha as buyer, when in fact, Ferer-London was the buyer. Ferer-Omaha returned the contracts, and Codelco changed most of them to show Ferer-Lon-don as buyer. Codelco\u2019s invoices listed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>buyer\u2019s name, address, Codelco contract number, and a letter of credit number. The invoices also showed the name of the vessel the copper was to be shipped on, the date and place of shipping, and the destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Both Ferer-Omaha\u2019s and Ferer-London\u2019s purchases of Codelco copper were invoiced on a provisional basis, based on an estimated copper content. Following assay, a final invoice was issued. If the final invoice was lower than the provisional invoice, then Co-delco owed a refund for\" overpayment; conversely, if the final invoice was higher than the provisional invoice, then a balance was due from the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">When the ships bearing Codelco copper reached the United States, Ferer-Omaha performed its usual services by arranging for further refining and sale. However, instead of invoicing the sales of Ferer-Lon-don\u2019s refined Codelco copper on Ferer-Lon-don\u2019s invoices, as had been its prior practice, Ferer-Omaha invoiced the Codelco copper sales on its own forms and assigned the invoices to Chase. Notwithstanding those assignments, however, until March 1974 Ferer-Omaha was diligent in sending Ferer-London sufficient funds to enable Ferer-London to repay the loans it owed to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">D. <em>The Crisis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Serious delays in payments from Ferer-Omaha to Ferer-London on Codelco copper sales began in March 1974. On April 20, 1974, two Ferer-London directors flew to Omaha and met with Harvey Ferer seeking to accelerate payments. During the course of the meeting Harvey Ferer revealed that he had diverted $12 million of Ferer-Lon-don\u2019s Codelco proceeds to pay LME margin calls. The Ferer-London directors returned to London and informed Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s problems. They also told Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s that Chase had a security interest or \u201ccharge\u201d over all of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Two days later, on April 22, 1974, Harvey Ferer told Chase officials about the potential loss of $25 million because of his speculation on the LME. He also told Chase representatives that Ferer-London owed $12 million to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s that could not be repaid because the funds had been diverted to pay margin calls on the LME. That same day, Chase made a formal demand on Ferer-Omaha for repayment of its loans. On April 24 Ferer-Oma-ha filed a Chapter XI petition in the bankruptcy court in Omaha. A few months later Ferer-London went into liquidation in England.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">As part of the effort to collect its outstanding loans, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s had Fer-er-London assign its interest in those Co-delco copper shipments that corresponded to unpaid letters of credit. Using the assignments, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was able to take possession of several shipments and thereby reduce its losses to approximately $7.7 million. Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Ferer-London then proceeded to the bankruptcy court in Nebraska to determine what would be available for them from Ferer-Omaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">E. <em>The Omaha Bankruptcy Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">As part of the bankruptcy proceedings in' Omaha, and with the approval of the bankruptcy court,- Chase continued to finance Ferer-Omaha at vastly reduced levels. This enabled Ferer-Omaha to continue operating its metals trading business under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. While the court specifically approved use of the \u201clock box\u201d system, it maintained summary jurisdiction over the funds being transferred into and out of the collateral account.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">From 1974 until early 1977 Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was represented in the Ferer-Omaha bankruptcy proceedings by Carter, Led-yard &amp; Milburn (Carter Ledyard), a New York law firm. Carter Ledyard reported to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s London solicitors, and in turn retained Kennedy, Holland, DeLacey &amp; Svoboda (Kennedy Holland) as local counsel in Omaha. In late 1975 Ferer-Lon-don also retained Carter Ledyard and Kennedy Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In May 1974 Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Fer-er-London brought reclamation actions against Ferer-Omaha in the bankruptcy court. Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s claimed that Fer-er-Omaha had converted approximately $9 million that should have been turned over to Ferer-London for repayment to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Ferer-London\u2019s original claim was for approximately $10 million, but because $9 million of that claim was represented by amounts assigned to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, Ferer-London voluntarily reduced its claim to approximately $1 million. Fer-er-London joined Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s in seeking to enjoin Ferer-Omaha from disposing of Ferer-London\u2019s Codelco copper or proceeds. Chase moved to intervene, claiming that it had a perfected security interest in all of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The bankruptcy court entered a temporary restraining order directing Ferer-Oma-ha to furnish a summary of all transactions relating to the disposition of the Codelco copper. Ferer-Omaha\u2019s summary stated that all of the accounts receivable had been paid, but did not show that the funds had passed through the collateral account at Chase. Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s then sought to withdraw its reclamation action without prejudice. Chase did not oppose the withdrawal motion, but sought to have attorneys\u2019 fees assessed against Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s if the withdrawal motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">During the course of oral argument on the withdrawal motion, counsel for Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s attempted to characterize his client as the innocent party in all of the bankruptcy proceedings and argued that attorneys\u2019 fees should not be awarded. Counsel for Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s argued that a good deal of Ferer-London proceeds owed to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s \u201cdirectly or indirectly, went to Chase Manhattan Bank * * Thus, both Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Ferer-London knew, or at least suspected, as early as July 1974, that Chase was the recipient of the money which Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s claimed. The bankruptcy court granted Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s motion to withdraw and denied Chase\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">1. <em>The Codelco Refunds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Because the final assay of copper content in the Codelco shipments proved to be lower than the provisional assays, Ferer-Oma-ha and Ferer-London were due refunds for overage payments on most of the copper purchased from Codelco (hereinafter \u201cCo-delco refunds\u201d). On May 7, 1975, Harvey Ferer furnished Chase with a handwritten schedule of Codelco contracts, stating whether the contract was in Ferer-Omaha\u2019s or Ferer-London\u2019s name, the amounts due or owing, and the financing bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">On May 30, 1975, Codelco paid Chase approximately $505,000 in Codelco refunds. Two weeks later, Codelco sent approximately $17,000 more, for a total of $522,-000. Chase, believing that its security interest gave it a superior right to the refunds, applied them to Ferer-Omaha\u2019s outstanding pre-bankruptcy loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was aware that Chase claimed the refunds on account of the Fer-er-Omaha and Ferer-London purchases financed by Chase. In a phone conversation in May 1975, Chase\u2019s attorney told James Gadsden, an attorney for Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, that Chase had received refunds from Codelco and that Chase believed that it was entitled to keep them because of its security interest in all of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s property. At the same time, Ferer-Omaha furnished Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s with a schedule of amounts due from Codelco which contained exactly the same information, in typewritten form, that had been furnished to Chase by Harvey Ferer. The schedule furnished to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s even had footnotes to show which Ferer-London shipments Chase claimed, some of which included shipments financed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Gadsden related this information to the London attorneys for the bank, and furnished them with the schedule showing the amounts due.. At that time no one objected to Chase\u2019s retention of the Codelco refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">2. <em>The Confirmed Plan of Arrangement and Exchange of Releases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">In 1975 Chase and the other creditors of Ferer-Omaha sought to work out a reorga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>nization plan so that Ferer-Omaha could emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings. The problem facing the creditors and the debtor, however, was the existence of the potential Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s/Ferer-London claim of approximately $9-10 million. The validity of Ferer-London\u2019s and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s claims had been disputed at many creditors\u2019 meetings, but in the summer of 1975 a compromise began to emerge.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">That compromise was embodied in a stipulation filed in the bankruptcy court on May 21, 1975, and in releases exchanged between Chase and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s in September 1975. The stipulation entered into between Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, Ferer-Lon-don, and Ferer-Omaha, provided that Ferer-Omaha, although denying any intent to commit any wrongdoing, had technically \u201cconverted\u201d Ferer-London copper financed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Therefore, the stipulation proved Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s unsecured claim for $9 million in the bankruptcy proceedings. The stipulation also stated that Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was holding $358,-000 that belonged to Ferer-Omaha, which both Chase and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s claimed. The stipulation allowed Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s to keep the $358,000 and set it off against their bankruptcy claim. Finally, the stipulation provided that Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s would drop its non-dischargeability complaint filed in May 1975 so that a plan of arrangement could be worked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In return for dropping its objections to the claims of Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, and consenting to the set off of the $358,000, Chase obtained a release from Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s in which Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s released all claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">which it ever had, now has or which it or its successors hereafter can, shall or may have against The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. or against The United States National Bank of Omaha, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning' of the world to the day of the date of these presents, arising out of any transactions or occurrences involving Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s Bank Ltd. and Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Co., a Nebraska corporation, or Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation, or any transactions or occurrences involving The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. and/or The United States National Bank of Omaha and Aaron Fer-er &amp; Sons Co. or Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Ltd.; * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Relying in part on the stipulation, the bankruptcy court, on September 8, 1975, confirmed a plan of arrangement for Ferer-Omaha that permitted Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s to participate as an unsecured creditor of Fer-er-Omaha to the full extent of its $9 million claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">II. THE PRESENT ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"Ats\">In May 1977 Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Fer-er-London learned that the Codelco refunds paid to Chase amounted to $522,000. Fer-er-London\u2019s liquidator protested, claiming that Chase was not entitled to those funds and demanding that Chase remit them to Ferer-London. When Chase refused, plaintiffs instituted these joint actions in the New York Supreme Court in August 1977. Because international banking transactions were involved, Chase removed the actions to the federal district court pursuant to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaints sought damages for money had and received, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentation. Additionally, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s sought rescission of the 1975 release because of alleged misrepresentations by Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In 1979 Chase sought discovery of all Carter Ledyard and Kennedy Holland memoranda, contending that the misrepresentation count raised an issue of Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s knowledge at the time the releases were exchanged. Chase also sought discovery of all correspondence between the law firms and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. The district court granted Chase\u2019s motion, but excluded from the discovery any portion of the memoranda or correspondence that contained instructions and information from Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. We see no error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>district court\u2019s resolution of this discovery problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In April 1980 Chase moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the amended plan of arrangement in the bankruptcy proceedings. Chase argued that plaintiffs were aware of their potential claims in the bankruptcy proceedings, that plaintiffs had participated in those proceedings, and that all claims were, or should have been, litigated in the bankruptcy court. Judge Griesa granted partial summary judgment, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">Those issues, the property, the receivables of Ferer-Omaha were within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. Ferer-London and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s were out there claiming conversion. The bankruptcy action clearly embraces or clearly embraced and bars now further litigation about claims by plaintiffs here against Chase arising from the post-April 24, 1974 matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A jury trial on the remaining issues began on March 24, 1983, and continued until April 18, 1983. At the close of all the evidence, Judge Griesa dismissed the negligence and breach of fiduciary duty counts, holding that plaintiffs\u2019 negligence actions were barred by New York\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, and that, as a matter .of law, plaintiffs had failed to prove that Chase owed a fiduciary duty to either plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The court then submitted four questions to the jury in the form of special verdicts. The first two questions asked about Chase\u2019s knowledge of Ferer-London\u2019s ownership interest or Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s security interest in the Codelco copper. The jury found that Chase had no actual knowledge of either interest. On questions 3 and 4, which related to the release, the jury found that Chase had misrepresented or concealed material facts connected with the release and that Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s had relied on that misrepresentation or concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Chase moved to set aside the affirmative responses to the release questions and for judgment n.o.v. The court granted Chase\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was represented by counsel both in New York and in Omaha. Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s had all the rights of the American litigation process available to it before it signed any release. Aside from that, the record is absolutely conclusive that Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s knew, and Ferer-London knew, the nature of their claims against Chase. The documents are absolutely conclusive on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The district court therefore ruled that the release was valid and that it barred Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s entire action.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Turning to Ferer-London\u2019s only remaining cause of action \u2014 money had and received \u2014 Judge Griesa held that (1) Chase was a \u201cgood faith purchaser\u201d under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code; (2) Ferer-London never attempted to show that any of its money could be traced to Chase; and (3) equity did not require that Chase bear the loss suffered by Ferer-London. On April 27, 1983, judgment was entered dismissing both plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">Before taking up the specific claims on appeal, we need to consider the controlling law and the proper standard of review. It is apparent from the factual picture painted above that the events leading to this litigation cut across the boundaries of two foreign nations, England and Chile, and at least two states within the United States, New York and Nebraska. Inexplicably, none of the parties have attempted to show which forum\u2019s law should govern these actions. Instead, both sides have drawn from a potpourri of decisions from the jurisdictions connected with the events in question, concentrating, however, on New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">These actions were removed to the district court under the Edge Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632 (1982), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-16\">[A]ll suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity [involving a United States corporation], arising out of trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>actions involving international or foreign banking, * * * shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States, * * [and may be removed] into the district court * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The fact that this action \u201carises under the laws of the United States\u201d, however, does not necessarily mean that federal law supplies the ultimate rule of decision. <em>See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979). Believing that this type of controversy, like that in <em>Kimbell Foods, </em>does not require a uniform federal rule, and applying the federal common law choice of law approach set out by Judge Lumbard in <em>Corporacion Venezolana de Fomento v. Vintero Sales Corp., </em>629 F.2d 786 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1111, 101 S.Ct. 863, 66 L.Ed.2d 804 (1981), we conclude that New York law governs plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In <em>Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Fomento, </em>Judge Lumbard separated the issues to determine which forum\u2019s law would apply to each. <em>Id. </em>at 794; <em>see also Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., </em>309 F.2d 553 (2d Cir.1962) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 912, 83 S.Ct. 726, 9 L.Ed.2d 720 (1963). The case at bar involves two different types of issues: restitution (money had and received) and tort (negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">As to the action for money had and received, New York law governs. The banking relationship between Ferer-Omaha and Chase arose in New York, the banking transactions were carried out in New York, Chase\u2019s principal offices are located in New York, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s has an office there, and Chase received plaintiffs\u2019 money, if at all, through the lock box and collateral account in New York. <em>See Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 221 (1971); <em>Industrial Export &amp; Import Corp. v. HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., </em>191 Misc. 493, 77 N.Y.S.2d 541 (N.Y. Sup.Ct.1947), <em>affd, </em>302 N.Y. 342, 98 N.E.2d 466 (1951); <em>see also </em>Ehrenzweig, <em>Restitution in the Conflict of Laws, </em>36 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1298, 1305-07 (1961) (law of forum usual rule in restitutionary actions). Additionally, New York has a significant interest in regulating banking practices occurring within its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">New York also has the superior interest in having its law applied to the negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentation issues. All of the acts which plaintiffs complain of took place in New York, <em>see Neumeier v. Kuehner, </em>31 N.Y.2d 121, 128-29, 335 N.Y.S.2d 64, 69-70, 286 N.E.2d 454, 457-58 (1972), and New York certainly has a substantial interest in preventing torts by banks operating within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Finally, the parties have not attempted to show that the law of any other potentially interested jurisdiction differs from that of New York. <em>See Cousins v. Instrument Flyers, Inc., </em>44 N.Y.2d 698, 405 N.Y.S.2d 441, 376 N.E.2d 914 (1978). We therefore conclude that New York law governs the substantive issues raised on these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The standard of review governing plaintiffs\u2019 appeals is the same for the causes of actions dismissed on directed verdict \u2014negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and money had and received \u2014 as it is for the misrepresentation cause of action dismissed by judgment n.o.v. <em>See Mattivi v. South African Marine Corp., \u201cHuguenot\u201d, </em>618 F.2d 163 (2d Cir.1980); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>308 F.2d 911, 914 (2d Cir.1962). Moreover, the test to be applied by the court of appeals is the same as that originally applied by the trial judge. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>308 F.2d at 914. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajt-dedup-0\">[T]he trial court cannot assess the weight of conflicting evidence, pass on the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute its judgment for that of the jury. Rather, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party (giving the non-movant the benefit of all reasonable inferences), the trial court should grant a judgment n.o.v. [or directed verdict only when (1) there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>mise and conjecture, or (2) there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><em>Mattivi v. South African Marine Corp., \u201cHuguenot\", </em>618 F.2d at 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We now turn to an analysis of each of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">A. <em>Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Plaintiffs alleged that Chase was negligent, indeed grossly negligent, because it accepted Ferer-London\u2019s proceeds from Ferer-Omaha, and because it allowed Ferer-Omaha to borrow money while speculating on the LME. Plaintiffs allege that these actions continued until April 1974. Whatever their merits, plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence and gross negligence are barred by New York\u2019s three-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>N.Y.Civ.Prac. Law \u00a7 214(4) (McKinney 1972). Since the acts complained of ceased in April 1974 and plaintiffs\u2019 actions in state court were not begun until August 1977, the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for negligence and gross negligence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">B. <em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Plaintiffs contend that by accepting the funds in the lock box and by accepting the Codelco refunds, Chase has breached a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d owing to each plaintiff. The weakness in this claim, however, is that neither Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s nor FererLondon established that Chase owed them a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s maintains that the long-standing correspondent bank relationship between it and Chase created a fiduciary relationship between the banks. This is not so. A correspondent bank relationship, standing alone, does not create an agency relationship, <em>see Amigo Foods Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank </em>\u2014 New <em>York, </em>39 N.Y.2d 391, 384 N.Y.S.2d 124, 348 N.E.2d 581 (1976), and Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s neither pleaded nor proved any other facts which could possibly be construed as creating a fiduciary relationship between it and Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Ferer-London claims that Chase owed it a fiduciary duty because Chase (1) was banker for both Ferer-Omaha and Fer-er-London; (2) had access to the financial records of both corporations; and (3) knew that the two corporations had a \u201cclose relationship\u201d. Notwithstanding Ferer-London\u2019s allegations, New York law is clear that the usual relationship of bank and customer is that of debtor and creditor. <em>Solicitor for the Affairs of His Majesty\u2019s Treasury v. Bankers Trust Co., </em>304 N.Y. 282, 107 N.E.2d 448 (1952); <em>see also Industrial Commissioner v. Five Corners Tavern, Inc., </em>47 N.Y.2d 639, 643, 419 N.Y.S.2d 931, 934, 393 N.E.2d 1005, 1009 (1979). And in this case, there is no evidence to indicate that either Chase or Ferer-London intended that their relationship be something more than just the debtor-creditor relationship. <em>Cf. National Boulevard Bank of Chicago v. Schwartz, </em>175 F.Supp. 74, 76-77 (S.D.N.Y.1959), <em>affd, </em>274 F.2d 823 (2d Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">C. <em>Misrepresentation and Rescission of the 1975 Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaints alleged that Chase misrepresented and concealed material facts with regard to its credit arrangement with Ferer-Omaha and its receipt of Codelco refunds. Plaintiffs further alleged that they were entitled to money damages because they chose to forgo certain collection procedures in the Omaha bankruptcy action in reliance on the facts as Chase misrepres\u00e9nted them. Additionally, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s sought rescission of the release it had given Chase in September 1975, contending the release would not have been given had Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s known the true facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">1. <em>Validity of the Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Although plaintiffs alleged that Chase both misrepresented and concealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>material facts, the evidence introduced at trial related only to concealment. Under New York law, omissions of material fact, may rise to a level constituting fraud and serve as a basis for an action for money damages, <em>Goldsmith v. National Container, Inc., </em>287 N.Y. 438, 40 N.E.2d 242 (1942); or for rescission of a release. <em>Dambmann v. Schulting, </em>75 N.Y. 55 (1878); <em>Gurnee v. Hasbrouck, </em>267 N.Y. 57, 195 N.E. 683 (1935). Before such omissions can be la-belled fraudulent, however, there must be a showing that a duty of disclosure existed. <em>Frigitemp Corp. v. Financial Dynamics Fund, Inc., </em>524 F.2d 275 (2d Cir.1975); <em>Gurnee v. Hasbrouck, </em>267 N.Y. at 62, 115 N.E. at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">During the course of negotiations surrounding a business transaction, a duty to disclose may arise in two situations: first, where the parties enjoy a fiduciary relationship, <em>see Frigitemp Corp. v. Financial Dynamics Funds, Inc., </em>524 F.2d at 283; <em>see also Coface v. Optique Du Monde, Ltd., </em>521 F.Supp. 500, 504 (S.D.N. Y.1980); and second, where one party possesses superior knowledge, not readily available to the other, and knows that the other is acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge. <em>See Frigitemp Corp. v. Financial Dynamic Funds, Inc., </em>524 F.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Our conclusion in Part III-B., <em>supra, </em>that Chase did not owe a fiduciary duty to either Ferer-London or Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s defeats plaintiffs\u2019 first argument supporting a duty to disclose. The claim of fraudulent concealment based on superior knowledge, however, presents a more difficult problem that requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Plaintiffs claim that Chase first concealed material facts on April 29, 1974, when Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s approached Chase to ask for help in locating Ferer-London\u2019s Codelco copper, or its proceeds, which had been converted by Ferer-Omaha. At the meeting, Chase officers expressed a willingness to cooperate, but indicated that they would probably not be able to help at all because Ferer-Omaha\u2019s records were \u201cchaotic\u201d. Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s did not ask how Chase\u2019s credit arrangement with Fer-er-Omaha operated, whether Ferer-Omaha receivables had been assigned to Chase, or how Chase was repaid by Ferer-Omaha. Chase, of course, did not volunteer the information. Plaintiffs claim that Chase kept the operation of the credit arrangement concealed throughout the bankruptcy proceedings and that plaintiffs did not discover its existence until the summer of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">While there is evidence that Chase did not present a detailed explanation of its credit and security agreement with Ferer-Omaha, plaintiffs failed to establish that Chase\u2019s knowledge was \u201csuperior\u201d, because all of the information that plaintiffs now claim was concealed from them was either a matter of public record, was not pursued by plaintiffs, or was disclosed, at least in part, by Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In the April 1974 meeting, the first time it is claimed that Chase concealed the existence of the collateral account, Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s never inquired about Chase\u2019s credit arrangement with Ferer-Omaha, and there was nothing about Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s request for assistance to indicate that the credit and security agreement information would be useful to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Indeed, it seems reasonable for Chase not to have volunteered the information at the time, particularly because a bank should keep its own customers\u2019 affairs confidential. <em>Cf. Graney Development Corp. v. Taksen, </em>92 Misc.2d 764, 400 N.Y.S.2d 717 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.), <em>affd, </em>66 A.D.2d 1008, 411 N.Y.S.2d 756 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Moreover, on May 2, 1974, a lock box arrangement identical to that used by Chase prior to the bankruptcy petition had already been approved by the bankruptcy court. A stipulation entered into between Chase, USNB, and Ferer-Omaha and ordered by the court provided that Chase and USNB would continue financing Ferer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Omaha, and that Chase would use a lock box, collateral account, and operating account. That stipulation and order was part of the public record in the bankruptcy proceedings that Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s and Ferer-London participated in.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Additionally, in response to an inquiry from a Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s officer, a lawyer for Chase explained generally how a lock box system operated. However, the Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s officer never pursued the matter, and never even asked when Chase started using the lock box system with Ferer-Omaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Finally, as the district court pointed out, although plaintiffs had all the resources of the bankruptcy litigation process available to them before executing the release, they never attempted to use those tools to discover how Chase\u2019s credit arrangement with Ferer-Omaha operated. <em>See Dambmann v. Schulting, </em>75 N.Y. 55, 61-62 (1878); <em>see also Danann Realty Corp. v. Harris, </em>5 N.Y.2d 317, 184 N.Y.S.2d 599, 157 N.E.2d 597 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The second instance of Chase\u2019s alleged concealment related to the Codelco refunds. Plaintiffs claimed that Chase knew that a large portion of the refunds were owed to Ferer-London (and ultimately to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s), but decided to conceal receipt of the Codelco refunds and apply them instead to Ferer-Omaha\u2019s indebtedness. Plaintiffs especially rely on the facts surrounding the Codelco refunds as strong evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding of misrepresentation or concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The evidence shows, however, that the schedule sent to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s listing the refunds due from Codelco clearly revealed that Chase claimed to be entitled to all of the Codelco refunds regardless of who financed the original contracts. On one particular occasion Chase\u2019s attorney told Gadsden, the attorney for Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, \u201cthat Chase has received a payment for Codelco within the last ten weeks.\u201d Yet, until this lawsuit, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s never objected to Chase\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">In the absence of any direct inquiry from plaintiffs, Chase, which had a perfected security interest in all of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s property and which occupied a position adverse to plaintiffs in the bankruptcy proceedings, had no reason to assume that the mechanics of its financing and security arrangement with Ferer-Omaha were of material interest to plaintiffs, who took no steps in the bankruptcy proceedings to discover those arrangements. These simply are not the kinds of circumstances that give rise to an affirmative duty to disclose, whose breach might be the predicate for a fraud claim. Chase dealt fairly with plaintiffs and in a manner consistent with its minimal obligations to them and its more substantial obligations to its own customer, Ferer-Omaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Furthermore, throughout the bankruptcy proceedings plaintiffs were represented by counsel, knew the general nature of their claims, participated in arm\u2019s length negotiations with Chase, and knew generally what was given up by the release executed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. <em>See Gurnee v. Has-brouck, </em>267 N.Y. at 62, 195 N.E. at 688; <em>Mittendorf v. J.R. Williston &amp; Beane, Inc., </em>372 F.Supp. 821 (S.D.N.Y.1974). Under all these circumstances, plaintiffs\u2019 actions for money damages based on misrepresentation fail as a matter of law. Similarly, no fraud having been established, the release given by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s must be upheld as valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">2. <em>Scope of the Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">At trial and on appeal Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s has argued that the release was not broad enough to bar the claims asserted in the instant case. This argument is without merit, for Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s released:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axp\">causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckoning, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, extents, executions, claims and demands whatsoever, in law, in admiralty, or in equity, * ~ * by reason of any matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day of the date of these presents, arising out of any transactions or occurrences involving Williams &amp; Glyn's Bank Ltd. and Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Co., a Nebraska corporation, or Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons, Ltd., a United Kingdom corporation, or any transactions or occurrences involving The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. * * * and Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons, Co., or Aaron Ferer <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Ltd.; * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The language chosen was broad and unambiguous. Surely the present claims arise \u201cout of transactions or occurrences\u201d involving Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s Bank, Ltd., and Fer-er-Omaha or Ferer-London. Further, the release was drafted in part by a Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s attorney. As signatory to the release, Williams <em>&amp; </em>Glyn\u2019s is bound by it and precluded from suing Chase on the present claims. <em>See Lucio v. Curran, </em>2 N.Y.2d 157, 157 N.Y.S.2d 948, 139 N.E.2d 133 (1956). Thus, dismissal of Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s entire action was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">3. <em>Effect of the Release on Ferer-Lon-don</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Chase claims that Ferer-London, a non-signatory, having assigned its interest to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, is also bound by the release and lacks standing in these proceedings. An unequivocal and complete assignment extinguishes the assignor\u2019s rights against the obligor and leaves the assignor without standing to sue the obligor. <em>See Acme Blacktop Paving Corp. v. Brown &amp; Matthews, Inc., </em>30 A.D.2d 1042, 294 N.Y.S.2d 826 (App.Div.1968). On May 6, 1974, Ferer-London formally assigned to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">[A]ll our rights and interests in the copper wheresoever situate or if sold in the sale proceeds thereof and authorise you to take all necessary action in your own name or ours to enforce your rights over the copper to sell the copper and to realise and collect the sale proceeds without reference to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Although it might be argued that the assignment from Ferer-London to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was an assignment of all rights in the Codelco copper, we view the assignment to be more in the nature of an assignment as security for an antecedent debt owed to the assignee, Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. In such circumstance New York law recognizes the right of the assignor, Ferer-Lon-don, to sue the obligor, Chase, in order to enforce its rights and ensure that the as-signee prosecutes the cause vigorously. <em>See Fifty States Management Corp. v. Pioneer Auto Parts, Inc., </em>44 A.D.2d 857, 355 N.Y.S.2d 856 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Moreover, the assignment from Ferer-London to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s was related to particular lots of copper financed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, and Ferer-London claimed in the bankruptcy proceedings that Ferer-Omaha converted Ferer-London copper over and above that financed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s. Therefore, even if we were to view the assignment as a general assignment, Ferer-London would still have standing with regard to its claim that Ferer-Omaha converted $1 million worth of its receivables in excess of those assigned to Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Since the release executed by Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s disposes of its entire action, but does not bind Ferer-London, we must, finally, consider the merits of Ferer-London\u2019s remaining cause of action \u2014 money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">D. <em>Money Had and Received</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">The essential elements in a claim for money had and received under New York law are that (1) defendant received money belonging to plaintiff; (2) defendant benefitted from the receipt of money; and (3) under principles of equity and good conscience, defendant should not be permitted to keep the money. <em>See Miller v. Schloss, </em>218 N.Y. 400, 407, 113 N.E. 337 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">We need not decide whether the first two elements of the claim were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>proved, because assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Ferer-London proved both of them, it failed on the third element because, under the circumstances of this case, equity does not require Chase to return any funds to Ferer-London.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The fundamental cause of Ferer-Lon-don\u2019s problems was that it allowed Ferer-Omaha to take possession of the Codelco copper and treat it as its own. Ferer-Oma-ha\u2019s refiners and customers believed that the copper belonged to Ferer-Omaha, and, as the jury found, Chase had no actual knowledge of Ferer-London\u2019s ownership interest in the receivables before the bankruptcy petition was filed. Most importantly, Ferer-London failed to do anything, either legally or practically, to give notice of its ownership of the copper or of its claim to the receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Furthermore, Chase was entitled to rely on the documents it received from Ferer-Omaha. New York public policy disfavors attacks based on the assertion that an asset of a bank is something less than it appears to be on its face. <em>See Franklin National Bank v. Skeist, </em>49 A.D.2d 215, 373 N.Y.S.2d 869 (App.Div.1975). Ferer-London cannot now claim that Chase should have looked behind the accounts receivable assigned to it to ascertain the validity of Ferer-Omaha\u2019s interest in the Codelco copper. Moreover, Chase relied on its receipt of the money now claimed by Ferer-London when, in the Chapter XI proceeding, it reduced the amount of its claim based on Ferer-Omaha\u2019s indebtedness to Chase. Although our ultimate resolution of this case means that we do not have to pass on the propriety of the summary judgment ruling made by Judge Griesa, we think that Chase\u2019s reliance on Ferer-Lon-don\u2019s position as an unsecured creditor in the Chapter XI proceedings is a factor which mitigates against Chase\u2019s having to return any money to Ferer-London. <em>See Bank Saderat Iran v. Amin Beydoun, Inc., </em>555 F.Supp. 770 (S.D.N.Y.1983). <em>See also Miller v. Meinhard-Commercial Corp., </em>462 F.2d 358 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Accordingly, under the circumstances presented in this case, where the loss must be borne by one of two innocent parties, such loss must be borne by the party whose conduct brought about the situation that caused the loss \u2014 Ferer-London. <em>See State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. v. Stokes, </em>65 Misc.2d 316, 317 N.Y.S.2d 706 (Civ.Ct.1970). Ferer-London\u2019s count for money had and received was, therefore, properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">We conclude that the district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims on the basis of New York\u2019s statute of limitations. The district court was also correct in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of a fiduciary relationship because Chase had no such relationship with either plaintiff. The misrepresentation and rescission counts were properly dismissed because plaintiffs failed to prove either that Chase owed a duty of disclosure to either Ferer-London or Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s, or that Chase concealed any material fact from the plaintiffs. All of Williams &amp; Glyn\u2019s claims are barred by its release, knowingly and voluntarily given. Finally, Ferer-London did not prove that equity and good conscience required Chase to return any of the disputed money it had received. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment in both actions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
