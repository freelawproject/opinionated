GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">This action arises from illegal purchases of office supplies by a county official. Al-corn County sued to recover all amounts paid by it in violation of state bidding laws to the defendant USIS. Additionally, the county sought punitive damages under state law and treble damages under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), the civil remedy provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The district court directed a verdict for the county on its claim for restitution under state law. Neither party appeals that judgment. The court, however, further directed verdicts against the county on its punitive damages and RICO claims. The county appeals, arguing that it was entitled to present these claims to the jury. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case for a new trial on the county\u2019s RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">During 1979 and 1980, the defendant, U.S. Interstate Supplies, Inc., (USIS), collected more than $46,000 from Alcorn County for office supplies it sold to the county at inflated prices, including seventy-one cartons of toner for use in copying machines and seventy-three thousand ballpoint and felt-tipped pens, the majority of which were never delivered. Local news media personnel, understandably dubious that the county had validly purchased approximately 2.7 pens per each of its twenty-seven thousand inhabitants, dubbed the event \u201cPenscam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">USIS, a California corporation, at the time of \u201cPenscam\u201d was engaged in telephone solicitation sales. Individual defendants Morris Savitz and David Creditor were salesmen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for USIS, and Janice Rado was the corporation\u2019s sole stockholder, officer and director. USIS began doing business with Alcorn County in 1979 through its salesmen Savitz and Creditor. Janice Rado sent Alcorn County a price list intending this list to represent its bid for Alcorn County\u2019s business. No public notice or request for bids was made by Alcorn County in connection with purchases of office supplies during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-18\">Billie Cutchens, a deputy chancery court clerk of Alcorn County, admitted that she ordered the supplies from USIS. She pleaded guilty to embezzlement of public funds and testified for the county at the trial of this suit. Cutchens testified that she received payments of cash and other property, including three television sets and two radios, from Creditor and USIS in return for making the orders and that Creditor told her these \u201cgifts\u201d were intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>ed for her and not the county. She also testified that pursuant to instructions from Creditor, she falsified invoices and entries into the county\u2019s claim docket in order to conceal the purchases from county authorities. Cutchens maintained at trial that Creditor threatened to harm her when she attempted to withdraw from the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">In March 1981, Alcorn County sued USIS in federal district court, invoking both diversity and federal-question jurisdiction. The complaint alleged that USIS was obligated under Mississippi law to reimburse all payments made in violation of the state\u2019s public purchase laws. In addition, the complaint demanded punitive damages based on fraud and conspiracy to embezzle public funds and treble damages based on violations of RICO. The complaint was later amended to name Creditor, Savitz and Rado individual defendants. Savitz and Rado filed bankruptcy petitions prior to trial, and the complaint was dismissed as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">The case was tried before a jury in the Northern District of Mississippi in November 1982. After all parties had presented evidence, the district judge made rulings on cross-motions for directed verdicts, which disposed of all issues in the case, and he dismissed the jury without submitting the case to it. The court ruled that Alcorn County was entitled to repayment of all amounts that it paid on invoices for more than $250, because the evidence conclusively demonstrated that those payments were made in violation of the state law requiring competitive bidding. The district judge also found the county entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">The district judge directed a verdict against Alcorn County on its claims for punitive and treble damages without a written opinion. From our examination of the record, we gather that the district judge was of the opinion that no basis had been established for the award of punitive damages under state law. With respect to treble damages, the district judge made the following remarks: \u201cRacketeering, as counsel has so ably pointed out to me, contemplates an illegal enterprise, an illegal enterprise, such as a gambling, a prostitution type thing. I\u2019m of the opinion in this case that the proof does not rise to that degree which would justify either a racketeering charge going to the jury or punitive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">On November 16/1982, the district court entered judgment for Alcorn County for repayments and interest totalling more than $50,000. The judgment contained the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-13\">\u201cThe plaintiff is also entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees, which matter is held in abeyance to be determined on affidavits and counteraffidavits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">On January 3, 1983, Alcorn County filed a notice of appeal from both the judgment denying it recovery on its RICO and punitive damages theories and the denial of its motion for a new trial. Attorney\u2019s fees were awarded in a judgment entered on January 28, 1983. The parties submitted briefs and presented oral arguments before this panel in November 1983. At no time did the defendants question the timeliness of Alcorn County\u2019s notice of appeal. Following oral argument, we requested that the parties submit additional briefs addressing whether the notice of appeal was filed within the prescribed time limit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-16\">This appeal involves some complex procedural issues as well as questions of sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>stantive law. If the notice of appeal in this case was not filed in time, then we must dismiss the appeal without reaching the merits of Alcorn County\u2019s claims. The resolution of the timeliness issue, as we will explain in detail, hinges upon whether the judgment entered on November 16, 1982, was a final, therefore appealable, judgment. If the November 16 judgment was final, then Alcorn County\u2019s January 3, 1983, notice of appeal was not filed in time. If there was no final judgment in this case until January 28, 1983, then we must consider whether the premature filing of the notice of appeal vested jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">If we resolve these procedural issues in Alcorn County\u2019s favor, then we must address whether the district court erred in directing verdicts on the civil RICO and punitive damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">The judgment entered on November 16, 1982, assessed liability for attorney\u2019s fees against the defendants, but left the amount of the fee award undetermined. We must decide whether this judgment, which on its face leaves an issue in the case undecided, was a final or appealable judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. If so, no timely notice of appeal from that judgment was filed, and we must dismiss this appeal. The standard for determining whether such a judgment is final is set forth in <em>Holmes v. J. Ray McDermott &amp; Co., Inc., </em>682 F.2d 1143 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1107, 103 S.Ct. 732, 74 L.Ed.2d 956 (1983). Synthesizing the holdings of prior cases, we derived this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-8\">When attorney\u2019s fees are similar to costs ... or collateral to an action ... a lack of determination as to the amount does not preclude the issuance of a final, appealable judgment on the merits. When, however, the attorney\u2019s fees are an integral part of the merits of the case and the scope of relief, they cannot be characterized as costs or as collateral and their determination is a part of any final, appealable judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1146 (citations omitted). In <em>Holmes, </em>we held that a request for attorney\u2019s fees in a maritime action for arbitrary and willful failure to pay maintenance and cure was similar to an element of damages and \u201cnot uniquely separable from the merits but ... bound hand in hand with them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">Since <em>Holmes </em>was decided, we have applied its finality test to an action on a contract, holding that where attorney\u2019s fees were provided for in the contract, an award of such fees was an integral part of the merits of the case and that a judgment assessing liability for, but not the amount of, attorney\u2019s fees was not final. <em>Oxford Production Credit Ass\u2019n v. Duckworth, </em>689 F.2d 587 (5th Cir.1982). In reaching our decision, we looked to Mississippi law for guidance because it governed the construction of the contract in that diversity case. <em>Id. </em>at 588. Here we have looked to the law governing Alcorn County\u2019s claims, both state and federal, but we have found no cases which address the particular question before us. We do find some guidance, however, in the nature of the cause of action created by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">Alcorn County maintains that its request for attorney\u2019s fees is an integral part of the merits of this case, pointing to the fact that attorney\u2019s fees were a part of the relief requested in its complaint. If the county had failed to request attorney\u2019s fees in its complaint, that would suggest that they were not integral to the merits of this case. We do not, however, consider the fact that the claim was in the complaint to be dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">On consideration of the factors suggested by <em>Holmes, </em>we find that Alcorn County\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is integral to its cause of action under the civil RICO statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are persuaded by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>fact that, under federal law, the award of attorney\u2019s fees is provided for by the very same statute which both creates the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and provides for an award of damages. This case is distinguishable in that respect from <em>White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982), in which the Supreme Court held that an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 was not integral to a plaintiff\u2019s main cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the provision for attorney\u2019s fees in section 1964(c) was intended by Congress, like the provision for treble damages, to encourage private enforcement of the laws on which RICO is predicated. These provisions provide strong incentives to civil litigants and are integral to the effort of Congress to enlist the aid of civil claimants in deterring racketeering, as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. <em>See </em>Tannenbaum and Molo, <em>State and Local Governments\u2019 Use of the Treble Damages Remedy Under Civil RICO: A Means of Redressing the Economic Effects of Unlawful Conduct, </em>35 Baylor L.Rev. 1, 4 n. 13 (1983). It is clear to us that attorney\u2019s fees are an essential part of the relief that Congress intended to make available to parties injured by racketeering violations. Rather than making a fee award a matter of the trial court\u2019s discretion, as it is under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, Congress made the fee award mandatory to successful civil RICO plaintiffs. There is no opportunity under the civil RICO statute for a successful defendant to recover attorney\u2019s fees. This distinction, too, convinces us that the fee award provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) is <em>not </em>like costs, but is an integral part of the relief sought by the civil RICO plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">Because the request for attorney\u2019s fees in this case was integral to the merits of the RICO cause of action, the judgment rendered on November 16, 1982, which did not fix the amount of the fee award, was not final.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Holmes, </em>682 F.2d at 1148. The judgment of the district court became final on January 28, 1983, when the order fixing the amount of attorney\u2019s fees was entered, and the time for appeal began to run on that date. <em>Oxford Production Credit Association v. Duckworth, </em>689 F.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">The only notice of appeal filed in this case was filed on January 3, 1983, more than three weeks before the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>ment of the district court became final. We must decide, then, whether the premature notice of appeal properly invokes the jurisdiction of this court. Despite some recent authority to the contrary,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the older precedent in this circuit holds that we may consider a premature appeal in those cases where judgment becomes final prior to disposition of the appeal. <em>Jetco Electronic Industries, Inc. v. Gardiner, </em>473 F.2d 1228 (5th Cir.1973). The <em>Jetco </em>rule has been recognized and followed in this circuit in a number of cases. <em>See, e.g., Cole v. Tuttle, </em>540 F.2d 206 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Tower v. Moss, </em>625 F.2d 1161, 1164-65 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Mesa Petroleum Co. v. Coniglio, </em>629 F.2d 1022 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Martin v. Campbell, </em>692 F.2d 112 (11th Cir.1982) (recognizing <em>Jeteo </em>as the rule of the Former Fifth Circuit, binding on the Eleventh Circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">In <em>Martin v. Campbell, </em>the Fifth Circuit precedent was summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-5\">In each of these cases the appellant filed his notice of appeal prematurely before all claims had been adjudicated, but the pending claims were later decided. The court held that, considering together the judgment being appealed and the later judgments, the litigation was effectively terminated and, therefore, there was no longer a Rule 54(b) defect in the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7j\">692 F.2d at 114. In choosing between conflicting precedents, this court has held that the older rule is presumptively correct. This is a logical extension of the rule that one panel within this circuit may not overrule the opinion of another. <em>Ryals v. Estelle, </em>661 F.2d 904 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>727 F.2d 1373 (5th Cir. 1984). The preference for the older authority is clearly appropriate here, where <em>Jeteo </em>has been acknowledged repeatedly as the law of this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\"><em>Jeteo </em>and the cases interpreting it tell us that a premature notice of appeal properly may invoke this court\u2019s jurisdiction. We recognize, of course, that this rule is subject to the exceptions mandated by Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, Alcorn County\u2019s notice of appeal was filed after the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial and is not, under a literal reading of the rule, ineffective. We join the Third Circuit in holding that a premature notice of appeal does invoke appellate jurisdiction except in the narrow circumstances described in Rule 4(a)(4). <em>See Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, </em>698 F.2d 179 (3d Cir.1983). Accordingly, we hold that the notice of appeal filed by Alcorn County on January 3, 1983, was effective, and we turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-12\">The district court held that, as a matter of law, Alcorn County was not entitled to submit to the jury its RICO claims or its claim for punitive damages under state law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Reviewing these holdings in turn, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>reverse the judgment of the district court with respect to the RICO claim and affirm its judgment with respect to punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The district court was of the opinion that Alcorn County could not prevail under the civil remedy section of RICO because the county had not alleged or presented evidence tending to prove that the defendants were connected to organized crime. We hold, in the first instance, that, in the light of recently decided cases, the district court\u2019s interpretation of the requirements of RICO was erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, we find that the county adduced evidence sufficient to require the submission of its civil RICO claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Until a few weeks ago, this circuit had not addressed whether a civil RICO plaintiff must allege or prove that its injury was caused by the operation of organized crime. In <em>Owl Construction Co., Inc. v. Ronald Adams Contractor, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 540 (5th Cir.1984), we held that it was error to dismiss a civil RICO complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because the plaintiff did not allege a tie to organized crime. This holding is in accordance with the positions of the Second, Seventh and Eighth Circuits,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and extends this circuit\u2019s rule for criminal RICO prosecutions to the civil arena.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s rationale for directing a verdict against Alcorn County on its civil RICO claim, i.e., that civil RICO redresses only the claims of those harmed by the activities of organized crime, was, therefore, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-12\">On review of the trial transcript, we find that Alcorn County presented sufficient evidence in support of its civil RICO claim to survive the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. In reviewing a directed verdict, we must reverse and remand for trial if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom it was rendered, \u201creasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions____\u201d <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc). Viewing this directed verdict in the light of <em>Boeing, </em>we conclude that we must reverse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-14\">Broadly stated, a civil RICO claimant must prove (1) a violation of the substantive RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962, and (2) an injury to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbusiness or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). In order to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), the plaintiff must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>(1) the existence of an enterprise which affects interstate or foreign commerce;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-4\">(2) that the defendant [was \u201cemployed by\u201d or] \u201cassociated with\u201d the enterprise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-5\">(3) that the defendant participated in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-6\">(4) that the participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity, i.e., by committing at least two acts of racketeering activity designated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1961(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\"><em>United States v. Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1011 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find, in reviewing the transcript of the trial in this case, that Alcorn County did in fact produce substantial evidence tending to prove each of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">The plaintiffs maintain that the conduct of Cutchens, Creditor and USIS, which clearly affected interstate commerce, was an \u201centerprise\u201d within the meaning of RICO. The definition of \u201centerprise\u201d for purposes of RICO is very broad, and we think it beyond doubt that a reasonable jury could find that the association of Cutchens, USIS and its employees Creditor and Savitz, for the purpose of selling supplies to Alcorn County, constituted an enterprise affecting interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 625-26 (5th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similarly, there was substantial evidence that the individual defendants and USIS were \u201cassociated with\u201d this enterprise. Cutchens testified about specific actions of the individual defendants and USIS, acting in its corporate capacity, which advanced the goal of the enterprise, that is, to sell the office supplies to Alcorn County and to conceal those sales from county officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">Finally, Cutchens\u2019 testimony, if believed, established that the defendants participated in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity as defined in section 1961(1) and (5). That section requires proof that each defendant committed at least two acts, within a specified time frame not relevant here, from an extensive list of predicate offenses. This list includes \u201cany act or threat involving murder, kidnaping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in narcotic or other dangerous drugs, which is chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year____\u201d In <em>Phillips, </em>we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-14\">RICO does not criminalize engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity standing alone; the gravamen of a RICO offense is the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.... The two predicate crimes need not be related to each other but must be related to the affairs of the enterprise____ It does not matter that each defendant participated in the affairs of the enterprise through different or unrelated crimes, so long as an inference may be drawn that each crime was intended to further the enterprise\u2019s affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">664 F.2d at 1011-12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-18\">Cutchens testified that on many occasions USIS sent her \u201cgifts\u201d in exchange for her cooperation in purchasing supplies from USIS and that USIS falsified some invoices so that the transactions would be easier for Cutchens to hide. She also testified that Creditor and Rado threatened her when she attempted to end her participation in the scheme. Cutchens\u2019 testimony constitutes substantial evidence that the defendants violated, on several occasions, MISS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 97-11-53. That criminal statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-19\">No person shall directly or indirectly offer, promise, give or agree to give to any public official ... any money, property, or other tangible or intangible thing of value as an inducement or incentive for (a) the awarding or refusal to award a [public] contract ... (b) the purchase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>sale or lease of [public] property ... or (c) the accomplishment of any official act or purpose involving public funds or public trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Violations of this section are punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment. The violations of a state anti-bribery statute, as alleged by Alcorn County and shown by the testimony offered at trial, clearly constitute the predicate offenses needed to establish a pattern of racketeering activity under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) and (5). <em>See United States v. Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d 1181, 1186 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 1451, 1617, 71 L.Ed.2d 663 (1982).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The testimony of Cutchens, if believed by the jury, establishes that she, Creditor and USIS through the commission of these acts, constituting a pattern of racketeering activity, participated in an \u201centerprise\u201d which affected interstate commerce. The evidence of the violations of MISS.CODE ANN. \u00a7 97-11-53 is sufficient to warrant submitting the issue of a section 1962(c) violation to the jury. We therefore make no comment on evidence of other predicate offenses on which Alcorn County might rely on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">Having concluded that there was substantial evidence of a substantive RICO violation, we now examine whether there was evidence that this violation damaged the business of Alcorn County. A state auditor testified that the county had paid more than market price for the products it purchased from USIS and that the county had not received supplies for which it had paid. The auditor\u2019s testimony was supported by extensive documentary evidence. Although our review is somewhat limited by virtue of the fact that the defendants have not addressed the sufficiency of the county\u2019s evidence of damages, we find that the injury shown by the county through the auditor\u2019s testimony is compensable under section 1964(c). Most courts have read the \u201cinjury\u201d requirement of section 1964(c) broadly. <em>See, e.g., Schact v. Brown, </em>711 F.2d 1343, 1353-59 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 508, 509, 78 L.Ed.2d 698 (1983); <em>Bennett v. Berg, </em>685 F.2d at 1059. We find particularly relevant the holding of <em>Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. O\u2019Hearn, </em>523 F.Supp. 244 (S.D.N.Y.1981). In that ease, the district court held that a shipping company could recover damages resulting from the payment of kickbacks, padded bills and bribes. The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afg-dedup-1\">[T]he broad remedial purposes of RICO clearly permits private law suits by a firm forced to pay bribes or kickbacks of any kind. Hellenic was directly injured if, as alleged, it paid for services it never received, the proceeds of which were used to pay off Hellenic employees and to bribe union officials. RICO was addressed to the precise form of racketeering activity which allegedly took place here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">523 F.Supp. at 248. The injury alleged by Alcorn County in this case, including unauthorized purchases at inflated prices, procured by bribery and threats, and payment for goods never received, falls within the scope of a civil RICO action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">The district court, therefore, erred in refusing to submit the issue of damages under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">Whether Alcorn County was entitled to submit its claim for punitive damages to the jury is a somewhat more difficult question, because the theory under which the county seeks punitive damages is unclear to us. Alcorn County has never in this litigation pressed a claim for compensatory or actual damages under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">In an effort to ascertain the theory under which the county sought this recovery, we have examined carefully its complaint. First, the county maintains that the contracts of sale between it and USIS were illegal and, therefore, \u201cvoid, or in the alternative, rescinded.\u201d The county states that it was entitled \u201cto recover of and from [USIS] all ... payments in the total amount of $45,421.39.\u201d It is clear, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>Alcorn County has not argued differently, that this claim is a request for the equitable remedy of rescission, predicated on the illegality of the contracts with USIS. The county makes no request for actual or punitive damages with respect to its claim for reimbursement of monies paid to the defendants. Second, the complaint sets forth allegations of embezzlement, conversion of county funds and conspiracy to violate Mississippi\u2019s public purchase laws. It makes no claim for actual damages. It does, however, request punitive damages of $250,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Punitive damages are given as an enhancement of compensatory damages and, in most jurisdictions, are not recoverable in the absence of a properly pleaded and proven cause of action for actual damages. 22 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Damages, </em>\u00a7 241. Mississippi law follows this general rule. <em>Lenaz v. Conway, </em>234 Miss. 231, 105 So.2d 762 (1958). In many states, punitive damages are not recoverable at all in a court of equity. 22 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Damages, </em>\u00a7 239. Although Mississippi has recently adopted a rule allowing the award of punitive damages by its chancery courts, <em>Tideway Oil Programs, Inc. v. Serio, </em>431 So.2d 454 (Miss.1983), nothing in that case suggests any deviation from the rule of <em>Lenaz v. Conway. </em>There simply is no independent cause of action for punitive damages under Mississippi law, and that is, in effect, what the county has asserted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">Applying these rules to Alcorn County\u2019s request for punitive damages in this case, we must affirm the verdict of the district court. The county chose, through its complaint, to seek an equitable remedy of cancellation or rescission rather than the legal remedy of contract damages. Neither did the county seek actual damages based upon tort law. While actual damages in this case may have been approximately the same as the amount sought for rescission, they were not sought as such. Actual damages, however, would have excluded the real value of the supplies actually received and used or retained by the county. Moreover, in the district court the county\u2019s attorney, in support of his motion for a directed verdict, argued <em>solely </em>for recovery based on rescission and never mentioned recovery based on actual damages. In any event, the relief which the county requested was not damages, but restitution of amounts paid by it to USIS. This rescission relief restored the plaintiff to the position it would have been in had no contract been made. That is what Alcorn County asked for, received, and did not appeal. Had the county chosen to plead and present a contract or tort claim against the defendants in this case, the issue of punitive damages might have been appropriately submitted to the jury. However, choosing as it did to make no claim for actual damages and to receive and retain equitable judgment for rescission, the county had no claim for punitive damages.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">Therefore, we affirm the directed verdict against Alcorn County on its claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">Because the district court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the county\u2019s claims for treble damages under RICO, we must reverse the judgment below and remand the case for a new trial on the RICO claims. In so doing, we note that this claim is a complex one and will require carefully prepared jury instructions. Although there is a paucity of precedent on the civil RICO issue, the district court on remand will have the advantage of a number of appellate eases decided since this case was first tried; <em>e.g., Owl Construction Co., Inc. v. Ronald Adams Contractor, Inc., </em>727 F.2d at 540, 541, <em>and cases cited therein. </em>Criminal cases construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962 will, of course, be relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>to the question whether a violation of that section has been proved, although the standard of proof in a civil RICO case is not as stringent as in a criminal case. <em>United States v. Cappetto, </em>502 F.2d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Finally, it appears to us that a jury verdict awarding the county treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c) could duplicate the recovery already had on the rescission claim and the award of attorney\u2019s fees on January 28, 1983. These issues relating to double recovery are not before us today, however, and we are reluctant to comment on them in the absence of guidance from the parties and a more developed record of the facts. We merely note that duplicative damages should not be allowed. To the extent that duplication may be found to present a fact issue, special interrogatories submitted to the jury could help the court avoid such duplication in the entry of final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">. USIS maintained throughout the trial that Sav-itz and Creditor were independent contractors who made contracts for the sale of supplies, then sold those contracts for a commission to USIS, which filled the orders. The trial court held, however, that under California law, Savitz and Creditor were employees of USIS, rendering USIS liable for their torts. This holding has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-9\"><em>. </em>Alcorn County filed its notice of appeal thirty days after the denial of its Rule 59(e) motion for a new trial. It relied on the fact that it served on the defendants the motion for a new trial on November 29, 1982, believing that this motion tolled the running of the time for appeal until thirty days after its disposition, January 3, 1983, in this case. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). The motion for a new trial was not filed on time, however, and our cases make it clear that the consideration by the district court of an untimely motion for a new trial does not interrupt the running of the thirty-day period for filing a notice of appeal. <em>Alvestad v.

Although we are bound to follow the rule of <em>Holmes </em>as the law of this circuit, in so doing we note the difficulties it may create for litigants. Some commentators have suggested a per se approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-7\">It is best to read <em>[White v. New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Security </em>] as establishing a clear rule. A judgment otherwise final is appealable even though the court has not disposed of attorney fee issues, without regard to the time at which attorney fees were requested or the theory underlying the request. The great virtue of this rule is clarity. It will forestall any need to worry whether a judgment that fails to pass upon a demand for fees in the complaint is not final, in the way that judgments that fail to dispose of all requests for relief are not final. It will avoid any period of uncertainty as courts work through questions whether some grounds for recovering fees are less separable from the merits than the ground involved in this case. 15 Wright, Miller, and Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3915 (Supp.1983) 308-09 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT4\">The Tenth Circuit (1982) has adopted this approach to finality. In <em>Cox v. Flood, </em>it held that \"judgments finally disposing of the merits are appealable even though questions relating to attorney\u2019s fees have been left undecided.\u201d 683 F.2d 330 at 331. The court in so holding apparently assumed that a request for attorney's fees is never a part of the merits of the case, even an action under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15. The Third Circuit, too, has read the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>White </em>to create a broad, per se rule of finality: \"(Ojrders disposing finally of the merits are appealable even though the questions relating to attorney\u2019s fees have been left undetermined.\u201d <em>Halderman v. Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital, </em>673 F.2d 628, 644 (3d Cir.1982) (en banc).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1223-14\">.

In passing, though, we note the opinion of Judge Marshall of the Northern District of Illinois, that the holding of <em>Cappetto </em>should be read to apply only to cases for injunctive relief brought under section 1964(a) and not to actions for civil damages under section 1964(c). <em>NSC International Corp. v.

The district court made its decision in November 1982, before many of the cases interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), on which we now rely, were decided. At that time several courts had held that the involvement of organized crime was a necessary component of a civil RICO action. <em>See, e.g., Waterman Steamship Corp. v.
