HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1598-7\">A jury convicted appellants of conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976), and felonious failure to file currency transaction reports (CTRs) with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1059, 1081, 1082 (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and regulations promulgated under those provisions. Ample evidence supported the convictions. Neither appellant asserted that the CTRs were actually filed. Nevertheless, we must reverse the convictions because appellants were prohibited from establishing their one plausible line of defense, good faith reliance on advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-9\">Appellant Ghitis owned and operated a currency exchange business in Cali, Colombia. Ghitis testified that the major thrust of his business concerned buying American dollars and exchanging them for Colombian pesos or for checks or money orders. According to Ghitis, a typical exchange transaction involved four steps: (1) Ghitis agreed to buy American dollars from a seller in Colombia; (2) the seller directed his agent in the United States to deposit the dollars in Ghitis\u2019 U.S. bank account; (3) Ghitis verified the deposit; and (4) Ghitis gave the seller pesos or checks to cover the amount deposited. Later, Ghitis hired Appellant Eisenstein to run a branch office for the currency exchange in Miami, enabling Eisenstein, rather than the seller\u2019s agent, to make the deposits and report the transactions to Ghitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-16\">The Government introduced Ghitis\u2019 business records for the first eight months of 1981 to show that the exchange business took in more than $240 million during that period. Bank officials in Miami, no doubt alerted by the staggering amounts of money flowing into Ghitis\u2019 account, told Eisenstein in January of 1981 that he was required to file CTRs for the currency exchange for any transaction that exceeds $10,000. Eisenstein promised to ask Ghitis about the CTRs. Eisenstein later assured bank officials that he had mentioned the CTRs to Ghitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-17\">However, no CTRs were filed by Ghitis or Eisenstein. They were thus indicted for failing to report a $1 million transaction that occurred in late February of 1981 and a $1.5 million transaction that occurred in March of 1981. In addition, the indictment alleged a conspiracy to violate the reporting laws and a pattern of illegal activity involving currency transactions in excess of $100,000 in a twelve-month period. Both appellants were convicted on all counts\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-18\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-19\">Ghitis and Eisenstein appeal their convictions on several grounds. In light of our decision to reverse, we reach only two of the issues raised by appellants\u2019 arguments: (1) whether appellants\u2019 currency exchange business was a \u201cdomestic financial institution\u201d covered by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1081; and (2) whether the district court erroneously excluded evidence that appellants relied in good faith on the advice of counsel in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>fusing to file the CTRs. We conclude that the statute covers Ghitis\u2019 business but that the erroneous exclusion of highly relevant evidence requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-5\">A. <em>Domestic Financial Institutions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-6\">By enacting the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to require certain types of financial institutions to report currency transactions. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 (1976) (revised version at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (1982)). Under the Act, \u201cdomestic financial institutions\u201d must report any exchange of United States currency exceeding the amount prescribed by the Treasury Secretary. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1081 (1976) (revised version at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313 (1982)). The Secretary has promulgated regulations that require such institutions to report exchanges involving more than $10,-000. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-7\">Appellants concede that on at least two occasions they completed currency exchange transactions involving more than $10,000. They argue, however, that they were not required to file reports on the transactions because their currency exchange business is not a <em>domestic </em>financial institution within .the meaning of the Act. Appellants base their argument on the testimony of Ghitis that all transactions were negotiated and completed in Colombia, leaving nothing for Eisenstein to do in Miami except deposit the money and report to Ghitis in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-8\">We find appellants\u2019 reasoning unpersuasive. The statutory definition of \u201cdomestic\u201d is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-9\">The term \u201cdomestic\u201d used in reference to institutions or agencies, limits the applicability of the provision wherein it appears to the performance by such institutions or agencies of functions within the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1599-10\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(f) (1976) (revised version at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5312(b) (1982)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-13\">Appellants\u2019 currency exchange business performs \u201cfunctions within the United States\u201d by receiving dollars in the United States, by depositing the money in a U.S. bank, and by relaying information about each transaction from Miami to headquarters in Colombia. Therefore, the business was a \u201cdomestic financial institution\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-14\">B. <em>Reliance on Advice of Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1599-15\">Only <em>willful </em>failures to file CTRs are subject to criminal penalties under the Act. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1058 (1976) (revised version at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5322 (1982)). The law of this circuit is well established that, as it is used in the currency reporting statute, the term <em>\u201cwillful </em>require[s] proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the reporting requirement and his specific intent to commit the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Granda, </em>565 F.2d 922, 926 (5th Cir.1978). Congress no doubt made the failure to file CTRs a specific intent crime because, without knowledge of the reporting requirement, a would-be violator cannot be expected to recognize the illegality of his otherwise innocent act. <em>See id. </em>at 925-26; <em>United States v. Warren, </em>612 F.2d 887, 890 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956, 100 S.Ct. 2928, 64 L.Ed.2d 815 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-16\">A defendant charged with violating the reporting statute can attempt to negate proof of specific intent by establishing the defense of good faith reliance on advice of counsel. <em>United States v. Bush, </em>599 F.2d 72, 76-78 (5th Cir.1979). In order to take advantage of this defense, the defendant must show that he relied in good faith after first making a full disclosure of all facts that are relevant to the advice for which he consulted the attorney. <em>See United States v. Taglione, </em>546 F.2d 194, 200-01 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Bursten v. United States, </em>395 F.2d 976, 981-82 (5th Cir.1968). When the defendant presents evidence that he disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>all relevant facts to his attorney and relied on the attorney\u2019s advice based on the disclosure, the trial court must instruct the jury on the defense of good faith reliance on counsel. <em>Bursten v. United, States, </em>395 F.2d at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">Here, the trial court gave appellants\u2019 requested instruction on the advice of counsel defense. The jury was told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1600-5\">Among their defenses, the defendants claim that they are not guilty of willful wrongdoing because they acted on the basis of advice from an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1600-6\">If a defendant, before taking any action, sought the advice of an attorney whom he considered competent, in good faith and for the purpose of securing advice on the lawfulness of his possible future conduct, and made a full and accurate report to his attorney of all material facts of which he has the means of knowledge concerning, in this case, the necessity of filing a currency transaction report, that is, IRS Form 4789, and acted strictly in accordance with the advice of his attorney, given following his full report, then the defendant would not be willfully doing wrong in omitting something the law requires, as that term is used in these instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1600-7\">Whether a defendant acted in good faith for the purpose of seeking guidance as to the questions about which he is in doubt, and whether he made a full and complete report to his attorney concerning the necessity of filing a currency transaction report[,] IRS Form 4789, and whether he acted strictly in accordance with the advice received are questions for you to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1600-8\">Record on Appeal at 770-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-9\">Clearly, the instructions emphasized the importance of the \u201cfull disclosure\u201d requirement. The jury, however, was deprived of evidence that was relevant, indeed crucial, to its determination of whether Ghitis and Eisenstein made a \u201cfull and complete report\u201d to their attorney. After defense counsel established that Ghitis and Eisenstein met with their attorney on at least one occasion prior, to the acts charged in the indictment, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and the attorney on whose advice appellants allegedly relied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1600-11\">BY MR.

The lawyer\u2019s testimony was not offered as proof of the matter <em>asserted </em>\u2014 i.e., that Ghitis and Eisenstein operated a currency exchange \u2014 but as evidence that Ghitis fully disclosed the nature of his business to his attorney. The testimony was admissible to show the attorney\u2019s knowledge and to show Ghitis\u2019 compliance with the \u201cfull disclosure\u201d requirement of his advice of counsel defense. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(3); <em>cf United States v. McLennan, </em>563 F.2d 943, 945-47 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 1607, 56 L.Ed.2d 60 (1978) (\u201cWhen the defense is advice of counsel, the advice given, whether correct or not, and whether recitals in it are true or not, is always admissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-40\">Perhaps it is unrealistic to suggest that the operators of a business exchanging nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in one eight-month period could be unaware of, or uncertain about, these reporting require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>ments. Nevertheless, in our system of American justice, a defendant must be allowed the opportunity to try to establish the suggested unrealism. The lawyer\u2019s testimony might not have been credible. Ghitis and Eisenstein might have been fanciful to argue their lack of knowledge about the reporting requirements. Still, the issue was one for the jury to decide on the presentation of all relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-4\">While it may stretch credulity to believe that anyone engaged in a business such as appellants\u2019 might not know of these reporting requirements, it is equally difficult to believe that the Government\u2019s prosecuting attorney was unaware of the relevance of the testimony sought to be elicited from Ghitis\u2019 attorney. In order for appellants to establish their good faith reliance on advice of counsel, it was <em>necessarily relevant </em>for the lawyer to tell the jury the nature of the enterprise presented to him by Ghitis and Eisenstein and upon which he gave his advice. It was of scant relevance that the lawyer might have told appellants that they were not required to file CTRs unless it also appeared that the lawyer had been fully advised of the operations of their business. Appellants were required to show that, as to this particular enterprise, the lawyer advised them not to be concerned about the CTRs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-5\">The Government, although conceding that the lawyer\u2019s testimony should have been admitted, argues that any error was harmless because Ghitis testified as to the substance of his conversations with the lawyer and, in any case, because the attorneys for both sides argued to the jury as if Ghitis actually made a full disclosure. Hence, the government urges that the lawyer's testimony was merely cumulative of evidence already before the jury and that appellants can show no harm resulting from the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-7\">We are not convinced by the Government\u2019s \u201charmless error\u201d argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we have said, it might have been unrealistic to suggest that Ghitis and Eisenstein, operators of a business of this magnitude, relied in good faith on the advice of their attorney that they were not required to file these reports. However, even though it might be true that appellants would have been convicted for the lack of credibility of their only defense, the harm in having been denied such a defense is highlighted by the fact that, weak as it might have been, reliance on advice of counsel was appellants\u2019 only defense. The evidence of full disclosure, consisting entirely of Ghitis\u2019 unsupported testimony, could have been corroborated by his lawyer. The trial judge\u2019s failure to permit this highly relevant testimony cannot be dismissed as harmless error. Therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1598-13\">. The applicable provisions of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act were originally codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-83 (1976). After revision and recodification, those provisions now appear at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5301-22 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1599-11\">. As revised, the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1599-12\">\"[D]omestic financial agency\u201d and \"domestic financial institution\u201d apply to an action in the United States of a financial agency or institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-1\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5312(b)(1) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1601-41\">. The trial court missed its best opportunity to avoid its erroneous exclusion of the lawyer's testimony on hearsay grounds when it refused to permit defense counsel to explain this line of questioning. Had the judge heard counsel\u2019s explanation, the testimony might have come in and we would not today be required to reverse otherwise valid convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1602-16\">. If anything, the. Government\u2019s \u201charmless error\" theory illustrates how unwise it might have been for the prosecutor to have misled the judge into making this error. By keeping the lawyer\u2019s testimony from the jury, the prosecutor excluded evidence tending to support his theory that Ghitis and Eisenstein must have known about the reporting requirements. If the lawyer\u2019s testimony agreed with that of Ghitis, then from the extent of the disclosure made by Ghitis to the lawyer the prosecutor might have argued, and the jury might well have agreed, that appellants knew about the CTRs and realized that they were required to file such reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
