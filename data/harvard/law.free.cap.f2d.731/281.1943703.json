BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b341-30\">We deal today not with substance but with form. On appeal is a two-sentence order dismissing an employee\u2019s claim for sickness and accident benefits assertedly due him from his employer. Because the enigmatic form of this decision by the District Court prevents us from discerning\u2014 and thus reaching \u2014 its underlying substance, we vacate the order and remand for an explanation of the dismissal. Nevertheless, the case teaches a lesson: succinctness, no less than beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-31\">John Myers is a first class boilermaker at the Port Arthur, Texas refinery of the Gulf Oil Corporation. Myers is also a member of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, which through its local chapter represents many of the workers at the Port Arthur refinery. In January 1979, Gulf and the Union entered into a collective bargaining Contract effective through January 1981. Part of the Contract was a Supplemental Agreement cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ering certain welfare benefit plans for the employees, including a Plan for sickness and accident benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In January 1980, the Union went on strike on certain issues, as allowed under a stipulation in the Contract. Initially, Myers participated in the strike, which was to last until May 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">On February 5, 1980, Myers was injured when he engaged in a fight on behalf of a fellow striker, identified as Ricky Clark. Clark, who was on the picketline, was either being beaten by or beating on two other men. When Myers jumped in, one of the other men slashed out at him with a knife, seriously cutting Myers\u2019 left hand. The treatment and rehabilitation of his hand prevented Myers from returning to work with other workers on May 27, 1980 when the strike ended. Myers returned to his job in March 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Myers did not receive any benefits under the sickness and accident Plan relating to the injury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sued in federal court to recover them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Gulf answered and made a motion alternatively to dismiss or for summary judgment. It argued that Myers failed to exhaust his administrative remedy under the Plan (an appeal to the refinery manager), as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>He also failed to join the Union, which, Gulf argued, was an indispensable party to the suit. It said that Myers sought an adjudication of the Contract and Supplemental Agreement, which would include an inquiry into the Union\u2019s intent in entering into those agreements. Gulf further asserted that the Contract and Supplemental Agreement expressly allowed Gulf to suspend payment of sickness and accident benefits to employees participating in a strike.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, it added, an administrative law judge had upheld such an interpretation in a prior, unrelated proceeding. Finally, Myers\u2019 claims were waived, Gulf argued, when the Union agreed at the strike\u2019s conclusion to abandon any pending claims, and forego future suits, regarding the strike and the benefit plans under the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">As might be expected, Myers sought to counter each of Gulf\u2019s arguments. He claimed that no exhaustion was required because the Plan and his suit were not under ERISA, and, anyway, the remedy under the Plan was wholly inadequate and thus futile. He argued that the Union was not an indispensable party, because the agreements were unambiguous on their face and could be interpreted without looking into the Union\u2019s intent. Even if the agreements were ambiguous, he said, join-der not dismissal was the appropriate recourse. He emphasized that Gulf had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>contractual duty to pay the benefits since they were in the nature of accrued benefits for past work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lastly, Myers characterized the benefits as individual entitlements, which the Union could not waive for its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Thereafter, Myers and Gulf agreed to submit the case to the District Court on stipulated facts, on certain evidence introduced at Myers\u2019 prior suit, <em>see supra, </em>n. 3, and on memorandums of law. They raised essentially the same legal arguments as in their previous discourse over the dismissal/summary judgment motion. In addition, Gulf contended that the Plan was merely a voluntary wage continuation policy funded out of current assets, which did not involve accrued benefits as Myers asserted. Also, it pointed out that injury from fighting was expressly excluded from the Plan. Myers responded that his actions were taken in defense of a fellow striker and thus fell within the \u201cself-defense\u201d exception to the \u201cfighting\u201d exclusion. Again, Gulf moved to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">At that juncture, the Trial Judge issued its Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Having considered the Defendant\u2019s MOTION TO DISMISS Oil IN THE ALTERNATIVE FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, and having reviewed the pleadings, the stipulated facts, and the legal memoranda, the Court is of the opinion that the Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED, because the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">The cause is DISMISSED, costs assessed against the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ame-dedup-0\">From those sixty-five words, Myers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">The District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is pithy to the point of being incomplete. Both parties raised numerous legal and factual arguments which the Order left wholly unanswered: Was the Contract unambiguously clear in allowing Gulf\u2019s action? Or, was it ambiguous, so that the Union must be a party to the action? Why then dismissal and not join-der? Did Myers have to exhaust his remedy under the Plan? Were his claims waived by the Union\u2019s concession at the conclusion of the strike? Did Myers not act in \u201cself-defense\u201d under the Plan? Did the Plan merely provide continued wages and not accrued benefits for past work?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Gulf tries to support the Trial Judge\u2019s decision by rearguing the contentions it made at various points below. It stresses that this Court has held, under F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), that findings of fact and conclusions of law are not necessary in grants of summary judgment, so long as there remain no genuine issues of material fact.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">Gulf argues in vain. It has as little inkling of the reasons for the Order of dismissal as have we.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">As this Court recently stated Although nothing in F.R.Civ.P. 56, governing summary judgment, technically requires a statement of reasons by a trial judge for granting a motion for summary judgment, we have many times emphasized the importance of a detailed discussion by the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-18\"><em>Heller v. Namer, </em>666 F.2d 905, 911 (5th Cir.1982) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>have no notion of the basis for a district court\u2019s decision, because its reasoning is vague or was simply left unsaid, there is little opportunity for effective review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In such cases, we have not hesitated to remand the case for an illumination of the court\u2019s analysis through some formal or informal statement of reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Clearly, \u201cIn all but the simplest case, such a statement [is] not only helpful, but essential.\u201d <em>Jot-Em-Down Store (JEDS) Inc. v. Cotter &amp; Co., </em>651 F.2d 245, 247 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Because the District Court gives no indication from which we can accurately predict its basis for granting summary judgment for Gulf, we cannot adequately review its decision. Thus, we vacate the Order and remand for findings and conclusions consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\">.

It is agreed that Myers could have received about $10,700 \u2014 $5,100 for the period between his injury and the end of the strike, and $5,600 from that date until the expiration of his eligibility under the Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\">. Myers also sued Gulf and Saga Food Services (who employed the other men involved in the fight) for damages from his injury. Gulf was severed from the action and found not liable. Saga Food was found liable. Myers was found '50% contributorily negligent. The amount of damages was settled between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-11\">. Article 1(6) of the Supplemental Agreement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">\n<em>No Strikes or Lockouts:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV\">The Company and the Union agree that there shall be no strikes or lockouts arising out of the provisions of this Supplemental Agreement during the term hereof. [1] <em>In the event of a strike arising out of any labor dispute, other than one arising out of the provisions of this Supplemental Agreement during the term hereof, there shall be no impairment or abrogation of any employee's rights hereunder; </em>however, it is understood and agreed that [2] <em>for the duration of such strike no employer or employee contributions shall be made to any welfare benefit plan for striking employees, and no service credits shall be accrued by such striking employees who are represented by the Union.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6jF\">(Emphasis and bracketed numbers added.) Gulf pointed to italicized portion [2] of the clause in support of its interpretation.
