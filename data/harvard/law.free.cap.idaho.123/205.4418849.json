While at work reviewing a sheet of building specifications, Hopkins was struck in the left eye by a three inch nail and was permanently injured. At the time of this incident, a coworker was nearby, operating a pneumatic nail gun, which was manufactured by Duo-Fast.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Duo-Fast provided Northwest with nail guns and in exchange Northwest purchased all of its nails and other fasteners from Duo-Fast.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Plaintiffs brought a product liability action against Duo-Fast, alleging defects in the nails and nail guns manufactured by Duo-Fast. The plaintiffs\u2019 theory at trial was that the nail gun which injured Steven Hopkins should have been provided with a safety device known as a \u201cdrop-off,\u201d that drop-offs were not provided by Duo-Fast as standard equipment on all of its nail guns, and that some of the nails manufactured by Duo-Fast for the nail guns were of a dimension that would allow them to escape from the guns in tandem. Without the drop-off attachment, when one nail was fired another nail might also be fired from the nail gun on a different trajectory. The gun used by the co-worker did not have a drop-off attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">During the trial, the defendants\u2019 expert, Bookwalter, modified what had been his earlier testimony in deposition, as the result of determining during the course of direct examination of plaintiffs\u2019 witness that he had been provided erroneous information as to the size of the nail head used in the nail gun in question. Bookwalter had been provided the nail head dimension by the defendants based upon information the defendants had provided in the course of discovery to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs objected to this revised testimony; after inquiry, the court permitted the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">An additional defense expert witness, Dr. Blotter, had had his deposition taken approximately two weeks prior to the commencement of the trial by the plaintiffs, had described the testing and analysis performed by him at that deposition, and rendered an opinion.' Subsequent to this deposition, and prior to his testimony, Dr. Blotter performed additional tests and analysis which changed his testimony to the effect that the nail gun did not generate the velocity required for the accident to have occurred as described by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Defense counsel informed plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of this contemplated change in testimony the morning that Dr. Blotter was to testify. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel timely objected to the testimony which after inquiry was permitted over plaintiffs\u2019 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">After both parties presented lay and expert testimony, a jury returned a-verdict for Duo-Fast. The jury determined that Duo-Fast did not manufacture an unreasonably dangerous or defective product, and that no warranties had been breached by Duo-Fast.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">The issues framed by the plaintiff on appeal with which we must deal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">1. Did the trial court err in permitting testimony of defendants\u2019 experts where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">(a) the defendants\u2019 expert deposition testimony was based on information concerning product condition provided by the defendant to the defendants\u2019 expert and where the defendant divulged, for the first time at trial, that the information upon which its expert relied and testified at deposition was in error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-18\">(b) the opinions expressed by the defendants\u2019 expert witness at the time of his deposition were changed prior to trial, but no notice was given of the changed testimony to the plaintiffs until the day of testimony at trial of the defendants\u2019 expert witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(c) additional tests and analyses were performed after the deposition of the defendants\u2019 experts and the results of said tests and analyses were not provided to counsel for plaintiffs until the day of the experts\u2019 testimony at trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">2. Did the trial court err in giving the jury a limiting instruction with regard to the introduction of defendants\u2019 safety bulletin, plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 18?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN PERMITTING THE DISPUTED TESTIMONY OF DEFENDANTS\u2019 EXPERT WITNESSES</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The testimony of Jeffrey Bookwalter, to which appellants object, was a result of Mr. Bookwalter learning during the course of plaintiffs\u2019 examination of its witness that Bookwalter had used a different dimension nail head than Hopkins\u2019 witness Mr. Novak. Bookwalter used the dimension supplied by Novak (plaintiffs\u2019 witness) rather than that he had used earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">After the timely objection of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the testimony of Bookwalter, the court made inquiry and determined that Mr. Bookwalter had relied upon engineering drawings of the nails, which were supplied by the defendants to the plaintiffs during discovery, and which became, during this trial, Exhibit 8. These engineering drawings were drawings of a nail then in use, but were of a dimension different than that which was in use at the time of the accident, March 4, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">During plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, they called Mr. Novak to establish the actual size of the head of the nail in use at the time of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. It was during this testimony that Mr. Bookwalter learned for the first time that the information upon which he was relying was improper. Mr. Bookwalter then adjusted his analysis to reflect the evidence introduced by plaintiffs in their case-in-chief, as to the actual nail head dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The issue, as to the testimony of Dr. Blotter was framed based upon deposition testimony taken approximately two weeks prior to the trial date, and the proffered testimony of Dr. Blotter at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">During the deposition of Dr. Blotter, an expert hired by Duo-Fast, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Dr. Blotter whether or not he was going to conduct more tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">Q. Are there any other opinions that you are going to be expressing in this trial in terms of areas of your evaluation that we haven\u2019t already discussed that you can think of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-14\">A. Well, that will depend upon Mr. Farley [opposing counsel] and it will depend on the development of the case. I think if something comes up that needs a technical response as an expert, then I would respond to that request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3o\">Q. Dr. Blotter, you can understand I am sure also that I am representing a client and I do not want to be ambushed by new information that comes out ten minutes or two days before trial. You understand that, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">A. Yes, but could I also expect that you would welcome with a welcome hand anything that would add to the truthfulness as to what would happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-17\">Q. If I had an opportunity to test its truthfulness, yes, but I don\u2019t want you to be the sole judge of that. I want to know if you anticipate doing any further work on this [in] advance of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7h\">Deposition of Dr. Blotter, 87-88 (taken August 31, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">On the morning of the day that Dr. Blotter testified at trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">\u201cMR. HOWARD [counsel for Hopkins]: Over the break I asked Mr. Farley if there\u2019s any additional work that had been done by Dr. Blotter, who is his next expert witness he intends to call.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">\u201cHe indicated to me that there was. The court afforded me the opportunity to talk to Dr. Blotter, who\u2019s out in the hallway now. I took about 10 minutes to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">\u201cI guess I wanted to place my objection on the record. Also there\u2019s work that\u2019s been done by Dr. Blotter.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">\u201cWe continued his deposition because he had indicated at his deposition, and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Farley had, that he might want to do something more. And yet until I asked Mr. Farley this morning, I still wasn\u2019t told what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u201cAnd he did some force tests and he did some other calculations in regard to shear strength, which I haven\u2019t had a chance \u2014 I have talked to him about it. But as a practical matter, there is no way that I\u2019m going to be able to get into analyzing what he did so ... that I can effectively interrogate him on that.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cI wanted to place my objection on the record, which is essentially the same objection I placed on the record with regard to Mr. Blotter \u2014 Mr. Bookwalter. I\u2019m sorry. That I think it\u2019s the defendant's obligation to make that information available to me. Not 15 or 20 minutes before the witness goes on, but long enough for me to be able to meaningfully do something with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cAnd I guess I wanted to object to that. And he isn't on the stand yet, and I appreciate that. But this is in an effort to try and save some time with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Farley?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u201cI didn\u2019t know what Dr. Blotter had done until I met with him late last night. And there wasn\u2019t an opportunity for me to even advise Mr. Howard until this point during the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u201cThe work that he has done since his deposition was discussed at his deposition and Dr. Blotter alluded to it. He said, I have done this type of a qualitative analysis, but I haven\u2019t done a quantitative analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">\u201cAnd essentially that is what has been disclosed by Mr. Howard at this point. And building on the same information that was discussed at his deposition, what his quantitative analysis is based upon that.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\u201cHe\u2019s had the opportunity to talk to him, spend whatever time he wishes to spend with him. I don\u2019t know what else I can say. He\u2019s here, he\u2019s available for Mr. Howard to speak with for however long he wishes to speak with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\u201cIf he wishes to take his deposition before he testifies, since I know we\u2019re going to be going into tomorrow morning, I\u2019ve got no problem with paying for the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">\u201cThis is a product primarily of the schedule of Dr. Blotter. Period. I mean, he has not, by reason of his schedule, had an opportunity to do this kind of work until just now.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: What did he do specifically?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: At the time of his deposition, he had undertaken some trajectory tests and force tests in a qualitative sense in terms of, All right, this is the kind of thing I would like to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">\u201cSince his deposition, I learned last night that he has, in essence, done some force tests by going down into his lab. And he\u2019s taken the exemplar nailer that he has\u2014 which was discussed at his deposition \u2014 and he has driven nails with it to determine how much force is necessary in order to drive a nail. The same kind of thing, in fact, it\u2019s the same sort of numbers that Mr. Bookwalter has already testified to. In terms of the force required by this nailer in order to drive a nail into the wood. That\u2019s, in essence, what he\u2019s done in terms of additional tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">\u201cFrom that information, he has then done an analysis, if a nail were to be able to get into a position where it could come out to the back of the raceway, what kind of velocity would it have?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">\u201cHe had done velocity tests at the time his deposition was taken. And he, then and now, is prepared to talk about what kind of velocity a nail that would be projected out the back of the nose, if it got itself into that kind of a configuration, would have and whether or not that would be sufficient to reach the plaintiff in the location that he\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-21\">\u201cHe has also just utilized the same data that was discussed at Mr. Blotter \u2014 Dr. Blotter\u2019s deposition and <em>has arrived at a conclusion as to what he believes, how he believes the accident occurred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And is that a conclusion that he had not reached at the time that his deposition was taken?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u201cMR. HOWARD: <em>He didn\u2019t know any way that it could have occurred. </em>It could have occurred any number of ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: <em>That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: How does he conclude the accident occurred now?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: Based upon what his analysis has been, the substance of his opinion is that the accident could have occurred by a striking \u2014 or a high strike on the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u201cThe nail that was intended to go into the board or a second nail that, you know, after driving the nail that was intended to go and there\u2019s a bump on the edge of the board, the nail can project into the stack of lumber, and go up, and strike the plaintiff in the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">\u201cThat his analysis, based upon the velocity tests that he\u2019s done, which had been done previously, was that the velocity of the second nail wasn\u2019t sufficient. And even assuming all the things that the plaintiff has assumed as to how this accident occurred, that it was a second nail that got out the back of the raceway, what kind of velocity that kind of a nail would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>What did he conclude?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: <em>That it did not have sufficient velocity in order to reach the plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And he didn\u2019t give this opinion at the time of the deposition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: <em>Not that exact opinion. </em>But he talked about what kind of analysis he had done and what he was going to be doing in order to reach that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: And when did he do this additional work from which he reached\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: That I can\u2019t tell you. Because I don\u2019t know. Specifically time-wise, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know when he did it. It may have even been as late as yesterday, for all I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And this is the first time that it\u2019s been disclosed that the witness is going to say A, if the nail came out of the back of the gun </em>\u2014 or <em>if the second nail came out of the back of the gun, it wouldn\u2019t have sufficient velocity to hit the plaintiff?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: <em>That specific point, yes. </em>But the methodology and what he was going to be doing in that sense was discussed at his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And B, that this is the first time that the witness has given the opinion that the accident was caused by the intended nail going off in the wrong direction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: That was discussed at his deposition, Your Honor, as to whether or not, given the trajectory tests that he had done in the manner that he did them, you know, whether or not a nail \u2014 and what height a nail will get to.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">\u201cAnd he had already done those trajectory tests at the time of his deposition. <em>The conclusion that he draws from that has been a conclusion that he has arrived at since that time, of which I learned for the first time last night.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: When was this deposition taken?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-24\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: August 31st.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-25\">\u201cMR. HOWARD: Two weeks ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-26\">\u201cTHE COURT: When was he hired?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-27\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: When was he hired?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-28\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-29\">\u201cMR. HOWARD: Two months ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-30\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: About two months ago. That\u2019s about right.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-31\">\u201cBut he was made available before that. That was the only time that we could get Dr. Blotter and Ken Howard and me together to take the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-32\">\u201cTHE COURT: But it wouldn\u2019t have done any good to do it beforehand because he hadn\u2019t completed his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-33\">\u201cMR. FARLEY: Yes, I understand that.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-34\">\u201cMR. HOWARD: Your Honor, I would very much like to move this trial along. I realize that we\u2019ve promised the jury they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>would be out of here earlier than what they\u2019re really going to get out of here.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u201cAnd I guess I want to reserve my objection with regard to Dr. Blotter. And I don\u2019t know how else to move it along and reserve my objection, other than to make it and to see what he says.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid that we\u2019re going to anger this jury if we take time off for a deposition. And that\u2019s not going to help me anyway because I\u2019d have to pass that information by somebody else.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u201cAnd if we delay for a deposition or something, I mean, I\u2019d have to get'back ahold of Dr. Adams. And I\u2019d have to find out what he thought about the information so he could help me analyze it so I could make some head or tails of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cSo a short recess to take his deposition is really not going to do any good. And a long one, I think, might be counterproductive.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Of course I\u2019m going on the representations that have been made at this point and not on what Dr. Blotter has actually testified to as to what he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\"Based on what you\u2019ve said, and I can\u2014 <em>Mr. Howard, I can understand your problem. Because it is very definitely throwing a new wrinkle into, it seems to me, throwing a new wrinkle into the case. He\u2019s presenting a completely new opinion, even though, yes, you say, Well, he warned us that he might come up with something new.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\n<em>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t bother coming up with something new until, as I understand it, or didn\u2019t tell anybody about it until last night.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">\u201cAnd it seems to me, from what I\u2019ve heard at this point, that it\u2019s not because the defendant is sandbagging. And it\u2019s not because the plaintiff has failed to be diligent in pursuing its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">\u201cIt seems to me that the problem is that the witness didn\u2019t get the work done because of the press of other business.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\u201cSo I don\u2019t think, from the point of view of looking at, Well, did the plaintiff \u2014 defendant fail to seasonably supplement his responses to discovery? The answer is no. Using a double negative, no, he didn\u2019t fail to do so because he didn\u2019t know about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">\u201cAnd 26(e)(4) says that if a party fails to seasonably supplement his responses, then the court may exclude the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">\u201cSo I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a predicate for excluding the testimony at this point. If I felt that, you know, this was a sandbagging situation, I\u2019d rule otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it comes within \u2014 well, I think the appropriate exercise of discretion would be to permit the testimony.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Tr., 902-13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-19\">As the above excerpt displays, the trial court inquired into and was made aware of the problem presented to the plaintiffs by the late discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-20\">The standard of review applicable is that of abuse of discretion in ruling on admissibility of expert testimony. <em>Cosgrove v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, Inc., </em>117 Idaho 470, 788 P.2d 1293 (1989); <em>Sidwell v. William Prym, Inc., </em>112 Idaho 76, 730 P.2d 996 (1986); <em>Stoddard v. Nelson, </em>99 Idaho 293, 581 P.2d 339 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-21\">The trial court in this case, as set forth herein, correctly perceived the issue of admissibility of the expert testimony of both Bookwalter and Blotter, as one involving discretion. The trial court made an intensive inquiry into what tests were conducted by the witness pre and post-deposition. The trial court entertained the argument of counsel on this and related evidentiary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">The trial court acted within its discretion and applied the correct legal standards and clearly reached its decision by exercise of reason. <em>Sun Valley Shopping Center v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991); <em>Braley v. Pangburn, </em>118 Idaho 575, 798 P.2d 34 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">Under the circumstances presented, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude the expert testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN GIVING THE JURY A LIMITING INSTRUCTION WITH REGARD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DEFENDANTS\u2019 SAFETY BULLETIN, PLAINTIFFS\u2019 EXHIBIT 18</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Exhibit 18 was a \u201cDuo-Fast Safety Bulletin\u201d bearing a date one year after the accident that was the subject of this litigation. Exhibit 18 was proffered by the plaintiffs to impeach the testimony of defendants\u2019 expert who had consistently testified that a \u201cdrop-off\u201d was not a safety feature on the C-325 nailer, the instrument at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Exhibit 18 did not deal with the C-325 nailer, but with three (3) other models of nailers manufactured by the defendant. Exhibit 18 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">Part Number CN-140-2 is a drop-off. It is used primarily on the C-350, KDN-75, and KDN-75L tools. Drop-offs are used for two reasons; functionally for use with short fasteners and for safety performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">A raised drop-off permits the use of shorter fasteners. They prevent the fastener from tumbling which minimizes jamming. The chambered surface area on a drop-off will guide the point of a tumbling fastener back to its proper path down the raceway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">A drop-off can also serve as a safety feature. In these tools, the drop-off may capture a tumbling nail and prevent it from traveling in the direction of the operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">When using nails shorter than two inches, the longer XK-1019 is recommended; nails from 2 inches to 2Vi inches should be used with a standard CN-140-2; nails longer than 2 Vi inches can be used without any drop-off; and nails longer than 3V2 inches must be used without a drop-off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">Because the density of the material being fastened can vary, drop-offs should also be considered with materials denser than medium grade lumber. For example; in metal piercing applications a drop-off is always recommended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">From a safety standpoint, the drop-off is not usually necessary. Consider the material density, the fastener length, and the angle of penetration. If you have any doubts about the fastener\u2019s performance, the best choice is to install a drop-off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">The defendants objected to the introduction of Exhibit 18 on the grounds that it did reflect steps taken after the date of the incident, did not deal with the C-325 nailer which was the subject of this litigation, was not relevant, and the claim of the defendants that Exhibit 18 was not admissible under Idaho Rules of Evidence 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">The plaintiffs did not offer Exhibit 18 for introduction as evidence until the final act of their rebuttal, at which time the court admitted the exhibit for the purpose of impeaching the expert testimony of the defendants who had stated that a \u201cdrop-off\u201d was not a safety feature in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 18 is a document that I believe the evidence will show was issued by Duo-Fast at some time after the occurrence of this accident. Any statements that are contained in this document may not be used, must not be used by you for the purpose of proving the products in issue were defective in design or manufacture or that the Defendant was negligent or otherwise at fault. The evidence in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 18 may be considered by you only for the purpose of testing the believability of testimony that has been given during the trial. And that\u2019s the only purpose for which it can be used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">The trial court interpreted Exhibit 18 as an instrument that could be read to indicate remedial measures taken by the defendants one year after the injury complained of by the plaintiffs, but weighed its value as urged by the plaintiffs for the purpose of impeaching the testimony of defendants\u2019 expert and concluded it did outweigh the prejudice that might be attached to an interpretation that it consisted of a remedial measure and concluded that it could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>introduced with a limiting instruction. It is clear from the transcript of the trial that the use of a \u201cdrop-off\u201d in connection with the C-325 nailer was never recommended until following this injury, when an engineering recommendation was made to the company that a drop-off be installed on the C-325 nailer. This recommendation was marked for purposes of identification by the plaintiffs as Exhibit 19, dated October 1988. It was never offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The purpose for which the trial court admitted Exhibit 18 is clear. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument for introduction was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">What we\u2019re talking about is simply a safety bulletin which was subsequently dated, but which recognizes the use of the drop-off on the CN 325, which I think the testimony indicates was available all along.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">When the witness says, It\u2019s a safe product. The accident didn\u2019t happen this way. And they\u2019ve got a document in their files saying that the piece or a piece similar to the piece that was not on the product also has a purpose as a safety feature, that tends to affect the credibility of the witnesses presented by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">So I\u2019m going to let it in for that purpose. So, I think basically in reaching that decision, I\u2019m looking at the discussion that\u2019s contained in McCormick in Section 275 and some of the cases that are cited in that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">Of course, they\u2019re talking more about Rule 407 th[a]n they are talking about our statute. But I think that basically the same line of reasoning applies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">It\u2019s an area in dispute. That\u2019s one of the requirements. If they agree \u2014 if they\u2019d have agreed with your position, then there would be nothing to dispute and then they shouldn\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">But this is an area which is in factual dispute. There\u2019s evidence they\u2019ve taken a certain position; you\u2019ve taken an opposite position with respect to the products involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">So there is a factual issue in dispute. I believe this evidence, again, while it can\u2019t be used to prove culpability or a defect in design, it can be used to impeach the credibility of the defense witnesses and the opinions of the defense witnesses____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">I don\u2019t think this is the type of document that would be unduly prejudicial, when you consider its probative value insofar as the issue of credibility is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-15\">And when the document is offered\u2014 which I expect will be in the very near future \u2014 I\u2019ll give the jury a precautionary instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Tr. pp. 999-1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">The trial court, while admitting Exhibit 18 for impeachment purposes, recognized Exhibit 18 as a document that might have been interpreted as a \u201cremedial measure\u201d and gave a limiting instruction.

This issue could have been resolved by a Rule 16 pretrial order which set a deadline for any new testing or experiments without prior approval of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-24\">As both the majority and dissenting opinions point out, Dr. Blotter in his deposition alluded to the fact that he might do some additional testing. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, in his statement to the court, recognized that, stating, \u201cWe continued his deposition because he had indicated at this deposition, and Mr. Farley had, that he might want to do something more.\u201d Plaintiff argues that,, in the event that he did do something more, the defendant had a duty under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>26(e)(4) to \u201cseasonably\u201d supplement its discovery responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The drafters of Rule 26(e)(4) recognized that the term \u201cseasonably\u201d was somewhat imprecise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">The committee did have some misgivings with the requirement that the party has a duty to \u2018seasonably\u2019 supplement his responses in that this leaves a great deal of discretion to the trial court in determining whether the supplementation was done within the time required. However, it appeared that no better term could be devised____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Comment to I.R.C.P. 26(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991), this Court, in analyzing the Rule 26(e)(4) requirement, quoted from Friedenthal, <em>Discovery and Use of an Adverse Party\u2019s Expert Information, </em>14 Stan.L.Rev. 455, 485 (1962), that it is \u201cfundamental that <em>opportunity be had for full cross-examination____\u201d Radmer, </em>120 Idaho at 89, 813 P.2d at 900 (emphasis added). Thus, an important inquiry in determining whether a response was given \u201cseasonably\u201d is: was the opposing party given an opportunity for full cross examination? If \u201cyes,\u201d then there probably would be no abuse of discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">In his original testing, Dr. Blotter had tested a similar nail gun to evaluate the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that a nail was able to get into a position where it could come out of the back of the raceway on the nail gun with sufficient velocity to reach the plaintiff and injure his eye. The later testing by Blotter was to determine the force required by the nailer in order to drive a nail into wood. After doing the additional tests, Dr. Blotter\u2019s new opinion was, as noted in the dissenting opinion, that the most likely scenario for the accident was that the operator of the nail gun simply missed the board with the nail, and it hit the plaintiff in the eye, a rather non-technical and somewhat obvious conclusion. Had the additional testing and Dr. Blotter\u2019s new opinion been a very technical analysis and conclusion as to how the accident occurred, the trial court, or this Court on appeal, may well have concluded that the plaintiffs had been deprived of the opportunity for full cross examination. <em>Cf Radmer, supra. </em>The trial judge, who presided over the entire proceeding including all of the pretrial discovery disputes that occurred between the parties, concluded that the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the late disclosure, and that the defense expert ought to be permitted to use the additional testing in arriving at his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">The issue which we must resolve is whether or not the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the expert Dr. Blotter to consider his last minute force tests and then render an opinion that the most likely cause of the accident was that the operator simply missed the board with the nail. Unless we are convinced that the trial court erred in the exercise of its discretion, we should affirm. While it is a close question, the facts of this case are sufficiently distinguishable from <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991), to justify not overturning the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b251-13\">BISTLINE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AUv\">dissenting from the majority opinion, and concurring in the opinion of Justice TROUT:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">On March 3, 1992, the Court was then comprised of five sitting justices, all of whom participated in the opinions issued in the above-captioned case, <em>Hopkins v. Duo-Fast. </em>Justice McDevitt authored the opinion for the Court, and that opinion was joined only by Chief Justice Bakes and Justice Johnson. Justices Bistline and Boyle both dissented and wrote separate opinions. Justice Bistline, in addition to his own expressed views, fully joined the opinion of Justice Boyle. Justice Boyle has since accepted a position in the federal judiciary and therefore is no longer participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">In June of 1992, the Hopkins\u2019 petition for rehearing was granted. On September 15, 1992, the Court heard the reargument of the parties, and the controversy was taken under consideration, which so continues. The order granting a rehearing was just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>that, and nothing more. Such an order does not displace the opinions which had been written and culminated in the opinion for the Court, a point to be kept in mind. When a new opinion emanates from the Court, which is a majority opinion, as history evidences, it supplants the previous majority opinion, and on issuance this Court ordinarily states in plain language that any earlier contrary opinion is withdrawn, hence <em>functus officio. </em>Portions thereof may surface in the substituted opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Having made that clear, and because of my having joined the previous dissenting opinion authored by Justice Boyle, I now adopt as my own the views therein expressed and attach that joint opinion hereto as Appendix A. In addition, I stand fast on the views which I expressed for myself in my 1992 opinion, which are reiterated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Particular attention should be given to where the district court, the Hon. George D. Carey, Fourth Judicial District, begins the discussion leading to his disposition of the issue concerning the failure of Duo-Fast to supplement its answers to interrogatories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Mr. Howard, I can understand your problem. Because it is very definitely throwing a new wrinkle into, it seems to me, throwing a new wrinkle into the case. He\u2019s presenting a completely new opinion, even though, yes, you say, Well, he warned vs that he might come up with something new.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>But he didn\u2019t bother coming up with something new until, as I understand it, or didn\u2019t tell anybody about it until last night.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">And it seems to me, from what I\u2019ve heard at this point, that it\u2019s not because the defendant is sandbagging. And it\u2019s not because the plaintiff has failed to be diligent in pursuing its discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">\n<em>It seems to me that the problem is that the witness didn\u2019t get the work done because of the press of other business.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">So I don\u2019t think, from the point of view of looking at, well, did the plaintiff\u2014 defendant fail to seasonably supplement his responses to discovery? The answer is no. Using a double negative, no, he didn\u2019t fail to do so because he didn\u2019t know about it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">And 26(e)(4) says that if a party fails to seasonably supplement his responses, then the court may exclude the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a predicate for excluding the testimony at this point. If I felt that, you know, this was a sandbagging situation, I\u2019d rule otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">But I think, at least from what I\u2019ve heard, that Dr. Blotter would testify to as to the reasons why he hadn\u2019t reached that conclusion beforehand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-17\">I don\u2019t think it comes within \u2014 well, I think the appropriate exercise of discretion would be to permit the testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">R. 912-13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-18\">The trial court was obviously keenly aware of the problem presented by the late discovery but nevertheless ruled against the plaintiffs, who were judicially found to have been diligent in pursuing discovery. Instead, the court favored the tardy defendants. The court showed no consideration of the proposition that the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>its counsel were under an implied obligation of fairness which required that Dr. Blotter\u2019s further testing, beyond that which had been conducted prior to the taking of his deposition, be both finished and furnished at least far enough in advance of trial so as to allow plaintiffs\u2019 counsel time to consider it and prepare plaintiffs\u2019 expert to make a response. Instead the district court attributed \u201cthe problem\u201d wholly to Dr. Blotter\u2019s failure \u201cto get the work done because of the press of other business.\u201d Nothing in the court rules or in the record supports the court in its ruling that Dr. Blotter\u2019s lateness in conducting further testing and reaching new conclusions was excusable \u201cbecause of the press of other business,\u201d which is pure conjecture. Instead, the court should have placed the onus where it properly belonged, on Duo-Fast and its counsel, for not riding herd on Dr. Blotter. Duo-Fast, however, did not spring its surprise until after plaintiffs had presented their case. Defense counsel in making the belated disclosure to the court and counsel expressed no remorse for having been so remiss in his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">It simply is not possible to understand how the Chief Justice less than two years ago in the case of <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991), could write the following <em>ratio decidendi </em>and then join the opinion of Justice McDevitt, which ignores <em>Radmer </em>as though it never existed. <em>Radmer </em>states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The issue in this case is governed by Rule 26(e) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure. That rule provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to ... (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as a witness at trial and <em>with regard to expert witnesses the subject matter on which he is expected to testify, and the substance of his testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">This rule unambiguously imposes a continuing duty to supplement responses to discovery with respect to the substance and subject matter of an expert\u2019s testimony where the initial responses have been rejected, modified, expanded upon, or otherwise altered in some manner. <em>Zolber v. Winters, </em>109 Idaho 824, 712 P.2d 525 (1986); <em>Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Supplementation of Responses </em>\u00a7 2048.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In general, Rule 26 of the Idaho rules, like its federal analogue, <em>was designed to promote candor and fairness in the pre-trial discovery process. </em>Speaking with reference to Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i) of the federal rules, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules which promulgated the original draft of Rule 26 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">In cases of this character [involving expert testimony], a prohibition against discovery of information held by expert witnesses produces in acute form the very evils that discovery has been created to prevent. Effective cross-examination of an expert witness requires advance preparation____ Similarly, effective rebuttal advances knowledge of the line of testimony of the other side. If the latter is foreclosed by a rule against discovery, the narrowing of issues and elimination of surprise which discovery normally produces are frustrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Advisory Committee Notes, rule 26, Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C.A. Further illustrating the critical nature of complete and accurate responses regarding expert witnesses in the discovery process, one scholar notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-14\">It is fundamental that opportunity be had for full cross-examination, and this cannot be done properly in many cases without resort to pretrial discovery, particularly when expert witnesses are involved____ Before an attorney can even hope to deal on cross-examination with an unfavorable expert opinion he must have some idea of the bases of that opinion and the data relied upon. If the attorney is required to await examination at trial to get this information, he often will have too little time to recognize and expose vulnerable spots in the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Friedenthal, <em>Discovery and Use of an Adverse Party\u2019s Expert Information, </em>14 Stan.L.Rev. 455, 485 (1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">Typically, failure to meet the requirements of Rule 26 results in exclusion of the proffered evidence. <em>Coleco Industries, Inc. v. Berman, 567 </em>F.2d 569 (3d Cir.1977). Moreover, while trial courts are given broad discretion in ruling on pretrial discovery matters, reversible error has been found in allowing testimony where Rule 26 has not been complied with. <em>Smith v. Ford Motor Co., </em>626 F.2d 784 (10th Cir.1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Radmer, 120 </em>Idaho at 89, <em>818 </em>P.2d at 900 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added) (Bakes, C.J. author, Bistline, Johnson, Boyle, and McDevitt, JJ., concurring). This strange affair is made even more incredible because Justice McDevitt was a sitting member of a unanimous Court which issued <em>Radmer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">All of which is to suggest that while there are times when the Court functions as a unit, there are other times, such as now, where the trial bench and bar, and not to the exclusion of the general public, may well conclude that the Court is more interested in sending out opinions than in making that extra effort to release opinions which are soundly thought out and premised on at least on some reasonable degree of consistency, preferably always striving for a result which has an aroma of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em>. </em>In this passage, Judge Carey apparently uses \u201cdefendant\" as applicable to the corporation Duo-Fast. Duo-Fast appeared before the trial court by and through its retained attorney, Donald J. Farley. It is unclear as to who is the \"he.\" The person in charge of the Duo-Fast defense was Mr. Farley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\">. Here the reader is presented with the supposed basis for Judge Carey\u2019s decision, his conclusion exonerating Duo-Fast\u2019s witness, Dr. Blotter, and hence Duo-Fast as well, for not having timely completed the testing which they were to do, and then to timely advise the Hopkins' attorney. Unacceptable is the statement by Judge Carey that \"from what I\u2019ve heard, Dr. Blotter would testify as to the reasons why he hadn\u2019t reached that conclusion beforehand.\" It was a bare conclusion which the record does not support, and hence unsupportable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-20\">.Wholly incomprehensible and unavailable is the means by which Judge Carey arrived at this conclusion. As matters stand, the statement is a conclusion without any substantiation. Trial courts are granted discretion, true, but the parties are entitled to be informed as to the manner and reasoning which enters into the exercise of that discretion. Otherwise, pandemonium may rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b254-8\">BOYLE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A7P\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In my view, defendants had a duty to supplement their experts\u2019 deposition responses prior to trial as required by <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">I also respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion which holds that counsel for plaintiff waived a continuance during trial to take the deposition of defendant\u2019s expert. In my view, the trial court was not excused from excluding undisclosed evidence of additional tests and analysis performed after the expert\u2019s pretrial discovery deposition had been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">A review of the record clearly confirms that the trial court offered plaintiffs a recess to take further depositions of the defense expert. Although this was a reasonable proposal by the trial court, in light of its rejection by the surprised party it is not a sufficient remedy to overcome the prejudice to plaintiffs in this instant case. Perhaps more importantly, the majority\u2019s approval of the trial court\u2019s proposal to allow a deposition does not provide any meaningful guidance to the bench and trial bar in future cases. If any of the litigants is to bear the burden, responsibility or prejudice of failing to supplement discovery, it should be the offending party rather than the surprised party. In my view, our approval today of allowing a continuance during trial when a party fails to supplement its discovery responses will encourage eleventh hour undisclosed discovery rather than prevent it as is contemplated by the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">To place a surprised party in the position of having to accept the alternative of bringing the trial to a halt, taking the delinquent expert\u2019s deposition and then provide that information to the other experts and, finally, in all likelihood, take additional depositions in response all because of a party\u2019s failure to supplement an expert\u2019s opinion is an unacceptable and unjust remedy. Such a procedure can only work to the offending party\u2019s advantage and should not be allowed by the trial court nor approved by us on appeal. In my view, the only fair method of preventing the problem of a party failing to supplement discovery is to exclude evidence of post-discovery testing by experts or other new evidence obtained after the close of discovery unless a timely supplement is made as contemplated by the Rules. <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991). <em>See </em>I.R.C.P. 26(e)(4) which clearly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-14\">(4) If a party fails to seasonably supplement his responses as required in this Rule 26(e), the trial court may exclude the testimony of witnesses or the admission of evidence not disclosed by a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>quired supplementation of the responses of the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Rule 26 and all of its sub-parts are controlled by the provisions of Rule 1(a) which require that \u201c[t]hese rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\u201d In my view, none of these criteria have been satisfied by the process approved herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-8\">BISTLINE, J., concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b255-9\">TROUT, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"Akr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">After much thought about the expert testimony presented in this case and the importance of judicial discretion in ruling on the admission of testimony at trial, I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Blotter, testified at his deposition that he could not say what was the most likely cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. Dr. Blotter stated \u201cit seems unlikely that the nail came from the subject gun so I don\u2019t know for sure how it [the injury] happened.\u201d Deposition of Dr. Blotter, p. 76 (taken August 31, 1989). Dr. Blotter further speculated that the injury could have been caused by \u201cricochets from guns in other locations\u201d or that injury was caused by something other than a nail such as a staple or some other metal object. <em>Id. </em>at 73. At trial, however, after informing defendants\u2019 counsel that he had conducted additional testing after his deposition, Dr. Blotter testified that based upon this additional testing, he had changed his opinion and now concluded that the subject nail gun had in fact fired the nail which injured the plaintiff. Dr. Blotter opined that \u201cthe most likely scenario\u201d is that the operator of the subject nail gun \u201csimply missed the board with the nail\u201d which thereafter struck the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">It is difficult for me to imagine a case where plaintiffs\u2019 counsel could have been more circumspect in assuring himself that no new testimony would be forthcoming from the defendants\u2019 expert after the expert\u2019s deposition was concluded. The excerpt from the Blotter deposition set forth in the majority opinion makes clear that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel wanted to know if Dr. Blotter anticipated doing any further work in advance of trial. Additionally, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made it unmistakably clear at the Blotter deposition, taken just two weeks before trial, that the plaintiff needed sufficient opportunity to respond to additional tests performed by Blotter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">Mr. Howard: If you are going to have him do that additional stuff [testing], then I will want to continue this deposition. I am even taking a position quite frankly I may ask the Court to disallow him to testify unless I am afforded sufficient opportunity to discover and respond to any additional tests. This is beyond the 11th hour. We don\u2019t need to argue that now, I just want you to know that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqD\">In response, defendants\u2019 counsel gives his assurance that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel would be given access to any additional tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">Mr. Farley: I understand your position. My position is that you will be given full and free access to whatever other information other than what has been testified to today may come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-16\">Mr. Howard: When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-17\">Mr. Farley: Just as soon as I know it. If it is Tuesday, then you will have access to it. If it is the weekend before he testifies, you will have access to it. Just whenever. You will be given the opportunity to take his deposition if you want to do that or if you want to sit down and talk to him about anything additional I will give you that opportunity as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC8\">Deposition of Dr. Blotter, pp. 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-18\">Notwithstanding the moral duty imposed on defendants\u2019 counsel as a result of the above representations, I.R.C.P. 26(e)(1) statutorily obligates counsel to supplement responses to discovery, in particular the substance of an expert\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-19\">[A] party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to <em>any </em>question directly addressed to (A) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as a witness at trial <em>and with regard to expert witnesses the subject matter on which he is expected to testify, and the substance of his testimony.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">I.R.C.P. 26(e)(1). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In <em>Radmer v. Ford Motor Co., </em>120 Idaho 86, 813 P.2d 897 (1991), we recognized the importance and purpose of I.R.C.P. 26(e)(1) in promoting candor and fairness in the pre-trial discovery process when expert witnesses are involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">It is fundamental that opportunity be had for full cross-examination, and this cannot be done properly in many cases without resort to pretrial discovery, particularly when expert witnesses are involved ... Before an attorney can even hope to deal on cross-examination with an unfavorable expert opinion he must have some idea of the bases of that opinion and the data relied upon. If the attorney is required to await examination at trial to get this information, he often will have too little time to recognize and expose vulnerable spots in the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN8v\">120 Idaho at 89, 813 P.2d at 900 <em>citing </em>Friedenthal, <em>Discovery and Use of an Adverse Party\u2019s Expert Information, </em>14 Stan.L.Rev. <em>455, 485 </em>(1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Defendants\u2019 counsel in the present case was under a statutory duty to notify plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cseasonably\u201d that the substance of Dr. Blotter\u2019s testimony had changed, i.e. he had conducted further tests and was now able to conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by a nail from the subject nail gun after the operator missed a board.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Defendants\u2019 counsel apparently takes the position that he did supplement the response by advising plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of the additional testing shortly before his expert was to take the stand and <em>after plaintiffs\u2019 counsel specifically asked if there was any additional work that has been done by Dr. Blotter. </em>Defense counsel\u2019s explanation for this late disclosure was that \u201c[I] learned last night that he [Dr. Blotter] has, in essence, done some force tests by going down into his lab.\u201d Thus, because defense counsel did not require his expert to conduct his tests and reach his conclusions prior to the deposition, and because he didn\u2019t bother to ask his expert until the night before his testimony at trial, we are asked to accept that he has seasonably supplemented his discovery responses and the expert testimony should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">At the time this disclosure was made, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had already rested and his expert witness had left. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was placed in the position of being right in the middle of a trial, with a jury which had apparently been promised that the trial would be over soon, and only then finding out that his assumptions about defendants\u2019 expert witness\u2019 testimony were in error. He was in no position at that point to conduct further discovery or bring his expert witness back to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The term \u201cseasonably\u201d as used in Rule 26(e) must have a reasonable meaning to assure members of the bar that some degree of consistent fairness exists in the rules of procedure. \u201cSeasonably\u201d cannot possibly mean moments before the witness is to testify and it must place some requirement on counsel that they ask their witnesses to set aside the \u201cpress of business\u201d in order to prepare early and fully. Offering opposing counsel a few minutes to speak with the witness, a continuance, or even the cost of another deposition cannot possibly compensate opposing counsel for all of the expense and time which goes into trial preparation. Rule 26(e)(4) gives the court both the authority and the responsibility to exclude the testimony not seasonably disclosed, which places the penalty on the party who did not supplement, where it properly belongs. To hold otherwise encourages a lack of diligence on the part of counsel, realizing that their last minute trial preparation and consultation with their expert witnesses will place opposing counsel at an extreme disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">I am very familiar with our standards on the exercise of judicial discretion set forth in <em>Sun Valley Shopping Center v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 803 P.2d 993 (1991), and I have considered carefully the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>comments of the trial judge in exercising his discretion to permit this testimony. While I believe strongly in the importance of vesting the trial courts with the discretion to make these very difficult decisions, I cannot in good conscience affirm the exercise of discretion in this instance. In my opinion, it was manifest error for the trial court to allow Dr. Blotter to testify at trial concerning his recently formulated opinion on the most critical element of plaintiffs\u2019 case, the cause of the injury. To hold otherwise sends a message to the trial bar of this state that they can permit their witnesses to change their testimony at the last minute with impunity. I do not understand that to be the intent behind our rules of discovery. For that reason I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b257-5\">BISTLINE, J., concurs.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
