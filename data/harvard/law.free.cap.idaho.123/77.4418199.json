Immediately following sentence, the public defender, Mr. Van Bishop, filed a petition for post-conviction relief on behalf of petitioner. The trial\u2019 court subsequently appointed Lamarr Kofoed to represent Ivey on the petition, because the basis of the petition was a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Kofoed filed an amended petition on August 1, 1991. The State\u2019s response, filed August 23, 1991, denied all allegations and requested summary dismissal of the petition, emphasizing the lack of any factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>support. On August 28, 1991, the trial court petitioned this Court for an extension of time in order to dispose of the post-conviction proceedings. Ivey then filed a supporting affidavit setting out with some specificity what he intended to prove at the hearing to demonstrate the lack of proper representation at trial. Ivey alleges that the public defender, Mr. Bishop, failed to effectively represent petitioner\u2019s interest in his preparation for, and his conduct at trial. Specifically, petitioner asserts that Mr. Bishop failed to vigorously cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses, allowed perjured testimony to go unchallenged, intentionally refused to use available rebuttal evidence and witnesses, and failed to vigorously investigate evidence that may have led to the true murderer. Moreover, the petitioner contends that Mr. Bishop went against his wishes, attempting to portray him as having a mental defect at the sentencing hearing. Mr. Bishop filed a supporting affidavit concerning his representation of Ivey. All of Ivey's contentions relating to trial counsel\u2019s performance are answered by Mr. Bishop\u2019s affidavit, explaining that each act complained of related to a strategic judgment about the validity of evidence or the credibility of witnesses. Bishop also asserted that he had avoided extensive cross-examination of a certain witness because he did not wish to develop information damaging to petitioner\u2019s case. Furthermore, Bishop elected not to call the \u201cavailable defense witnesses\u201d after determining that their testimony would not be favorable to petitioner. Bishop\u2019s investigation of petit\u00edoner\u2019s alibi witnesses revealed that they would not testify as Ivey claimed. Shortly after the affidavits were filed, petitioner requested a hearing on his petition. The court responded by an order of dismissal filed October 21, 1991, holding that petitioner had not made the showing required by <em>Drapeau v. State, </em>103 Idaho 612, 651 P.2d 546 (Ct.App.1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Petitioner entreats this Court to vacate the conviction and sentence, and to grant a new trial with newly appointed defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">A petition for post-conviction relief is in the nature of a civil proceeding, entirely new and distinct from the underlying criminal action. <em>Peltier v. State, </em>119 Idaho 454, 808 P.2d 373 (1991). Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4906(c) governs the situation in which summary disposition of a petition for post-conviction relief is appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Peltier v. State, </em>119 Idaho 454, 808 P.2d 373 (1991), this Court read section (b) as <em>requiring </em>the court to notify of its intent to dismiss under the facts of that case. Failure to notify the petitioner of the court\u2019s intent to dismiss required that an order dismissing the petition be reversed. <em>Peltier, </em>119 Idaho at 456-57, 808 P.2d at 375-76. However, where a party moves to dismiss the petition without a hearing, the 20-day notice is not required. <em>See State v. Christensen, </em>102 Idaho 487, 488, 632 P.2d 676, 677 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>(1981) (section (b) governs only those situations where the trial court on <em>its own initiative </em>determines to dismiss the petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In order to warrant a hearing for a petition for post-conviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a claimant must first show that a material issue of fact exists as to whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Second, a claimant must show that a material issue of fact exists as to whether this deficient performance prejudiced his case. <em>Parrott v. State, </em>117 Idaho 272, 275, 787 P.2d 258, 261 (1990), <em>citing Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>116 Idaho 129, 137, 774 P.2d 299, 307 (1989); <em>Aragon v. State, </em>114 Idaho 758, 760, 760 P.2d 1174, 1176 (1988); <em>Estes v. State, </em>111 Idaho 430, 725 P.2d 135 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In determining whether a summary disposition motion is properly granted, a court must review facts in a light most favorable to petitioner, and determine whether such facts would entitle relief if accepted as true. While this requires that the petitioner\u2019s unrebutted factual assertions be accepted as true, a court is not required to accept petitioner\u2019s conclusions. <em>Parrott, </em>117 Idaho at 274, 787 P.2d at 260; <em>Paradis v. State, </em>110 Idaho 534, 536, 716 P.2d 1306, 1308 (1986); <em>Kraft v. State, </em>100 Idaho 671, 603 P.2d 1005 (1979). The standard to be applied to a trial court\u2019s determination that no material issue of fact exists is the same type of determination in a summary judgment proceeding. <em>See State v. Christensen, </em>102 Idaho 487, 489, 632 P.2d 676, 678 (1981); <em>Anderson v. City of Pocatello, </em>112 Idaho 176, 731 P.2d 171 (1986). We review the trial court\u2019s legal determination that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under a correction of error standard, showing no particular deference. <em>Anderson, </em>112 Idaho at 179-80, 731 P.2d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">An accused in a criminal proceeding is guaranteed effective assistance of counsel. <em>Aragon v. State, </em>114 Idaho 758, 760 P.2d 1174 (1988). To establish deficient assistance, the burden is on the petitioner to show that his attorney\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Aragon, </em>114 Idaho at 760, 760 P.2d at 1176. This objective standard embraces a strong presumption that trial counsel was competent and diligent. <em>Charboneau, </em>116 Idaho at 137, 774 P.2d at 307; <em>Aragon, </em>114 Idaho at 760, 760 P.2d at 1176; <em>Estes v. State, </em>111 Idaho 430, 725 P.2d 135 (1986). Moreover, according to statute and case law, petitioner must not only put competency into issue, he must also show that the deficient conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. The constitutional requirement for effective assistance of counsel is not the key to the prison for a defendant who can dredge up a long series of examples of how the case might have been tried better.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Petitioner refers to a number of claimed failings, all of which assert a lack of adequate preparation on the part of Mr. Bishop. However, petitioner must support his allegations by affidavit or equally reliable evidence. Such affidavit must in turn satisfy Rule 56(e) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires the affidavit to be made on personal knowledge setting forth facts that would be admissible at trial. <em>Hecla Mining Co. v. Star-Morning Mining Co., </em>122 Idaho 778, 839 P.2d 1192 (1992); <em>East Lizard Butte Water Corp. v. Howell, </em>122 Idaho 679, 837 P.2d 805 (1992); <em>Casey v. Highlands Ins. Co., 100 </em>Idaho 505, 600 P.2d 1387 (1979). Petitioner\u2019s affidavit does not satisfy Rule 56(e), as it is based on hearsay and is conclusory. Specifically, petitioner\u2019s affidavit alleges, but does not support with personal knowledge, that Bishop permitted perjured testimony, and that Bishop failed to adequately investigate by refusing to contact certain allegedly exculpatory defense witnesses. These bare insinuations can only be the product of hearsay, as defendant has been incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ated since indictment and cannot possibly have personal knowledge of Bishop\u2019s conduct. Petitioner offers no other evidence to support his claims. Thus, petitioner does not overcome the strong presumption in favor of competency to create a genuine factual issue. Moreover, even if one accepts petitioner\u2019s allegations of deficiencies as true, there is no showing that, had counsel acted in accord with petitioner\u2019s wishes, it would have produced a different result at trial. Conversely, Mr. Bishop\u2019s affidavit, based on his own knowledge and experience, explains and justifies the particular trial strategy he chose to pursue, including the investigation and interviews of every witness named by petitioner and the rationale for calling or not calling them, the very trial strategy this Court has vowed not to second-guess. <em>State v. Larkin, </em>102 Idaho 231, 628 P.2d 1065 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The trial court properly dismissed the petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b119-5\">BAKES, C.J., and JOHNSON and TROUT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-4\">.

State, </em>118 Idaho 932, 934, 801 P.2d 1283, 1285 (1990) citing <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). The right to counsel necessarily includes the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann v.

State, 122 </em>Idaho 801, 839 P.2d 1215 (1992); <em>Parrott v. State, </em>117 Idaho 272, 274, 787 P.2d 258, 260 (1990). Until allegations in a post-conviction petition are controverted they are deemed to be true. <em>Clark v. State, </em>92 Idaho 827, 830, 452 P.2d 54, 57 (1969). The issue on appeal from a dismissal is whether the petition alleges facts which, if true, would entitle the petitioner to relief. <em>Smith v. State, </em>94 Idaho 469, 472, 491 P.2d 733, 736 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Ivey made the following allegations in his petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">(A.) My Public Defender failed to properly represent me at all stages of my criminal proceedings, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">(1.) He allowed State Witnesses to provide perjured testimony, without proper cross-examination or use of rebuttal evidence and witnesses, which were available to him and known to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-15\">(2.) He allowed the prosecutor, who well knew of perjured testimony by State Witnesses, to knowingly submit it. The prosecutor failed to provide proper discovery disclosure to me and my counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-16\">(3.) He failed to subpoena and call exculpatory defense witnesses which were known to him, including my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-17\">(4.) He failed to follow up on information that would have identified the true murderer and his vehicle, and he failed to get a voice analysis of a telephone message left by the true murderer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-18\">(5.) An essential defense witness who could have and should have been subpoena by interstate process, from Detroit, Michigan was not subpoenaed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-19\">(6.) Available defense witnesses were not called to testify as to my alibi, my demeanor at the subject time, my lack of blood stains, my lack of motive, and my non-violent history. The victim\u2019s diary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was not produced, which would have shown an amicable relationship with the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">(7.) My public defender promised strong and vigorous cross-examination of State\u2019s witnesses Michael Angel and Cameron Lane, but failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">R. 11-12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecuting attorney then filed an affidavit from Van Bishop, the public defender, which disputed each of the allegations above. In response, Ivey filed an affidavit alleging more specific facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To my mind, the allegations made by Ivey raise an issue of material fact as to whether Bishop provided effective assistance of counsel. Therefore, I believe the dismissal of the petition was improper under <em>Matthews.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The majority dismisses the allegations made in Ivey\u2019s affidavit because they allegedly fail to comply with \u201cRule 56(e) of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires the affidavit to be made on personal knowledge setting forth facts that would be admissible at trial.\u201d At 80, 844 P.2d at 709. This logic would be sound except for the fact that I.R.C.P. 56(e) does not apply in this case. Rule 56(e) applies to affidavits filed in support of or in opposition to summary judgment pursuant to I.R.C.P. 56(aHb). No such motion was filed in this case. The motion filed by the State was pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-4906(c). That statute does not contain the requirements for affidavits found in I.R.C.P. 56(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears the legislature decided to not require petitioner\u2019s affidavits in opposition to a I.C. \u00a7 19-4906 dismissal to meet the high standards of I.R.C.P. 56(e), and I object to the Court\u2019s attempt to engraft such a rule onto the statutory procedure. In all likelihood, the legislature recognized it would be extremely difficult for petitioners, who may be incarcerated and without the assistance of counsel, to gather affidavits from potentially far flung witnesses, given their circumstances and lack of means.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Even assuming Rule 56(e) applies to a petition for post-conviction relief, it is just as likely as not that the allegations in Ivey\u2019s petition are made from personal knowledge. The majority is wrong in declaring that Ivey's allegations \u201ccan <em>only </em>be the product of hearsay, as defendant has been incarcerated since indictment and <em>cannot possibly </em>have personal knowledge of Bishop\u2019s conduct\u201d (emphasis added). A close reading of Ivey\u2019s petition belies the majority\u2019s curiously summary contention. The facts contained in allegations 1, 6, and 7 occurred (or failed to occur) during the trial, when Ivey presumably was present. Ivey could easily have ascertained the facts underlying allegations 2, 3, 4, and 5 by speaking to Bishop. For instance, as to allegation 3, even from jail Ivey could have asked Bishop whether Bishop had subpoenaed Ivey\u2019s wife, and Ivey certainly would have personal knowledge as to whether she was called to testify at trial. If Ivey ascertained this information from Bishop, it would not be hearsay, pursuant to I.R.E. 801(d)(2). The point here is not to determine under which hearsay exception such a statement would fall. The point is to show that whether the evidence is admissible is somewhat conjectural, thus rendering even more necessary an evidentiary hearing. Furthermore, since, as stated above, a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>seem that a court must also view the preliminary facts concerning the admissibility of evidence in the same light. Hence, the trial court should have erred on the side of assuming, for purposes of petition dismissal proceedings, that Ivey\u2019s allegations were made from personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">As noted above and in the majority opinion, the facts in this case must be read in the light most favorable to the petitioner, Ivey. The majority contradicts this statement, however, when it places a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of competency\u201d upon Ivey at this stage in the proceedings. We should not apply the <em>Strickland </em>presumption, which involves weighing the evidence, until an evidentiary hearing has occurred. What the majority is really doing by applying the presumption at this stage is weighing the evidence by balancing Ivey\u2019s allegations of incompetency against Bishop\u2019s defense of competency. The majority\u2019s statement, that while a court must accept petitioner\u2019s \u201cunrebutted allegations\u201d as true, it need not accept petitioner\u2019s \u201cconclusions,\u201d might be seen as no more than a sleight of hand. A court must accept <em>rebutted </em>allegations in the light most favorable to petitioner as well. In short, whether Bishop\u2019s alleged failings prejudiced Ivey is a question of fact. Ivey has alleged such failings and resulting prejudice. The court must accept that allegation in the light most favorable to Ivey.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It is also instructive to turn to I.R.C.P. 1(a), since the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure generally apply to post-conviction proceedings. <em>State v. Goodrich, </em>104 Idaho 469, 660 P.2d 934 (1983). Rule 1(a) proclaims of the I.R.C.P. that, \u201cThese rules shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I doubt strongly that the majority\u2019s disposition of this case is just. Although a petition for post-conviction relief is civil in nature, <em>see State v. Goodrich, </em>above, it cannot be denied that there is a criminal law aspect as well; by its very nature, the petition addresses alleged error in a criminal proceeding and alleges an illegal infringement upon petitioner\u2019s liberty. Since the precious value of liberty is involved, this Court should be very cautious in condoning the disposal of these actions in their initial stage on technicalities.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. Ivey goes on to allege that he was deprived the right to effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. This Court agrees with Ivey\u2019s allegation in this regard, as we have recently vacated his death sentence for the same reasons he alleged in his petition. <em>State v. Ivey, </em>123 Idaho 74, 844 P.2d 703 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. Ivey\u2019s affidavit also alleged, in rebutting Bishop's affidavit, that Bishop did not allow him to testify on his own behalf, even though Ivey repeatedly requested that he be allowed to do so. If true, this could entitle Ivey to relief, since defendants have a right to testify at trial. <em>See Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-13\">.Perhaps the majority is confused because of our cases which hold that a motion to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief is <em>similar </em>to a motion for summary judgment in that all facts must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See e.g. Matthews, </em>122 Idaho at 807, 839 P.2d at 1221 (1992). We have never held, however, that the rules governing summary judgment apply to petitions for post-conviction relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
