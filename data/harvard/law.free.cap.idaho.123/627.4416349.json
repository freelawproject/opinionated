Monroe (\u201cMonroe\u201d), who had been employed by respondent, Chuck &amp; Del\u2019s, Inc. (\u201cChuck &amp; Del\u2019s\u201d), as an air conditioning and heating system servicer and installer, filed a worker\u2019s compensation application for hearing. Monroe alleged that on April 29, 1987, he \u201cinjured his back when installing a window air conditioner,\u201d causing \u201cdisc herniation at L4, 5 and L5, SI.\u201d He framed the issue as \u201c[wjhether or not [he] is entitled to medical, PPI and permanent disability benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAf\">On June 1, 1990, the State Insurance Fund filed its answer to the application for hearing. Among other things, it denied that notice of injury was given to the employer within sixty days of the accident or that Monroe was permanently disabled, it admitted that Monroe was temporarily disabled from September 28, 1987 through February 7, 1988, and it asserted that Monroe\u2019s \u201ccurrent condition is the result of subsequent activity and therefore not related to the alleged injury of April 29, 1987.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">A hearing was held on October 12, 1990, in Boise, Idaho, before a referee. On September 20, 1991, the referee issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and proposed order. The referee\u2019s recommendation was based upon the oral and documentary evidence adduced at the hearing, post-hearing depositions, and briefs of counsel. The referee stated the issues as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-22\">(1) Whether the Claimant\u2019s symptoms associated with a bulging disc at the L5-S1 level are related to the April 29, 1987 injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-23\">(2) Whether the Claimant is entitled to medical care and workers\u2019 compensation benefits for these additional symptoms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-24\">(3) Whether the Claimant is entitled to a permanent partial impairment rating as a result of the April 29, 1987 injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-25\">(4) Whether the Claimant is entitled to a permanent partial disability rating exceeding the impairment rating; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-26\">(5) Determination of the amount of any impairment and disability rating.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Among other things, the referee found that Monroe suffered a \u201cnew and distinct injury in July of 1989,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[sjinee [Monroe\u2019s] new symptoms are not the direct and natural consequence or result of his 1987 injury, he is unable to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the condition,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he \u201cdoes not have a permanent partial disability which exceeds the permanent physical impairment rate of 10% of the whole person\u201d because he \u201chas not established any non-medical factors which increase his disability above the permanent physical impairment rate.\u201d Finally, the referee proposed that Monroe be allowed income benefits for permanent partial disability of 10% of the whole person for fifty weeks, but be denied benefits for his herniated disc at the L5-S1 level. The Industrial Commission of the State of Idaho (\u201cCommission\u201d), after conducting a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, adopted the referee\u2019s proposal on September 20, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">We address the following issues raised by Monroe:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">I. Is there substantial competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that Monroe is not entitled to benefits for problems associated with a bulging or herniated disc at the L5-S1 level because his 1989 injury is not causally related to his 1987 injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">II. Is there substantial competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s denial of permanent disability benefits above the 10% permanent partial impairment rating?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">IS THERE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION\u2019S FINDING THAT MONROE IS NOT ENTITLED TO BENEFITS FOR PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH A BULGING OR HERNIATED DISC AT THE L5-S1 LEVEL BECAUSE HIS 1989 INJURY IS NOT CAUSALLY RELATED TO HIS 1987 INJURY?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">This Court has appellate jurisdiction over orders of the Industrial Commission. Idaho Const, art. V, \u00a7 9. The conditions, scope, and procedure on appeal from an order of the Commission may be provided by the legislature. Idaho Const, art. V, \u00a7 9. In this regard, the legislature has limited this Court\u2019s ability to set aside a decision of the Commission to the following four grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">(1) The commission\u2019s findings of fact are not based on any substantial competent evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-16\">(2) The commission has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-17\">(3) The findings of fact, order or award were procured by fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-18\">(4) The findings of fact do not as a matter of law support the order or award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-19\">1.C. \u00a7 72-732.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-20\">In regard to the first ground for setting aside an order of the Commission, our review of the Commission\u2019s findings of fact \u201cdoes not entail a <em>de novo </em>determination of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Graham v. Larry Donohoe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Logging, </em>103 Idaho 824, 825, 654 P.2d 1377, 1378 (1982), citing I.C. \u00a7 72-732. In other words, this Court does not try the matter anew, acting as a trial court does in weighing the evidence before it. Rather, \u201c[w]e are not concerned with whether this Court would have reached the same conclusion, but rather, with whether the findings by the Commission are supported by substantial, competent evidence.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>103 Idaho at 825-26, 654 P.2d at 1378-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">B. <em>Application of the Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Monroe alleges that the Commission erred in concluding that his 1989 injury was not a work-related injury. This conclusion rests wholly upon the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Gary Botimer, a physician who treated Monroe after the 1987 and 1989 injuries. A review of the transcript of his deposition discloses that he testified that Monroe\u2019s \u201csymptoms are from the second\u201d injury. Further, Dr. Botimer testified that between the time of the surgery following the 1987 injury and the 1989 injury, Monroe was asymptomatic. While there may be conflicting testimony, or testimony capable of different interpretations, in Dr. Botimer\u2019s deposition testimony, this Court is not in the business of weighing evidence in Industrial Commission cases. The above-stated testimony of Dr. Botimer constitutes substantial competent evidence in support of the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the 1989 injury is not causally related to the 1987 injury and, therefore, not a compensable work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We note that the present case is not controlled by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>93 Idaho 107, 456 P.2d 751 (1969). In <em>Johnson, </em>the claimant suffered an on-the-job back injury. After the injury, he underwent surgeries and recurrences of back pain. Approximately three years after the accident, he slipped while attempting to get into a pickup truck and immediately experienced back pain. He underwent more treatment. The second incident was an off-the-job accident. On appeal, this Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s award to the claimant, holding that \u201cthe \u2018pick-up truck\u2019 accident was not an overriding trauma which superseded respondent\u2019s previous history\u201d and that \u201cthe facts in this case support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u2018pick-up truck\u2019 incident aggravated a pre-existing condition....\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>93 Idaho at 11-12, 456 P.2d at 755-56. In the present ease, there was no pre-existing condition, as Monroe was asymptomatic after the 1987 injury. It was not until the 1989 ditch-cleaning incident that Monroe first experienced symptoms indicative of the type of injury he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">IS THERE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION\u2019S DENIAL OF PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS ABOVE THE 10% PERMANENT PARTIAL IMPAIRMENT RATING?</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">The Commission ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-15\">Though the evidence shows that the Claimant has some increased difficulty in performing his current employment and requires assistance with heavy lifting at times, at least part of this increased difficulty is attributable to the July 19, 1989, incident at home, rather than to the April, 1987, work-related injury. The Claimant\u2019s rate of earnings is higher at the present time than it was at the time of his injury. The Claimant has not established any non-medical factors which increase his disability above the permanent physical impairment rate. The Referee therefore concludes that the Claimant does not have a permanent partial disability which exceeds the permanent physical impairment rate of 10% of the whole person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">Regarding appellant\u2019s impairment rating, the referee found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-17\">During his deposition, Dr. Botimer for the first time expressed an opinion concerning an impairment rating for the disc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>injury at the L4-5 level and surgery which had been performed in November of 1987. He estimates that the Claimant has a 10% impairment of the whole person as a result of that injury. The Defendants do not dispute that impairment rating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">The Referee finds that the Claimant has a permanent physical impairment of 10% of the whole person as a result of the April 29, 1987, injury for which he is entitled to income benefits. The Claimant has not established that non-medical factors increase the Claimant\u2019s permanent partial disability above the impairment rating. The Referee, therefore, finds that the Claimant has a permanent partial disability of 10% of the whole person as a result of the April 29, 1987, injury which includes consideration of the permanent physical impairment and pertinent non-medical factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The claimant bears the burden of proving disability in excess of his or her impairment rating. <em>Seese v. Ideal of Idaho, Inc., </em>110 Idaho 32, 34, 714 P.2d 1, 3 (1985). \u201cThe test for such determination is not whether the claimant is able to work at some employment, but rather whether the physical impairment, taken in conjunction with nonmedical factors, has reduced the claimant\u2019s capacity for gainful activity.\u201d <em>Seese, </em>110 Idaho at 34, 714 P.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In <em>Horton v. Garrett Freightlines, Inc., </em>115 Idaho 912, 912-13, 772 P.2d 119,119-20 (1989) <em>(Horton II), </em>this Court addressed \u201cwhether physical impairments that arose after the work-related injury to the employee (Horton), but which were the result of physical conditions that pre-existed the work-related injury, should be considered by the Commission when making a determination of the degree of Horton\u2019s permanent disability.\u201d Horton had appealed from the Commission\u2019s decision finding him to be permanently partially impaired to the extent to 12% of the whole person and permanently disabled to the extent of 30% of the whole person. This Court held that \u201call physical impairments that were caused by the work-related injury and by all pre-existing conditions should be taken into account\u201d when evaluating permanent disability as prescribed in I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-425 and 72-730. <em>Horton II, </em>115 Idaho at 917, 772 P.2d at 124. However, we disagreed that liability could be apportioned to the employer where \u201c[t]he injury to Horton\u2019s right hip did not produce the symptomatology and the disability to Horton\u2019s left hip, his shoulders, and his back. These impairments arose independently. They were, as the Commission said, \u2018unrelated.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Horton II, </em>115 Idaho at 919, 772 P.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Monroe\u2019s argument as to the consideration of non-medical factors is premised upon his contention that the Commission\u2019s finding that his 1989 injury was not a work-related injury was not supported by substantial and competent evidence. We have held that that finding is supported by substantial and competent evidence, and therefore, non-medical factors resulting from that injury need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Likewise, Monroe\u2019s 1989 injury constitutes an independent impairment, unrelated to his 1987 work-related injury. We hold that the Commission properly evaluated Monroe\u2019s permanent disability, and that there is substantial and competent evidence to support its denial of awarding disability above impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Costs to respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-14\">JOHNSON and TROUT, JJ., and REINHARDT, J., Pro Tern, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. The referee found that \u201c[i]n April of 1987, the Claimant injured his back while attempting to reinstall an air conditioner which had been removed for service\" while he was employed with Chuck &amp; Del\u2019s. In addition, the referee found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ0\">In July of 1989, the Claimant experienced an episode of severe back pain at his home. The Claimant had dug a trench the previous week for placement of a sprinkler system. Some dirt had fallen into the trench and the Claimant intended to remove the dirt. He lifted a shovel in preparation for doing so and experienced severe back pain extending into the left leg and foot. The pain was sufficiently severe that he had to crawl into his house as he could not rise. Since the incident at Claimant\u2019s home, he has noted increased symptoms and different symptoms compared to those which were present prior to the incident. The pain is now constant in the Claimant\u2019s left leg, and he notes numbness on the bottom of his left foot. He experiences more problems doing his work and requires assistance when any heavy lifting is necessary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-22\">.

Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, the case of <em>Johnson v. Boise Cascade Corp., </em>93 Idaho 107, 456 P.2d 751 (1969), compels a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><em>Johnson </em>presents facts that are markedly similar to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Johnson had injured his back in the course of employment. The doctor believed that Johnson had a possible lumbar disc protrusion at the L4-5 level, which was removed in several surgeries. Over three years later, Johnson slipped while trying to get into a truck, reached for the steering wheel to keep from falling, and experienced low back pain. His doctor stated that the truck incident had aggravated his past back pathology. In a later surgery, the doctor removed the L4-5 disc, but the patient still suffered from arachnoiditis, a condition which could be caused by trauma or chemicals. Apparently, the only testimony was from Johnson\u2019s doctor. The Industrial Accident Board there found that \u201cthe condition of said disc material and continued complaints of claimant prior to said surgery [after the non-work-related accident] show a direct causal connection with the [earlier] industrial accident.\u201d In Monroe\u2019s case, his doctor\u2019s deposition testimony (which, by stipulation of both parties, was the only evidence before the referee and therefore was uncontroverted) stated that Monroe\u2019s first accident caused an injury at the L4-5 level, which was remedied by surgery, and caused a bulging disc at the L5-S1 space, as demonstrated by an MRI scan. When Monroe picked up his shovel (presumably less traumatic to the back than preventing a fall out of a pick-up truck) two years later, he injured the disc at L5-Sl and became symptomatic. In fact, the only difference between the two cases is that Johnson maintained roughly the same symptoms throughout his injuries, whereas Monroe developed new symptoms after his most recent accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In light of the similarities between these case, it is surprising that the referee never addresses or even cites Johnson. The majority, in an after-the-fact attempted save, tries to distinguish Johnson from the instant case by stating that \u201c[i]n the present case, there was no pre-existing condition, as Monroe was asymptomatic after the 1987 injury.\u201d I would agree with the majority\u2019s distinction if the majority\u2019s factual assertion was not patently erroneous. That assertion, however, is erroneous. The referee never expressly made a finding as to whether there was a pre-existing condition. The referee, however, <em>did </em>find that Monroe \u201csuffered a new and distinct injury in July of 1989 which brought on [his] left-sided symptoms and evidently resulted in an <em>additional </em>bulging or herniation of the disc in question.\u201d Findings of Fact, p. 6 (emphasis added). The referee continued, \u201cThe Claimant\u2019s symptoms were dramatic and different and apparently resulted from some <em>increased </em>pathology at the L5-S1 level.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). It is clear, then, that the referee accepted that Monroe had pre-existing bulging or herniation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>pathology at that same disc that he later injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">It is noteworthy Johnson was not simply a case where this Court deferred to the Industrial Commission\u2019s findings of fact under a substantial, competent evidence standard. In its discussion of <em>Johnson, </em>the majority only tells half the story: this Court actually declared, \u201cNot only do we believe that the facts in this case support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u2018pick-up truck\u2019 incident aggravated a pre-existing condition, <em>but we believe that a contrary conclusion on the part of the Board would have been unreasonable.\u201d Johnson, </em>93 Idaho at 111-12, 456 P.2d at 755-56 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The referee appeared to define causation far too narrowly. <em>Johnson </em>held that the non-work related pickup truck accident was not a superseding trauma. It is thus hard to imagine how the referee could find that Monroe\u2019s second injury was a \u201cnew and distinct injury with no direct causal connection to the Claimant\u2019s April, 1987, injury,\u201d even though the most recent injury \u201cwas superimposed on the preexisting pathology-\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In addition, an examination of Dr. Botimer\u2019s deposition transcript shows that the evidence adduced therein utterly failed to support the referee\u2019s finding of lack of causation. For instance, Dr. Botimer stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">The question is how much do you ascribe to the first and how much do you ascribe to the second injury as to causing his true problem. When you phrase it symptoms, I have to say the symptoms are from the second. When you say which is responsible or led up to or compromised him so that he could have gotten the second one, then you have to say that\u2019s related to the first one also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Deposition transcript, p. 22. Another example is this exchange between Dr. Botimer and Mr. Shurtliff, respondents\u2019 attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhX\">[Shurtliff]: The initial injury created the condition, L5-S1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">[Botimer]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">[Shurtliff]: And the second injury exacerbated it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">[Botimer]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-13\"><em>Id., </em>p. 20. The only evidence that could conceivably be construed as supporting the referee\u2019s conclusion came about during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_e\">[Shurtliff]: You <em>don\u2019t have a crystal ball </em>that can tell you <em>with a surety </em>that but for that previous injury, he wouldn\u2019t have hurt his back, L5-S1, on that day that he cleaned his ditch, can you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFMe\">[Botimer]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_B\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_X\">[Shurtliff]: Well, but isn\u2019t that <em>true\u2014it would be extreme, </em>but that\u2019s true right now of any of the four of us who\u2019ve never had a previous problem that we could, in just doing something ordinary, go over and herniate a disc?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af1c\">[Botimer]: People have done herniated discs with normal activities like that, but <em>it\u2019s unusual.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKh\">[Shurtliff]: But not medically <em>impossible?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alu\">[Botimer]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abf\"><em>Id., </em>p. 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">Thus, the uncontested evidence clearly demonstrated that it was highly probable, although not completely impossible, that the first injury was causally related to the second injury. But in fact, all that is necessary is that an expert testify to a reasonable degree of medical probability. This Dr. Botimer did.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">In light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the conclusion that the disc already damaged in the first accident further ruptured in the second accident, there was no substantial competent evidence to support the conclusion that the herniated disk was in no way caused by the first accident.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">Although the substantial and competent evidence test dictates that we defer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>findings of the Industrial Commission and its referees, it is not to be, nor should it be, used as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d to affirm each and every Industrial Commission decision. This is particularly true when the Commission fails to follow applicable Idaho case law. <em>See, e.g., Hill v. E &amp; L Farms, </em>123 Idaho 371, 848 P.2d 429 (1993). And it is even more true when the only evidence is uncontroverted deposition testimony, in which credibility is not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">This Court should vacate the Industrial Commission\u2019s order and remand the cause for proceedings consistent with our case law and with the factual reality of Monroe\u2019s unfortunate situation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\">. The majority\u2019s (and referee\u2019s) preoccupation with symptoms is odd, to say the least. For instance, the referee defined \u201d[t]he primary issue to be determined\u201d as \"whether the Claimant\u2019s left-sided <em>symptoms, </em>emanating from the bulging disc at L5-S1 on the left side, and subsequent treatment of this condition, are causally related to the Claimant\u2019s 1987 injury so that he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for this condition.\u201d Findings of Fact, p. 6 (emphasis added). Nowhere in the worker\u2019s compensation act does the word \"symptoms\u201d appear. The relevant inquiry is, as the majority correctly notes, whether there is \"substantial competent evidence to support the Commission's finding that Monroe is not entitled to benefits for problems associated with a bulging or herniated disc at the L5-S1 level <em>because his 1989 injury is not causally related to his 1987 injury.\u201d </em>Even the majority, then recognizes that the issue is whether Monroe\u2019s second injury was caused in some way by his 1987 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Moreover, the referee notes that Dr. Botimer remarked upon a \u201cbulging disc at the L5-S1 level on the left side which he had elected not to enter at the time of the Claimant\u2019s previous surgery because the Claimant did not have left-sided symptoms at that time.\u201d Findings of Fact, p. 5. Dr. Botimer then formed the opinion that \"the original injury ruptured or bulged the disc at L5-S1 and the second episode continued that process to make him symptomatic.\u201d The doctor clearly delineated the difference between \"injuries\u201d and \"symptoms\u201d and implicitly testified that an injury could exist without symptoms. The referee never stated that he disbelieved the doctor\u2019s expertise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">. Dr. Botimer\u2019s testimony that such an injury would be unusual for a person with an uninjured back would seem to indicate that in light of the fact that Monroe had previously injured that same disc, it would be even less probable that the second injury was not caused by the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
