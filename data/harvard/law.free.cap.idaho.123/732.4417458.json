We hold that a statutory employer who carries workers\u2019 compensation insurance is not liable to an employee of an uninsured contractor for the additional ten percent of compensation, plus costs and attorney fees imposed on an employer who does not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">Pyramid Framing Contractors, Inc. contracted to have carpentry work done by Bob Weightman. Weightman employed Kevin Vickers. While Vickers was working at a Pyramid job site, he fell, sustaining head injuries that caused his death. Weightman did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. As Vickers\u2019s statutory employer, Pyramid is liable to pay death benefits to Vickers\u2019s surviving spouse and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-24\">Asserting I.C. \u00a7 72-210, Vickers\u2019s spouse and children applied to the Industrial Commission for an order requiring Pyramid and its surety to pay an additional amount equal to ten percent of the compensation for Vickers\u2019s death, together with costs and attorney fees. The Commission dismissed the application on the grounds that the statute applies only to employers who fail to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance and that Pyramid had insurance covering its liability as Vickers\u2019s statutory employer. Vickers\u2019s spouse and children appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">AN INSURED STATUTORY EMPLOYER IS NOT LIABLE FOR A TEN PERCENT PENALTY, PLUS COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES UNDER I.C. \u00a7 72-210, WHEN THE STATUTORY EMPLOYER IS LIABLE FOR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION BENEFITS BECAUSE A CONTRACTOR WAS NOT INSURED.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Vickers\u2019s spouse and children assert that an insured statutory employer is liable for an additional ten percent of compensation, plus costs, and attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 72-210, when the statutory employer is liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits because a contractor was not insured. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">72-210. Employer\u2019s failure to insure liability.\u2014If an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this act, an injured employee, or one contracting an occupational disease, or [the employee\u2019s] dependents or legal representative in case death results from the injury or disease, may claim compensation under this law and shall be awarded, in addition to compensation, an amount \u00e9qual to ten per cent (10%) of the total amount of [the employee\u2019s] compensation together with costs, if any, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees if [the employee] has retained counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">I.C. \u00a7 72-210.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">A clear reading of this statute does not allow us to penalize Pyramid and its surety for the failure of Weightman to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Pyramid carried insurance, and this insurance covers the liability to Vickers\u2019s spouse and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Counsel for Vickers\u2019s spouse and children invites us to rule that the additional amount, costs, and attorney fees prescribed in I.C. \u00a7 72-210 should be considered as part of the compensation for which the statutory employer is liable. This invitation is premised on the construction of I.C. \u00a7 41-1839 in <em>Emery v. United Pac. Ins. Co., </em>120 Idaho 244, 815 P.2d 442 (1991), citing <em>Holliday v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>89 Idaho 293, 301, 404 P.2d 634, 639 (1965) (The attorney fees authorized by I.C. \u00a7 41-1839 is not a penalty, but an additional sum rendered as just compensation.).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">This premise is contrary to <em>Heese v. A &amp; T Trucking, </em>102 Idaho 598, 635 P.2d 962 (1981), where the Court stated that I.C. \u00a7 72-210 \u201cspecifically imposes <em>penalties </em>upon an employer who \u2018fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600, 635 P.2d at 964 (emphasis added). Therefore, we reject counsel\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-19\">We affirm the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-20\">We award Pyramid and its surety costs, but not attorney fees, on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-21\">McDEVITT, C.J., BISTLINE and TROUT, JJ., and SCHILLING, J., Pro Tern, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
