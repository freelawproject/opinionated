In the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>plaintiffs alleged that the Wilcoxes were employed by the state of Idaho at the Child Development Center and provided respite or foster care through the state of Idaho. In addition, plaintiffs alleged that \u201cthe minor Plaintiffs suffered incidences of repeated sexual exploitation, sexual molestation, and sexual abuse between May, 1980, and May, 1987, at the said Child Development Center and at the home of Defendants Jay Wilcox and Shirley Wilcox----\u201d Further, plaintiffs alleged that \u201cthe adult Plaintiffs were never informed by representatives of the Defendant, State of Idaho, nor by its Department of Health &amp; Welfare, nor by any of its employees at its Child Development Center, of the sexual exploitation, sexual molestation, and sexual abuse of the minor Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As to Wilcox, plaintiffs alleged that she \u201cwas negligent in one or more of the following:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">a. In failing to report to the law enforcement authorities, the sexual abuse, exploitation and molestation which occurred at her home by Defendant, Jay Wilcox, which duty to report is set out in Idaho Code \u00a7 16-1619, Idaho Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">b. In failing to report to her husband\u2019s employer the tendencies and sexual molestation of other children by her husband, Defendant Jay Wilcox.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">c. In failing to warn or provide adequate safety for the minor Plaintiffs herein, who were brought to her home by her husband, Defendant Jay Wilcox, knowing the sexual propensities of her husband, Defendant Jay Wilcox.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">Plaintiffs prayed for their economic and non-economic losses against Wilcox, reasonable attorney fees, and costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">B. <em>The Declaratory Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">On June 25, 1990, Enumclaw filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. In the complaint, Enumclaw alleged that it was not liable under the policy of insurance issued to Wilcox with respect to the claims made against her by the twelve anonymous plaintiffs. Specifically, Enumclaw stated that it denied liability because \u201cit appears that the basis of the claims against Shirley Wilcox, are not an accident or \u2018occurrence\u2019 as set out in the terms of the insurance policy____\u201d Enumclaw attached an insurance policy to its complaint, which it alleged was \u201cin effect during all times relevant to the matters contained in this complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">On July 9, 1990, Enumclaw filed an amended complaint for declaratory judgment. In the amended complaint, Enumclaw added that the insurance policy did not provide coverage pursuant to an exclusion relating to intentional conduct, because Wilcox\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s acts were intentional and Wilcox\u2019s failure to report was also intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">On February 14, 1991, Wilcox filed an answer to the first amended complaint for declaratory judgment. In her answer, Wilcox alleged that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, that there was not an actual controversy between the parties, that the exclusions cited by Enumclaw were irrelevant, that Enumclaw is estopped from withdrawing because she relied on a letter from Enumclaw which stated that Enumclaw would defend her, and that Enumclaw has waived its right to withdraw defense or coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">On March 6, 1991, Enumclaw filed a motion for summary judgment. Along with the motion for summary judgment, Mark Canterbury, a Personal Lines Senior Underwriter who has access to all insurance policies issued by Enumclaw, filed an affidavit which stated that an attached homeowner\u2019s insurance policy (the \u201cEnumclaw Policy\u201d) was in effect between Enumclaw and Wilcox from February 1, 1971 to March 7, 1985. In addition, J. Walter Sinclair, an attorney for Enumclaw, filed an affidavit stating that he attended the January 22, 1991 deposition of Wilcox. Sinclair attached \u201crelevant excerpts\u201d of the transcript of the deposition to his affidavit. Among other things, the attached excerpts revealed that Wilcox stated that her ex-husband told her in July of 1978 \u201c[t]hat he had touched him inappropriately one time.\u201d Further, after telling Wilcox, he told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Mormon bishop. In addition, after being excommunicated from the Mormon church, the Wilcoxes provided respite care to children in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">On March 7, 1991, the intervenors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed an answer to plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint. In addition to the defenses raised by Wilcox, the intervenors added that Enumclaw\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations and laches and that the insurance policy should be construed against Enumclaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On April 2, 1991, Roger B. Wright, an attorney for Wilcox, filed an affidavit in which he stated that he attended the January 22, 1991, deposition of Wilcox. Wright attached \u201crelevant excerpts\u201d of the transcript of the deposition to his affidavit. Among other things, the excerpts revealed that Wilcox did not believe her ex-husband was continuing to engage in inappropriate touching with her son after her ex-husband had been excommunicated from the Mormon church.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On April 10, 1991, Wilcox filed an affidavit in which she stated that the insurance policies attached to the initial complaint and Mark Canterbury\u2019s affidavit did not appear to be the same as the policy that she had in her possession. Wilcox attached a copy of her original insurance policy (the \u201cWilcox Policy\u201d), the \u201conly policy [she knew] to have been in effect during the period relevant to Plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On April 11, 1991, the intervenors filed a motion for summary judgment. Wilcox joined the intervenors\u2019 motion on April 12, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">On May 7, 1991, Joyce Grager filed an affidavit. In her affidavit, she stated that she has been employed by Enumclaw for the past fifteen years and was in charge of a program at Enumclaw in which the language of homeowners\u2019 insurance policies was simplified in 1983. Further, she stated that when each homeowner\u2019s policy came up for renewal on or after November 1, 1983, the new \u201csimplified\u201d policies were automatically sent to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Argument on the cross-motions for summary judgment was heard on May 8, 1991. The district court issued its memorandum decision on June 5, 1991, its order denying Enumclaw\u2019s motion and granting the Wilcox/intervenor motion for summary judgment on June 9, 1991, and summary judgment dated June 10, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">In its memorandum decision, the district court stated that \u201cthe first question to be resolved is which of the two Enumclaw homeowner\u2019s policies ... were in effect at the times in question.\u201d The court noted that \u201cfor purposes of Enumclaw\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Enumclaw admits that [Wilcox\u2019s] policy is the applicable policy for the period of May, 1980 through May, 1987. Based upon that admission, the court will rule upon Enumclaw\u2019s motion for summary judgment based upon the provisions and language contained in [the Wilcox] [P]olicy.\u201d However, since Enumclaw did not concede the applicability of the Wilcox Policy with respect to the Wilcox/intervenor motion for summary judgment, the district court stated that \u201cthere is a genuine issue of material fact as to which policy is applicable from and after November, 1983.\u201d Since the court found that there was a factual dispute, it reasoned that it would have to deny the Wilcox/intervenor motion unless there was no \u201csubstantial and material difference\u201d between the Enumclaw Policy and the Wilcox Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">The district court first addressed Enumclaw\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As to the contention that Wilcox\u2019s conduct did not constitute an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which the Wilcox Policy defines as \u201can accident ...,\u201d the court noted that the Wilcox Policy did not define the term \u201caccident;\u201d and, thus, the term is \u201cunclear, and therefore ambiguous from the language of the policy itself____\u201d Since an ambiguity in an insurance contract must be resolved in favor of the insured, the district court reasoned, the court adopted the broad definition of \u201caccident\u201d given in <em>Penley v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>414 P.2d 305, 308 (Okla.1966), which the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>court stated as: \u201can injury is the result of an \u2018accident\u2019 if it is not caused by intentional conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The second question was whether Wilcox\u2019s \u201calleged misconduct in the underlying case was intentional. If it was, then [the Wilcox] [P]olicy provides no liability coverage. On the other hand, if it was not, then coverage exists.\u201d In this regard, the district court specifically distinguished between Wilcox\u2019s conduct and her ex-husband\u2019s conduct \u2014 \u201cit is <em>her </em>acts or omissions, and not those of her husband, which must be scrutinized in order to determine whether they constitute an \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of [the Wilcox] [P]olicy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court stated that \u201c[w]hile it may be that [Wilcox] intentionally decided not to report or warn of her husband\u2019s misconduct, that decision constituted nothing more than a mistake or an error in judgment. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that she intentionally harmed anyone.\u201d Thus, the district court found that Wilcox's conduct constituted an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the Wilcox Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The district court then addressed the policy exclusions relating to the wilful violation of a law or ordinance by the insured and expected or intended injury. As to the wilful violation of a law exclusion, the court found that since this exclusion was not in the Wilcox Policy, but only in the Enumclaw Policy, it would not be considered. As to the expected or intended injury exclusion, the court found that there was no evidence that Wilcox expected or intended to injure anyone. In addition, the court stated that \u201c[w]hile it may be argued that [Wilcox\u2019s] failure to report or warn of her husband\u2019s sexual misconduct could foreseeably result in injury to the minor plaintiffs in the underlying action, in this court\u2019s view foreseeability does not amount to an expectation of or an intent to cause injury,\u201d citing <em>Farmers Ins. Group v. Sessions, </em>100 Idaho 914, 607 P.2d 422 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The court then reviewed the business pursuits exclusion of the Wilcox Policy. In this regard, the court followed the rationale of <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Sipple, </em>255 N.W.2d 373 (Minn.1977), and found that \u201cthe acts of molesting the children were not acts that contributed, or furthered the interest of, the Wilcox business.\u201d Thus, the court ruled that the business pursuits exclusion does not bar coverage for Wilcox as to those children who may have been molested at the Child Development Center by her ex-husband since Wilcox was not engaged in any business pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">As to the children who may have been molested at the Wilcox home while Wilcox and her ex-husband were providing respite or foster care for them, the district court turned to the definition of \u201cbusiness pursuits\u201d given in <em>Black v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>115 Idaho 449, 767 P.2d 824 (Ct. App.1989). With this definition in mind, the court concluded that Wilcox\u2019s \u201cactivities in providing respite or foster care did not constitute a business.\u201d Particularly, the court found that Wilcox and her ex-husband \u201cprovided respite and foster care primarily for humanitarian reasons, and not for commercialism or profit,\u201d that the activities were \u201cperformed intermittently and not on a regular basis,\u201d and that \u201cany compensation received for such care was equalled or exceeded by the expenses involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Initially, the district court concluded that the provision of the Wilcox Policy regarding the scope of coverage (the \u201coccurrence\u201d and \u201caccident\u201d provision) was \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as the provision in the Enumclaw Policy. The court then found that the exclusion regarding a wilful violation of the law did not apply to Wilcox\u2019s conduct because only her ex-husband violated the law and because Enumclaw had not alleged that her ex-husband\u2019s conduct is imputed to Wilcox. Finally, the district court found that the business pursuits exclusion of the Wilcox Policy was substantially the same as that in the Enumclaw Policy, and, thus, inapplicable. The court granted the Wilcox/intervenor motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Enumclaw filed a notice of appeal on June 26, 1991. It appealed from \u201c(1) an order on Motion for Summary Judgment dated June 9, 1991; (2) a Motion to Intervene dated April 9,1991; and a subsequent order relating to the award of attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>fees and costs____\u201d The notice was filed pursuant to I.A.R. 11(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">By order dated July 9, 1991, the district court awarded Wilcox $33.00 in costs as a matter of right and $5,794.25 in attorney fees, but refused to award discretionary costs. Further, the court awarded the intervenors $359.90 in costs as a matter of right, but refused to award discretionary costs and attorney fees because it found the intervenors to not be parties entitled to fees under I.C. \u00a7 41-1839.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The intervenors filed a notice of cross-appeal on July 12, 1991. They appealed from an \u201cOrder denying Costs and Attorney!] Fees, entered in the above entitled action on the 12th day of July, 1991____\u201d The notice was filed pursuant to I.A.R. 11(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The issues raised on this appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">1. Was the district court correct in ruling that the conduct of Wilcox was an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the Enumclaw Policy and the Wilcox Policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">II. Was the district court correct in ruling that the insurance policy exclusions did not bar coverage for the conduct of Wilcox?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">III. Was the district court correct in ruling that if there was no substantial and material difference between the Wilcox Policy and the Enumclaw Policy, summary judgment could still be given on the Wilcox/intervenors motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">IV. Was the district court correct in awarding attorney fees and costs to Wilcox?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">V. Was the district court correct in ruling that the intervenors were not parties entitled to attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 41-1839?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">Was The District Court Correct In Ruling That The Conduct Of Wilcox Was An \u201cOccurrence\u201d Under The Terms Of The Enumclaw Policy And The Wilcox Policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-18\">The Enumclaw Policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially similar conditions.\u201d The Wilcox Policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d The district court found the term \u201caccident\u201d to be ambiguous, and resolved the ambiguity by adopting a definition of \u201caccident\u201d found in an Oklahoma case, <em>Penley v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>414 P.2d 305 (Okla.1966). The district court stated the definition given in <em>Penley </em>as: \u201can injury is the result of an \u2018accident\u2019 if it is not caused by intentional conduct.\u201d It adopted this definition of \u201caccident\u201d from <em>Penley </em>because it reasoned that rules of construction required it to give the word a broad definition since the policies left it undefined. We disagree with the reasoning of the district court as well as its adopted definition of \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-21\">In <em>Stein-McMurray Ins. v. Highlands Ins. Co., </em>95 Idaho 818, 820, 520 P.2d 865, 867 (1974), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-22\">[W]here a word or phrase used in an insurance contract has a settled legal meaning or interpretation, that meaning or interpretation must be given even though other interpretations are possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-23\">In other words, not every word and phrase in an insurance contract needs to be defined in the contract. Rather, insurance policies may contain words and phrases that simply have settled legal meanings or interpretations, and, thus, would not be ambiguous merely because the policy does not provide a definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-24\">In this case, both parties have cited a number of definitions for the word \u201caccident,\u201d including <em>Couch on Insurance, Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>and cases from other jurisdictions. All of these definitions, with the exception of the <em>Penley </em>definition, are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the definitions cited by the parties say essentially the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-25\">Accident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Insurance contract. </em>An accident within accident insurance policies is an event happening without any human agency, or, if happening through such agency, an event which, under circumstances, is unusual and not expected by the person to whom it happens. A more comprehensive term than \u201cnegligence,\u201d and in its common signification the word means an unexpected happening without intention or design.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 14 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">ac \u2022 ci \u2022 dent (ak 'si dent), <em>n. </em>1. an undesirable or unfortunate happening, unintentionally caused and usually resulting in harm, injury, damage, or loss; casualty; mishap: automobile accidents. 2. any event that happens unexpectedly, without a deliberate plan or cause____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary 9 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We hold that the word \u201caccident,\u201d as used in an insurance policy such as the two policies in this case, and not otherwise defined in the policy, has a settled legal meaning or interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">With this definition in mind, we turn to the alleged acts of Wilcox. It is <em>her conduct </em>that we must look to, and not to her ex-husband\u2019s conduct, because she is the only one whose acts could be covered by the policy in question. The twelve anonymous plaintiffs in the underlying action have alleged that Wilcox was negligent in failing to report or warn the proper authorities of the child molestation perpetrated upon minors by her ex-husband. Her alleged conduct is the failing to report or warn, while her ex-husband\u2019s conduct is the child molestation, which is intentional conduct and, thus, clearly not an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Looking to Wilcox\u2019s alleged conduct, we find that it is not an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies because it was not the conduct which caused injury. The injury suffered by the minors is child molestation. While the acts or failure to act by Wilcox may have created or contributed to the environment which permitted her ex-husband\u2019s conduct, Wilcox did not commit the acts complained of by the twelve anonymous plaintiffs. Therefore, the Enumclaw Policy and the Wilcox Policy do not provide coverage for Wilcox.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Because we hold that the policy in question does not afford coverage for Wilcox, it is unnecessary to consider the policy exclusions, the issue relating to whether the intervenors were parties entitled to attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 41-1839, and whether the district court could proceed on the Wilcox/intervenor motion for summary judgment if it found no \u201csubstantial and material difference\u201d between the insurance policies. Further, the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The decision of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">No costs or fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-12\">BAKES, C.J., and JOHNSON, BISTLINE and TROUT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\">.
