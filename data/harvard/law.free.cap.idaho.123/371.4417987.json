The claimant was injured while working on a potato seed duster conveyor belt at E &amp; L Farms. Russet contends that under the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine the Industrial Commission should have found E &amp; L to be Hill\u2019s employer at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The Industrial Commission (the Commission) made the following findings of fact. In early 1988, Hill was employed by Russet as a maintenance worker. On or about February 23, 1988, the work Hill was performing at Russet temporarily ended. Hill asked the manager of Russet, Val Whitehead, for additional work. Whitehead consulted with his brother, Scott Whitehead, who is the manager of E &amp; L Farms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hill was directed to report to E &amp; L for temporary work, and while at E <em>&amp; </em>L, Scott Whitehead directed Hill\u2019s activities. While so engaged in performing services for E <em>&amp; </em>L, specifically, repairing a seed dusting machine owned by E &amp; L, Hill was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Hill filed a Notice of Injury and Claim for Benefits with the Industrial Commission asserting as defendants E &amp; L Farms and its surety, the State Insurance Fund (SIF). SIF denied coverage of the claim on the basis that at the time of the industrial accident Hill was an employee of Russet, not E &amp; L. Russet in turn denied that assertion. After conducting a hearing where both E &amp; L and Russet introduced evidence, the Commission ruled that Russet was Hill\u2019s employer at the time of the accident and hence liable for all worker\u2019s compensation benefits due Hill as a result of the accident. Russet and USF <em>&amp; </em>G have appealed the Commission\u2019s decision on both factual and legal grounds. In particular, they contend that the Commission incorrectly applied the law to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">In reaching its decision, the Commission relied solely on a worker\u2019s compensation treatise, Larson\u2019s <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>(1986). In doing so, the Commission used a three-pronged test to determine whether a special employer is an employer for the purpose of worker\u2019s compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALaq\">When a general employer lends an employee to a special employer, the special employer becomes liable for [worker\u2019s] [compensation only if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-17\">(a) the employee has made a contract of hire, express or implied, with the special employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-18\">(b) the work being done is essentially that of the special employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-19\">(c) the special employer has the right to control the details of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-20\">Commission's Findings at 6 (quoting from Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 48.00). The Commission also quoted Larson for the principle that \u201cthe pivotal issue is whether or not there was a contract of hire expressed or implied between the employee and the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ployer. If the issue cannot be answered yes, the investigation is closed____\u201d Commission\u2019s Findings at 6. Additionally, the Commission assigned the burden of proof to Russet, citing Larson, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 48.14 (1986), for the proposition that a presumption exists of continued employment with the general or original employer unless that employer shows that the special employer has been substituted for the old general employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Since this Court is not bound by the Commission\u2019s conclusions of law, we will exercise free review with respect to appellants\u2019 contention. <em>Combs v. Kelly Logging, </em>115 Idaho 695, 769 P.2d 572 (1989). We find that <em>Pinson v. Minidoka Highway District, </em>61 Idaho 731, 106 P.2d 1020 (1940), and <em>Paullas v. Andersen Excavating, </em>113 Idaho 156, 742 P.2d 411 (1987), as appellants urge, are the material Idaho cases as to when an employer is liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the borrowed servant doctrine. An examination of <em>Sines v. Sines, </em>110 Idaho 776, 718 P.2d 1214 (1986) is also necessary to a clear resolution of this issue in Idaho.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">Our <em>Pinson </em>case establishes that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWR\">[t]he general test is the <em>right </em>to control and direct the activities of the employee, or the power to control the details of the work to be performed and to determine how it shall be done, and whether it shall stop or continue, that gives rise to the relationship of employer and employee, and where the employee comes under the direction and control of the person to whom his services have been furnished, the latter becomes his temporary employer, and liable for compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-7\"><em>Pinson, </em>61 Idaho at 737, 106 P.2d at 1022 (citations omitted, emphasis in original). Moreover, the <em>Paullas </em>Court specifically stated that the \u201cright to control\u201d test is the primary test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">The State Insurance Fund urges us to abandon the \u201cright-to-control\u201d test and, instead, adopt what is called a \u201crelative nature-of-the-work\u201d test advanced by Professor Larson. This alternative test has been discussed in <em>Sines v. Sines, </em>110 Idaho 776, 777 n. 1, 718 P.2d 1214, 1215 n. 1 (1986). <em>See also Burns v. Nyberg, </em>108 Idaho 151, 156, 697 P.2d 1165, 1170 (1985) (Bistline, J., dissenting). To date, however, a majority of this Court has been disinclined to adopt the new test and, thus, overturn literally dozens of prior Idaho cases. We are similarly reluctant today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">113 Idaho at 160, 742 P.2d at 415. It is of interest that <em>Sines v. Sines, </em>110 Idaho 776, 718 P.2d 1214 (1986), to which the <em>Paullas </em>Court cites, found that the worker in that case was not an employee due to the fact that the \u201cright-to-control\u201d test was not satisfied, even though a contract existed between the two parties. While the <em>Sines </em>case did not involve the borrowed servant doctrine, it is an example of this Court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cright to control\u201d test which the <em>Paullas </em>Court said was the same for both the determination of employee status and borrowed servant status.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Thus, in a two-employer situation, the \u201cright to control\u201d test is the primary determinative test, with the existence of a contract for hire, express or implied, and whether the work being done is essentially that of the special employer as secondary, \u201c[ajdditional factors germane to loaned employee status.\u201d <em>Paullas, </em>113 Idaho at 158, 742 P.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Because Idaho case law establishes that the primary test for the borrowed servant doctrine is the \u201cright to control\u201d test, and not merely the existence of a contract for hire, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the inquiry ends upon finding no contract for hire is erroneous. We reverse the Commission\u2019s decision and remand the cause to the Commission to determine the extent of E &amp; L\u2019s control over Hill and whether such control was significant enough to create an employer/employee relationship and liability under the worker\u2019s compensation laws.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-13\">McDEYITT, C.J., and JOHNSON and TROUT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b407-14\">BAKES, J., pro tern., concurs (following retirement on February 1, 1993).</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">.
