The claimant Ennis Yardley had been employed by Chuck\u2019s Freezer Meats in Weiser, Idaho, for approximately sixteen years when he injured his back in the course of his employment while butchering a hog. Claimant\u2019s back did not respond to treatment, and two surgeries were performed which resulted in claimant receiving a permanent physical impairment rating by Dr. Floyd G. Johnson of 30% of the whole body.</p>\n<p id=\"AsD\">Claimant was also evaluated by a vocational evaluation expert who, based upon claimant\u2019s limited educational background and other limited work skills, rendered an opinion that claimant could not return to his former occupation as a butcher, and further concluded that claimant was 95% vocationally impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">Subsequent to the rating by both Dr. Johnson and the vocational evaluator, but prior to a hearing to determine claimant\u2019s permanent disability, claimant was convicted of a felony and incarcerated in the penitentiary. Claimant\u2019s disability hearing was conducted at the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoc\">The Commission concluded, after that hearing, that claimant \u201chas a permanent partial disability of 60% of the whole person.\u201d The employer and its surety, the State Insurance Fund, appeal from that disability award.</p>\n<p id=\"AHA\">The appellants do not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the disability award of 60% of the \u201cwhole man.\u201d Nor do appellants assert as error the fact that the Commission\u2019s disability \u201cevaluation did not take into consideration the Claimant\u2019s criminal conviction and incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Appellants\u2019 sole issue on appeal is that, as a matter of law, the Commission should not have rendered a \u201cdetermination of the scope and extent of [claimant\u2019s] personal partial disability\u201d while claimant was incarcerated in the state prison. Appellants argue that since incarceration \u201cYardley had embarked on a course of education that might well lead to a GED [high school diploma] and that he has available to him the opportunity for retraining that likely will expand the number of post-incarceration employment possibilities available to him.\u201d Accordingly, appellants argue that the Commission erred in entering a permanent disability rating prior to the time that claimant is released from the state penitentiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants assert that the Commission should have entered an order granting claimant an award of 30% impairment only, deferring a final total disability award until claimant was released from the penitentiary. Nevertheless, we conclude that the Commission did not err in entering a permanent disability award in this case. <em>Baldner v. Bennett\u2019s, Inc., </em>103 Idaho 458, 649 P.2d 1214 (1982). The claimant\u2019s condition was stable, and the claimant was entitled to a rating. <em>Archer v. Bonners Ferry Datsun, </em>117 Idaho 166, 786 P.2d 557 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Claimant has requested an award of attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-804, claiming that the employer and its surety have contested his claim \u201cwithout reasonable ground.\u201d The effect of an injured worker\u2019s incarceration in the state penitentiary upon a claimant\u2019s award of permanent disability is a question of first impression in this state. While a claimant\u2019s incarceration could raise a number of legal issues, appellants have raised only one, <em>i.e., </em>whether or not the fact of incarceration, and the possibility of educational opportunity or retraining while incarcerated, precludes the Commission from entering a final permanent partial disability award prior to the claimant being released from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">That issue, while rather narrow, is not an unreasonable legal issue to raise on appeal from a decision of the Commission. Accordingly, we deny attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-804.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-8\">BISTLINE, JOHNSON, McDEVITT and TROUT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. Appellants also do not assert that the Commission should have retained jurisdiction, and accordingly we do not address that issue either.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
