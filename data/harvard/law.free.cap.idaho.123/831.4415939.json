Gamer (\u201cGarner\u201d) and Chris D. Hadley (\u201cHadley\u201d) applied for unemployment benefits after each had voluntarily quit his previous employment to accept offers of new employment which proved unsuccessful. Gamer quit his part-time work as a truck driver with Horkley Oil to accept a full-time position as a salesman for Anderson Lumber Company. Garner became partially unemployed after three months with Anderson Lumber due to a slow down. Hadley quit work as a house framing laborer for Roger Carney after he received an offer of employment from Y-J Foods for work as a butcher. Hadley\u2019s offer was later rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Although both claimants were initially determined to be ineligible for benefits, the appeals examiner reversed that determination, finding that each claimant had satisfied the requirements of IDAPA 09.30.483 and 09.30.484, and thus were entitled to benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Both Horkley Oil and Roger Carney protested the appeals examiner\u2019s decisions to the Commission, which reversed the decision of the appeals examiner in both cases. The Commission determined that IDAPA 09.30.484 was inconsistent with I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore, the appeals examiner\u2019s conclusion that Garner and Hadley had met their burdens of proving they quit their jobs with good cause in connection with their employment, as required by I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e), was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">In support of its decision, the Commission relied on <em>Schafer v. Ada County Assessor, </em>111 Idaho 870, 728 P.2d 394 (1986), which held that a county employee, who resigned his job voluntarily because he thought he had a firm job offer from another employer, left his job with \u201cgood cause.\u201d At the time <em>Schafer </em>was decided, the words \u201cconnected with his employment\u201d were not part of the definition of \u201cgood cause.\u201d However, a few months after <em>Schafer </em>was decided, I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) was amended to require that a claimant show that such individual \u201cleft his employment voluntarily [with] good cause <em>connected with his employment.\u201d </em>Based on this history of the law the Commission concluded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">The Commission concludes that the legislature intended, in amending the statute to again require that \u201cgood cause\u201d be \u201cconnected with\u201d an individual\u2019s \u201cemployment,\u201d to disallow benefits where an employee quit only because he or she intended to take another job. The fact that such a job would meet the requirements of [IDAPA 09.30.484] is irrelevant. The employee\u2019s decision to quit his or her employment in order to take a \u201cbetter\u201d job is subjective, personal and unique to the employee and is not \u201cconnected with\u201d the individual\u2019s prior employment. Because [IDAPA 09.30.484] contravenes I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e), it cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Following the Commission\u2019s decisions, the Department filed a motion to reconsider both cases. The Commission issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>consolidated \u201cOrder on Reconsideration\u201d which affirmed its previous decision that both Garner and Hadley left work for personal reasons unconnected with their employment. The Commission also reaffirmed its ruling that IDAPA 09.30.484 was invalid, finding the Department\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) to be unreasonable. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">We are asked to determine whether the Commission erred in its determination that IDAPA 09.30.484 contravenes I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) and is therefore invalid. Regarding our standard of review, the Commission\u2019s determination is one of law which this Court may freely reverse if it finds the Commission\u2019s determination to be erroneous. Idaho Const, art. 5, \u00a7 9; <em>Hewson v. Asker\u2019s Thrift Shop, </em>120 Idaho 164, 166, 814 P.2d 424, 426 (1991) (\u201cThe Court is not bound by conclusions of law drawn by the Industrial Commission; an order of the Commission must be set aside where the law is misapplied to the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Tax Com\u2019n, </em>120 Idaho 849, 820 P.2d 1206 (1991), this Court adopted a four prong test for determining the appropriate level of deference to be given to an agency\u2019s construction of a statute. This four prong test states that an agency\u2019s construction of a statute will be given great weight if: (1) the agency has been entrusted with the responsibility to administer the statute at issue; (2) the agency\u2019s construction of the statute is reasonable; (3) the statutory language at issue does not expressly treat the precise question at issue; and (4) any of the rationales underlying the rule of deference are present. <em>See </em>120 Idaho at 862, 820 P.2d at 1219. The soundness of IDAPA 09.30.484 rests on this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">While it is undisputed that the Department has been entrusted to administer the Employment Security Act and can adopt regulations as necessary for the proper administration of the act, I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-1331, 72-1333, the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) through its adoption of IDA-PA 09.30.484 has been questioned. As noted above, the Commission found IDAPA 09.30.484 unreasonable in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schafer v. Ada County Assessor, </em>111 Idaho 870, 728 P.2d 394 (1986). The <em>Schafer </em>Court held that the phrase \u201cconnected with his employment\u201d was not required in a determination of good cause because the phrase was removed from the statute in 1947. However, the Commission determined that the amendment to I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e), which reinserted the phrase, was intended to overrule the <em>Schafer </em>decision, stating: \u201cWith the 1987 amendment we have now come full circle. Following the dictates of the <em>Schafer </em>court, the Commission will not now adhere to a regulation which effectively deletes the very clause the legislature added!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">At the heart of the Commission\u2019s decision is the long standing rule that \u201cgood cause\u201d for voluntarily terminating employment cannot be based on reasons which are subjective and personal to the employee. <em>Berger v. Nez Perce Sheriff, </em>105 Idaho 555, 671 P.2d 468 (1983); <em>Flynn v. Amfac Foods, Inc., </em>97 Idaho 768, 554 P.2d 946 (1976); <em>McMunn v. Department of Public Lands, </em>94 Idaho 493, 491 P.2d 1265 (1971). The Commission determined that an employee\u2019s decision to quit his or her employment in order to take a better job is subjective, personal and unique to the employee and is not \u201cconnected with\u201d the individual\u2019s prior employment. Thus, the Commission determined that whether or not an employee could meet the requirements of IDAPA 09.30.484 is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">However, <em>Schafer </em>did not hold that quitting employment for other employment is never a personal decision. Rather, <em>Schafer </em>merely held that I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) at that time did not require that good cause be \u201cconnected with\u201d an individuals employment. Although the 1987 amendment to the statute would now require such a finding, the issue of whether or not it is always a personal decision to leave one job for another was not before the Court in <em>Schafer. </em>Therefore, any legislation subsequent to that decision cannot be interpreted as overruling such a holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Furthermore, IDAPA 09.30.484 incorporates IDAPA 09.30.483 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">For purposes of Idaho Code \u00a7 72-1366(e), to be connected with employment, a claimant\u2019s reason(s) for leaving the employment must arise from the working conditions, job tasks, or employment agreement. If the claimant\u2019s reason(s) for leaving the employment arise from personal/non job-related matters, the reasons are not connected with the claimant\u2019s employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In light of IDAPA 09.30.483, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that IDAPA 09.30.484 effectively deletes the phrase \u201cconnected with his employment\u201d is unfounded. IDA-PA 09.30.484, when combined with IDAPA 09.30.483, is completely consistent with I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e). Therefore we find that IDA-PA 09.30.484 is a reasonable interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e), satisfying the second prong of the <em>Simplot </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Similarly, we find that the third prong of the <em>Simplot </em>test is satisfied in this case. I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) does not expressly answer the question of whether or not \u201cgood cause connected with his employment\u201d exists when an employee leaves one job for a better job. IDAPA 09.30.484 addresses this ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Finally, we believe that judicial deference is justified in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> IDAPA 09.30.484 provides a practical and reasonable guideline to determine \u201cgood cause in connection with employment\u201d for situations when an employee leaves one job for another. Most importantly, as we determined above, IDA-PA 09.30.484 is consistent with the long standing rules regarding good cause and the need to avoid subjective and personal reasons in establishing good cause. Accordingly, we hold that IDAPA 09.30.484 is valid and entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">However, the primary policy in the act is still to prevent \u201cinvoluntary\u201d unemployment, not to encourage the voluntary upgrading of employment. In this respect, IDAPA 09.30.483 requires the claimant to prove that the leaving of his employment must arise from \u201cworking conditions, job tasks or employment agreement.\u201d The requirements of IDAPA 90.30.484 specifically state that they are \u201cin addition to satisfying the requirements of regulation 483.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Once an appeal is taken to the Industrial Commission, it becomes the finder of fact and the entire case is before the Commission for a trial <em>de novo. </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-1368(g); <em>Steffen v. Davison, Copple et al., </em>120 Idaho 129, 814 P.2d 29 (1991); <em>Ortiz v. Armour &amp; Company, </em>100 Idaho 363, 597 P.2d 606 (1979). Accordingly, this case is remanded to the Commission for the making of the necessary findings of fact with regard to compliance with both I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(e) and IDAPA 09.30.483 and 09.30.-484.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">In this case there was no finding below that the claimants have complied with IDA-PA 09.30.483. When the Commission adopted the findings of the appeals examiner, it expressly rejected the appeals examiner\u2019s conclusions at which stage most of the critical factual findings necessary for coverage were made. The Commission appears to have assumed that if an individual complied with IDAPA 09.30.484, then the Commission did not have to consider IDA-PA 09.30.483. At least that rationale is implicit in its finding. On remand the Commission should consider the claimants\u2019 compliance with both IDAPA 09.30.483 and 09.-30.484, and set out specifically whether the claimants\u2019 unemployment arise from \u201cworking conditions, job tasks or [the] employment agreement\u201d which were sufficiently unreasonable, or unbearable, to justify the claimants\u2019 voluntary termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The order of the Commission is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further findings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">No costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>BISTLINE, JOHNSON and TROUT, JJ. concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b869-4\">BAKES, J.
