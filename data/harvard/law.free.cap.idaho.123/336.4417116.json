He was sentenced to a fixed term of life in prison. On appeal, Lewis contends that he was tried for the crime of lewd conduct in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution based upon the claim that a previous charge (knowingly transferring a bodily fluid containing the HIV virus, I.C. \u00a7 39-608) resulted in a mistrial and, according to Lewis, involved proof of the same conduct. In addition, Lewis contends that the district court erred in delaying his trial, selecting a jury from another county, allowing certain evidence and testimony to be presented to the jury, denying his motion for a new trial, and sentencing him to a fixed term of life in prison. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">On June 11, 1989, a criminal complaint was filed against Lewis. In the complaint, the State alleged that Lewis had committed the crime of lewd conduct with a minor under the age of sixteen, in violation of I.C. \u00a7 18-1508. More specifically, the complaint stated that the conduct occurred in February of 1989, with a fifteen-year-old boy and involved the acts of Lewis performing oral sex and attempting to perform anal sex upon the boy, both with the intent to gratify Lewis\u2019 sexual desire. After a preliminary hearing held on June 13, 1989, an information was filed against Lewis on June 15, 1989. Lewis was arraigned on the charges and pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">On September 19, 1989, the parties appeared at the time set for jury trial by the court. At this hearing, the court advised the parties that trial needed to be reset. Lewis requested a \u201ctrial as soon as possible.\u201d The court inquired as to certain dates, heard responses, and the parties fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>nally agreed to set trial for November 20, 1989, at 9:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">On November 6, 1989, Lewis filed a motion to dismiss the information. Grounds for the motion were: (1) Lewis had been tried for attempting to transfer the HIV virus, \u201cwhich contained the identical issue as in this matter;\u201d and (2) the HIV charge ended in a mistrial, over Lewis\u2019 objections, and the State is now collaterally estopped from further proceedings. In support of the motion, Lewis cited \u201cprinciples of res judicata and the \u2018double jeopardy\u2019 clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d During oral argument on this motion, counsel for Lewis discussed I.C. \u00a7 18-301, a statutory double jeopardy constraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On November 7, 1989, the parties again appeared before the court. At the hearing, Lewis withdrew his November 6, 1989 motion to represent himself. In addition, the court discussed its concern about selecting a jury due to publicity, and whether jury selection in a county other than Ada County should be considered. Lewis requested that jury selection be from Ada County. The State requested that the jury be selected from another county. Finally, the court ruled that there be no mention of Lewis being HIV-positive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On November 17, 1989, Lewis filed a motion in limine and a motion to suppress. Among other things, Lewis asked that the court not allow into evidence a statement made by Lewis to a police officer regarding his sexual preference, a videotape, testimony from an expert witness, and certain property that was seized from his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On November 20,1989, the parties met in court for a status conference. At this conference, the court announced its decision to select a jury from another county, to which Lewis objected, stating his desire to go to trial immediately. The court responded that another trial was going on at the time, and it set jury trial for November 28, 1989. Finally, the court heard argument on Lewis\u2019 claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Also on November 20, 1989, Marji Shepherd, Ada County Jury Commissioner, filed an affidavit stating that she interviewed seventy-six prospective jurors, asking them questions concerning their ability to be fair and impartial in the Lewis case, as well as their familiarity with Lewis, including the AIDS issue, through the media. In this regard, she stated that forty people said they could not be impartial, thirty-five said they could, and one was undecided. Jury Commissioner Shepherd also stated that, based upon her experience, it would be necessary to call at least 300 prospective jurors in Ada County in order to have a fair and impartial jury for Lewis, and that it would not be possible to sequester 300 prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">On November 27, 1989, the court issued its decision on jury selection and Lewis\u2019 motion to dismiss. As to jury selection, the court decided to impanel a jury from another county pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-1816, due to the publicity of Lewis\u2019 HIV case, his HIV status not being relevant to this case, and the matters set forth in Jury Commissioner Shepard\u2019s affidavit. The court denied Lewis\u2019 motion to dismiss. In so doing, the court stated that if Lewis had been acquitted in the HIV case, the State would be collaterally estopped from proceeding in this case. However, since a mistrial was declared and there was no final judgment on whether Lewis and the victim had sexual contact, the court concluded that this prosecution was not barred. In addition, the court noted that I.C. \u00a7 39-608, the statute relating to transferring the HIV virus, does not require sexual contact or that the victim be under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">On November 29, 1989, the parties again met in court to take up motions. At the hearing, Lewis filed an amended motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>suppress. The amended motion to suppress, regarding all videotapes, writings, notes, and letters seized, cited the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 17 of the Idaho Constitution, and claimed that probable cause did not exist to support the warrant. Additionally, Lewis filed an affidavit stating that he did not consent to the May 5, 1989, search of his premises. The case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On December 5, 1989, the sixth day of jury trial, the jury reached a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">On January 19, 1990, Lewis filed a motion to reappoint August H. Cahill as defense counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to I.C.R. 34 and I.C. \u00a7 19-2406, stating that \u201c[n]ew evidence exists which substantially impeaches the credibility of the state\u2019s primary witness____\u201d In support of this motion, Lewis filed an affidavit of Joie Hein. Mr. Hein stated that the victim could not have seen a certain videotape with Lewis on a certain day because Hein had borrowed that tape from Lewis\u2019 roommate on the day in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On January 29, 1990, a sentencing hearing was held. At the hearing, the court denied Lewis\u2019 motion to strike certain evidence in the presentence investigation report, and it sentenced Lewis to a fixed life term in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">On February 8, 1990, Lewis\u2019 roommate, Michael Carver, filed an affidavit. In his affidavit, Mr. Carver stated that he had lent the above-mentioned videotape to Joie Hein on the day the victim testified that he had watched it with Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">On March 1, 1990, Lewis filed a notice of appeal. He appealed from the January 29, 1990 judgment pursuant to I.A.R. 11(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">On May 3, 1990, the parties met in court to argue the motion for a new trial. At the hearing, Lewis filed a motion to disqualify the presiding judge, and the parties agreed to continue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">On May 23, 1990, Lewis filed a motion for reconsideration of sentence. The motion was made pursuant to I.C.R. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">On June 13, 1990, the court issued its decision and order denying the motion for a new trial. In denying the motion, the court cited <em>State v. Drapeau, </em>97 Idaho 685, 551 P.2d 972 (1976), for the standard for granting a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. Applying this standard, the court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Lewis had not acted with due diligence to discover the new evidence because he had unrestricted access to Mr. Carver and Mr. Hein. In addition, the court found that the jury was properly selected from another county, commenting that there was no way to evaluate whether Boise-area people are more sensitized to gay issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">I. Did the district court err in ruling that this case was not barred by the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const, amend. V.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">II. Did the district court abuse its discretion by continuing Lewis\u2019 trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">III. Did the district court violate a constitutional right or abuse its discretion by selecting a jury from another county?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">IV. Did the district court err in denying Lewis\u2019 motion to suppress evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-21\">V. Did the district court correctly apply rules of evidence in admitting certain evidence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-22\">VI. Did the district court abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of an expert witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-23\">VII. Did the district court abuse its discretion by denying Lewis\u2019 motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-24\">VIII. Did the district court abuse its discretion by sentencing Lewis to a fixed term of life in prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN RULING THAT THIS CASE WAS NOT BARRED BY THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, U.S. CONST.AMEND. V?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We hold that the district court did not err in ruling that Lewis\u2019 prosecution for the crime of lewd conduct, I.C. \u00a7 18-1508 (1984)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, was not barred by double jeopardy because of his previous prosecution for the crime of transferring the HIV virus, I.C. \u00a7 39-608<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, which ended in a <em>sua sponte </em>mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We begin our analysis of this issue with a review of three United States Supreme Court opinions dealing with double jeopardy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The three United States Supreme Court cases are: <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990); and <em>United States v. Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">A. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932): In <em>Blockburger, </em>the defendant was charged with five counts of violating provisions of the Harrison Narcotic Act, and he was found guilty of the second, third, and fifth counts. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-17\">The second count charged a sale on a specified day of ten grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the third count charged a sale on the following day of eight grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the fifth count charged the latter sale also as having been made not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser as required by the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APh\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 301, 52 S.Ct. at 181. The relevant federal statutes provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the aforesaid drugs [opium and other narcotics] except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from any of the aforesaid drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 300 n. 1, 52 S.Ct. at 180-81 n. 1.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the drugs specified in section 691 of this title, except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 300 n. 2, 52 S.Ct. at 181 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On appeal, the defendant argued that the two sales charged in the second and third counts, having been made to the same person, constituted a single offense. Further, he argued that the fifth count, having been made not from the original stamped package <em>and </em>having been made not in pursuance of a written order, constituted one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">As to the defendant\u2019s first argument, the Court held that the sales charged in the second and third counts, were \u201cdistinct and separate sales made at different times.\u201d <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 301, 52 S.Ct. at 181. The Court explained that, although the purchaser paid for the additional quantity shortly after the first quantity was delivered, the first sale had been consummated by its delivery, making \u201c[e]aeh of several successive sales eonstitute[] a distinct offense, however closely they may follow each other.\u201d <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 302, 52 S.Ct. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">As to the defendant\u2019s second argument, the Court recognized that the above-quoted provisions of the Narcotic Act create \u201ctwo distinct offenses,\u201d one creating a crime of selling any of the drugs unless they are in or from the original stamped package, and the other creating a crime of selling any of the drugs without a written order from the purchaser. <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 303-04, 52 S.Ct. at 182. The Court stated the issue as whether, when there has been one sale, \u201cboth sections being violated by the same act, the accused committed two offenses or only one.\u201d <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. In concluding that two offenses were committed, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">Each of the offenses created requires proof of a different element. The applicable rule is that, where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">\u201cA single act may be an offense against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-14\"><em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">B. <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 110 5.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990): In <em>Grady, </em>the defendant drove his vehicle across the double yellow line of the road, striking two oncoming vehicles. The driver of the second vehicle struck by the defendant died later that evening. The defendant was served with two tickets directing him to appear in the local court on a certain date for: (1) driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor; and (2) failing to keep right of the median. Prior to the defendant\u2019s scheduled appearance, an assistant district attorney began to prepare for a homicide prosecution in connection with the accident. The defendant entered guilty pleas to the two traffic tickets, and was given the minimum sentence for these two crimes. There was never any mention of the fatality at either the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas or his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">About two months after the sentencing hearing, a grand jury investigating the accident indicted the defendant, charging him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>with: (1) reckless manslaughter, (2) second degree vehicular manslaughter, and (3) criminally negligent homicide, all for causing the death of the driver of the second vehicle; (4) third degree reckless assault for causing injury to the passenger of the second vehicle; and (5) driving while intoxicated. Furthermore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">The prosecution filed a bill of particulars that identified the three reckless or negligent acts on which it would rely to prove the homicide and assault charges: (1) operating a motor vehicle on a public highway in an intoxicated condition, (2) failing to keep right of the median, and (3) driving approximately 45 to 50 miles per hour in heavy rain, \u201cwhich was a speed too fast for the weather and road conditions then pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 513-14, 110 S.Ct. at 2089. The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the prosecution would violate statutory and constitutional double jeopardy constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Grady </em>affirmed the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, which agreed with the defendant\u2019s argument. <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 515, 110 S.Ct. at 2089-90. The Court held that, in addition to the traditional <em>Block-burger </em>test,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\"><em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 510, 110 S.Ct. at 2087 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The <em>Grady </em>Court reached its holding by adopting reasoning set forth ten years earlier in <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 100 5.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980). It deemed the following analysis to \u201cgovem[ ] this case:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Like Thomas Corbin, John Vitale allegedly caused a fatal car accident. A police officer at the scene issued Vitale a traffic citation charging him with failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident in violation of \u00a7 ll-601(a) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. Vitale was convicted of that offense and sentenced to pay a $15 fine. The day after his conviction, the State charged Vitale with two counts of involuntary manslaughter based on his reckless driving. Vitale argued that this subsequent prosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">This Court held that the second prosecution was not barred under the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test because each offense \u201crequire[d] proof of a fact which the other [did] not.\u201d <em>See Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. Although involuntary manslaughter required proof of a death, failure to reduce speed did not. Likewise, failure to slow was not a statutory element of involuntary manslaughter. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. at 418-19, 100 S.Ct. at 2266. Thus, the subsequent prosecution survived the <em>Blockburger </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">But the Court did not stop at that point. Justice White, writing for the Court, added that, even though the two prosecutions did not violate the <em>Block-burger </em>test:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">[I]t may be that to sustain its manslaughter case the State may find it necessary to prove a failure to slow or to rely on conduct necessarily involving such failure; it may concede as much prior to trial. In that case, because Vi-tale has already been convicted for conduct that is a necessary element of the more serious crime for which he has been charged, his claim of double jeopardy would be substantial____</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\"><em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 515-16, 110 S.Ct. at 2090 (citations omitted), quoting <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. at 420, 100 S.Ct. at 2267.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The United States Supreme Court fashioned a two-step double jeopardy analysis: (1) apply the <em>Blockburger </em>test; if the prosecution is not barred under <em>Blockburger, </em>then; (2) apply the <em>Grady </em>test. For the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the inquiry is whether the two or more offenses have \u201cidentical statutory <em>elements </em>or that one is a lesser included offense of the other....\u201d <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 516, 110 S.Ct. at 2090 (emphasis added), citing <em>Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 166, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 2225, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977). For the <em>Grady </em>test, \u201c[t]he critical inquiry is what <em>conduct </em>the State will prove....\u201d <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2093 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The <em>Grady </em>Court applied the two-step double jeopardy analysis to the facts of that case. First, it recognized that the defendant conceded that the <em>Blockburger </em>test did not bar the prosecution of the reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and third degree reckless assault offenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 522, 110 S.Ct. at 2094. In applying the second step of the analysis, the Court turned to the prosecution\u2019s bill of particulars, which was binding on the State as its theory of proof. <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 522-23, 110 S.Ct. at 2094, citing <em>Corbin v. Hillery, </em>74 N.Y.2d 279, 290, 545 N.Y.S.2d 71, 75, 543 N.E.2d 714, 720 (1989), <em>affirmed. </em>The <em>Grady </em>Court quoted from the document, and held that the State admitted that it would prove the entirety of the conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 523, 110 S.Ct. at 2094.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">C. <em>United States v. Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992): The defendant operated a methamphetamine facility in Beggs, Oklahoma. In July of 1987, DEA agents raided the Beggs facility and shut it down. Subsequently, the defendant ordered materials for manufacturing methamphetamine to be delivered to him in Joplin, Missouri. DEA agents witnessed the Joplin transfer and arrested the defendant shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">The defendant was charged and convicted in Missouri for the crime of attempting to manufacture methamphetamine based upon the Joplin transfer. In the Missouri case, the <em>Felix </em>Court summarized what the government showed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">1. On August 26, 1987, the defendant asked to purchase the materials from a DEA informant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-16\">2. The defendant made a down payment of $7,500 on the materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-17\">3. The defendant instructed the informant to deliver the materials to a Joplin hotel on August 31, 1987;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-18\">4. The informant met the defendant at that hotel on that date with the materials; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-19\">5. The defendant inspected the materials, hitched his car to the trailer in which the materials had been transported, and then he was arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-20\"><em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-21\">At the trial in the Missouri case, the defendant disputed that he had the requisite criminal intent. In order to prove his intent, the government introduced evidence that the defendant had manufactured methamphetamine in Oklahoma. The <em>Felix </em>Court summarized this evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-22\">1. During the spring of 1987, the defendant had purchased material from the DEA agent for manufacturing methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-23\">2. The defendant gave those materials to Paul Roach in exchange for lessons on how to manufacture methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-24\">3.

The Court admitted this evidence pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to F.K.E. 404(b), regarding the defendant\u2019s state of mind with respect to the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Subsequently, the defendant was charged and convicted in Oklahoma of one count of conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine and seven substantive counts, four counts relating to manufacturing and possession with intent to distribute, one count relating to maintaining a methamphetamine manufacturing lab, and the last two counts relating to interstate travel with the intent to promote his illegal enterprise. \u201cAt trial, the Government introduced much of the same evidence of the Missouri and Oklahoma transactions that had been introduced in the Missouri trial.\u201d <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the convictions for conspiracy and the first five substantive counts were reversed based upon the <em>Grady </em>test. The United States Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">As to\u00b0the substantive counts, the <em>Felix </em>Court stated that \u201c[t]he actual crimes charged in each case were different in both time and place; there was absolutely no common conduct linking the alleged offenses.\u201d <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1382. In this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-14\">The Court of Appeals appealed] to have acknowledged as much, as it concentrated not on the actual crimes prosecuted in the separate trials, but instead on the type of evidence presented by the Government during the two trials____ Thus, the Court of Appeals holding must rest on an assumption that if the Government offers in evidence in one prosecution acts of misconduct that might ultimately be charged as criminal offenses in a second prosecution, the latter prosecution is barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-16\"><em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1382. The <em>Felix </em>Court disagreed with this rationale, reiterating that \u201ca mere overlap in proof between two prosecutions does not establish a double jeopardy violation.\u201d <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1382. It also pointed to the <em>Grady </em>opinion\u2019s disclaimer of adopting a \u201csame evidence\u201d test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 S.Ct. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1382, citing <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 521 n. 12, 110 S.Ct. at 2093 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">D. <em>Application of the Double Jeopardy Analysis to the Present Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-22\">1. <em>Jeopardy Attached in Lewis\u2019 First Trial: </em>In the HIV case, the jury was impanelled and sworn. \u201cJeopardy attaches when a jury is sworn.\u201d <em>State v.

Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978). Jeopardy did attach in Lewis\u2019 first trial. We must therefore analyze the issue of whether Lewis was twice placed in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">2. <em>The Traditional Blockburger Test: </em>The traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test requires us to examine the <em>elements </em>of each crime and determine whether each crime requires proof of a fact that the other does not. <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 516, 110 S.Ct. at 2090.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The crime of lewd conduct with a minor or child under sixteen, I.C. \u00a7 18-1508 (1984), contains the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">(la) A lewd or lascivious act committed upon or with the body or a body part of a minor or child under the age of sixteen; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">(lb) Involving a minor or child in any act of bestiality or sadomasochistic abuse or lewd exhibition, as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-1507; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">(2) Intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires of the defendant or victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The crime of transferring a body fluid which may contain the HIV virus, I.C. \u00a7 39-608, contains the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-12\">(la) Expose another person in any manner with the intent to infect; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">(lb) With defendant\u2019s knowledge that he or she has been afflicted with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS related complexes (ARC), or other manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">(2) A transfer or attempted transfer of body fluid, tissue, or organs to another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">I.C. \u00a7 39-608(1). The statute goes on to define \u201cbody fluid\u201d as, among other things, semen, I.C. \u00a7 39-608(2)(a), and \u201ctransfer\u201d as including, among other modes sexual and otherwise, anal-genital contact, I.C. \u00a7 39-608(2)(b). Finally, consent and medical advice are defenses to I.C. \u00a7 39-608(1). I.C. \u00a7 39-608(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">It is clear from our examination of the statutory elements of each crime that the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied. In order to prove a violation of the HIV offense, it is not necessary to prove that the victim is under the age of sixteen, that the defendant had an intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify his or her, or the victim\u2019s, lust, passions, or sexual desires\u2014all of which are elements of the lewd conduct crime. In order to prove a violation of the lewd conduct statute, it is not necessary to prove that the defendant had an intent to infect the victim or expose the victim with knowledge of his or her HIV status, or that any body fluid, tissue, or organ was transferred to the victim\u2014all of which are elements of the HIV crime. Therefore, we hold that the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test, which focuses upon the elements of each crime, is satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">3. <em>The Grady Test: </em>The second part of the double jeopardy analysis requires us to focus upon the <em>conduct </em>which the State intended to prove in the HIV case and the conduct it proved at the lewd conduct trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2093.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">In the lewd conduct case, the State alleged the following: (1) during February of 1989, the defendant committed a lewd and lascivious act upon the body of the victim; (2) the victim was under the age of sixteen years old; and (3) the defendant had the intent to gratify his sexual desire.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-21\">In the HIV case, the indictment read: GEORGE FRANK LEWIS is accused by the Grand Jury of Ada County by this Indictment, of the crime of KNOWINGLY ATTEMPTING TO TRANSFER BODY FLUIDS WHICH MAY CONTAIN THE HIV VIRUS, I.C. \u00a7 39-608 committed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-22\">That the defendant, GEORGE FRANK LEWIS, on or about February, 1989, in the County of Ada, State of Idaho, did attempt to transfer his body fluids to another person, knowing that he has been afflicted with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), AIDS related complexes (ARC), or other manifestations of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, to wit: attempting to anal pene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>trate [the victim] with his penis, with the intent to gratify the sexual desires of the defendant, by passing semen onto or into [the victim\u2019s] body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">While the State may have introduced evidence in the lewd conduct case that it would have introduced in the HIV case, it is clear that \u201ca mere overlap in proof between two prosecutions does not establish a double jeopardy violation.\u201d <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1382. Instead, the <em>Grady </em>test looks only to \u201cwhat conduct the State will prove, <em>not the evidence the State mil use to prove that conduct.\u201d Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2093 (emphasis added). Although the HIV charge and the lewd conduct charge may have arisen at or near the same time and place, the <em>Grady </em>test is not a \u201csame transaction\u201d test. <em>Felix, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 1385; <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 523 n. 15, 110 S.Ct. at 2094 n. 15. Further, \u201cit is clear that when two crimes arise from the same sequence of events, such is not sufficient to invoke the protection of I.C. \u00a7 18-301.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State v. Chapman, </em>112 Idaho 1011, 1013, 739 P.2d 310, 312 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In establishing the essential elements of the lewd conduct charge, the State introduced evidence that Lewis\u2019 conduct consisted of anal-genital or oral-genital contact with an under sixteen-year-old victim and that Lewis or the victim had the intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify their lust, passions, or sexual desires. This conduct does not <em>constitute </em>a violation of the HIV offense because the State did not produce evidence of Lewis\u2019 conduct as a knowing carrier of HIV. Therefore, the lewd conduct prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSE ITS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">DISCRETION BY CONTINUING LEWIS\u2019 TRIAL?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by continuing Lewis\u2019 trial until December 29, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">At the hearing on September 19, 1989, the district court suggested a trial date of December 5, to which Lewis\u2019 counsel responded that, \u201cI would certainly object to that late of a setting.\u201d The parties and the court discussed alternate dates to set the trial, and ultimately agreed upon November 20, 1989, Lewis\u2019 counsel stating, \u201cThat would be fine with me, Judge.\u201d Lewis had filed several motions, including a motion to dismiss that was set for hearing on November 20, 1989, at 1:30. At the hearing on November 20, 1989, the court noted that Lewis\u2019 motions, which had not yet been heard and decided, were filed late. Yet, Lewis\u2019 counsel did \u201cobject[] to another change of date.\u201d However, at the November 7, 1989 hearing, the parties and court agreed to begin jury selection on November 21,1989. The trial ultimately began on November 29, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-3501 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-20\">19-3501. When action may be dismissed.\u2014The court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, must order the prosecution or indictment to be dismissed, in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-21\">2. If a defendant, whose trial has not been postponed upon his application, is not brought to trial within six (6) months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>from the date that the indictment or information is filed with the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Thus, the district court has discretion in determining whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to justify a continuance in the trial. <em>In re Rash, </em>64 Idaho 521, 526, 134 P.2d 420, 421-22 (1943). Whenever this Court is faced with an appeal from a discretionary determination, we ask three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">(1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991), citing <em>State v. Hedger, </em>115 Idaho 598, 600, 768 P.2d 1331, 1333 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In this case, the record clearly shows that the district court correctly understood this issue to be one of discretion. Further, the record shows that the decision was made within the confines of its discretion and consistent with the applicable legal standards. First, the length of the continuance was about two and one-half months (from the original date of September 19, 1989, to the ultimate date of November 29, 1989) and the trial began within six months of the filing of the criminal information (June 15, 1989); second, the basis for the continuance (that \u201canother trial was going on ... \u201d) was an adequate reason. <em>State v. Talmage, </em>104 Idaho 249, 251, 658 P.2d 920, 922 (1983), citing <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). Finally, the record shows that the district court reached its decision to continue the trial until November 29th by an exercise of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT VIOLATE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OR ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY SELECTING A JURY FROM ANOTHER COUNTY?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">We hold that the district court did not violate a constitutional right or abuse its discretion by selecting a jury from another county to sit in the lewd conduct case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Idaho Code \u00a7 19-1816, which was first enacted in 1983, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">19-1816. Impaneling jury from another county.\u2014(a) As an alternative to entering the order of removal provided in the preceding sections of this chapter, the court may instead enter an order directing that jurors be impaneled from the county to which venue would otherwise have been transferred, if it finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">1. That a fair and impartial jury cannot be impaneled in the county where the criminal complaint, information or indictment is filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">2. That it would be more economical to transport the jury than to transport the pending action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">3. That justice will be served thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Lewis contends that I.C. \u00a7 19-1816 does not empower a district court, on its own motion, to order selection of a jury from another county, and that the district court, in this case, did order the change in jury selection upon its own motion. For authority, Lewis points to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-1801 and 19-1808, which require motion by the defendant or the State, respectively, in order to effect a change of venue, and to I.C.R. 21, which provides for change of venue upon motion by the defendant or the State, and cites <em>State v. Ash, </em>94 Idaho 542, 493 P.2d 701 (1972), wherein this Court ruled it improper for a district court to change venue pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-1801 on its own motion. We conclude that the State did move for the change of jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">At the November 7, 1989 hearing, the district court identified the following issues to be discussed: (1) Lewis representing himself; (2) the publicity of the case and consideration of impaneling a jury from another county; and (3) consideration of a jury questionnaire. During the discussion of the jury selection issue, the State assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ed that \u201ca change of venue is appropriate in terms of selecting a jury.\u201d The State therefore requested the court to select a jury from another county.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN DENYING LEWIS\u2019 MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We hold that the district court did not err in admitting into evidence certain photographs and the document entitled \u201cAnd Then There Was James,\u201d both of which Lewis moved to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The search warrant issued by the magistrate authorized Detective Armstrong to search for the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZGa\">[Cjertain evidence of a crime, to wit: pornographic VCR tape entitled \u201cBoys On Film;\u201d another pornographic VCR tape untitled containing adults of both sexes engaging in sexual acts; lists of names of past, present or potential victims; memorabilia of victims including photos, clothing, or other personal items; a diary listing names of victims and activities engaged in; camera and VCR recording equipment; correspondence with victims; indicia of ownership or occupance of Apt 14, 2701 Rosehill, Boise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In support of his request for a search warrant, Detective Armstrong signed an affidavit which detailed his experience (seventeen years) as a law enforcement officer, his experience (thirteen years) and training in the investigation of crimes involving the sexual abuse of children, including identifying adults who sexually abuse children, and the events that had taken place in the Lewis investigation. In addition, Detective Armstrong stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">Your affiant knows from his experience and training that pedophiles or adults who habitually seek sex with children usually keep records or diaries, listing their sexual partners\u2019 names and the activities engaged in. That these offenders usually keep pictures of their sexual victims, or keep items belonging to their victims in order to recall the sex acts with those children. These offenders often write out plans involving future victims, and correspond via letters with victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">The district court ruled that the affidavit was sufficient and that the material was properly seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">When we review the issuance of a search warrant by a magistrate, our review is limited to ensuring that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, and we give great deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination. <em>State v. Lang, </em>105 Idaho 683, 684, 672 P.2d 561, 562 (1983). Looking to the language of the affidavit of Detective Armstrong, we hold that there was a substantial basis that probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant. Furthermore, it is clear from our review of the record that the photographs and document fell within the scope of the warrant. The photographs, which depict, <em>inter alia, </em>scantily clad young men and homosexual acts, fall within the provision of the warrant providing for the search of \u201cmemorabilia of victims including <em>photos, </em>clothing, or other personal items.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The document, which was written in the first person and regarded homosexual acts between the writer and a person who had the \u201cunworried look of a fifteen-year-old,\u201d was properly seized pursuant to the \u201cmemorabilia\u201d and \u201cdiary\u201d provisions of the warrant. Although it is clearly \u201cexpressive material,\u201d \u201cit is seizable with a valid warrant or under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement just as any other piece of evidence of a crime would be.\u201d <em>State v. Claiborne, </em>120 Idaho 581, 585, 818 P.2d 285, 289 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">The search was lawful. The search warrant authorized the officers to enter Lewis\u2019 apartment and conduct a search for various items, including memorabilia and diaries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY APPLY RULES OF EVIDENCE IN ADMITTING CERTAIN EVIDENCE AT TRIAL?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting certain evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, Lewis claims that the court should not have admitted the following evidence pursuant to I.R.E. 404(b): (1) testimony from Detective Larry Armstrong regarding Lewis\u2019 statement that he had a sexual preference for young boys; (2) the videotape entitled \u201cBoys On Film;\u201d (3) a document entitled \u201cAnd Then There Was James;\u201d and (4) uncharged sexual misconduct with the alleged victim prior to the charged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Rule 404(b) of the Idaho Rules of Evidence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsB\">Relevant evidence is admissible, I.R.E. 402, but is to be weighed against its prejudicial impact, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by undue delay, waste of time, or cumulative effect, I.R.E. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\"><em>A.Detective Armstrong\u2019s Testimony: </em>During the State\u2019s direct examination, Detective Armstrong testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">I asked Mr. Lewis if he didn\u2019t have a sexual preference for adolescent boys, and he responded, \u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to take advantage of the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">At the time this statement was offered, Lewis objected on the basis of foundation, order of proof, and \u201copening the door\u201d to prior convictions. The district court ruled that there was a proper foundation laid for the testimony, and that it was relevant and admissible. Lewis did not object to this testimony as violative of I.R.E. 404(b). Our review of the record satisfies us that the court correctly applied the rules of evidence in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">B. <em>The Video \u201cBoys On Film:\u201d </em>The victim testified that he and Lewis watched a portion of this video on the day in question. During pre-trial motions, Lewis argued that the only issue was whether the victim really saw the film, and that the jury did not need to see it. Lewis did not object to it as being violative of I.R.E. 404(b). The court ruled that the film tended to corroborate the victim\u2019s account of the crime, but it reserved ruling on whether the jury could view the film. The record does not reveal that the court ruled that the jury could view it. The court correctly applied the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">C. <em>The Document \u201cAnd Then There Was James:\u201d </em>Detective Armstrong testified that he perceived the document to be indicia of pedophilia. At the time it was offered, Lewis objected to Detective Armstrong's testimony based upon the document not then being admitted. The court then admitted it, ruling that a proper foundation had been laid. The court properly applied the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">D. <em>Prior Uncharged Sexual Contact With The Victim: </em>The victim testified regarding earlier uncharged sexual acts between himself and Lewis. During pretrial motions, Lewis objected to this testimony as violative of I.R.E. 404. The State contends that the testimony was properly admitted as proof of Lewis\u2019 plan to groom the victim for sexual purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">We have recently analyzed evidence of prior uncharged sexual misconduct between a defendant and his victims in <em>State v. Tolman, </em>121 Idaho 899, 828 P.2d 1304 (1992). In this regard, we focused upon whether the testimony revealed a common scheme or plan to sexually abuse an identifiable group and comparing that to the victim and the circumstances surrounding the victim\u2019s allegations. <em>Tolman, </em>121 Idaho at 905, 828 P.2d at 1310. In addition, we stated that testimony of prior sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>misconduct is admissible where the parties' credibility is at issue. <em>Tolman, </em>121 Idaho at 904, 828 P.2d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In this case, the victim testified that he and Lewis engaged in sexual acts a few weeks before the acts in question in this case. The testimony revealed that during two trips the two of them took to Idaho City, Idaho, and to Lowman, Idaho, they engaged in oral sex, and Lewis tried to ease the victim\u2019s conscience by telling him that \u201ceverybody does it.\u201d Lewis did not testify at trial. Essentially, then, his defense was that the alleged acts did not occur. \u201cThis type of posture at trial places the credibility of the victim squarely in issue for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>123 Idaho 178, 181, 845 P.2d 1211, 1214 (1993). When the alleged conduct in this case is considered with the victim\u2019s testimony regarding prior sexual misconduct with Lewis, \u201cthe jury was better able to compare patterns and methods, details and generalities, consistencies and discrepancies, and thereby ma[k]e a more meaningful and accurate assessment of the parties\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Tolman, </em>121 Idaho at 905, 828 P.2d at 1310. Our review of the record satisfies us that the district court properly admitted this testimony in conformity with the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY ALLOWING THE TESTIMONY OF AN EXPERT WITNESS?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of Dr. James Oyler, a psychologist who had treated the victim after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Lewis argues that Dr. Oyler invaded the jury\u2019s province by offering his opinion that the victim was truthful in his claim that Lewis had sexually abused him. This argument is flawed for two reasons: (1) the record reveals that Dr. Oyler did not testify that it was his opinion that the victim was telling the truth; and (2) the dialogue where this statement is supposed to have been made was during Lewis\u2019 cross-examination of Dr. Oyler, during which Lewis tried unsuccessfully to get Dr. Oyler to express his opinion on the victim\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Idaho Rule of Evidence 702 guides the admission of expert testimony. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Rule 702. Testimony by experts.\u2014If</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise. Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is within the discretion of the district court to determine whether a person is qualified to testify as an expert witness.\u201d <em>State v. Thomasson, </em>122 Idaho 172, 175, 832 P.2d 743, 746 (1992), citing <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>119 Idaho 1047,1051, 812 P.2d 1208, 1212 (1991). In this case, Dr. Oyler testified that he was a psychologist licensed to practice in the State of Idaho. He was educated at Idaho State University and received a master\u2019s degree in clinical psychology in San Francisco, California. He detailed his work experience in psychology, including his involvement in therapeutic intervention with minors who were victims of sexual abuse and people involved in homosexual issues. He further testified as to his therapeutic relationship with the victim, including his opinion that the victim fit the profile of a sexual abuse victim. Given Dr. Oyler\u2019s qualifications and experience, as set forth in the foundation laid for his testimony, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by allowing him to testify regarding whether the victim fit the profile of a sexual abuse victim. If a proper foundation has been laid, it is proper for the expert to testify regarding whether a person has been sexually abused. <em>State v.

The victim testified that he had watched certain portions of the videotape with Lewis on this day. Subsequent to the trial, Carver and Hein signed affidavits stating that Carver, who was Lewis\u2019 roommate, had loaned the videotape in question to Hein, and Hein was still in possession of it on the day the victim testified that he had watched it with Lewis. The district court ruled this evidence to be newly discovered evidence, and concluded that the motion be denied pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>State v. Drapeau, </em>97 Idaho 685, 551 P.2d 972 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The <em>Drapeau </em>standard, which applies to motions for new trials based upon newly discovered evidence, is: (1) the evidence was unknown to the defendant at the time of trial; (2) the evidence is material, not merely cumulative or impeaching; (3) it will probably produce an acquittal; and (4) failure to learn of it was due to no lack of diligence on the part of the defendant. <em>Drapeau, </em>97 Idaho at 691, 551 P.2d at 978. The trial court ruled that the evidence was merely impeaching evidence, that it probably would not produce an acquittal, and that failure to learn of it was due to a lack of diligence on Lewis\u2019 part. As to the diligence question, the court found that while Lewis was in jail prior to the trial, Carver visited Lewis forty-five times, and Hein visited Lewis ten times, and that both Carver and Hein were frequently at the courthouse proceedings relating to Lewis. The record shows that the court perceived this issue as a discretionary determination, that it correctly applied the proper analysis, and reached its decision through an exercise of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY SENTENCING LEWIS TO A FIXED TERM OF LIFE IN PRISON?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Lewis to a fixed term of life in prison. In other words, the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">Our standard in reviewing sentences is: Sentencing is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial judge, and the defendant has the burden of showing a clear abuse thereof on appeal.

Thus, in order for this Court to conclude that Lewis\u2019 fixed life sentence is unreasonable, we must be convinced that the sentence was excessive under any reasonable view of the facts, considering (1) the protection of society, (2) deterrence of Lewis and others, (3) the possibility of Lewis\u2019 rehabilitation, and (4) punishment or retribution for Lewis. <em>Broadhead, </em>120 Idaho at 146, 814 P.2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The record reveals that Lewis has previously been convicted for a sexual' offense against a minor in 1979 in Nashville, Tennessee. Also, Lewis was HIV-positive at the time of the acts for which he was convicted in the present case. Further, there were several allegations of uncharged sexual misconduct between Lewis and minors during the sentencing proceedings. Finally, Lewis continues to deny that he committed this crime. Based upon the information before it, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>stated that this was the \u201cmost aggravated case [it has] seen.\u201d It considered the objectives of sentencing, and concluded that \u201cthe protection of society does warrant the penalty of life in prison without possibility of parole.\u201d Based upon the record, we hold that the sentence imposed by the district court was not excessive under any reasonable view of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and the sentence imposed by the district court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-6\">JOHNSON and TROUT, JJ\u201e and REINHARDT, J., Pro Tern., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">.

Thus spoke the United States Supreme Court in <em>Grady, </em>a case with which the majority deals extensively. Child molestation is in some ways more of a national tragedy than drunk driving. Also, let it be noted that Lewis is hardly a sympathetic defendant. In forcing his will on someone too young to be able to consent to sex, he also tried to engage in a course of conduct that, if successful, could potentially have exposed his young victim to a deadly virus. It is crucial to recall, however, that this Court must not decide its criminal cases based upon the character of the accused, as difficult as that may sometimes be to disregard. Instead, we must decide our eases based on the law. Because the majority, for whatever reason, disregards aspects of the proceedings against Lewis that are blatantly contrary to the relevant constitutional, statutory and case law, I cannot concur in much of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">I. The Lewd and Lascivious Prosecution Against Lewis Is Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The majority\u2019s discussion of the law of double jeopardy is both cogent and complete, but its analysis of the facts <em>sub judice </em>and its application of the law to those facts are neither. The majority opinion attempts to apply the relevant precedent of <em>Grady </em>to Lewis\u2019s case in a three-sentence paragraph, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">In establishing the essential elements of the lewd conduct charge, the State introduced evidence that Lewis\u2019 conduct consisted of anal-genital or oral-genital contact with an under sixteen year old victim and that Lewis or the victim had the intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify their lust, passions, or sexual desires. This conduct does not constitute a violation of the HIV offense because the State did not produce evidence of Lewis\u2019 conduct as a knowing carrier of HIV. Therefore, the lewd conduct prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_h6\"><em>State v. Lewis, </em>at 405 (emphasis omitted). The Court summarily concludes that double jeopardy does not bar the lewd and lascivious prosecution since Lewis\u2019s \u201cconduct does not constitute a violation of the HIV offense because the <em>State did not produce evidence </em>of Lewis\u2019 conduct as a knowing carrier of HIV.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This conclusion is not only wholly unsupported by meaningful analysis, but it also blatantly disregards the same opinion\u2019s preceding legal analysis. The majority thereby engages in an alchemic attempt to convert <em>evidence </em>of an element of a crime into <em>conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">By analyzing the evidence involved rather than the conduct, the majority opinion defies the dictates of <em>Grady. </em>As the majority explains, <em>Grady </em>requires analysis of the defendant\u2019s conduct to determine whether an accused is being punished twice for the same offense, holding that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove <em>conduct </em>that constitutes an offense for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant has already been prosecuted.\u201d 495 U.S. at 510,110 S.Ct. at 2087 (emphasis added). <em>Grady </em>later specifically asserts that \u201c[t]his is not an \u2018actual evidence\u2019 or \u2018same evidence\u2019 test. <em>The critical inquiry is what conduct the State mil prove, not the evidence the State will use to prove that conduct.\u201d </em>495 U.S. at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2093 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">To demonstrate the majority\u2019s error, it is necessary to delineate precisely what conduct is at issue in the two prosecutions. It is first noted that the indictment which laid the HIV charge states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Lewis, on or about February, 1989, ... did attempt to transfer his body fluids to another person, knowing that he has been afflicted with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), AIDS related complexes (ARC), or other manifestations of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, to-wit: <em>attempting to anally penetrate [the victim] with his penis, </em>with the intent to gratify the sexual desires of the defendant, by passing seman [sic] onto or into [the victim\u2019s] body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Thus, the first prosecution alleged that Lewis attempted anal-genital contact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The subsequent prosecution, initiated by complaint and information, charged Lewis with the crime of lewd and lascivious conduct in that \u201cLewis, on or about February, 1989, ... did, ... commit a lewd and lascivious act upon the body of a minor, ... to-wit: of the age of 15 years, <em>by placing his mouth on [the victimjs penis and by attempting to anally penetrate [the victim] with his penis, </em>with the intent to gratify the sexual desire of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5F\">The question then becomes what constitutes \u201cconduct.\u201d Although the majority opinion does not state as much, its careless reference to conduct would seem to embrace not only the oral-genital contact and the attempted anal-genital contact, but also the victim\u2019s age, Lewis\u2019s and/or the victim\u2019s intent, and Lewis\u2019s HIV-positive status. How these latter facts fit into the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d is not readily understood. <em>Webster </em>defines \u201cconduct\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>a noun meaning \u201c1. The way a person acts: BEHAVIOR.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s II New Riverside University Dictionary </em>295-296 (1984). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>similarly defines the word: \u201cPersonal behavior; deportment; mode of action; any positive or negative act.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>268 (5th ed. 1979). Hence, \u201cconduct\u201d means a course of physical action. Assuming that the members of the United States Supreme Court, all of whom signed on to the relevant portion of <em>Felix, </em>know the dictionary meaning of the word \u201cconduct\u201d (and that is a safe assumption), \u201cconduct\u201d does not mean the defendant\u2019s status nor state of mind, nor the victim\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The majority\u2019s implicit analysis of what constitutes Lewis\u2019s conduct also fails because its presumed definition is no more than a re-application of the <em>Blockburger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>test, as Lewis pointed out. Whether Lewis was a knowing carrier of HIV or whether Lewis possessed the requisite intent to gratify his desires on a fifteen year old are <em>elements </em>of the two crimes, not \u201cconduct.\u201d It is the <em>Blockburger </em>test, not the <em>Grady </em>test, which looks to the elements of the two charged crimes. No quarrel can be made with the majority opinion\u2019s statement that the Lewis prosecutions fail to satisfy the <em>Blockburger </em>inquiry and thus that the subsequent prosecution is not barred under that theory. But the Supreme Court intended the <em>Grady </em>inquiry as separate and additional to the <em>Blockburger </em>inquiry. In including these elements in its <em>Grady </em>inquiry under the guise of \u201cconduct,\u201d the majority does little justice to United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The majority appears to have accepted the State\u2019s contention, advanced in oral argument, that a passage in <em>Grady </em>indicates that <em>Grady\u2019s </em>rationale would only bar the second prosecution if the prosecution alleged that Lewis was HIV-infected. The theory by which the State reaches this conclusion is seductively clever but ultimately unpersuasive. The <em>Grady </em>dicta which the State points to discusses what sort of prosecution would have been acceptable in regard to Corbin, the defendant in <em>Grady:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOd\">By its own pleadings, the State has admitted that it will prove the <em>entirety of the conduct </em>for which Corbin was convicted\u2014driving while intoxicated and failing to keep right of the median\u2014to establish essential elements of the homicide and assault offenses. Therefore, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars this successive prosecution____ This holding would not bar a subsequent prosecution on the homicide and assault charges if the bill of particulars revealed that the State would not rely on proving <em>conduct </em>for which Corbin had already been convicted (i.e., if the State relied solely on Corbin\u2019s driving too fast in heavy rain to establish recklessness or negligence).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">495 U.S. at 522-23, 110 S.Ct. at 2094 (emphasis added). The State makes an Olympian leap in logic from the dicta contained in the above paragraph to its argument that what conduct is involved is not the central inquiry. The State does so by contending that in <em>Grady, </em>driving constituted conduct and intoxication a condition, yet the <em>Grady </em>court expressly would permit Corbin to be subsequently prosecuted for the same conduct, driving (i.e., driving too fast in heavy rain). Thus, so the argument would go, the Supreme Court did not really mean that the same conduct may not be prosecuted twice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here, the State argues similarly that attempted anal-genital contact is conduct and HIV-positive is a condition, so the Double Jeopardy Clause would permit a subsequent lewd and lascivious prosecution of Lewis by alleging attempting anal-genital contact, the conduct, without proof of HIV infection, the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">As shown above, however, it is impossible to escape the <em>Grady </em>court\u2019s express holding that the proper inquiry involves examining conduct, <em>not </em>evidence adduced, as well as myriad other references to \u201cconduct,\u201d even in the paragraph cited by the State. The <em>Grady </em>court obviously considered that driving while intoxicated is a separate course of conduct from driving too fast, the driving amounting to a \u201ctransaction\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> consisting of various separate courses of conduct. This definition is as thin as the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>be spread.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the state would need to argue that attempting anal-genital contact while HIV-positive is a separate course of conduct from the <em>same </em>instance of attempted anal-genital contact without proof of such status, by the same person at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Such an argument defies common sense. Corbin engaged in at least three courses of conduct as alleged in the first prosecution: he drove while intoxicated, failed to keep to the right of median, and drove too fast. These courses of conduct were all separate courses of conduct, although, all three occurred roughly contemporaneously. For instance, Corbin could have driven too fast without driving while intoxicated, or vice versa. Hence, as the Supreme Court suggested, it was possible to have a subsequent prosecution on the homicide and assault charges using only the conduct of driving too fast as proof of intent in the assault and homicide prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The distinction becomes obvious when applying the same analysis to the instant case. The State alleged in both the HIV case and the lewd and lascivious case that Lewis had attempted to engage in anal-genital contact with the victim. The only conduct actually constituting the element of attempted transfer of body fluid in the HIV case was attempted anal-genital contact Such a transfer would be impossible without the conduct comprising attempted anal-genital contact\u2014the same conduct that constituted an essential element in the subsequent lewd and lascivious case\u2014unlike the situation in <em>Grady, </em>where Corbin\u2019s speeding occurred independently of homicide and assault. If the State had alleged in the HIV case that Lewis attempted anal-genital contact but had alleged in the lewd and lascivious case that he engaged in only <em>oral-genital </em>contact, it would be possible for Lewis to commit the attempted transfer without engaging in the conduct charged in the lewd and lascivious case, and vice versa. In this hypothetical situation, the oral-genital contact and attempted anal-genital contact would have occurred within the same transaction but would not constitute the same conduct. Thus, this hypothetical second prosecution would have been permitted by the Double Jeopardy Clause, since the Supreme Court has expressly rejected the \u201csame transaction test.\u201d <em>Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 523 n. 15, 110 S.Ct. at 2094 n. 15. The above analysis is tortuous, but, again, common sense tells us that one instance of attempted anal-genital contact is not two courses of conduct. And if the Double Jeopardy Clause bars anything, it bars prosecuting the accused twice for the exact same course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The prosecution\u2019s allegations of Lewis\u2019s conduct\u2014the only relevant inquiry under <em>Grady </em>and its progeny\u2014amounted to the same instance of attempted anal-genital intercourse in both prosecutions. And in using the entirety of the conduct for which Lewis had previously been prosecuted, i.e., attempted anal-genital contact, the government sought to establish an essential element of the lewd and lascivious offense, i.e., a lewd or lascivious act.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The alleged oral-genital contact raises another question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As explained above, <em>Grady </em>would permit subsequent prosecution of Lewis for alleged oral-genital contact because the oral-genital contact was conduct separate from the attempted anal-genital contact and because oral-genital contact was not the conduct for which Lewis was prosecuted in the HIV case. The fact remains, however, that the State in the lewd and lascivious case inexplicably alleged both oral-genital contact and attempted anal-genital contact. Because it is impossible to determine whether the jury convicted Lewis on the lewd and lascivious charge based on the anal-genital contact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the oral-genital, or both and because the subsequent allegation of attempted anal-genital contact violated a fundamental constitutional right, this error cannot be considered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Concluding that Lewis was twice prosecuted for the same conduct does not end all inquiry of whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the subsequent prosecution. Reprosecution after a mistrial is permissible if the defendant requested or acquiesced in the mistrial. <em>U.S. v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976). Here, the trial judge in the HIV case sua sponte declared a mistrial, to which Lewis objected. Reprosecution after mistrial is also permissible if there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824). A review of the record reveals not a scintilla of necessity in the trial judge\u2019s declaration of mistrial. The trial judge held proceedings in which he declared,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">Now, Mr. Lewis, it has come to my attention via the media and statements that this case is beginning to have a great deal of press coverage, and as I understand from sources that I\u2019ve received that apparently there was even a TV special yesterday in regard to this matter, though I didn\u2019t see it____ And I note, for the record, that I accepted a letter regarding some personal problems or life of myself. And while I don\u2019t know of anything on my own life that has any effect on this, I can\u2019t see how I can handle this case anymore with the publicity and the things that are going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Transcript of Proceedings of October 30, 1989, p. 1. If excess publicity were a problem, the trial judge would have possessed various other remedies to deal with it. Certainly, the sole act of substituting a new judge would not solve the perceived problem of excess publicity. Too, the judge\u2019s cryptic reference to a letter is not explained. Two remedies would then appear to be appropriate: either this Court should vacate the judgment of conviction or it should remand back to the trial court in the lewd and lascivious case to determine by evidentiary hearing whether manifest necessity for the new trial existed in the HIV case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">II. The Prosecution Did Not Move to Impanel a Jury from Another County.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">In its discussion of this issue, the majority apparently accepts Lewis\u2019s argument that a trial court may not sua sponte order selection of a jury from another county. This position is correct, in light of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 19-1816, 19-1801, and 19-1808; I.C.R. 21; and <em>State v. Ash, </em>94 Idaho 542, 493 P.2d 701 (1972). The Court then proceeds to conclude that the State did move for the change of jury selection. This conclusion is based solely on the fact that the prosecution stated that \u201ca change of venue is appropriate in terms of selecting a jury\u201d after the district court repeatedly had mentioned that it was considering resorting to an out-of-county jury selection. The first mention of out-of-eounty jury selection appears in the following exchange at a status conference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">Mr. Cahill [Lewis\u2019s counsel at trial]: ... I realize that <em>the court had us here for some reason that I am not really sure has to do with the jury selection, </em>and perhaps I should just talk to him [Lewis]. [] If I could have some time to talk to him to see what his position is going to be\u2014 ... is the <em>court </em>contemplating jury selection outside of this jurisdiction? The Court: <em>I am thinking about it, yes. </em>What I would like to do is let you know what topics we are going to discuss today, and I will give you a time to discuss the matter with your client____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Tr., Vol. I, p. 2 (emphasis added). The trial court continues by analyzing why it believes such an action would be necessary, concluding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\"><em>My feeling </em>is at this point, ... that the wisest course would be to leave the county, go to another district, choose a jury there, keep the jury sequestered for the trial, and try it in Ada County, but choose the jury elsewhere. That would be <em>my feeling </em>that that is probably the best course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Id., </em>p. 5 (emphasis added). It then granted a ten-minute recess to allow Mr. Cahill to discuss the jury selection matter, as well as the other matters the court brought up for discussion, with his client. After the recess, the trial court returned to the topic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ads\">The Court: All right, now, about the other issues, do you have any <em>input </em>on the issue of whether or not we should choose an out-of-county jury in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">Mr. Cahill: Your Honor, after discussing the matter, we certainly appreciate <em>the court\u2019s concern. </em>However, it is our desire that jury selection take place in Ada County. We do not\u2014we are not moving for a change in venue, in other words. The Court: The State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">Mr. Rosenthal [the prosecutor]: Your Honor, I think in light of the publicity that has taken place ... I think a change of venue is appropriate in terms of selecting a jury____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Tr., Vol. I, pp. 7-8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In light of the above, the majority\u2019s concept of \u201cmotion\u201d here is nothing less than bizarre. It is clear that the trial court brought up the issue of out-of-county jury selection sua sponte and then merely asked whether the parties had \u201cinput.\u201d In the earlier exchange, Mr. Cahill noted that the trial court had called the parties there to discuss matters, including, perhaps, jury selection. The prosecution merely acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s suggestion after the trial court had engaged in substantial analysis on its own, without the parties\u2019 input.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Clearly, the prosecutor did not provide any sort of notice to Lewis that he was \u201cmoving\u201d for a change in venue or for a change in county for the purposes of jury selection. As <em>State v. Ash, 94 </em>Idaho 542, 493 P.2d 701, explained, in holding that a trial court may not change venue on its own motion, \u201cThere is a good reason for this rule: under it, both parties have an opportunity to present their views on the necessity for a change of venue to the court <em>before its decision </em>on the issue.\u201d <em>Ash, </em>94 Idaho at 545, 493 P.2d at 704 (emphasis added). This is no less true than for a motion for selecting an out-of-county jury. A ten-minute recess culminating in an exchange between the parties and the court comprising less than a page of transcript demonstrates that the court provided neither party with an opportunity to present their views fully and effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Furthermore, Idaho Criminal Rules require that a pre-trial motion be in writing. Rule 21 requires that \u201c[t]he court upon <em>motion </em>of either party shall transfer the proceeding to another county if the court is satisfied that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the case is pending.\u201d I.C.R. 21(a) (emphasis added). Rule 12, which governs motions before trial, states in relevant part that \u201c[e]very pleading, <em>motion, </em>notice, or judgment or order of the court shall be typed with black ribbon or produced by a computer or word processor type printer____\u201d I.C.R. 12(c). It is evident, then, that the State should have put its \u201cmotion\u201d in writing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">Another good reason to require a motion and thus notice is that a change in venue (or a change in jury pool) implicates a substantial and express constitutional right. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution commands, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law----\u201d Such a change in venue or jury pool should not occur lightly, on the whim of the district court, but should be fully argued by both parties, with time for them to consult relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">In view of the above, and in view of the fact that I.C. \u00a7 19-1816 requires a previous motion for transfer of venue before a trial court may impanel a jury from another county, the State\u2019s mere acquiescence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the trial judge\u2019s motion to impanel an out-of-county jury is not a \u201cmotion.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">III. \u201cAnd Then There Was James\u201d Exceeded the Scope of the Search Warrant and Thus Should Have Been Suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Putting aside whether the majority correctly concludes that probable cause existed for issuance of the search warrant, it is not correct in asserting that the document entitled \u201cAnd Then There Was James\u201d (\u201cJames\u201d) fell within the scope of the warrant. Hence, the trial court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to suppress \u201cJames.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The search warrant provided that the police could search for \u201cmemorabilia of <em>victims ...; </em>a diary listing names of <em>victims </em>and activities engaged in.\u201d Again, the majority distorts commonly understood, unambiguous words in order to affirm Lewis\u2019s conviction. \u201cJames\u201d is a short narrative, perhaps fiction, told as a flashback in the first-person. As such, it cannot qualify as a \u201cdiary\u201d as defined by the majority\u2014\u201ca register or record ... kept daily or at frequent intervals\u201d because \u201cJames\u201d appears on its face to be only one day\u2019s worth of writing. And if the narrative is fiction, which it may well be, it cannot qualify as a \u201crecord\u201d or therefore \u201cmemorabilia.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority\u2019s analysis implodes when one actually reads the warrant; \u201cJames\u201d does not qualify as either a diary or memorabilia as defined by the search warrant. Both of these warrant provisions describe items containing descriptions of multiple victims. \u201cJames,\u201d however, is a narrative, perhaps fictional, about sexual activity which the narrator conducted with a <em>nineteen </em>year old male who is described as having \u201cthe soft, unworried look of a fifteen-year-old.\u201d Even if \u201cJames\u201d describes a non-fictional incident, which is by no means clear, the recipient of adult, consensual sex can hardly be called a \u201cvictim.\u201d Moreover, \u201cJames\u201d only concerns sexual activity with one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">The fact that \u201cJames\u201d is not even remotely described in the search warrant is particularly troubling because, as the majority opinion notes, \u201cJames\u201d is clearly expressive material. That opinion, however, goes on to cite <em>State v. Claiborne, </em>120 Idaho 581, 818 P.2d 285 (1991), for the proposition that expressive material \u201cis seizable with a valid warrant or under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement just as any other piece of evidence of a crime would be.\u201d <em>Claiborne, </em>120 Idaho at 585, 818 P.2d at 289. This quotation is disingenuous when Claiborne is read in its entirety. In <em>Claiborne, </em>this Court held that a book plainly and on its face constituting \u201csexually exploitative material,\u201d as defined and barred by a criminal statute governing child pornography, could be seized because it was \u201cat the same time evidence of the crime of possession of sexually exploitative material,\u201d <em>not </em>because it was evidence of the underlying lewd and lascivious crime for which Claiborne was prosecuted. <em>Id. </em>A narrative describing sex between two adults does not on its face violate any criminal statutes, since it is not clearly obscene unless and until so judged after a trial. Thus, \u201cJames\u201d falls outside the rationale of <em>Claiborne </em>but within the rationale of <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985): \u201cThe First Amendment imposes special constraints on searches for and seizures of presumptively protected material, and requires that the Fourth Amendment be applied with \u2018scrupulous exactitude\u2019 in such circumstances.\u201d 472 U.S. at 468, 105 S.Ct. at 2781 (quoted in <em>Claiborne, </em>120 Idaho at 583, 818 P.2d at 287). As explained above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>a better view is that \u201cJames\u201d does not at all fall within the scope of the warrant. But even if one accepts the majority\u2019s arguments as to \u201cJames\u201d falling within \u201cmemorabilia\u201d or \u201cdiary,\u201d the narrative does so with a remarkable amount of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The fact that \u201cJames\u201d is clearly expressive material which was not described with particularity in the search warrant should mandate a holding that the district court erred in denying Lewis\u2019s motion to suppress and in thereafter admitting \u201cJames\u201d as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">IV. Detective Armstrong\u2019s Testimony and Prior Uncharged Sexual Contact with Victim Constituted Prejudicial Character Evidence and Thus Should Have Been Excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The majority contends that Lewis waived the issue of whether Detective Armstrong\u2019s testimony violated I.R.E. 404(b) because Lewis failed to cite the specific rule in his objection. Nonetheless, the majority admits that Lewis\u2019s counsel did object to the proffered testimony on the grounds that the statement \u201copen[ed] the door\u201d to prior convictions, i.e., bad acts. Rule 404(b) is entitled \u201cOther crimes, wrongs or acts.\u201d The majority\u2019s hyper-technicality is patent and unfair. Keeping in mind the intense and quick-moving nature of a trial, it is unrealistic to expect counsel to object to a piece of evidence in precisely the same manner that he or she would later raise the issue on appeal. As a matter of law, it is plain that Lewis adequately preserved the issue of Armstrong\u2019s testimony for appeal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Rule 404(b) bars the admission of evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d for the purpose of \u201cprov[ing] the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d I.R.E. 404(b). It is difficult to imagine a statement which contravenes this rule greater. The prosecution offered Detective Armstrong\u2019s testimony to suggest that Lewis possessed an attraction to \u201cadolescent boys\u201d and thus possessed a propensity to engage in sexual behavior with them. The State does not assert any Rule 404(b) exception (for instance, that the testimony was offered for other purposes, such as proof of motive or intent), presumably because there is no exception within which the testimony falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">As for the evidence of prior uncharged sexual contact with the victim, this justice stands by his dissent in <em>State v. Phillips, </em>123 Idaho 178, 845 P.2d 1211 (1993). <em>State v. Tolman, </em>121 Idaho 899, 828 P.2d 1304 (1992), and its progeny were wrongly decided in that they expand the \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d exception in I.R.E. 404(b) to engulf and render meaningless the general rule therein: that evidence of other acts is not admissible to attempt to show a defendant\u2019s person\u2019s propensity to engage in such acts. What the majority refers to as a \u201cplan\u201d is nothing more than evidence offered to prove the character of Lewis as a pedophile, thus intimating to the jury that he acted in conformity with that character. Also noteworthy is that the majority\u2019s rationale that the jury should hear the evidence of prior, uncharged acts because the jury is \u201cbetter able to compare patterns and methods,\u201d etc., ignores that the jury is also better able to conclude that since Lewis engaged in earlier acts, he 1) committed in the charged act or 2) deserved to be punished for the charged acts, even if the latter were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The raison d\u2019etre of the rules of evidence is that not every piece of evidence should go to the jury, and for good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">V. Dr. Oyler\u2019s Testimony that the Victim Fit the Profile of a Sexual Abuse Victim and that the Victim Had Been Abused Should Not Have Been Allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">For the most part, the majority opinion correctly disposes of Lewis\u2019s claim that Oy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ler\u2019s testimony was improper. The troubling aspect of Oyler\u2019s testimony involves the following exchange between the prosecutor and Oyler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">[Prosecutor]: Doctor, based on your training, your education, and your experience, as well as on your evaluation, therapeutic intervention with [the victim], can you state with a reasonable psychological probability whether [the victim] has been sexually abused? [Oyler]: He clearly fits the profile, and based on that, I would say yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Tr., Vol. IV, p. 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">First of all, although Lewis did not object as to foundation, it is notable that Oyler never testified as to what this \u201cprofile\u201d might be or what character traits it might consist of. If Oyler had testified as to psychological or behavioral traits of which a profile of a sexually abused youth might consist\u2014laying the appropriate scientific foundation, of course\u2014and then noted which of these the victim exhibited, such testimony would be permissible, provided that it is beyond the knowledge of the average juror and that it is scientifically sound. Second, notwithstanding this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Hester, </em>114 Idaho 688, 760 P.2d 27 (1988), it is an inappropriate invasion of the jurors\u2019 fact-finding function for an expert witness to proceed the extra step and to conclude that a victim has actually been abused. Only the jury is entitled to arrive at that conclusion if it so chooses based upon the testimony it has heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Because of all of the constitutional, statutory, and evidentiary errors noted above, this Court should reverse and vacate the conviction. A neutral system of justice demands no less.</p>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. The reference to \"passing\u201d semen \"onto or into [the victimfs body\u201d is somewhat ambiguous, in light of the evidence adduced that Lewis ejaculated onto the victim\u2019s body but did not actually engage in actual anal-genital contact. Nonetheless, the indictment must refer to the attempted anal-genital contact only. Idaho Code \u00a7 39-608, the statute under which Lewis was originally prosecuted, specifically defines \"transfer,\u201d an essential element of the crime (absent a specific intent to infect), as \u201cengaging in sexual activity by genital-genital contact, oral-genital contact, [or] anal-genital contact____\u201d Nowhere in this definition can one find semen-skin contact, nor would one expect to, since the HIV virus has rarely, if ever, been shown to be transferred by such means.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">. As far as can be ascertained from the record before the court, the jury was instructed that Lewis could be convicted in the lewd and lascivious trial for both oral-genital and attempted anal-genital contact. The charging documents, statements of the prosecution\u2019s theory of proof, should be binding until challenged by the State. <em>Cf. Grady, </em>495 U.S. at 522-23, 110 S.Ct. at 2094. Here, the State never claims that Lewis was convicted only for the oral-genital contact, not for the attempted anal-genital contact. In fact, the State candidly admits, \"The attempted anal penetration that formed part of the basis for this charge [the attempted transfer of body fluids which may contain the HIV virus] was the same act as the attempted anal penetration charged in the lewd conduct case.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Brief, p. 5. The State\u2019s reference to \"part of the basis of this charge\u201d is unclear; in light of the discussion in the above footnote, the \"rest of the basis\u201d for the HIV charge must be the other elements of the offense, including the fact that Lewis was HIV positive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">. At least one problem with the State\u2019s analysis is that <em>Grady\u2019s </em>holding involves a vertical comparison\u2014that is, between the conduct for which the defendant is first prosecuted and the conduct for which he or she is subsequently prosecuted. <em>Grady </em>does not purport to concern itself with a horizontal comparison\u2014that is, between conduct that might have been charged in the first prosecution and conduct actually charged in that same prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">. The term \"transaction\" is used because it falls within the United States Supreme Court\u2019s terminology, not because it is necessarily the best choice of word. (The same might be said of \"conduct,\" and in fact the Court in <em>Felix </em>acknowledged that \u201d[i]t appears that while <em>Grady </em>eschewed a \u2018same evidence\u2019 test, and <em>Garrett </em>rejected a \u2018single transaction\u2019 test, <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[471 U.S. 773, 790, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 2417, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985) ], the line between those tests and the \u2018same conduct\u2019 language is not easy to discern.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">. This Court should not give credence to the perilous sophistry needed to conclude that being HIV positive constitutes conduct. People are generally known to drink a lot for the purpose of getting drunk; on the other hand, people generally do not receive blood transfusions or engage in unprotected intercourse for the purpose of getting the AIDS virus. Moreover, intoxication is a temporary, controllable state and much more akin to conduct rather than HIV-positive status, which, as of now, is a permanent and incurable <em>condition.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b390-13\">. Oddly enough, this issue was not raised by the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\">. Even if we were inclined to overlook the plain language of the Idaho Criminal Rules, the State still should have substantially complied with such regulations\u2014that is, it should have provided notice to Lewis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. Because of my suggested disposition of the procedural aspect of the jury charge, I do not address Lewis\u2019s substantive constitutional argument. Unfortunately, neither does the majority, except for its introductory sentence: \u201cWe hold that the district court did not violate a constitutional right or abuse its discretion by selecting a jury from another county____\u201d Because of its disposition of the procedural issue, the majority should discuss beyond a one-sentence conclusion Lewis\u2019s contention that even if the appropriate procedure was followed, the jury selection violated his substantive Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b393-15\">. Since \u201cJames\u201d implicates the First Amendment as explained below, this court should err on the side of caution and presume that \"James\" is fiction and therefore not memorabilia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">. I agree with the majority that Lewis did not preserve the admissibility of \"James\u201d beyond the search warrant issue dealt with in the motion to suppress hearing. This is unfortunate, because the probity and relevancy of the document was minimal at best, while the potential prejudicial effect was enormous. Thus, had the issue been preserved properly, the inescapable conclusion would be that the admission of \"James\u201d violated I.R.E. 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
