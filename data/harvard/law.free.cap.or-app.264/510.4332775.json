He contends that the stop violated his rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it was not supported by probable cause, and he further contends that that violation tainted the evidence that he moved to suppress. The state does not dispute that the stop violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, but argues that the violation did not taint the evidence. Because we conclude that the violation tainted the evidence obtained during the stop and that admission of that evidence was prejudicial, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On July 14, 2010, defendant was driving a purple Cadillac on Interstate 84. Sherman County Deputy Sheriff Hulke pulled defendant over.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Hulke testified that he stopped defendant for a traffic violation, but that he could not recall what the violation was. Hulke testified that it was the type of violation for which he would usually issue a warning to a driver; but Hulke did not issue a warning to defendant. Defendant\u2019s uncontradicted testimony was that Hulke did not inform him of the reason for the stop. Although, in his motion to suppress, defendant specifically asserted that there was no evidence that Hulke had a reason to stop him, the state did not respond by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>presenting any evidence \u2014 such as a dispatch record or police report \u2014 that Hulke had ever given notice of, or recorded, any reason for the stop.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">During the stop, Hulke asked defendant for his name and defendant gave the name \u201cHarold Pennington,\u201d which is the name of one of defendant\u2019s friends. Hulke ran Pennington\u2019s name through dispatch, learned that Pennington\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended, and issued defendant a traffic citation in Pennington\u2019s name for driving while suspended and \u2014 because defendant had been unable to provide proof of insurance \u2014 for driving uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Approximately one month later, defendant informed a staff member of the district attorney\u2019s office that he had given a false name during the traffic stop. Thereafter, Sherman County Deputy Sheriff Shull telephoned defendant and obtained an oral statement. Defendant told Shull that he had given a false name because he did not have a valid license at the time of the stop and he did not want the car, which belonged to his girlfriend, to be towed. Defendant also told Shull that he had given Pennington\u2019s name because he had thought that Pennington had a valid license, and that he wanted to make sure that Pennington \u201cdidn\u2019t get in trouble.\u201d Shull asked defendant to go to his local police department and complete a written statement. Defendant did so, and the police department sent the statement to Shull. Thereafter, the state charged defendant with giving false information to a police officer based on his statements during the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained during and after the traffic stop. In his written motion, defendant moved to suppress \u201cthe seizure and identification of Defendant, any statements or admissions made by Defendant, all observations of Defendant, all evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>including identification, seized from Defendant and/or the vehicle in which he was driving on July 14, 2010.\u201d Defendant asserted that Hulke \u201cpull[ed] [him] over without cause and ask[ed] for [his] identification\u201d and that doing so \u201cconstitute [d] an unlawful seizure similar to the one struck down in <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 964 P2d 1007 (1998).\u201d Defendant further asserted that, because the stop was unlawful, the evidence obtained as a result of the stop had to be suppressed under the \u201cattenuation analysis delineated in <em>[State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 115 P3d 908 (2005)].\u201d Similarly, at the hearing on his motion, defendant argued that the evidence obtained during and after the traffic stop had to be suppressed under <em>Hall. </em>Defendant argued that the evidence was \u201cdirectly tied to that stop\u201d and that there was \u201cno factual attenuation\u201d between the stop and the discovery of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The state did not dispute that Hulke had stopped defendant unlawfully. But, the state argued that the causal connection between the unlawful stop and the discovery of the evidence was attenuated. The state\u2019s theory regarding the statements that defendant made <em>during </em>the stop was that the statements were attenuated from the stop because defendant made them because \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t want to get his girlfriend\u2019s car towed.\u201d The state\u2019s theory regarding the statements that defendant made <em>after </em>the stop was that they were attenuated from the stop because defendant volunteered them a month after the stop and because he made them \u201cso his friend wouldn\u2019t get in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Accepting the state\u2019s arguments, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cI\u2019m going to deny the Motion to Suppress. I\u2019m going to find the stop was illegal, but the conduct of the Defendant was independent in his own decision to notify the police that he gave a wrong name. And to keep his friend out of trouble[,] as well as having the car towed ***[.] I\u2019m also going to find there was a substantial attenuation of the time frame in which this took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">After the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and the court acquitted him of driving while suspended, but convicted him of giving false information to a police officer. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>II. ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">error of his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop. He renews his argument that, under the exclusionary rule of Article I, section 9, the evidence is inadmissible because it is the unattenuated product of the illegal stop. His argument focuses on the admissibility of his statements, both the oral statements that he made during the stop and the oral and written statements that he made one month after the stop.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts that all of the statements were erroneously admitted, but that, even if the later statements were properly admitted, the erroneous admission of the earlier statements was harmful because, without the earlier statements, the later statements would not have been corroborated and the state would not have been able to prove that he committed the crime of giving false information to a police officer. <em>See </em>ORS 136.425 (generally, a \u201cconfession alone is not sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant without some other proof that the crime has been committed\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In response, the state argues that all of defendant\u2019s statements were properly admitted because the causal connection between the stop and the statements is attenuated. The state acknowledges that the stop made it possible for Hulke to question defendant and that defendant\u2019s statements during the stop were in response to Hulke\u2019s questioning, but contends that the statements are admissible because defendant chose to give a false name. According to the state, \u201cdefendant\u2019s unilateral, voluntary decision to lie about his identity attenuated the \u2018discovery\u2019 of the evidence from the prior illegality.\u201d The state also argues, for the first time on appeal, that defendant\u2019s statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>admissible because they are evidence of a \u201cnew independent crime \u2014 providing false information to a police officer.\u201d As support for that argument, the state relies on an exception to the exclusionary rule that applies to evidence of \u201cindependent crimes directed at officers who illegally stop, frisk, arrest or search,\u201d <em>State v. Gaffney, </em>36 Or App 105, 108, 583 P2d 582 (1978), <em>rev den, </em>285 Or 195 (1979), but the state acknowledges that \u201cthis case does not present the same type of officer-safety concerns\u201d as the cases in which we have applied the <em>Gaffney </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A. <em>The History and Purpose of Oregon\u2019s Exclusionary Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Article I, section 9, protects individuals from unreasonable government searches and seizures. It prohibits government officers from interfering with individuals\u2019 rights to privacy and liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Article I, section 9, applies to traffic stops. <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 618, 227 P3d 695 (2010). To be constitutional, a stop for the purpose of investigating a traffic violation must be based on probable cause that the person to be stopped has committed the violation. ORS 810.410(2), (3); <em>State v. Matthews, </em>320 Or 398, 402, 884 P2d 1224 (1994). The probable cause requirement serves to protect the rights of all individuals to travel without unjustified interference by government officers; it helps to ensure that government officers exercise their authority only for proper purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">When a defendant moves to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless seizure on the ground that the seizure violated Article I, section 9, the state bears the burden of proving that the seizure was constitutional. <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983). In this case, the state did not establish that Hulke had probable cause to stop defendant. Therefore, as the trial court held, the stop violated defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights. As a result, the question in this case is whether defendant\u2019s statements obtained during and after the unlawful stop were subject to exclusion under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>In <em>Davis, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court explained the history and underlying principles of the exclusionary rule of Article I, section 9. 295 Or at 231-37. The court reviewed early cases in which other courts had excluded evidence that had been obtained in violation of protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, and it cited with approval cases in which courts had held that the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of the protections was necessary to give effect to the protections because, without it, the protections would have no force. <em>Id. </em>at 231-34. The court emphasized that, although the exclusionary rule can prevent the government from using evidence, it applies only to evidence that the government would not have if its officers had complied with the law. <em>Id. </em>at 237. The court also explained that the cost of exclusion was offset by the benefit of enforcement of the constitutional limits on government authority, quoting <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 US 383, 393, 34 S Ct 341, 58 L Ed 652 (1914), for the proposition that, if evidence obtained in violation of a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights can be admitted against the person in a criminal trial, \u201c\u2018the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.\u2019\u201d <em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The court then reviewed its own cases and concluded that the underlying premise of the exclusionary rule of Article I, section 9, is \u201cto bar the government\u2019s use of its own invasions of the defendant\u2019s rights, as stated in <em>Weeks </em>and its predecessors.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 233 n 5. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">\u201cIn summary, although not without some diversity of expression, the court since <em>State v. Laundy, </em>[103 Or 443, 204 P 958, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>103 Or 443 (1922)] has held to a principled view of the effect of an unlawful seizure of evidence. It has maintained the principle that those rules of law designed to protect citizens against unauthorized or illegal searches or seizures of their persons, property, or private effects are to be given effect by denying the state the use of evidence secured in violation of those rules against the persons whose rights were violated, or, in effect, by restoring the parties to their position as if the state\u2019s officers had remained within the limits of their authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 237. Thus, evidence that the government secures in violation of a person\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights is inadmissible against that person; it must be suppressed in order to vindicate the person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>As the court later stated in <em>State v. Davis, </em>313 Or 246, 253, 834 P2d 1008 (1992), \u201c[i]f that constitutional right to be \u2018secure\u2019 against impermissible government conduct is to be effective, it must mean that the government cannot obtain a criminal conviction through the use of evidence obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under that provision.\u201d Thus, \u201c[i]f the government seeks to rely on evidence in an Oregon criminal prosecution, that evidence must have been obtained in a manner that comports with the protections given to the individual by Article I, section 9.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254; <em>see Hall, </em>339 Or at 24 (\u201cThe right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under Article I, section 9, also encompasses the right to be free from the use of evidence obtained in violation of that provision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The applicability of the Oregon exclusionary rule of Article I, section 9, is to be determined in light of the reasons for the rule. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 23; <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Rogers, </em>314 Or 114, 118-19, 836 P2d 127 (1992). Because the purpose of the rule is to protect individuals\u2019 rights, the rule requires the suppression of evidence to restore individuals to the positions that they would have held if \u201cthe government\u2019s officers had stayed within the law.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">B. <em>The </em>Hall <em>Test for Exclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Resolution of this case turns on the application of the test prescribed in <em>Hall </em>for the exclusion of evidence under Article I, section 9. Therefore, it is necessary to examine <em>Hall </em>in some detail. In <em>Hall, </em>a police officer stopped the defendant, a pedestrian, without reasonable suspicion, thereby violating the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9. 339 Or at 19. The officer did so by asking for the defendant\u2019s identification and running a warrant check. <em>Id. </em>While the check was pending, the officer asked the defendant if he was carrying any weapons or drugs and if he would consent to a search. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The defendant consented, and the officer found a vial containing methamphetamine residue in the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence of the vial and its contents, asserting that the illegal stop tainted his consent and the results of the consent search. The trial court denied the motion, and the Supreme Court reversed the trial court, holding that the evidence was tainted by the illegal stop. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37. In its opinion, the court explained that there are \u201ctwo related, but distinct, ways that a violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, may affect the validity of a defendant\u2019s subsequent consent to a search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. First, a violation \u201cmay negate a defendant\u2019s consent to a search upon the ground that that police conduct rendered the defendant\u2019s consent involuntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cArticle I, section 9, may require exclusion of evidence from an otherwise valid consent search upon the ground that the defendant\u2019s consent derived from a preceding violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under that state constitutional provision.\u201d <em>Id. at 21.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In <em>Hall, </em>the defendant did not claim that his consent was involuntary; the issue was whether the defendant\u2019s consent was tainted by the illegal stop. That, the court explained, was dependent on the nature of the causal connection between the illegal stop and the defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 28. According to the court, the test to determine whether consent is tainted for the purposes of Article I, section 9, is similar to the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 US 471, 83 S Ct 407, 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963), in which, in the context of a challenge to the admission of statements made during an illegal arrest, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u2018\u201cWe need not hold that all evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. <em>Rather, the more apt question in such a case is whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint!\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">339 Or at 21 n 12 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 US at 487-88 (internal quotation marks omitted)) (emphasis added). Thus, under <em>Wong Sun, </em>evidence that is causally connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>to illegal police action is inadmissible unless it has been, or would have been, obtained \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable\u201d from the illegal action \u201cto be purged of the primary taint.\u201d 317 US at 488. In other words, such evidence is inadmissible unless \u201cthe connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has \u2018become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487 (quoting <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 US 338, 341, 60 S Ct 266, 84 L Ed 307 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In a manner consistent with the phrasing of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d test in <em>Wong Sun, </em>the <em>Hall </em>court stated that the question before it was \u201cwhether Article I, section 9, require [d] exclusion of the state\u2019s evidence because [the] defendant\u2019s consent derived from \u2014 or, stated differently, was obtained by \u2018exploitation\u2019 of \u2014 the unlawful stop.\u201d Hall, 339 Or at 22.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then prescribed how courts are to determine whether a defendant\u2019s consent \u201cderived from\u201d prior unlawful police conduct. The court explained that, in order for evidence to be excluded on the ground that it resulted from a violation of a defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, there must be a causal connection between the violation and the discovery of the evidence, and, if there is a causal connection, exclusion is required unless the government can establish \u201cthat the evidence did not derive from the preceding illegality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. To do so, the government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cmust prove that either (1) the police inevitably would have obtained the disputed evidence through lawful procedures even without the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; (2) the police obtained the disputed evidence independently of the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; or (3) the preceding violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, has such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that that unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). In each of those three circumstances, \u201cthe admission of the challenged evidence does not offend Article I, section 9, because the defendant has not been disadvantaged as a result of the unlawful police conduct, or stated differently, because the defendant is not placed in a worse position than if the governmental officers had acted within the bounds of the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In <em>Hall, </em>the issue was whether the state had established that the causal connection between the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights and the discovery of the disputed evidence was so tenuous that the violation could not \u201cbe viewed properly as the source of [the] evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the <em>Hall </em>court, determining whether the state has established that the violation is only tenuously related to the discovery of the evidence \u201crequires a fact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. Several considerations are relevant to that determination, including \u201c(1) the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the [discovery of the evidence], (2) the existence of any intervening circumstances, and (3) the presence of any circumstances \u2014 such as, for example, a police officer informing the defendant of the right to refuse consent \u2014 that mitigated the effect of the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">To summarize, <em>Hall </em>establishes that, if there is a causal connection between unlawful police conduct and a defendant\u2019s consent to a search, evidence obtained as a result of the consent is inadmissible unless the state proves that the discovery of the evidence \u201cwas independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, considerations relevant to whether a defendant\u2019s consent is only tenuously related to the unlawful police conduct include the temporal proximity between the conduct and the consent and whether there are any intervening circumstances or other circumstances that mitigate the effect of the unlawful police conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Applying its test to the facts of the case before it, in which the officer illegally stopped the defendant by asking for his identification and running a warrant check, the <em>Hall </em>court concluded that the officer\u2019s illegal stop vitiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the defendant\u2019s consent to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 36. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cGiven the close temporal proximity between the illegal detention and [the] defendant\u2019s consent, and the absence of any intervening circumstances or other circumstances mitigating the effect of that unlawful police conduct, we cannot say that the state has proved that the defendant\u2019s decision to consent, even if voluntary, was not the product of the preceding violation of [the] defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court further concluded, evidence resulting from the defendant\u2019s consent was inadmissible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Importantly, the <em>Hall </em>court distinguished the facts of the case before it from the facts in two other cases: <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>290 Or 493, 624 P2d 99 (1981), and <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 854 P2d 399 (1993). In <em>Kennedy, </em>when police officers told the defendant that they had information that he was carrying narcotics, the defendant \u201cdenied that he was carrying narcotics and said, \u2018Would you like to search my luggage?\u201d\u2019 290 Or at 496. The officers found cocaine as a result of the search, and the defendant moved to suppress that evidence on the ground that the officers had illegally stopped him before he invited the officers to search his luggage. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>a police officer asked the defendant, who had already been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, \u201c[D]o you have any drugs or guns in the house?\u201d and he replied, \u201cNo, go ahead and look.\u201d 317 Or at 30. The police found a gun in the house, and the defendant moved to suppress that evidence on the ground that the police had illegally arrested him before he offered to allow the officers to search. In each case, the Supreme Court concluded that, even assuming that the officers had engaged in unlawful conduct, the evidence discovered as a result of the defendant\u2019s consent was admissible. In <em>Hall, </em>the court explained that its conclusions in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cmust be understood in light of the specific facts of each of those cases \u2014 particularly, the facts that those defendants both had volunteered to allow a search without any police prompting and, in <em>Rodriguez, </em>that the police had provided the defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning him about drugs or weapons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>339 Or at 34. The court further explained that, \u201c[i]n the absence of such intervening circumstances \u2014 or other circumstances mitigating the effect of the unlawful police conduct \u2014 this court has required suppression under facts similar to those at issue in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez,\u201d </em>that is, when officers obtain consent during an unlawful (or unlawfully extended) stop. <em>Id. </em>As examples, the court cited <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, and <em>State v. Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or 206, 895 P2d 306 (1995). In each <em>of </em>those cases, an officer lawfully stopped the defendant for a traffic violation, completed the investigation of the violation, told the defendant that he was free to go, but then asked the defendant if he would consent to a search. And, in each case, the Supreme Court concluded that the officer\u2019s conduct after telling the defendant that he was free to go constituted an unlawful extension of the traffic stop and that the defendant\u2019s consent and the evidence resulting from it were tainted and had to be suppressed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Toevs, </em>327 Or at 537-38; <em>Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Subsequent cases involving traffic stops have followed <em>Hall. </em>In <em>State v. Thompkin, </em>341 Or 368, 371, 143 P3d 530 (2006), an officer asked the defendant, who was a passenger in a car that had been lawfully stopped for a traffic violation, for her identification, which the officer used to run a records check. Meanwhile, a second officer questioned the defendant about drugs. The questioning prompted the defendant to surrender a pipe used for smoking crack cocaine, and a subsequent search led to the discovery of a small amount of cocaine. The Supreme Court held that the officers had illegally stopped the defendant and that the resulting evidence was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 381. The court explained that the reasoning of <em>Dominguez-Martinez, Toevs, </em>and <em>Hall </em>was \u201cequally applicable to this case, where [the] defendant voluntarily surrendered incriminating evidence in response to the officer\u2019s questioning during an impermissible seizure,\u201d and where there were no \u201cintervening circumstances or other circumstances mitigating the effect of the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Thompkin, </em>341 Or at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 630, which involved two cases that were consolidated for review, the Supreme Court held that the officer in each case illegally extended an otherwise lawful traffic stop when, rather than proceeding to either issue a citation or release the defendant, the officer questioned the defendant about matters unrelated to the reason for the stop and requested consent to search, which the defendant gave and which led to the discovery of contraband. Regarding the effect of the illegal extension on one of the defendants, the court observed that the defendant had \u201cno way of knowing that [the officer\u2019s] questions and request to search the car were not part of the traffic investigation and that his cooperation in [the officer\u2019s] investigation was not required to continue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. The court concluded that \u201cas in <em>Hall, </em>given the temporal proximity between the illegal detention and each defendant\u2019s consent, and in the absence of any other intervening circumstances, or other circumstances mitigating the effect of the unlawful seizures of each defendant, * * * each defendant\u2019s consent, even if voluntary, was the product * * * of the unlawful seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><em>Hall, </em>its predecessors, and its progeny establish that, when an officer illegally stops a person and makes an inquiry, the person\u2019s response to that inquiry is the product of the illegal stop and evidence obtained as a result of the inquiry is inadmissible, unless the state proves that the response was \u201cindependent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 35. They also establish that, in the absence of intervening circumstances or other circumstances that mitigate the effect of the illegal stop, a person\u2019s response to an officer\u2019s inquiry during an illegal stop is not attenuated from the illegality; it is the tainted fruit of the illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Of particular relevance here, both we and the Supreme Court held, well before <em>Hall, </em>that, when an officer illegally stopped a driver and requested the driver\u2019s identification, the driver\u2019s response to that request was tainted by the illegal stop, as was the evidence obtained as a result of the driver\u2019s response. <em>State v. Starr, </em>91 Or App 267, 754 P2d 618 (1988), and <em>State v. Farley, </em>308 Or 91, 775 P2d 835 (1989), are illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In <em>Starr, </em>an officer illegally stopped the defendant, who had been sleeping in his car on the side of the road, by requesting and retaining his driver\u2019s license. After the officer returned the license, the defendant drove away, and the officer ran a records check and learned that the defendant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended. The officer pursued the defendant and arrested him for driving while suspended. The trial court suppressed the evidence resulting from the illegal stop, including the defendant\u2019s identity, and we affirmed. 91 Or App at 269-70. We specifically rejected the state\u2019s argument that the officer was \u201centitled to know [the] defendant\u2019s name from the first encounter,\u201d stating that \u201c[u]nder the circumstances, [the officer] did not have authority to compel [the] defendant to do anything, including giving his name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270. Accordingly, we concluded that \u201c[the] defendant\u2019s identity was obtained as a result of the unlawful stop.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In <em>Farley, </em>an officer stopped the defendant for driving a vehicle that did not have a license plate. 308 Or at 93. But, when the officer approached the defendant\u2019s car, he saw a temporary registration sticker in the window. At that point, the officer\u2019s reason for the stop evaporated. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the officer proceeded to ask the defendant for his driver\u2019s license and proof of registration. The defendant\u2019s responses to those requests led to the discovery of evidence that the defendant\u2019s license was suspended and he was driving uninsured. The Supreme Court held that, once the reason for the stop evaporated, the officer did not have authority to ask the defendant for his license and registration, and the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence resulting from those requests. <em>Id. </em>at 94; <em>see also State v. Bentz, </em>211 Or App 129, 134, 158 P3d 1081 (2007) (holding that officer\u2019s request for defendant\u2019s name during an illegal entry constituted exploitation of the illegal entry under <em>Hall).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">As <em>Starr </em>and <em>Farley </em>show, an illegal stop taints evidence obtained in response to police inquiries made during the illegal stop, absent intervening or mitigating circumstances. A defendant is entitled to suppression of such evidence, and, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, 264 Or App at 538-39 (Hadlock, J., dissenting), the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>not required to prove that that the officer was conducting a criminal investigation or that there were coercive circumstances above and beyond the illegal stop. <em>Id. </em>(describing the <em>Hall </em>test for exclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Essentially, the <em>Hall </em>test creates a presumption that, if the discovery of evidence is causally connected to unlawful police conduct, the evidence is tainted and, therefore, inadmissible. The state can rebut the presumption by showing that (1) the evidence would have been inevitably discovered, (2) the evidence had an independent source, or (3) the causal connection between the unlawful conduct and the discovery of the evidence was tenuous. 339 Or at 25. The presumption is proper; it reflects the reality \u2014 both legal and practical \u2014 that unlawful police conduct puts an individual at a disadvantage that can affect the person\u2019s decision whether to, for example, consent to a search, surrender property, or make a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">A stop can affect a person\u2019s decision whether to respond to an officer\u2019s request for information in at least two ways. First, it restricts the person\u2019s legal options. Unlike a person who has not been stopped, a person who has been stopped is not free to walk away from an officer seeking information; the person\u2019s legal options for responding to an inquiry by the officer have been restricted. That is particularly true for traffic stops. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Rodgers /Kirkeby:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201c[I]n contrast to a person on the street, who may unilaterally end an officer-citizen encounter at any time, the reality is that a motorist stopped for a traffic infraction is legally obligated to stop at an officer\u2019s direction, <em>see </em>ORS 811.535 (failing to obey a police officer) and ORS 811.540 (fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer), and to interact with the officer, <em>see </em>ORS 807.570 (failure to carry or present license) and ORS 807.620 (giving false information to a police officer), and therefore is not free unilaterally to end the encounter * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">347 Or at 622-23. If, for example, a driver does not provide identification to an officer, the officer may detain or arrest the person in order to investigate and verify the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>identity. As a result, when an officer subjects a person to a traffic stop, the officer has gained the authority to impose negative consequences \u2014 further detention or arrest \u2014 if the person refuses to respond to a request for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Second, a stop can affect a person\u2019s decision whether to respond to an officer\u2019s request for information because it brings additional considerations to bear on the person\u2019s decision \u2014 considerations such as what effect noncompliance with the officer\u2019s request could have on the person\u2019s release. In other words, a stop changes a person\u2019s decisional calculus by introducing additional factors that weigh in favor of compliance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">When a person has been <em>illegally </em>stopped, the person\u2019s options have been <em>illegally </em>restricted, and additional factors that weigh in favor of compliance have been <em>illegally </em>introduced. Thus, an illegal stop subjects the person to \u201cthe pressure of police action that [is] available to police only by the prior unauthorized conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Williamson, </em>307 Or 621, 626, 772 P2d 404 (1989). It puts the person \u201cin a worse position than if the governmental officers had acted within the bounds of the law.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25. Accordingly, it is appropriate that, under the <em>Hall </em>test, if there is a causal connection between unlawful police conduct and the discovery of evidence, the evidence cannot be admitted unless the state proves that its discovery was independent of, or only tenuously connected to, the illegal stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">C. <em>Application of the </em>Hall <em>Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">As in <em>Hall, </em>the issue in this case is whether the causal connection between the illegal stop and the challenged evidence is attenuated. We conclude that defendant\u2019s statements to Hulke during the unlawful traffic stop are not attenuated from the stop, but that his statements one month later are.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>With respect to the earlier statements, there was no temporal break between the stop and the statements; the stop was ongoing when the statements were made. There were no mitigating circumstances: Hulke did not inform defendant that he did not need to answer his questions, and the circumstances \u2014 a traffic stop \u2014 would have caused defendant to reasonably believe that he was required to provide the officer with identification. Nor were there any intervening circumstances: Nothing occurred that would have alerted defendant that he was free to leave or to refuse to provide information. And, the statements were not spontaneous. They are akin to the defendants\u2019 self-identifications in <em>Starr </em>and <em>Farley, </em>the defendants\u2019 consents in <em>Toevs, Dominguez-Martinez, Hall, </em>and <em>Rodgers /Kirkeby, </em>and the defendant\u2019s surrender of evidence in <em>Thompkin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The opposite is true for the statements that defendant made one month later. Defendant was not stopped when he made the oral statements to Shull or when he completed the written statement at his local police department; indeed, a significant amount of time had passed since the illegal stop. Moreover, defendant initiated the contact with government authorities by telling the district attorney\u2019s office that he had given a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The dissent concludes that defendant\u2019s statements during the illegal stop are not tainted. In reaching its conclusion, the dissent acknowledges that <em>Hall </em>governs its analysis, but does not abide by <em>Hall. </em>The dissent suggests that Hulke did not \u201cexploit\u201d the illegal stop because he \u201cdid not trade on or otherwise take advantage\u201d of the stop to ask defendant his name. 264 Or App at 536-37 (Hadlock, J., dissenting). The dissent\u2019s focus on whether Hulke \u201ctrade [d] on or otherwise [took] advantage of\u2019 the illegal stop is based on <em>Rodriguez. </em>264 Or App at 537 (Hadlock, J., dissenting). To the extent that the dissent relies on <em>Rodriguez </em>to suggest a different test than <em>Hall </em>for whether evidence is the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d we must apply <em>Hall. </em>Moreover, concluding, as the dissent does, that evidence obtained as a result of unlawful police conduct is tainted only if an officer engaged in coercive conduct in addition to the illegal stop, is inconsistent with <em>Starr </em>and <em>Farley, </em>where the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>was suppressed had been obtained as a result of requests for identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The dissent accepts the state\u2019s argument based on <em>State v. Crandall, </em>340 Or 645, 136 P3d 30 (2006). In <em>Crandall, </em>a police officer directed the defendant to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201ccome here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647. The \u201c[defendant obeyed that direction but, before he reached the officer, put a clear plastic \u2018baggie\u2019 containing a controlled substance underneath one of the cars in the apartment parking lot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On review, the Supreme Court assumed that the officer had illegally stopped the defendant, but concluded that the illegality did not taint the subsequently discovered evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 652-53. The court held that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s unilateral, voluntary decision to put the baggie underneath the car sufficiently attenuated the discovery of that evidence from the prior illegality, in the same way that the defendants\u2019 acts in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Relying on <em>Crandall, </em>the dissent contends that \u201cdefendant\u2019s unilateral, voluntary decision to lie about his identity attenuated the discovery of the evidence * * * from the prior illegality.\u201d 264 Or App at 535 (Hadlock, J., dissenting). According to the dissent, \u201cdefendant\u2019s unilateral choice to give a false name was an intervening circumstance that attenuated the discovery of that false statement from the prior illegality[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">That is incorrect for several reasons. First, defendant\u2019s decision was not \u201cunilateral.\u201d As mentioned, in <em>Crandall, </em>the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s act of putting the baggie under the car was similar to the defendants\u2019 consents in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>which were volunteered, and different from the defendant\u2019s consent in <em>Hall, </em>which was in response to a question. This case is akin to, and controlled by, <em>Hall. </em>Like <em>Hall, </em>and unlike <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez, </em>it involves a direct response to an officer\u2019s request, not a volunteered or unilateral action. <em>See also State v. Campbell, </em>207 Or App 585, 590, 142 P3d 517 (2006) (distinguishing <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>because defendant did not volunteer to be searched but consented only after deputy asked for permission to conduct a pat-down search).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Second, defendant\u2019s false statement was not an \u201cintervening circumstance\u201d between the illegal stop and the discovery of the evidence. It <em>was </em>the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Third, and finally, it is irrelevant that defendant\u2019s statement was false. Whether a statement is the product of prior unlawful conduct does not depend on whether the statement is true or false. If, as the dissent suggests, a decision to lie in response to a question could be said to be a \u201cunilateral, voluntary decision,\u201d a decision to tell the truth could also be said to be a \u201cunilateral, voluntary decision,\u201d as could a decision to consent to a search. The dissent\u2019s reasoning would lead to the conclusion that, if an illegally stopped person provided his name upon request, and, as a result of a records check, was charged with driving while suspended, then the evidence obtained as a result of the stop would be admissible. That, however, is contrary to controlling law. <em>Starr, </em>91 Or App at 270; <em>Farley, </em>308 Or at 94. Likewise, the dissent\u2019s reasoning would lead to the conclusion that, if an illegally stopped person was asked to consent to a search and did consent, the results of the search would be admissible. That, too, is contrary to controlling law. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Ultimately, the dissent\u2019s conclusion rests on the fact that defendant committed a new crime, giving false information to a police officer. The dissent appears to have accepted the state\u2019s argument based on <em>Gaffney, </em>36 Or App at 105, in which we recognized an exception to the exclusionary rule for evidence of new crimes that threaten officer safety. The <em>Gaffney </em>exception to the exclusionary rule is a limited one; it applies to \u201cevidence of independent crimes directed at officers who illegally stop, frisk, arrest or search.\u201d 36 Or App at 108. Accordingly, we have applied it only in cases in which the challenged evidence involved a new crime that threatened officer safety. <em>See e.g., State v. Rodriguez, </em>37 Or App 355, 357, 587 P2d 487 (1978), <em>rev den, </em>285 Or 319 (1979) (evidence that defendant hit officer in the head was admissible even if officer had illegally stopped defendant); <em>State v. Burger, </em>55 Or App 712, 715-16, 639 P2d 706 (1982) (evidence that defendant kicked officers after being arrested was admissible even if the arrest was unlawful). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>And, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>161 Or App 111, 119-20, 984 P2d 312 (1999), we expressly declined to extend the exception to evidence of a crime \u2014 supplying contraband, for bringing marijuana into jail \u2014 that the defendant allegedly committed after being illegally arrested. We explained that the <em>Gaffney </em>line of cases was \u201cinapposite\u201d because \u201c[t]he crucial fact in those cases was that the new crime was directed at the arresting officers, thereby threatening their safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. \u201cThe rationale underlying our denial of suppression in those cases,\u201d was absent in <em>Williams </em>because \u201c[t]he presence of the concealed marijuana did not threaten the officer\u2019s safety in any way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. Therefore, we concluded, evidence of the marijuana was tainted and had to be suppressed in order to \u201c\u2018restor[e] the parties to their position as if the state\u2019s officers had remained within the limits of their authority.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 237).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Just as the evidence of the alleged supplying contraband had to be suppressed in <em>Williams </em>in order to restore the parties to the positions that they would have occupied had the state\u2019s officers not violated the defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, the challenged evidence in this case must be suppressed. To admit the evidence under the <em>Gaffney </em>exception would be inconsistent with the limited purpose of the exception that we clearly articulated in Williams.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Because defendant\u2019s statements during the illegal stop were not attenuated from the stop and are not admissible under the <em>Gaffney </em>exception to the exclusionary rule, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress those statements. Admission of those statements was not harmless because, as defendant argues and the state does not dispute, the state could not have secured a conviction based on the later statements alone. <em>See </em>ORS 126.425(1) (\u201cA confession [is not] sufficient to warrant the conviction without some other proof that the crime has been committed[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court erred in failing to suppress the statements that defendant made during the illegal stop and that the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> ORS 807.620(1) provides: \u201cA person commits the offense of giving false information to a police officer if the person knowingly uses or gives a false or fictitious name, address or date of birth to any police officer who is enforcing motor vehicle laws.\u201d ORS 807.620 (2) provides that the offense is a Class A misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> In his written motion to suppress, defendant asserted that there was no evidence that Hulke had a reason to stop him.

The same is true if, instead of seizing property, an officer seizes a person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> The state does not argue that <em>Williams </em>is plainly wrong, nor does it offer any reason why the balance struck in that case between the protection of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and the state\u2019s interest in prosecuting crimes should be any different in this case, which involves a nonviolent misdemeanor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b552-6\">HADLOCK, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Defendant gave a false name to a police officer who had conducted a traffic stop. As the state concedes, that stop must be deemed unlawful because the officer could not recall, at the time of the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, why he had stopped defendant, and the officer apparently had not memorialized the reason for the stop, in a citation or otherwise. The majority concludes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements that he made during that unlawful traffic stop because those statements \u201cwere not attenuated from the stop and are not admissible under the <em>Gaffney </em>exception to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>State v. Suppah, </em>264 Or App, 510, 531, 334 P3d 463 (2014). With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">I briefly recap the undisputed facts. In July 2010, Officer Hulke stopped defendant for a traffic violation, but he was not able to recall, at a later suppression hearing, what that violation was. During the stop, Hulke asked defendant for his name and date of birth. Instead of answering truthfully, defendant gave him the name and birth date of a friend, Pennington. Although defendant was unaware of it, Pennington\u2019s license was suspended at the time. Hulke issued a citation to defendant, using Pennington\u2019s name, for driving with a suspended license and driving uninsured. Approximately one month later, defendant contacted the district attorney\u2019s office, stating that he had given \u201ca wrong name\u201d and asserting that he did not want Pennington to get in trouble because of his actions. Deputy Sheriff Shull followed up with defendant and asked him to submit a written statement through his local police department. Defendant submitted a statement in which he explained that he had been pulled over by Hulke on July 14. He later was charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>with giving false information to a police officer, ORS 807.620 and driving while suspended, ORS 811.182.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all information and evidence that had been obtained from the stop, arguing that the search and seizure violated his rights under various constitutional provisions, includingArticleI,section9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on Hulke\u2019s inability to recall the reason that he had stopped defendant, the trial court ruled that the stop had been illegal. Nonetheless, the court denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cI\u2019m going to find the stop was illegal, but the conduct of the Defendant was independent in his own decision to notify the police that he gave a wrong name. And to keep his friend out of trouble as well as having the car towed in that I\u2019m also going to find that there was a substantial attenuation of the time frame in which this took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Defendant waived his right to a jury and was tried to the court, which found him guilty of giving false information to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court should have suppressed both his statements from the initial traffic stop and the statements that he made to police one month later. He contends that suppression was required under Article I, section 9, because the evidence was derived from an unlawful stop and not \u201csufficiently attenuated to remove the taint of the unlawful stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">For the reasons stated by the majority, I agree that the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements that he made one month after the traffic stop. <em>See Suppah, </em>264 Or App at 527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to suppress the statements that he made during the traffic stop. I begin my analysis with <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 25, 115 P3d 908 (2005), which explains the circumstances under which a trial court should suppress evidence that police officers obtained as a result of their own unlawful conduct. Under <em>Hall, </em>a defendant seeking to suppress evidence must first establish \u201ca minimal factual nexus \u2014 that is, at minimum, the existence of a \u2018but for\u2019 relationship\u2014 between the evidence sought to be suppressed and prior unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25. However, the existence of that \u201cbut for\u201d connection is not enough, standing alone, to warrant suppression. <em>See State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 40, 854 P2d 399 (1993) (\u201c[t]he fact that, \u2018but for\u2019 the unlawful conduct the police would not have been in a position to seek (for example) a person\u2019s consent does not, in and of itself, render any evidence uncovered during the ensuing consent search inadmissible\u201d). Rather, once that minimum factual nexus is established, the state has the burden of showing that the evidence was not obtained through \u201cexploitation\u201d of the unlawful police conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201c[T]he state nevertheless may establish that the disputed evidence is admissible under Article I, section 9, by proving that the evidence did not derive from the preceding illegality. To make that showing, the state must prove that either (1) the police inevitably would have obtained the disputed evidence through lawful procedures even without the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; (2) the police obtained the disputed evidence independently of the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9; or (3) the preceding violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9, has such a tenuous factual link to the disputed evidence that that unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"><em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25 (internal citations omitted); <em>see State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 244 P3d 360 (2010) (the \u201cexploitation\u201d analysis asks \u201cwhether the consent search in some sense <em>derived </em>from the prior unlawful police stop\u201d (emphasis in original)). In determining whether evidence derived from unlawful police conduct \u2014 or, conversely, \u201cwas independent of, or only tenuously related to\u201d it \u2014 we consider the specific facts at issue, including the temporal proximity between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>unlawful police conduct and the discovery of the evidence, and the existence of any intervening or mitigating circumstances. <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">As noted, the state does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that Hulke\u2019s stop of defendant was unlawful. Nor does the state contend that no \u201cbut for\u201d connection exists between the stop and the statements that defendant made during that stop \u2014 specifically, defendant\u2019s false declaration that he was Pennington. Rather, the state argues only that Hulke did not obtain that statement by exploiting the illegal stop. In that regard, the state argues, it was defendant\u2019s own, independent desire to evade citation that prompted him to lie. The state asserts that, \u201csimply because an individual is unlawfully detained under Article I, section 9, it does not follow that the evidence of defendant\u2019s new, independent crime \u2014 providing false information to a police officer \u2014 must be suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In support of that contention, the state cites <em>State v. Crandall, </em>340 Or 645, 136 P3d 30 (2006). In that case, a police officer unlawfully stopped the defendant without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, by telling him to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201ccome here\u201d as he left an apartment. <em>Crandall, </em>340 Or at 647. The \u201c[defendant obeyed that direction, but before he reached the officer, he put a clear plastic \u2018baggie\u2019 containing a controlled substance underneath one of the cars in the apartment parking lot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After noting that the officer\u2019s direction to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201ccome here\u201d was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the defendant\u2019s decision to put the baggie underneath the car, the Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s unilateral, voluntary decision to put the baggie underneath the car sufficiently attenuated the discovery of that evidence from the prior illegality,\u201d such that \u201c\u2018the unlawful police conduct cannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence.\u2019\u201d Id. at 652-53 (quoting <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Here, the state argues, defendant\u2019s unilateral, voluntary decision to lie about his identity attenuated the discovery of the evidence (his false statement) from the prior unlawful police conduct, in much the same way that the defendant\u2019s actions in <em>Crandall </em>did. In my view, the state\u2019s reliance on <em>Crandall </em>is apt. Although Hulke\u2019s request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>identification was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of defendant\u2019s decision to give him Pennington\u2019s name, defendant made a unilateral, voluntary decision to lie. Thus, just as the defendant in <em>Crandall </em>chose to hide evidence of drugs in an attempt to avoid criminal liability, the defendant in this case chose to hide evidence of his identity in an attempt to avoid the consequences of giving his own name. In each case, the officer\u2019s unlawful action was the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the defendant\u2019s choice, but that voluntary choice (and the officer\u2019s discovery of evidence that flowed from that choice) cannot be said to have derived from the officer\u2019s action. And here (unlike in <em>Crandall), </em>defendant\u2019s choice involved committing a new crime (giving false identification to a police officer) that had not yet existed when the officer asked him for identification, further weakening any causal link between the officer\u2019s inquiry and the officer\u2019s discovery of evidence (the false name). Given the totality of the circumstances, I would conclude that defendant\u2019s unilateral choice to give a false name was an intervening circumstance that attenuated the discovery of that false statement from the prior illegality, such that the unlawful stop \u201ccannot be viewed properly as the source of that evidence.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Put differently, Hulke did not \u201cexploit\u201d his unlawful stop of defendant in any way that resulted in defendant giving the false name. True, Hulke would not have asked defendant for his name had he not conducted the traffic stop, and defendant presumably would not have provided any identifying information (accurate or not) had Hulke not asked that question. But that chain of events establishes nothing more than the sort of \u201cbut for\u201d causation that the Supreme Court has held does not constitute exploitation. Take the circumstances at issue in <em>Rodriguez, </em>a case that presented the question whether the defendant\u2019s consent to search his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>apartment was obtained through exploitation of a purportedly unlawful arrest. 317 Or at 38. The officer making that arrest had gone to the defendant\u2019s apartment, entered the apartment when the defendant \u201cstepped back,\u201d which the officer took as an indication to step in, read <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the defendant, and then asked, \u201cDo you have any drugs or guns in the house?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Although the defendant then said, \u201cNo, go ahead and look,\u201d the officer sought clarification, asking, \u201c\u2018Can we search?\u2019 You know, \u2018Want to consent to search,\u2019 and so forth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that point, the defendant said, \u201cYes, go ahead.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The Supreme Court held that the <em>Rodriguez </em>defendant\u2019s consent was not obtained through exploitation of the purportedly unlawful arrest, which had brought the officer to the defendant\u2019s apartment, because the officer \u201cdid not trade on or otherwise take advantage of the arrest to obtain [the] defendant\u2019s consent to the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. \u201cThe mere fact that, but for the arrest, the agent would not have been standing in the doorway of [the] defendant\u2019s apartment, in a position to ask [the] defendant about drugs and guns\u201d did not establish that the officer had exploited the arrest to obtain the defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the mere fact that the traffic stop put Hulke in the position to ask defendant\u2019s name does not, itself, amount to \u201cexploitation\u201d of the illegality associated with that stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The majority\u2019s disagreement with my analysis is based primarily on <em>Hall, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s consent to search was obtained through exploitation of an unlawful stop. 339 Or at 36. But <em>Hall </em>does not stand for the proposition that <em>any </em>request for information \u2014 or request for consent to search \u2014 made during an unlawful stop necessarily constitutes exploitation. Rather, the <em>Hall </em>court made a fact-specific determination of whether \u201cthe unlawful police conduct, even if not overcoming the defendant\u2019s free will, significantly affected the defendant\u2019s decision to consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. Given the totality of the circumstances in that case, including that the officer requested consent to search immediately after he had asked the defendant about whether he was carrying weapons or illegal drugs, and while he was awaiting the results of a warrant check, the court held that the state had not proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s decision to consent, even if voluntary, was not the product of the preceding violation of [the] defendant\u2019s rights under Article I, section 9.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. Nothing in this record suggests that defendant\u2019s decision to give a false answer to Hulke\u2019s request for identifying information was based on similar police pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The other cases on which the majority relies \u2014 like <em>Hall </em>\u2014 also involved two types of facts that are not present here. First, in each of those cases, police officers took advantage of an unlawful (or unlawfully extended) stop to conduct an investigation into possible criminal activity, like the unlawful possession of controlled substances or weapons. <em>See State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 626-28, 227 P3d 695 (2010) (officer asked defendant Rodgers about items in car possibly related to the manufacture of controlled substances, and requested consent to search, during an unlawful extension of a traffic stop; officer requested consent to patdown and further search from defendant Kirkeby after traffic stop should have concluded); <em>State v. Thompkin, </em>341 Or 368, 378-79, 143 P3d 530 (2006) (officers unlawfully seized the defendant, who was a passenger in a stopped car, when they requested and retained her identification to run a warrants check and questioned her about illegal activity); <em>State v. Toevs, </em>327 Or 525, 537, 964 P2d 1007 (1998) (officer questioned the defendant about drugs during an unlawfully extended traffic stop); <em>State v. Dominguez-Martinez, </em>321 Or 206, 208-09, 895 P2d 306 (1995) (similar). Second, <em>Rodgers/ Kirkeby </em>and <em>Thompkin </em>involved coercive circumstances beyond the types of discomfort or inconvenience that may often accompany an unadorned traffic stop. <em>See Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 626-28 (discussing officers\u2019 \u201cshow of authority\u201d); <em>Thompkin, </em>341 Or at 378-79 (explaining circumstances that amounted to seizure of the defendant).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case does not involve analogous circumstances. Hulke was not conducting the sort of criminal investigation that is aimed at revealing inculpatory evidence (like weapons, drugs, or other contraband) when he simply asked defendant for his identification in conjunction with a traffic stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Moreover, no other potentially coercive circumstances were present \u2014 for example, before requesting defendant\u2019s identification, Hulke had not asked him about contraband or sought consent to search defendant or his vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The majority also rejects my reliance on Crandall\u2014 and my ultimate determination that defendant\u2019s choice to lie was an intervening circumstance that attenuated discovery of the falsehood from the illegality of the stop \u2014 asserting that application of my analysis would lead to the admissibility of <em>all </em>statements that defendants made in response to police questioning during an unlawful traffic stop. <em>Suppah, </em>264 Or App at 530. With respect, I disagree. Questions of the type identified by the majority \u2014 like a request for consent to search \u2014 often are aimed (unless they are asked for officer-safety reasons) at uncovering possible criminal activity. Thus, an officer who asks such questions during the course of an unlawful (or unlawfully extended) traffic stop, and gains inculpatory evidence as a result, frequently may be said to have <em>traded on </em>the <em>stop </em>\u2014 i.e., exploited the unlawful stop \u2014 to conduct a criminal investigation. In such circumstances, the officer\u2019s discovery of the evidence is not attenuated from the illegality. But attenuation does exist when, as here, a police officer simply asks a driver for identification during the course of a stop and, as a result, obtains evidence of a <em>newly committed </em>crime (giving false information to a police officer) and not evidence of a crime that the defendant already had committed before the questioning ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>In short, defendant voluntarily committed a new crime when he gave Hulke a false name after the unlawful traffic stop. In my view, that new crime was an intervening circumstance that attenuated the causal connection between the unlawfulness of the stop and the newly created evidence (the giving of the false name) that defendant sought to suppress. Accordingly, I would hold that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-4\">Haselton, C. J., and Wollheim, Ortega, and DeVore, JJ., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> Defendant was acquitted of driving while suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\"> Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\"> In <em>State v. Bentz, </em>211 Or App 129, 134, 158 P3d 1081 (2007), we held that a police officer\u2019s act of \u201casking a person\u2019s name constitutes exploitation if the question causes the person to give information that leads the police to evidence.\u201d <em>Bentz </em>does not control here because Hulke\u2019s request for defendant\u2019s name did not cause defendant to give information that led Hulke to discover evidence that already existed. Rather, by giving a false name in response, defendant voluntarily and unilaterally committed a <em>new </em>crime and created <em>new </em>evidence that otherwise would not have existed. Consequently, Hulke\u2019s discovery of that evidence was sufficiently attenuated from the illegality so as not to warrant suppression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\"> In <em>Toevs and Dominguez-Martinez, </em>the Supreme Court held that, under then-existent statutes that subsequently were amended, evidence obtained during an unlawfully extended stop <em>necessarily </em>had to be suppressed. 327 Or at 537-38; 321 Or at 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> The majority also cites <em>State v. Starr, </em>91 Or App 267, 754 P2d 618 (1988), and <em>State v. Farley, </em>308 Or 91, 775 P2d 835 (1989). I find those <em>pre-Hall </em>(indeed, pre-Rodriguez) cases unhelpful to the analysis. In <em>Starr, </em>this court stated with little explanation that a trial court properly suppressed evidence of a stopped driver\u2019s identification because the \u201cdefendant\u2019s identity was obtained as a result of the unlawful stop.\u201d 91 Or App at 270. That holding has little persistent significance, as it preceded the <em>Hall </em>distinction between a mere \u201cbut for\u201d link between an officer\u2019s unlawful conduct and subsequently obtained evidence (which would not result in suppression) and an unattenuated exploitative link (which would result in suppression), and includes no similar analysis. And in <em>Farley, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis focused on its determination that, under ORS 810.410(3), a police officer \u201chad no statutory authority\u201d to ask a lawfully stopped driver for his license once the justification for the stop had ended. 308 Or at 94. The court went on to hold that the trial court had correctly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence that the officer obtained as a result of obtaining the defendant\u2019s license, but the court did so without engaging in any sort of exploitation analysis like the one later announced in <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Hall.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
