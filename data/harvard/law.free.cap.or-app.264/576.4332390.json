He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of giving false information to a peace officer. Defendant argues that, because the evidence presented at trial establishes that the officer did not request defendant\u2019s information for the purpose of arresting him on a warrant, as required for a conviction under ORS 162.385(l)(b), he had to be acquitted of that charge. <em>See State v. Moresco, </em>250 Or App 405, 408, 281 P3d 263 (2012) (\u201cORS 162.385(l)(b) requires that an officer request the defendant\u2019s identification for the purpose of <em>arresting </em>the defendant on a warrant, not merely for the purpose of ascertaining whether a warrant exists.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>State v. Allen, </em>222 Or App 71, 77, 191 P3d 762, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008) (same). The state contends that defendant did not preserve the claimed error on that charge; that the error is not susceptible to review as plain error; and, if it is, that we should not exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We agree with defendant that the trial court erred and that the error is plain: At trial, the officer unequivocally testified that he requested defendant\u2019s information in order to check for outstanding warrants. As in <em>Moresco, </em>that request cannot have simultaneously been made for the purpose of arresting defendant on a warrant; accordingly, the state failed to present evidence sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction. And, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>250 Or App 516, 522-27, 280 P3d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 666 (2012), we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Conviction on Count 2 for giving false information to a peace officer reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
