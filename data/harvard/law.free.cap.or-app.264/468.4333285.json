(Sideco), American Family\u2019s insured. The trial court agreed with FountainCourt, and American Family appeals the resulting supplemental judgment \u2014 which awarded FountainCourt $433,958.16 against American Family \u2014 and a subsequent supplemental judgment that awarded FountainCourt $68,538 in attorney fees. We conclude that the trial court did not err in entering a judgment against American Family for the unpaid amount of FountainCourt\u2019s judgment against Sideco, but that it did err in awarding FountainCourt its attorney fees. Accordingly, we affirm the supplemental judgment resolving the garnishment proceeding and reverse the attorney-fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The pertinent background facts are not in dispute. The case arises out of the construction of a housing development in Beaverton (the project), which consists of 34 condominium units and 63 townhouse units in 11 two- and three-story buildings. The buildings were constructed in stages between September 2002 and July 2004, with each having a different date of substantial completion as reflected in a certificate of occupancy. In 2007, FountainCourt brought this action against the developers and the general contractor, alleging various claims related to defects and deficiencies in the development and construction of the project. FountainCourt filed a second amended complaint in the action in August 2009, asserting direct negligence claims against several subcontractors that had performed work on the project, including Sideco.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>As to Sideco, FountainCourt alleged that Sideco had \u201cprovided labor and certain materials generally involving installation of exterior siding, weather-resistant barriers, windows, and related caulking and flashing for the FountainCourt buildings,\u201d and had breached its duty of care to FountainCourt in performing its work \u201cwith the [d]efects and deficiences set forth in paragraphs 17-20\u201d of the second amended complaint. Paragraphs 17 to 20, in turn, alleged \u201csubstantial water intrusion\u201d to the FountainCourt buildings causing extensive physical damage as a result of faulty workmanship; use of unsuitable or defective materials; improper installation; noncompliance with the approved construction plans; and failure to comply with applicable building codes, industry standards, and manufacturers\u2019 installation requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">American Family issued commercial general-liability insurance to Sideco from May 1, 2004, through May 1, 2006, with policy limits of $1 million per occurrence and an aggregate of $2 million for products-completed operations. Section I 1. of the insurance policy, titled \u201cInsuring Agreement,\u201d provides, in part:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">\u201ca. [American Family] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.

The cost of Sideco\u2019s defense was shared with Clarendon Insurance Company, which had issued an insurance policy to Sideco for the period April 15, 2003, to May 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">FountainCourt\u2019s claim against Sideco proceeded to a jury trial on a single theory: negligence causing physical property damage. Specifically, FountainCourt asked the jury to award it $3,831,635 in damages, based on a repair estimate prepared by Charter Construction. The court instructed the jury, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">\u201cPlaintiffs [that is, FountainCourt] must allege and prove physical damage to their property. * * * The plaintiffs must prove damages by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">\u201cIf you find the plaintiffs are entitled to damages, you should \u2014 or shall determine the amount of physical damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to plaintiffs\u2019 real property, if any, that was caused by the defendants\u2019 fault or negligence. The measure of damages for partial destruction of real property is the reasonable cost of repairing the damaged property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The jury was not asked to segregate damages by type, building, or date.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The jury returned a verdict finding that Sideco was negligent \u201cin one or more of the ways claimed\u201d and that that negligence was a cause of damage to FountainCourt. It found that FountainCourt\u2019s damages were $2,145,156 and that Sideco was 22.65 percent at fault. Accordingly, on April 16, 2010, the trial court entered a judgment against Sideco in the amount of $485,877.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On April 28, 2010, FountainCourt mailed a writ of garnishment to American Family, as an insurer of Sideco, for the amount of the judgment that FountainCourt had recovered against Sideco \u2014 the \u201cgarnishable property\u201d being the liability-insurance benefits that American Family allegedly owed to Sideco as a result of the judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 18.352.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> American Family\u2019s response indicated that it held no property belonging to Sideco and denied owing any debt to Sideco.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On July 27, 2010, FountainCourt moved for an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered against American Family on the writ of garnishment; it requested a hearing to determine whether American Family should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>be held liable under ORS 18.775 for the amount necessary to satisfy the garnishment, \u201calong with an award of costs.\u201d American Family (and the other garnishees, see 264 Or App at 475 n 3) moved that the \u201cmatter be set on the normal trial docket.\u201d The trial court allowed FountainCourt\u2019s motion and set the case for a show-cause hearing pursuant to ORS 18.778 and ORS 18.782.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\">FountainCourt then filed allegations pursuant to ORS 18.780, alleging that American Family was obligated under the terms of Sideco\u2019s policy to pay the judgment that FountainCourt had recovered against Sideco.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, it alleged, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">\u201cThe [American Family] Insurance Policies provide coverage for sums that [Sideco] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage. [Sideco] became legally obligated under the General Judgment to pay damages to [FountainCourt] because of property damage. Property damage constituted the cause of action on which the General Judgment was entered against [Sideco] in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In the prayer-for-relief section of the document, FountainCourt requested judgment in an amount not less than $485,877.84 plus \u201ccosts and disbursements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">American Family answered and asserted several affirmative defenses, including that it was not obligated to pay the damages because some or all of them \u201cdid not arise from \u2018property damage\u2019\u201d or \u201cresult from an \u2018occurrence,\u2019\u201d and, to the extent that they did, some or all of them \u201cresulted before or after the pertinent policy term\u201d or were subject to one or more policy exclusions. It also asserted a counterclaim for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to pay the damages awarded in the judgment against Sideco or, alternatively, a declaration of the amount payable, and requesting its \u201ccosts and disbursements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">After limited discovery, the trial court held a hearing under ORS 18.782 on October 29 and November 2, 2010. It subsequently entered an order \u201cfinding]\u201d that FountainCourt had \u201cmet [its] prima facie burden of proving coverage under the policies of insurance issued by American Family and Clarendon\u201d and holding that \u201cthe burden of proof is on American Family and Clarendon to prove what portions, if any, of the judgments entered against Sideco, Inc. are excluded by the policies of insurance they issued to Sideco, Inc.\u201d Then, as to American Family, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that American Family is unable to meet its burden of proving that any portion of the damages awarded against Sideco, Inc. for property damage caused to the FountainCourt buildings is not covered by the policies of insurance it issued to Sideco, Inc., by reason of any exclusion in said policies. Further, American Family is unable to show whether or how the jury apportioned damages among the FountainCourt buildings; accordingly its Multi-Unit Exclusion is inapplicable to this case and American Family is liable for the entire amount of the unsatisfied judgments entered against Sideco, Inc., which, as of October 29, 2010, totaled $433.958.16.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Based on that ruling, the court dismissed American Family\u2019s counterclaim for declaratory relief and directed FountainCourt to file a motion under ORCP 68 in support of its request for attorney fees and costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court subsequently entered a supplemental judgment against American Family for $433,958.16, \u201ctogether with such amount of [FountainCourt\u2019s] attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and disbursements, as may be determined pursuant to ORCP 68.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\">Before the court entered the supplemental judgment, FountainCourt filed an ORCP 68 motion and petition for attorney fees and costs, asserting an entitlement to attorney fees under ORS 742.061.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It reasserted that motion, along with supporting records as to the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded, after the court entered the supplemental judgment. American Family opposed the motion, arguing that ORS 742.061 is inapplicable in a garnishment proceeding and, in all events, that FountainCourt had failed to allege an entitlement to attorney fees under that statute in its \u201cdispositive motion\u201d \u2014 the motion for an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">After a hearing, the trial court issued a letter opinion concluding that FountainCourt was entitled to recover its attorney fees. The court reasoned that FountainCourt \u201ccould have believed [that it was] not required to separately plead both \u2018costs\u2019 and \u2018attorney fees\u2019 due to ORS 742.061,\u201d FountainCourt specifically mentioned attorney fees in \u201csubsequent paperwork,\u201d and,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cat no time did [American Family] object to the inclusion of attorney fees being the same as costs until after the trial had concluded. In fact, at the hearing [American Family] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>alluded to purposely waiting until after the trial to object apparently so [FountainCourt] could not move to amend its original motion. No party should benefit from waiting in the woods to ambush.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">(Citation omitted.) The court gave FountainCourt leave to amend its show-cause motion to include a claim for attorney fees, which FountainCourt did on April 4, 2011. The court then entered a supplemental judgment awarding FountainCourt attorney fees in the amount of $68,538, along with costs and disbursements. American Family appeals both judgments. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">A. <em>Garnishment Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In challenging the supplemental judgment in the garnishment proceeding, American Family asserts three assignments of error: (1) the court erred in \u201cconcluding] that American Family held garnishable property of Sideco, and den [ying] American Family\u2019s request to be released from the Writ of Garnishment\u201d; (2) the court\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that FountainCourt had met its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving coverage under the policy is not supported by evidence in the record; and (3) the court erred in denying American Family\u2019s request for a jury trial. American Family focuses primarily on the first of those assignments, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">At a garnishment hearing, the issue is whether the garnishee holds garnishable property of the debtor. ORS 18.778(1); ORS 18.775. The garnishor, here FountainCourt, stands in the shoes of the judgment debtor, here Sideco. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. v. Reuter, </em>299 Or 155, 164, 166, 700 P2d 236 (1985) (\u201cA garnishment gives the judgment creditor plaintiff no greater rights against the garnishee than the judgment debtor defendant has.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As noted earlier, under ORS 18.782, \u201c[t]he proceedings against a garnishee [are] tried by the court as upon the trial of an issue of law between a plaintiff and defendant.\u201d Thus, the trial court in this case was required to determine whether American Family was obligated, by reason of its insurance policy with Sideco, to pay the damages that FountainCourt had recovered against Sideco. That, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>turn, required FountainCourt to prove that the judgment represented damages that came within the insuring agreement of the American Family policy (the <em>prima facie </em>case for coverage), at which point the burden shifted to American Family to prove, if it could, that an exclusion in the insurance policy applied. <em>See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty Ins., </em>349 Or 117, 127, 241 P3d 710 (2010), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>349 Or 657, 249 P3d 111 (2011) (insured has the burden to prove coverage, while the insurer has the burden to prove an exclusion from coverage) (citing <em>Lewis v. Aetna Insurance Co., </em>264 Or 314, 316, 505 P2d 914 (1973), and <em>Stanford v. American Guaranty Life Ins. Co., </em>280 Or 525, 527, 571 P2d 909 (1977)); <em>Employers Insurance of Wausau v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>211 Or App 485, 509, 156 P3d 105, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 363 (2007) (same); <em>see also Bridal Veil L. Co. v. Pacific Coast C. Co., </em>75 Or 57, 61-62, 145 P 671 (1915) <em>(Bridal Veil) </em>(\u201cWhere a policy of insurance covers certain general risks, and in a separate clause of the policy excepts losses resulting from certain causes or under certain circumstances, the burden is on the insurer to allege and prove that the loss was one excepted from the general risk covered by the policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\">We do not understand American Family to dispute that that is the applicable standard. Rather, American Family contends that FountainCourt failed <em>to satisfy </em>its burden of proving coverage in either of two ways: (1) it did not show that the judgment awarded compensation <em>only </em>for \u201cproperty damage\u201d as provided in the insuring agreement; or (2) it did not show that the judgment was for property damage that occurred solely during the American Family policy period- \u2014 that is, while American Family was \u201con the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">1. <em>Property Damage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">American Family argues that (1) the jury was permitted to award the costs required to repair Sideco\u2019s own \u201cfaulty work\u201d; (2) which is not \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy; (3) therefore, the verdict (and resulting judgment) <em>could </em>include compensation for damage that is not within the insuring agreement; and (4) consequently, FountainCourt failed to meet its <em>prima facie </em>burden in the garnishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>proceeding. It contends that <em>\u201cphysical </em>damage,\u201d for which the jury was instructed that it could award compensation, does not equate with <em>\u201cproperty </em>damage,\u201d as used in the insuring agreement. (Emphases added.) In American Family\u2019s view, that discrepancy \u2014 together with the fact that FountainCourt included in its repair estimate the cost of repairing the water damage caused by Sideco\u2019s negligence, <em>as well as </em>the cost of repairing Sideco\u2019s own faulty work\u2014 allowed the jury to award compensation for damages that did not involve \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy. Said another way, it is American Family\u2019s position that the verdict <em>could </em>have included the cost to repair Sideco\u2019s faulty work, rather than only the cost to repair the resulting property damage, which is not \u201cdamages because of * * * \u2018property damage,\u201d\u2019 as used in the insuring agreement. Thus, FountainCourt did not satisfy its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving coverage. American Family summarizes its argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201cIn this case, [FountainCourt] asked the jury to award some damages that were within Sideco\u2019s insuring agreement, and some that were not. Because the jury returned a verdict for less than the prayer, the verdict <em>could </em>include damages that were not within Sideco\u2019s insuring agreement. Under such circumstances, it is error to conclude, as a matter of law, that the verdict only includes damages that are within the insuring agreement. Consequently, the trial court erroneously concluded that [FountainCourt] established a prima facie case for coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">(Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">FountainCourt responds that American Family \u201chad the burden of proving what portion, if any, of the damages awarded by the jury were for damage to Sideco\u2019s own work, as opposed to damage to the work of others,\u201d because \u201cdamage to work of the insured is a policy exclusion.\u201d In its view, it satisfied its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving that the judgment was for \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the insuring agreement because it demonstrated that the jury was instructed that it could award compensation <em>only </em>for physical property damage. And FountainCourt\u2019s expert established that physical damage due to Sideco\u2019s defective work occurred in every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>one of the buildings during each of the policy periods, thus triggering coverage. Moreoever, FountainCourt points out, the evidence at the garnishment hearing establishes that there was sufficient consequential damage to components other than Sideco\u2019s own work to constitute the entirety of the damages awarded against Sideco. Thus, the trial court correctly determined that FountainCourt had met its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving coverage under the policy. We agree with FountainCourt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">The interpretation of an insurance contract presents a legal question; the objective is to ascertain the intention of the parties \u201cbased on the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-71, 836 P2d 703 (1992) (setting forth analytical framework for interpreting insurance policies). We interpret insurance policies to give effect to every provision. <em>Cain Petroleum Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co., </em>224 Or App 235, 242, 197 P3d 596 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 115 (2009) (\u201c [I]f a proposed interpretation would require us to disregard any provision of the policy, it is not reasonable, as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>ZRZ Realty </em>is instructive. There, the court considered whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cthe requirement [for coverage under the applicable insurance policies] that any damage to the environr. &gt;.ent be neither intended nor expected is part of a limited grant of coverage [\u2022 \u2014 that is, coverage only for unexpected and unintended losses \u2014 ]to which the insured would have to prove entitlement or an exclusion from a broad grant of coverage for which the insurer would have to prove justification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">349 Or at 127. The court held that the way the parties chose to structure their insurance agreements was significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Thus, with respect to the express-fortuity policies that were among the policies at issue in <em>ZRZ Realty, </em>because the parties had chosen to provide coverage only for unexpected and unintended damages, and did <em>not </em>list expected or intended damages as an exclusion, \u201cthe burden [was] on the <em>insured </em>to prove that the event that triggered the loss came within the scope of that coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>added). In contrast, the implied-fortuity policies at issue in the case contained a \u201cbroad grant of coverage without any requirement that the damages be unexpected and unintended,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 132 \u2014 covering, for example, \u2018\u201c[a]ny and all liability imposed by law,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>at 133 (alteration in <em>ZRZ Realty). </em>Nonetheless, the trial court had read into that broad coverage a \u201cpublic policy\u201d limitation that the damages giving rise to the insured\u2019s liability \u201cbe neither expected nor intended,\u201d which it was the insured\u2019s burden to prove. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that such a limitation is properly understood as \u201can exclusion from a broad grant of coverage rather than as a grant of limited coverage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 134; thus, with respect to the implied-fortuity policies, the court concluded that the <em>insurer </em>bore the burden of proving that the damages were expected or intended. <em>Id. </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">As the Supreme Court explained, although both types of policies insured against the same risk,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201c[w]e must classify the limitation one way or another, and we conclude that respecting the parties\u2019 choice is the more appropriate method. Not only does it permit the parties to structure their agreements in a way that allocates the burden of proof, but it also avoids putting courts in the difficult position of divining the \u2018essence\u2019 of contractual provisions that logically may serve either as a grant of limited coverage or an exclusion from a broad grant of coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Here, the insuring agreement provides that American Family \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies.\u201d \u201c\u2018Property damage\u2019\u201d is defined to mean \u201c[p]hysical injury to tangible property.\u201d The policy then provides a list of exclusions, including an explicit exclusion for \u2018\u201c[p]roperty [d]amage\u2019 to \u2018your work\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019\u201d Thus, the parties chose to structure their agreement as a broad grant of coverage, subject to a list of exclusions, including an exclusion for \u201cDamage to Your Work.\u201d Giving effect to every provision in the policy, <em>Cain Petroleum Inc., </em>224 Or App at 242, we reject the idea that the \u201cyour work\u201d distinction is, as American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Family urges, one inherent in the definition of \u201cproperty damage,\u201d rather than an exclusion under the policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">We also agree with FountainCourt that it met its burden to prove that the judgment reflected \u201cdamages because of*** \u2018property damage,\u2019\u201d as used in the insuring agreement. The case went to the jury on the sole theory of negligence causing <em>physical property damage. See Harris v. Suniga, </em>344 Or 301, 180 P3d 12 (2008) (nonprivity property owners\u2019 claim for physical damage to real property could provide the basis for a negligence action, rather than a purely economic loss for which recovery is not permitted in the absence of a special relationship).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As detailed above, FountainCourt\u2019s complaint alleged extensive physical injury to tangible property throughout the project. The trial court instructed the jury that FountainCourt \u201cmust allege and prove <em>physical damage to </em>[\u00bfis] property,\u201d and that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201c [i] f you find [that FountainCourt is] entitled to damages, you * * * shall determine <em>the amount of physical damage to </em>[.FountainCourt\u2019s] <em>real property, if any, that was caused by the defendants\u2019fault or negligence. </em>The measure of damages for partial destruction of real property is the reasonable cost of repairing the damaged property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">(Emphasis added.) FountainCourt\u2019s counsel explained to the jury, in part, \u201cWe know there\u2019s damaged property, and you have to determine what is the reasonable cost. *** What does the damaged property consist of? It consists of these components that were damaged by water intrusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Jeff Forell, FountainCourt\u2019s expert who had inspected the buildings, testified at the garnishment hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>there was physical damage, due to Sideco\u2019s defective work, to underlying materials in all of the FountainCourt buildings. He explained that he had provided to the jury an allocation, by subcontractor, of the total repair estimate; that Sideco\u2019s allocation was approximately $1.5 million; and that all of the $485,000 awarded by the jury could have been to repair that resulting damage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cQ. *** Could all have [sic] the $485,000 that was awarded by the jury against Sideco have been awarded for consequential damage, resulting damage, as opposed to damage to Sideco\u2019s own work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cA. Yes, it could have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cQ. All right. I mean, given the $1.5 million allocation to Sideco, do you agree that the jury could have found, based on the evidence that you presented, that there was $485,000 worth of damage to other components caused by Sideco\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Given those circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that FountainCourt\u2014 standing in the shoes of Sideco \u2014 had satisfied its <em>prima facie </em>burden to prove that the judgment against Sideco reflects \u201csums that [Sideco] bee [a] me [] legally obligated to pay as damages because of *** \u2018property damage\u2019\u201d to which the insurance applied. The burden then shifted to American Family to prove that any portion of the damages awarded by the jury was not covered by the policy <em>by reason of any exclusion. ZRZ Realty, </em>349 Or at 127. The trial court concluded that American Family had failed to meet that burden, and American Family does not contend otherwise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">2. <em>Timing of Damage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">In a similar vein, American Family argues that, even assuming that the damages awarded by the jury were all for covered property damage, \u201c[b]ecause [FountainCourt] failed to establish that all of the Sideco damages were awarded for \u2018property damage\u2019 that occurred while American Family was on the risk, FountainCourt should take nothing.\u201d American Family concedes that \u201c[s]ome consequential water damage may have occurred while American Family was on the risk.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>However, it contends that, because the insuring agreement, by its terms, applies only to property damage that occurs \u201cduring the policy period\u201d \u2014 a provision that, in its view, \u201coperates as both a trigger of, and limitation on, coverage\u201d\u2014 FountainCourt was required to establish which portion of the damages awarded by the jury occurred during the discrete period of time that American Family was on the risk. According to American Family, because some water damage for which the jury awarded damages necessarily occurred either before or after the American Family policy term, FountainCourt failed to meet its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving coverage under the American Family policy, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\">We disagree. As discussed above, the insuring agreement requires American Family to pay, on Sideco\u2019s behalf, all sums that Sideco is legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage \u201cto which this insurance applies.\u201d It then provides that the insurance \u201capplies\u201d to property damage \u201conly if\u2019 the property damage \u201coccurs during the policy period.\u201d Thus, FountainCourt had the <em>prima facie </em>burden to prove that the judgment awarding damages against Sideco reflected amounts that Sideco was legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage that occurred during American Family\u2019s policy period. We conclude that the trial court did not err in concluding that FountainCourt had satisfied that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">FountainCourt proceeded against Sideco on the theory that Sideco\u2019s work was defective and that those defects were contributing to the infiltration of rain water and consequential water damage to building components. The jury agreed with FountainCourt and found that Sideco\u2019s portion of responsibility for the damage was $485,877.84. FountainCourt could not have prevailed on its claim without proving that Sideco negligently caused damage to FountainCourt\u2019s property. Thus, as a result of the jury\u2019s verdict, Sideco became legally obligated to pay damages because of property damage. At the garnishment hearing, Forell testified that the damage to the buildings from the water intrusion occurred after the construction on each building was completed and that the damage would continue to occur, or progress, until it was repaired. He also testified that every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>building in the project sustained water damage because of defects in Sideco\u2019s work while the American Family policies were in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Thus, given the progressive and continuing nature of the harm alleged by FountainCourt and found by the jury \u2014 water intrusion causing property damage \u2014 the award of damages reflected in the judgment against Sideco could represent an award of damages for property damage \u2014 that is, \u201c[p]hysical injury to tangible property\u201d \u2014 that occurred <em>entirely </em>during the American Family policy period. Stated in the converse, because of the harm alleged \u2014 ongoing and progressive property damage caused by water intrusion resulting from Sideco\u2019s negligence \u2014 and the case that was presented to the jury, there is nothing in the record that would <em>require </em>a conclusion that <em>any </em>portion of the damages awarded by the jury represents damages for repairing property damage that occurred <em>outside </em>of American Family\u2019s policy period. In other words, FountainCourt has established that the judgment was \u201cbased upon evidence which identified it as one within the coverage of the insurer\u2019s obligation,\u201d <em>Jarvis et ux v. Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>227 Or 508, 512, 363 P2d 740 (1961), thus satisfying its <em>prima facie </em>burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">American Family nonetheless reasons that, because the trial court also concluded that FountainCourt had met its <em>prima facie </em>burden of proving coverage under the policies issued by Clarendon \u2014 which had expired before the American Family policy became effective \u2014 the judgment against Sideco <em>necessarily </em>included damage for property damage that occurred during Clarendon\u2019s policy term and, consequently, not while American Family was on the risk. In its view, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s conclusion that American Family owed coverage for the entire judgment against Sideco was legally inconsistent with its conclusion that damages were within Clarendon\u2019s insuring agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Again, we are not persuaded. In the case of continuing and progressive water damage, the award of damages is not tied to discrete instances of property damage along a time continuum; instead the liability for property damage may be the same in every triggered policy period. That is so because the scope of repair \u2014 to replace the damaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>structural components and eliminate the water intrusion\u2014 does not necessarily change depending on the year in which the damage occurred. Accordingly, given the nature of the injury, it is possible that both Clarendon and American Family could be liable for the same damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">In short, we reject American Family\u2019s theory that, in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for coverage in the context of ongoing and progressive property damage, FountainCourt was required to exclude <em>the possibility </em>that the jury\u2019s verdict includes damages for repairing property damage that occurred outside the American Family policy period. Rather, once FountainCourt established that the judgment reflects damages for property damage that occurred during American Family\u2019s policy period, and that all of the damages awarded could have been for property damage sustained during that policy period, FountainCourt satisfied its burden of proving coverage under the insuring agreement, and it fell to American Family to establish that some portion of the damages included in the judgment did <em>not </em>reflect property damage occurring during its policy period.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">3. <em>Issue Preclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">American Family also contends that, even if it could be said that the jury had determined that the entire loss involved property damage to which the insurance applied, those findings are not preclusive in the garnishment action. Citing <em>State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Paget, </em>123 Or App 558, 860 P2d 864 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 36 (1994), American Family argues that its reservation of its right to contest whether the claims against Sideco involved property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>damage that was covered by the insurance policy created a conflict between it and Sideco that precludes Sideco, or its judgment creditor, FountainCourt, from relying on issue preclusion to prove, in the garnishment proceeding, that the entire judgment was within the insuring agreement. On the other hand, relying on Jarvis, 227 Or 508, FountainCourt and <em>amici </em>argue that American Family <em>is </em>bound by the jury determination as to \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We disagree that this case presents a question of issue preclusion. The doctrine of issue preclusion \u201carises in a subsequent proceeding when an issue of ultimate fact has been determined by a valid and final determination in a prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Emerald People\u2019s Utility Dist., </em>318 Or 99, 103, 862 P2d 1293 (1993); <em>see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 27 (1982) (\u201cWhen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties [.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Here, under the terms of its policy, American Family was obligated to pay those sums that Sideco became legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which the policy applied. Sideco, in incurring the judgment against it, became \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d the amount reflected in the judgment. Hence, the question is whether that judgment can be understood as embodying a determination of liability to which the policy applies. In other words, the question is <em>not </em>whether American Family is <em>legally bound </em>by a prior determination but, rather, whether it is bound <em>by its contract </em>to pay the amount reflected in the judgment. In that light, the dispositive question is this: What is the effect of the judgment under the insurance contract in light of the basis on which the case against Sideco was tried? That is a purely legal question; it is <em>not </em>a question of what <em>facts </em>were actually litigated below and whether <em>those facts </em>should be given preclusive effect in the garnishment proceeding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Here, the trial court did not rely on issue preclusion to conclude that \u201cthe entire judgment was within Sideco\u2019s insuring agreement\u201d; rather, it concluded, correctly, that the judgment represented a determination of liability of the type that is subject to American Family\u2019s insurance obligation as a contractual \u2014 not a factual \u2014 matter. As discussed above, that conclusion was correct given \u2014 as demonstrated at the garnishment hearing \u2014 the manner in which the case was presented to the jury, including the pleadings, the proof, and the instructions to the jury. In short, the court did not err in determining that FountainCourt had established a <em>prima facie </em>case that the damages awarded in the judgment included \u201cdamages because of * * * property damage\u201d that came within the American Family insuring agreement, and that American Family had failed to establish that the judgment included damages that American Family was <em>not </em>legally obligated to pay. American Family\u2019s attempt to argue, instead, that the trial court had relied on the judgment as <em>preclusive </em>of the issue is simply inapposite.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\">That reasoning also disposes of American Family\u2019s second and third assignments of error. In its second assignment, American Family contends that the trial court\u2019s \u201cfactual determination\u201d that all of the damages awarded against Sideco were within its insuring agreement is not supported by the evidence in the record. As just discussed, we reject the premise that the court made such a factual determination. <em>See Clark and Clark, </em>171 Or App 205, 210, 14 P3d 667 (2000) (\u201cThe determination of whether the essential elements of a claim have been established \u2014 in other words, whether a <em>prima facie </em>case was made \u2014 is a question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In its third assignment of error, American Family challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of its request for a jury trial. It argues that there was a factual dispute as to what the jury had concluded regarding the timing of consequential water damage to the FountainCourt property \u2014 specifically, it contends that \u201cthere was evidence presented during the garnishment proceeding that would have permitted a jury to find that consequential water damage did not occur while American Family was on the risk.\u201d And, it continues, \u201c[b]ecause a garnishment proceeding against an insurer seeks to adjudicate contractual rights and obligations,\u201d American Family was entitled, under Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution, to a jury trial on any disputed issues of fact. As just discussed, however, the question before the trial court in the garnishment proceeding was not \u2014 as a matter of <em>fact </em>\u2014 whether Sideco had been found liable on a basis for which it has insurance coverage, and in what amount, but, rather, whether the judgment reflects a determination of applicable liability \u2014 that is, because the entry of the judgment triggered American Family\u2019s obligation to pay a covered debt, the court was called upon to determine the import of that judgment under the parties\u2019 contract as a <em>legal </em>matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">For all of those reasons, the trial court did not err in concluding that FountainCourt was entitled to a supplemental judgment of garnishment against American Family.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">B. <em>Judgment for Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In its fourth assignment of error, American Family challenges the supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees to FountainCourt, arguing that FountainCourt was not entitled to a fee award because the statute on which the award is based, ORS 742.061,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> does not apply in a garnishment proceeding, and, even if it does apply, FountainCourt did not properly plead an entitlement to attorney fees as required by ORCP 68 C(2). Reviewing for legal error, <em>Rymer v. </em>Zwingli, 240 Or App 687, 691, 247 P3d 1246, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 716 (2011), we agree with American Family\u2019s second contention; accordingly, we need not determine whether ORS 742.061 applies in this context. In other words, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that, even if ORS 742.061 authorizes an award of attorney fees in a garnishment proceeding \u2014 a question that we expressly do not decide \u2014 FountainCourt was not entitled to an award of fees because it failed to comply with the strictures of ORCP 68 C(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\">ORCP 68 provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">\u201cC(2)(a) Alleging right to attorney fees. A party seeking attorney fees shall allege the facts, statute, or rule that provides a basis for the award of such fees in a pleading filed by that party. Attorney fees may be sought before the substantive right to recover such fees accrues. No attorney fees shall be awarded unless a right to recover such fee is alleged as provided in this subsection or in paragraph C(2)(b) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cC(2)(b) If a party does not file a pleading but instead files a motion or a response to a motion, a right to attorney fees shall be alleged in such motion or response, in similar form to the allegations required in a pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">(Boldface in original.) The rule thus provides that \u201cattorney fees shall not be awarded unless a party alleges the right to those fees in a pleading or motion and identifies a basis for that entitlement.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dry Cleaning To-Your-Door, </em>249 Or App 104, 108, 275 P3d 181 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Here, the parties agree that the dispositive motion for purposes of ORCP 68 C(2)(b) was FountainCourt\u2019s motion for an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered against American Family, which FountainCourt filed on July .27, 2010.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that motion, FountainCourt requested only \u201can award of costs\u201d; it did not allege a right to recover attorney fees under ORS 742.061, as required under ORCP 68 C(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Nonetheless, FountainCourt asserts that its inclusion of a request for \u201ccosts\u201d in the show-cause motion satisfied the requirement that it allege an entitlement to attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>fees because ORS 742.061(1) provides that \u201cattorney fees, if available under that statute, \u2018shall be taxed <em>as part of the costs </em>of the action.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis by FountainCourt.) FountainCourt also asserts that its failure to comply with ORCP 68 C(2) should be excused because \u201cAmerican Family also knew from FountainCourt\u2019s Pre-Hearing Memorandum that FountainCourt was requesting attorney fees pursuant to ORS 742.061.\u201d We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">First, FountainCourt did not mention ORS 742.061 in its motion; thus, even if it could be sufficient to consider a request for attorney fees to be encompassed in the request for an award of costs because of the particular treatment of the subject in the authorizing statute \u2014 a dubious proposition \u2014 without some reference to <em>that statute, </em>nothing in the motion would have given American Family notice that FountainCourt intended to recover attorney fees under the statute. An allegation of an entitlement to an award of costs, without more, is <em>not </em>an allegation of an entitlement to an award of attorney fees. <em>See Lumbermen\u2019s v. Dakota Ventures, </em>157 Or App 370, 375, 971 P2d 430 (1998) (purpose of ORCP 68 C(2) is to ensure that opponents are given adequate notice of a party\u2019s intention to seek attorney fees); <em>see also </em>ORCP 68 (addressing allowance of costs and disbursements separately from requirement to allege right to attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court has made clear that ORCP 68 C(2)\u2019s requirement to allege the right to attorney fees in the motion (or pleading) is mandatory. <em>Mulier v. Johnson, </em>332 Or 344, 350, 29 P3d 1104 (2001). In <em>Mulier, </em>the Supreme Court reversed our decision, in which we had held that the defendant\u2019s failure to allege its right to attorney fees in its motion for summary judgment, as required by ORCP 68 C(2)(b), was \u201cimmaterial\u201d because the defendant did assert such an entitlement in its concurrently filed memorandum in support of summary judgment, and plaintiff was therefore not prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 348 (describing our opinion <em>in Mulier v. Johnson, </em>163 Or App 42, 47, 986 P2d 742 (1999)). The court held that a memorandum is not a motion and, consequently, that the defendant\u2019s request for attorney fees did not satisfy the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 351; <em>cf. Anderson, </em>249 Or App at 109 (relying on <em>Mulier </em>to reject the plaintiffs attempt to assert an entitlement to attorney fees for the first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>in a proposed form of judgment). Hence, FountainCourt\u2019s reference in its prehearing memorandum to its request to recover attorney fees cannot overcome its failure to allege in its show-cause motion a right to recover attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">FountainCourt next argues that the trial court correctly allowed it to amend its show-cause motion to allege a right to recover attorney fees after the court had entered a judgment on the merits in the garnishment proceeding. To recap the timing of the relevant events: (1) FountainCourt filed its motion to show cause why judgment should not be entered against American Family in the garnishment proceeding \u2014 which did <em>not </em>include a request for attorney fees under ORS 742.061 \u2014 on July 27, 2010. (2) On December 20, 2010, the court entered a supplemental judgment on the merits in the proceeding. (3) On March 1, 2011, the court gave FountainCourt leave to amend its original show-cause motion to allege a right to recover attorney fees. (4) On April 4, 2011, FountainCourt filed an amended show-cause motion requesting attorney fees under ORS 742.061. (5) On the same date, April 4, 2011, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment awarding FountainCourt its attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">FountainCourt contends that the trial court\u2019s order allowing it to amend its show-cause motion after the entry of the supplemental judgment in the garnishment proceeding was proper under ORCP 23 B, and, therefore, any defect in not adequately alleging an entitlement to fees was \u201ccured\u201d by its filing of the amended motion. We disagree. ORCP 23 B allows post-judgment amendment of the pleadings \u201cas may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence\u201d and, hence, to raise \u201cissues not raised by the pleadings [but] tried by express or implied consent of the parties.\u201d It does not, on its face, allow the amendment of a pleading <em>to create </em>an issue to be tried <em>after </em>the entry of the applicable judgment. <em>Cf. Benj. Franklin Fed. Savings and Loan v. Phillips, </em>88 Or App 354, 357, 745 P2d 437 (1987) (allowing amendment of pleading under ORCP 23 A to assert entitlement to attorney fees under ORCP 68 C where the amendment is allowed before entry of final judgment). Nor does ORCP 23 B say anything about amending a <em>motion. See </em>ORCP 13 A (\u201cThe pleadings are the written statements by the parties of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>facts constituting their respective claims and defenses.\u201d); ORCP 13 B (identifying kinds of pleadings allowed under the rules); ORCP 68 C(2)(b) (party that does not file a pleading is required to allege right to attorney fees in motion or response \u201cin similar form to the allegations required in a pleading\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to FountainCourt.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court did not err in entering a judgment against American Family for the unpaid amount of FountainCourt\u2019s judgment against Sideco, but that it did err in awarding attorney fees to FountainCourt.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Supplemental judgment for garnishment against American Family Mutual Insurance Company affirmed. Supplemental judgment against American Family Mutual Insurance Company for attorney fees, costs, and disbursements reversed as to award of attorney fees; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> Although \u201cFountainCourt\u201d thus encompasses two entities \u2014 the homeowners\u2019 association and the condominium owners\u2019 association \u2014 for purposes of readability, we refer to it in the singular throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> To aid in readability, our quotation of the relevant policy provisions retains the boldface formatting used in the original.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> FountainCourt also issued garnishment writs to two other insurers that had issued commercial general-liability policies to Sideco: Maryland Casualty Company (policy period April 15, 2002, through April 15, 2003), and Clarendon Insurance Company (policy period April 15, 2003, through May 15, 2004). FountainCourt\u2019s claims against Maryland Casualty were settled and subsequently dismissed. As noted below, the trial court found in favor of Clarendon in the garnishment proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> ORS 18.352 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">\u201cWhenever a judgment debtor has a policy of insurance covering liability, or indemnity for any injury or damage to person or property, which injury or damage constituted the cause of action in which the judgment was rendered, the amount covered by the policy of insurance shall be subject to attachment upon the execution issued upon the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-11\"><em>See also State Farm Fire and Cas. v.

The issues before the courts in those cases are not analogous, and, as discussed, the Supreme Court has recently clarified that the allocation of the burden of proof is governed by the way in which the parties have chosen to structure their agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> Under the economic-loss doctrine, \u201cone ordinarily is not liable for negligently causing a stranger\u2019s purely economic loss without injuring his person or property\u201d; rather, \u201c[s]ome source of duty outside the common law of negligence is required.\u201d <em>Hale v. Groce, </em>304 Or 281, 284, 744 P2d 1289 (1987) (citations omitted). Thus, physical damage to real property was the only viable theory of negligence available to FountainCourt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> FountainCourt and <em>amici </em>(Associated General Contractors of America, Oregon-Columbia Chapter; Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Associated Builders and Contractors Inc.; Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Portland; Professional Remodelers Organization of the HBA of Metro Portland; and Independent Electrical Contractors of Oregon, Inc.) argue that, under <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter Creosoting, </em>324 Or 184, 923 P2d 1200 (1996), and <em>Cascade Corp. v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>206 Or App 1, 135 P3d 450 (2006), <em>rev dismissed, </em>342 Or 645 (2007), Oregon has essentially adopted an \u201call sums\u201d approach, by which, simply stated, once a policy is triggered under the insuring agreement, \u201cany one insurer whose policy is thus triggered has a duty *** to make its insured whole, absent an applicable exclusion, up to available policy limits.\u201d In light of our analysis and disposition, we need not reach that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> To reiterate, the issue in the garnishment proceeding was <em>not </em>whether there was a factual basis for FountainCourt <em>to obtain a judgment against </em>Sideco for which American Family <em>would be liable </em>under its insurance policy and, hence, whether the judgment that FountainCourt had obtained against Sideco <em>should </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>be given </em>preclusive effect in the garnishment proceeding with regard to those facts. Rather, the issue in the garnishment proceeding was whether there <em>is </em>a judgment against Sideco that American Family <em>is </em>required to pay under its insurance policy. In resolving the latter issue, the trial court considered the facts of the underlying case and trial to determine whether <em>the judgment </em>embodied a payment obligation that came within the insuring agreement. However, in doing that, the court was <em>not </em>required to resolve <em>any </em>of the facts that were at issue in the underlying case. It was required, instead, to determine how, in light of the trial in the underlying case, those factual issues had been resolved through entry of <em>the judgment.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b510-5\"> To be clear: Our point is not that FountainCourt\u2019s claim for garnishment is not part of the same \u201cproceeding\u201d as the earlier litigation (we express no opinion on that point); it is that the issues are not the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> The pertinent text of ORS 742.061 is set out at 264 Or App at 478 n 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> We accept that agreement but note that, under ORS 18.780, FountainCourt filed allegations and American Family filed an answer that framed the issues to be tried in the garnishment proceeding. The parties do not address, and we do not consider, the relationship between those allegations and the pleading requirement in ORCP 68 C(2). As it is, the cost allegations in the garnishment proceeding and the original show-cause motion are the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
