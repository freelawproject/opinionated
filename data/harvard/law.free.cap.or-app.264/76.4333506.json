J.</author>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Mother appeals a juvenile court judgment asserting jurisdiction over her daughter, E, pursuant to ORS 419B.100(l)(c). On appeal, mother contends that the court erred in asserting jurisdiction based on its determination that mother\u2019s substance abuse interferes with her ability to safely parent E. In particular, she contends that the Department of Human Services (DHS) failed to satisfy its burden to show that mother\u2019s substance abuse persisted at the time of the jurisdictional hearing and, alternatively, that the evidence failed to establish that any substance abuse persisted to an extent and degree likely to lead to a serious threat of loss or injury to E. We agree with mother, and reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Neither of the parties request <em>de novo </em>review, and we decline to exercise our discretion to conduct such review in this case. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (stating that we exercise <em>de novo </em>review only in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases). Accordingly, we \u201cview the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d De<em>pt. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013). In doing so, we \u201c(1) assume the correctness of the juvenile court\u2019s explicit findings of historical fact if th[ose] findings are supported by any evidence in the record; (2) further assume that, if the juvenile court did not explicitly resolve a disputed issue of material fact * * * the court implicitly resolved the issue consistently with that disposition; and (3) assess whether the combination of (1) and (2), along with nonspeculative inferences, was legally sufficient\u201d to permit the court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 639-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In May 2013, when E was one month old, DHS petitioned for jurisdiction over her, asserting the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cA. [M] other tested positive for controlled substances while pregnant, and *** mother\u2019s substance abuse interferes with her ability to safely parent the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cB. [M] other is aware that the father is a convicted sex offender who has failed to engage in treatment. [M] other has failed to recognize the threat that the father poses towards the child and she has failed to act protectively on the child\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cC. [M] other\u2019s criminal activities interfere with her ability to safely parent the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cD. [F]ather\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">\u201cE. [F]ather is a convicted sex offender who has failed to complete treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u201cF. [F] ather\u2019s mental health interferes with his ability to safely parent the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">At the close of the jurisdictional hearing, the court concluded that DHS had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that father\u2019s and mother\u2019s substance abuse interfered with their ability to safely parent E, and made E a ward of the court. Notably, the court concluded that DHS had failed to prove that the other allegations presented a current risk of harm to E, and dismissed those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">Given the court\u2019s disposition and the issue on appeal, we limit our discussion of the facts to those related to mother\u2019s substance abuse, except where necessary to provide additional context. Mother tested positive for amphetamine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in February 2013 at a prenatal medical appointment. Two months later \u2014 four days before E\u2019s birth \u2014 mother tested positive for THC. E was born prematurely on April 10, 2013. There was no evidence that mother\u2019s drug use contributed to E\u2019s premature birth, and E did not test positive for any illicit substances at birth. E spent her first five weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). DHS became involved with the family upon E\u2019s birth, based on father\u2019s status as an untreated sex offender and concerns about the parents\u2019 substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">DHS and mother agreed to a safety plan in which E, upon discharge from the NICU, would reside with E\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>great-grandmother, Parker, and have no contact with father. Mother agreed to a \u201cdrug and alcohol screen,\u201d but denied any drug use to DHS. At DHS\u2019s request, mother completed a urinalysis (UA) on April 17 and again on April 25 while E was in the NICU. Both UAs were negative for illegal drug use. E was discharged from the hospital on May 2, and, on May 13, mother failed to show up at a UA requested by DHS. On May 14, mother asked her DHS caseworker for permission to move with Parker and E to Alaska, where Parker permanently resided. The caseworker informed mother that DHS intended to file a petition to make E a ward of the court and that mother could not leave Oregon with E.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">On May 15, the caseworker went to mother\u2019s home to serve a summons and was informed that mother had moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, with E and Parker. DHS filed the petition for jurisdiction on May 17, and, on May 20, at a shelter hearing, the juvenile court awarded temporary custody of E to DHS and issued a \u201cpickup warrant\u201d to return E to Oregon. Mother and E were returned to Oregon, and DHS took E into protective custody on June 21, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">At the jurisdictional hearing on August 19, 2013, DHS adduced evidence to support the facts described above. Further, DHS established that mother had not engaged in any type of drug and alcohol treatment and that mother acknowledged that she had used marijuana during her pregnancy for morning sickness, even though she did not have a prescription. Mother also acknowledged that four years before the jurisdictional hearing she had used heroin for about a year. Mother denied ever using methamphetamine and was unable to explain her February 2013 positive UA for amphetamine. She also denied any \u201ccurrent\u201d drug use at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. Mother testified that she did not believe that father posed a risk of harm to E as an untreated sex offender because he was \u201cnot a predator\u201d and the nature of his crime of third-degree rape \u2014 father, at age 20, engaged in a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old \u2014 did not present a risk of harm to E. Nevertheless, mother claimed that she left for Alaska because of father\u2019s untreated sex offender status \u2014 i.e., so that father could stay in Oregon and finish treatment. She also claimed that she did not know that she lacked permission to go to Alaska.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>As noted, the juvenile court concluded that DHS proved by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cmother\u2019s substance abuse interferes with her ability to safely parent\u201d E, and entered a judgment establishing jurisdiction over E.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Under ORS 419B.100(1)(c), jurisdiction is proper when a child\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare\u201d of the child. A child\u2019s welfare is endangered if the child is exposed \u201cto conditions or circumstances that present a current threat of serious loss or injury.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. J. T, </em>258 Or App 57, 61, 308 P3d 307 (2013). The \u201ckey inquiry in determining whether condition[s] or circumstances warrant jurisdiction is whether, under the totality of circumstances, there is a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 440, 236 P3d 791 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, DHS has the burden to establish a nexus between the allegedly risk-causing conduct or circumstances and risk of harm to the child, and that the risk of harm is present at the time of the hearing and not merely speculative. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. M. Q., </em>253 Or App 776, 785, 292 P3d 616 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Accordingly, in this case, where jurisdiction is based solely on mother\u2019s substance abuse, DHS must demonstrate a nexus between her substance abuse and a risk of harm to E that was present at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. Mother complains on appeal that DHS failed to prove any \u201ccurrent substance abuse\u201d by her, \u201clet alone any nexus between mother\u2019s substance abuse and a risk of harm to [E].\u201d In particular, mother contends that there is no evidence that she used any illegal substances after E\u2019s birth and no evidence that E was affected by mother\u2019s prior drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">DHS counters that it was permissible for the court to infer that mother and father were not credible when they denied drug use at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. DHS further contends that, given E\u2019s young age and the fact that mother violated a DHS safety plan, the juvenile court did not err in concluding that E\u2019s circumstances endangered her welfare. To support those contentions, DHS points to a combination of the following evidence: (1) mother has a history of drug use, including two positive tests shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>E\u2019s birth, and has never received treatment; (2) mother and father \u201cremain a couple\u201d; (3) father had a history of drug use and a positive UA for methamphetamine after E\u2019s birth; (4) mother denied any current drug use and testified that she believed that father was not currently using drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Ultimately, we agree with mother that the record was legally insufficient to support the court\u2019s determination that E was reasonably likely to suffer serious harm in the absence of asserting jurisdiction. In many ways, this case presents issues similar to those in <em>M. Q., </em>253 Or App 776. There, we addressed whether the record supported a determination that the father was using drugs at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. We concluded that, although there was evidence in the record that would have supported a determination that the father was not credible, <em>e.g., </em>inconsistent testimony and excuses for missing a UA, the court\u2019s \u201capparent disbelief of father\u2019s claimed sobriety is not affirmative evidence that he still was using drugs at the time of the [jurisdictional] hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Next, we evaluated whether the evidence from which the court could have found that the father lacked credibility could itself support an inference that the father continued to use drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 786-87. We concluded that it could not. We noted that the father had voluntarily agreed to submit to UAs and that DHS had requested only one UA by the time of the jurisdictional hearing. Although the father missed that UA, \u201cthis case does not involve the kind of pattern of missed court-ordered UAs from which a factfinder reasonably could infer that a person was attempting to hide his or her drug use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787. The father had also been visiting his child weekly for months and had never been observed in a drug-altered state. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the record contained no evidence to support an inference that the father was using drugs at the time the court asserted jurisdiction, and noted that \u201c [jurisdiction cannot be based on speculation that a parent\u2019s past problems persist at the time of the jurisdictional hearing in the absence of any evidence that the risk, in fact, remains.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We reach similar conclusions in this case. The record lacks evidence that mother had a substance abuse problem at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the time of the hearing. DHS contends that mother\u2019s denial of current substance abuse lacked credibility, citing, among other things, her denial of the use of amphetamines despite a positive test in February 2013. We agree that evidence in the record would support a determination that mother is not credible but, as we stated in <em>M. Q., </em>\u201cthe juvenile court\u2019s apparent disbelief of [mother\u2019s] claimed sobriety is not affirmative evidence that [she] still was using drugs at the time of the [jurisdictional] hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. Further, evidence that would support the court\u2019s determination that mother lacked credibility would not itself allow a reasonable fact-finder to infer that mother continued to use drugs in August 2013. The only evidence of mother\u2019s drug use was a positive test for amphetamine and THC in February 2013 \u2014 six months before the jurisdiction hearing \u2014 and a positive test for THC in April 2013. Mother provided two voluntary UAs after E\u2019s birth in April, both of which were negative for any illegal drugs, and she missed one voluntary UA requested by DHS in May. As in <em>M. Q., </em>there was no pattern of missed court-ordered UAs \u201cfrom which a factfinder reasonably could infer that [mother] was attempting to hide *** her drug use.\u201d Moreover, mother had provided two clean UAs since E had been born, and DHS did not introduce any other evidence that would support an inference that mother was using drugs at the time of the jurisdictional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In addition, DHS did not introduce any evidence specific to mother that suggested that any drug use by mother put E at a nonspeculative threat of serious loss or injury. We have recognized on several occasions that a parent\u2019s substance abuse alone does not create a risk of harm to a child. <em>See, e.g., C. Z., </em>236 Or App at 443-44. The juvenile court did not explicitly find that mother\u2019s substance abuse had endangered or would likely endanger E, and there is no evidence in the record that would support an implicit factual conclusion to that effect. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. R. L. F., </em>260 Or App 166, 172-73, 316 P3d 424 (2013) (acknowledging that a parent\u2019s alcohol and marijuana use has the potential to constitute \u201cconditions or circumstances\u201d that could expose a child to a threat of harm, but concluding that DHS had presented no evidence to show that the parent\u2019s substance abuse created a risk of harm to the child or affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the parent\u2019s daily functioning or ability to parent); <em>C. Z., </em>236 Or App at 443-44 (the record lacked evidence that the mother\u2019s \u201cchemical abuse problem\u201d was a condition or risk that posed a risk to her children). Accordingly, the juvenile court erred in concluding that DHS established the allegation that mother had a substance abuse problem that interfered with her ability to safely parent E.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Given our conclusion that DHS presented insufficient evidence that mother had a substance abuse problem at the time of the jurisdictional hearing, and that there was no evidence that any drug use by mother put E at a non-speculative risk of serious loss or injury, we must determine the appropriate disposition of this case. As noted, the court asserted jurisdiction over E based on its determination that both father\u2019s and mother\u2019s substance abuse interfered with their ability to safely parent E. In <em>M. Q., </em>253 Or App at 788, which also involved a situation in which we concluded that DHS had failed to prove an allegation as to one parent and the other parent had not appealed the jurisdictional judgment, we reversed the jurisdictional judgment \u201conly as to\u201d one parent, and otherwise affirmed. <em>See also Dept. of Human Services v. J. H, </em>248 Or App 118, 119, 273 P3d 203 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We conclude that reversal of a jurisdictional judgment \u201conly as to\u201d one parent is inconsistent with the nature of the jurisdictional judgment in this case. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. W. A. C., </em>263 Or App 382, 392, 328 P3d 769 (2014). In <em>W. A. C., </em>we concluded that it was error for the juvenile court to assert jurisdiction over a child when the mother had admitted allegations in the dependency petition, but the father had not, and the court had set a contested hearing to consider the allegations against the father. We noted that it was error for the court to assert jurisdiction before adjudicating the allegations against the father because \u201cif a child has a parent who appears in the proceeding and is capable of caring for the child safely, juvenile court jurisdiction is not warranted and that, unless and until DHS proved that neither parent who appeared could safely parent the child, the court could not enter a jurisdictional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. We also explained that the juvenile court erroneously attempted to enter a jurisdictional judgment that the juvenile court viewed as only applying to the mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>having nothing to do with jurisdiction regarding the father. We rejected that notion, indicating that a jurisdictional judgment brings the child within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, \u201cwhich is appropriate only after a determination that, under the totality of the children\u2019s circumstances, their welfare is endangered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">Those principles squarely apply to the situation in this case. As noted, given our conclusion that the dependency allegations as to mother\u2019s substance abuse were not sufficiently established, the only remaining basis for jurisdiction is that father\u2019s substance abuse interferes with his ability to safely parent E. Accordingly, the record reflects one fit parent and one parent with a substance abuse problem that interferes with his ability to parent safely. Of particular note, there is no established link between the proven and unchallenged allegation as to father, and mother\u2019s ability to parent safely <em>(e.g., </em>that mother was unable or unwilling to protect E from risks of harm relating to father\u2019s substance abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Accordingly, because ORS 419B.100(l)(c) requires the juvenile court to focus \u201con <em>the child\u2019s </em>conditions or circumstances at the time of the hearing and whether the totality of those circumstances demonstrates a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the child [,]\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. F., </em>258 Or App 50, 54, 308 P3d 344, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 386 (2013), we conclude that the juvenile court erred in asserting jurisdiction over E because the evidence was legally insufficient to demonstrate that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was a current risk of nonspeculative harm to E.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> The court also asserted jurisdiction over E based on its determination that father\u2019s substance abuse interfered with his ability to safely parent E.
