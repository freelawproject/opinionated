He challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his identity, revealed by his driver\u2019s license, which was found when a deputy removed a wallet from a pair of shorts during a motor vehicle inventory. Defendant first argues that the deputy obtained evidence of his identity in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the warrantless search of the shorts was not authorized by the inventory policy. Defendant alternatively argues that the inventory policy itself violates Article I, section 9, \u201cbecause it authorizes deputies to search closed containers that are not intended primarily to hold valuables\u201d and \u201callows the deputies to exercise discretion in determining which closed containers to open[.]\u201d We conclude that the evidence in the record does not support a determination that the inventory was conducted pursuant to the inventory policy and does not satisfy the constitutional requirements for a warrantless search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Our standard of review is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cThe physical characteristics of a container and the circumstances under which a container is found constitute historical facts. Historical facts, as found by a trial court, are binding on review if there is evidence in the record to support them. If findings are not made on all such issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and there is evidence from which such facts could be decided in more than one way, then we will presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. Whether the facts support a determination that the officers\u2019 inventory was conducted pursuant to the [policy] and ultimately satisfy the constitutional requirements for a warrantless search is a question of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><em>State v. Swanson, </em>187 Or App 477, 482, 68 P3d 265 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In its letter opinion, the trial court summarized the undisputed facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cDeputy Mason had followed/chased the defendant driving a vehicle and upon stopping in a relatively remote area and residence driveway, the defendant left the vehicle and ran. The officers attempted but were unsuccessful in finding the defendant. In addition the officers did not know the identity of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201c[Deputy] Mason decided to impound the vehicle and called in another officer, Deputy Coney, who he asked to inventory the vehicle, which he did. During the search incident to taking possession of the vehicle [,] Deputy Coney located a wallet which contained defendant\u2019s identification, and from that [Deputy] Mason was able to identify the driver as the defendant from the photo on his driver\u2019s license. Deputy Coney * * * had found the wallet located in the pocket of a pair of men\u2019s shorts (short pants) located in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, Coney testified that the wallet \u201cwas in a pair of light colored blue shorts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He further testified that when he opened the wallet, he believed that he was acting in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the Josephine County Sheriffs inventory policy. That policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">\u201c1. A deputy may conduct a motor vehicle inventory without a warrant or probable cause when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201ca. The vehicle has been lawfully seized, impounded, or towed, pursuant to the arrest of the driver, prior to or after, towing the vehicle for violations, related enforcement or safety reasons as defined by Oregon Revised Statues, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">\u201cb. When deputies conduct the inventory within the scope of this section as an administrative procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201c2. Examination of the contents of a motor vehicle pursuant to a criminal investigation or with the intent of discovering evidence of a crime is a search, not an inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201c3. The contents of all motor vehicles that are lawfully seized and/or impounded by this Office shall be subject to inventoryin accordance with the provisions in paragraphl(a) and (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201c4. An inventory should be conducted in the location at which the vehicle is seized unless limited by reasons of safety or practicality. If so, it may be inventoried at a later time following impoundment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\u201c5. The owner or operator of the vehicle shall be asked to remove, if possible, all valuables from the vehicle prior to impoundment. If such items cannot be removed, they shall be inventoried before the vehicle is removed, and the owner/ operator may be requested to verify the completeness of the inventory by signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">\u201c6. A motor vehicle inventory may extend to all areas of the vehicle in which personal property or hazardous materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>may reasonably be found, including but not limited to the passenger compartment, trunk and glove compartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\u201c7. When performing a vehicle inventory, <em>the deputy shall open and inventory any container that based upon its context and/or physical appearance would reasonably be expected to contain valuables. Containers such as, but not limited to, wallets, purses, fanny packs, briefcases, coin purses and day packs shall be opened and inventoried. </em>Locked containers shall not be forced open, but shall be logged in the impound report as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">\u201cIf the deputy encounters any container for which the deputy can articulate a belief that it contains a hazardous material, the deputy shall open and inspect it before the container is allowed to enter a police facility, storage area, or is released to a tow operator. Hazardous materials shall be handled in compliance with applicable policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">\u201c8. Contraband and evidence discovered during the course of a motor vehicle inventory shall be placed into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant argued to the trial court that (1) Coney exceeded the scope of the policy when he removed the wallet from the shorts and (2) the policy was invalid. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that \u201cthe [deputy] may very well have concluded a pants pocket is designed to hold valuables and reasonably</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, defendant entered into a conditional plea of guilty to both of the charged offenses, reserving his right, on appeal from the ensuing judgment, for us to review the denial of his motion. ORS 135.335(3). On appeal, defendant contends that the state failed to prove that the warrantless search of the shorts was authorized by the inventory policy because the state failed to establish that shorts are \u201cContainers such as, but not limited to, wallets, purses, fanny packs, briefcases, coin purses and day packs\u201d or that the shorts\u2019 \u201ccontext and/or physical appearance\u201d would cause a reasonable person to expect that the shorts contained valuables.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">The state does not argue, under the language set forth in the inventory policy, that shorts are \u201cContainers such as, but not limited to, wallets, purses, fanny packs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>briefcases, coin purses and day packs [,]\u201d nor does the state directly rely on \u201ccontext\u201d or \u201cphysical appearance\u201d as authorization for the search of the shorts. Instead, the state argues that the search of the shorts was authorized by the inventory policy because the pocket on a pair of men\u2019s shorts \u2014 that is, the pocket on <em>every </em>pair of men\u2019s shorts \u2014 is \u201cdesigned to hold valuables.\u201d The state bases its argument on the contention that the operative provision of this inventory policy \u201cincorporates \u2014 albeit with different words \u2014 both the \u2018designed to contain\u2019 and \u2018likely to contain\u2019 descriptions of containers that this court has approved\u201d for inventory policies. The state points to <em>State v. Cordova, </em>250 Or App 397, 402, 280 P3d 1036 (2012), in which we recited the general principle that an inventory policy may \u201cauthorize opening containers that are designed to or likely to contain items of value.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Article I, section 9, protects the right of the people against unreasonable searches and seizures. Except for a \u201cfew specifically established and carefully delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement [,]\u201d a warrantless search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>State v. Connally, </em>339 Or 583, 587, 125 P3d 1254 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 8, 688 P2d 832 (1984), the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that a motor vehicle inventory \u201cpolicy is not inherently \u2018unreasonable\u2019 within the meaning of Article I, section 9,\u201d if it complies with certain conditions. The court then set forth those conditions, stating that the vehicle must be lawfully impounded and that \u201cany inventory must be conducted pursuant to a properly authorized administrative program, designed and systematically administered so that the inventory involves no exercise of discretion by the law enforcement person directing or taking the inventory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-10. Finally, the court stated that, if the \u201cinventory deviated from the established policy or procedures of the particular law enforcement agency, the inventory should be deemed invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. The state bears the burden to prove the lawfulness of the inventory. <em>State v. Brown, </em>229 Or App 294, 302, 211 P3d 315 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We conclude that the state has failed to meet its burden. In this case, the inventory policy specifically requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>determination of whether the container, based upon \u201ccontext and/or physical appearance would reasonably be expected to contain valuables\u201d \u2014 if so, the container may be opened and inventoried; if not, the container may not be opened and inventoried. The state presented no evidence about the context or the physical appearance of the shorts from which it could be concluded that the inventory policy was properly applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">To the extent that the state nonetheless attempts to argue that the pocket on a pair of men\u2019s shorts \u2014 that is, the pocket on <em>every </em>pair of men\u2019s shorts \u2014 is \u201cdesigned to hold valuables [,]\u201d that contention is unavailing. As we have explained, \u201cthe cases in this area are extremely fact specific and the [policies] governing inventories in each case vary in language and scope.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>187 Or App at 483. Undoubtedly, many inventory policies employ some version of the phrase \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d (or \u201cto hold\u201d) particular items or valuables. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cruz-Renteria, </em>250 Or App 585, 587, 280 P3d 1065 (2012) (policy required an inventory of closed containers \u201cdesigned to typically carry\u201d various items); <em>State v. Keady, </em>236 Or App 530, 532, 237 P3d 885 (2010) (policy required the opening of closed containers \u201cdesigned to hold valuables\u201d); <em>State v. Bean, </em>150 Or App 223, 226 n 4, 946 P2d 292 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 448 (1998) (policy mandated inventory of closed containers \u201cdesigned for carrying money and/or small valuables on or about the person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">This inventory policy neither contains the phrase \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d or \u201cdesigned to hold,\u201d nor employs a version of the phrase \u201cdesigned to carry\u201d (or \u201cto hold\u201d) particular items or valuables. As we have noted, \u201c[l]anguage has meaning, and, given the constitutional implication of inventories <em>vis-a-vis </em>the protections of Article I, section 9, we have been scrupulously rigorous in our construction of the terms of inventory policies.\u201d <em>Cordova, </em>250 Or App at 403-04 (citing <em>State v. Hanna, </em>248 Or App 608, 613, 273 P3d 945, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 265 (2012); <em>Keady, </em>236 Or App at 534; and <em>Swanson, </em>187 Or App at 484). Accordingly, the question whether the pocket on every pair of men\u2019s shorts is \u201cdesigned to hold valuables\u201d is not relevant, and the state\u2019s argument cannot be reconciled with the provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the evidence in the record does not support a determination that the inventory was conducted pursuant to the inventory policy and does not satisfy the constitutional requirements for a warrantless search. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> Article I, section 9, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\"> Our conclusion \u2014 that the evidence in the record does not support a determination that the inventory was conducted pursuant to the inventory policy and does not satisfy the constitutional requirements for a warrantless search \u2014 makes it unnecessary for us to reach defendant\u2019s alternative argument that the inventory policy itself violates Article I, section 9. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>229 Or App 294, 302-03, 211 P3d 315 (2009) (\u201c[W]e first consider whether the officers complied with the [inventory] policy; if they did so, we then consider whether the policy was constitutionally permissible ***.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> The quoted testimony is the only evidence in the record about the physical appearance of the shorts. As noted by the trial court in its letter opinion, Coney remembered little from the search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201cThere was no testimony about where the shorts were located in the vehicle, where Deputy Coney found them or in what condition, if he could see the wallet in the pocket either showing or that represented a bulge or otherwise that would belie the wallet\u2019s presence, or for that matter any facts in regard to the circumstances as to how he discovered the wallet, its location or how he took possession thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>\u201cHow did the [deputy] come upon the wallet? There is no evidence to help the court out in answering this question. We simply do not know. Deputy Coney\u2019s memory does not help us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">\u201cConsidering the evidence as it is, is a pocket in a pair of pants a closed container? The answer is yes, if based upon the position of the shorts, you cannot determine if there was a wallet in the pants. There is also no evidence of the thickness of the wallet, which pocket it was in, was the pocket not opaque, and upon which conditions the wallet\u2019s whereabouts and its identity would be given up by simply looking at the shorts. There is no evidence that the [deputy] picked up the pants or that in touching the pants that he located what was likely a wallet. There is no evidence how the [deputy] located the shorts or where they were in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
