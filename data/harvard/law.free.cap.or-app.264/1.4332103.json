J.</author>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">This case is on remand from the Oregon Supreme Court, which reversed, in part, our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further proceedings concerning three assignments of error that we either had no occasion to address in light of our disposition or need to readdress in light of its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Greenwood Products v. Greenwood Forest Products, </em>238 Or App 468, 242 P3d 723 (2010) <em>(Greenwood I), rev\u2019d in part and rent\u2019d, </em>351 Or 604, 273 P3d 116 (2012) <em>(Greenwood II). </em>The dispositive issue on remand concerns the denial of defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we conclude that defendants are entitled to a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim, based on \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand in part on appeal and affirm on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The Supreme Court has previously described the circumstances that gave rise to this case \u2014 as well as two other legal actions and a disciplinary proceeding \u2014 in <em>Greenwood II </em>and in its decision reprimanding plaintiffs\u2019 attorney for his conduct in litigating this case, <em>In re Newell, </em>348 Or 396, 234 P3d 967 (2010). We take the background facts from our decision in <em>Greenwood I </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Greenwood II </em>and <em>Newell, </em>supplemented as necessary with the undisputed facts pertinent to the issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Forest Products \u201cwas in the business of processing and selling industrial wood products\u201d and \u201cmaintained a large inventory of such products at numerous distribution centers throughout the United States.\u201d <em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 606. In February 2002, Forest Products and Greenwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>entered into an asset purchase agreement (APA). As pertinent, the APA provided that, (1) by the closing date, Forest Products would dismiss most of its employees who would then be rehired by Greenwood; (2) Greenwood would purchase Forest Products\u2019 inventory in seven geographically determined units for cost plus a two percent premium over a two-year period;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) until Greenwood\u2019s purchase of an inventory unit, Greenwood, for a fee, would provide Forest Products with, in the words of the APA, \u201call management and administrative services associated with purchasing, processing, and maintaining [Forest Products\u2019] inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">As the Supreme Court recounted in <em>Greenwood II,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\">\u201c[a]fter closing on February 28, 2002, Greenwood took over Forest Products\u2019 offices and equipment. Most of Forest Products\u2019 employees and management all became employees of Greenwood, holding the same positions that they had occupied at Forest Products. Forest Products continued to exist side-by-side with Greenwood \u2014 with Forest Products responsible, at least on paper, for maintaining the inventory that Greenwood employees sold. What this meant in practice was that, in those \u2018units\u2019 that had not yet been purchased by Greenwood, Greenwood employees sold wood products to outside customers, purchasing inventory to cover each sale from Forest Products, at cost plus two percent. The purchases and sales were tracked automatically on two sets of books \u2014 as one witness described it, \u2018when a sales entry was made, it was made in one company and automatically appeared as a *** purchase and a sale in the other company.\u2019 Although, as noted, Forest Products was responsible, during the transition, for replenishing, processing, and maintaining the supply of inventory that Greenwood employees would be selling, it was Greenwood employees who actually performed all of that work, under the \u2018management and administrative services\u2019 provision of the [APA],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">\u201cIn fact, the parties interpreted the \u2018management and administrative services\u2019 provision as extending to the work performed at Forest Products\u2019 highest levels. After the closing, Forest Products retained only two employees\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Dovenberg and LeFors; the remainder of the company\u2019s central staff went to work for Greenwood. Various key Greenwood employees, including Fahey, the head bookkeeper, and Pattillo, the vice president, spent part of their day attending to Forest Products\u2019 accounts and overseeing that company\u2019s operations. In practice, it was difficult to say which \u2018hat\u2019 a given employee was wearing at any given time.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-4\">\u201cAfter the February 28, 2002, closing, units of inventory were purchased and sold as the parties had envisioned for some 13 months, at which point the parties agreed to \u2018finish it off in a single transaction. At that point, Greenwood issued two promissory notes, dated March 18, 2003, for the remaining inventory. A few months later, in June 2003, Greenwood issued another promissory note and paid some $100,000 in cash for \u2018an accumulation of payable for prior purchases of inventory that were due for payment.\u2019 The amounts of the notes and cash payment were based on inventory numbers provided by traders\u2019 assistants and other higher level \u2018accounting people\u2019 (including Fahey and Pattillo) who, at the time of the sale and purchase, were employed by Greenwood but who provided inventory-related services to Forest Products. At the time of the final payments and transfers, the transaction set out in the APA appeared to be essentially completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201cIn August 2003, Greenwood\u2019s books were audited by a certified public accountant, Schmidt. Schmidt found certain unusual entries in the books- \u2014 an unexplained account with a balance of nearly $1.2 million and many entries that did not appear to be related to normal inventory activity. Schmidt suspected that there was a problem with the \u2018inter-company account,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>the accounting of sales of inventory between Greenwood and Forest Products. On the theory that any inventory transactions by Greenwood also should be reflected in Forest Products\u2019 books, Schmidt asked for, and obtained, permission to review Forest Products\u2019 books. While comparing those books with Greenwood\u2019s books, Schmidt found hundreds of entries that did not match. Schmidt eventually decided that, to really understand what had happened with the inventory, he would have to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>reconstruct both Greenwood\u2019s and Forest Products\u2019 books from scratch, using \u2018invoices and purchase orders and all the underlying documentation that would happen on a day-to-day basis in a business.\u2019 When Schmidt completed that work, the figures led him to the conclusion that Greenwood had paid Forest Products for $819,731.68 of inventory that it never had received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-4\">\u201cAfter Schmidt completed his work on Forest Products\u2019 books, Dovenberg approached him about some inconsistencies in Dovenberg\u2019s own personal accounts. Schmidt attempted to help Dovenberg sort out the problem. Ultimately, the two men determined that Fahey, the bookkeeper (who was employed by Greenwood but was providing inventory-related services to Forest Products) had embezzled at least $360,000 from Forest Products accounts between February and December of 2002.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">351 Or 609-11 (footnote omitted; omission in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Those circumstances gave rise to three legal actions\u2014 including this case. First, in 2004, Forest Products brought a conversion action against Fahey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Newell, </em>348 Or at 399. Second, in March 2005, plaintiffs brought this action against defendants \u201casserting breach of contract and equitable claims for reformation or rescission of the promissory notes\u201d and defendants asserted counterclaims, \u201cincluding a claim based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to pay the entire face value of their promissory notes to Forest Products.\u201d <em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 612. Third, in April 2005, after being contacted by Forest Products, the district attorney brought criminal charges for theft against Fahey, who hired attorney Andrew Coit to represent him. <em>Newell, </em>348 Or at 399. As we will explain shortly, 264 Or App at 11-12, immediately after his sentencing following the trial in this case \u2014 that is, the civil action between plaintiffs and defendants \u2014 Fahey executed an affidavit that was the focus of defendants\u2019 new trial motion based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">In January 2006, Fahey pleaded guilty to 10 counts of theft. <em>Newell, </em>348 Or at 399. \u201cAs part of the plea agreement, Fahey agreed to cooperate with [Forest Products\u2019] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>efforts to locate missing assets, and the trial court delayed the sentencing hearing to give Fahey time to carry out his part of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Fahey\u2019s sentencing was scheduled for May 2, 2006 \u2014 approximately one week before trial was scheduled to begin in this case. On May 1, Coit \u201cmoved to continue Fahey\u2019s sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Thereafter, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Robert Newell, learned about the request to set over Fahey\u2019s sentencing in the criminal action and that defendants had subpoenaed Fahey to testify in the trial in this case. <em>Id. </em>On Friday, May 5, Newell had a subpoena served on Fahey for a deposition that was scheduled to begin 14 hours later on Saturday morning at 9:00 <em>a.m.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em>Id. </em>at 400-01. Although Newell served defendants\u2019 attorney, Ron Ferguson, with notice of the deposition, he \u201cdid not attempt to notify Coit[, Fahey\u2019s criminal attorney,] that he had subpoenaed Fahey.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">As a result, Newell and Ferguson were present the following morning, but Coit was not. <em>Id. </em>At the beginning of the deposition, Fahey made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201cFor the record, I was served yesterday evening at 6:35 p.m. I have not had a chance to contact my counsel. As there is a pending criminal case on this in Washington County, [on] anything alluding to any of those areas I will be taking the Fifth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>During the deposition, Newell asked Fahey questions about his work at Forest Products, as well as questions about the criminal action, including questions \u201cabout the amount of money that Fahey had taken \u2014 an issue that was central both to [plaintiffs\u2019] lawsuit against [defendants] and also to the state\u2019s criminal charges against Fahey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. In response to many questions, Fahey asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege. In addition, he did not respond to some questions because he thought that a protective order precluded him from answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Nevertheless, Fahey answered many of Newell\u2019s questions. In doing so, Fahey indicated that Greenwood may not have, in fact, paid for more inventory than it had actually received. That was so based on Fahey\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d concerning the activities of Pattillo, Greenwood\u2019s vice president and his supervisor, in manipulating inventory amounts reflected in Forest Products\u2019 computer system. According to Fahey, Pattillo \u201cmay have phantomly * * * purchased\u201d inventory, placed it on Forest Products\u2019 books, and \u201cthen [had] taken [it] off the books prior to those locations being sold to [Greenwood].\u201d Fahey stated that Pattillo had instructed him to remove inventory from Forest Products\u2019 books on several occasions and that he \u201calways requested a note or something signed or initialed\u201d from Pattillo before doing so. According to Fahey, he placed the documentation from Pattillo in a file with other miscellaneous documents at the end of each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Newell also asked Fahey about his prior discussions with Ferguson as well as Forest Products\u2019 attorneys in the conversion action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With regard to his discussion with Ferguson, Fahey indicated that he did not recall talking about Pattillo but explained that his \u201cattorney *** was present at the time and our subject was incredibly limited to what we would talk about.\u201d With regard to his discussions with Forest Products\u2019 attorneys in the conversion action, Fahey said that he had not \u201creally told [those attorneys] anything yet.\u201d Instead, Fahey explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">\u201cI suggested that they get copies of cancelled checks. I suggested that they go to certain vendors and locations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>get copies of any inventory records they might have. I mentioned that before [,] at the meeting in February [2006]. But up to this point in time[,] I can\u2019t give any specific information to them regarding anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">On May 8, 2006 \u2014 two days after Newell took Fahey\u2019s deposition \u2014 trial in this case began. Before Fahey was scheduled to be called as a witness, Coit appeared on his behalf and filed a motion to seal the deposition transcript. There is no indication from the record on appeal that defendants objected to Coit\u2019s motion. The hearing that followed was not transcribed for this proceeding. Ultimately, the trial court granted Coit\u2019s motion and sealed the deposition transcript; however, the court did not preclude Fahey from testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Thereafter, defendants called Fahey as a witness outside the presence of the jury, and defendants\u2019 attorney, Ferguson, asked the following question: \u201cWas there a time within [February 25, 2002 until December 31, 2002,] when you were instructed to remove inventory off the books of Forest Products?\u201d At that point, Coit interjected, \u201cJudge, I\u2019d advise my client to invoke the Fifth Amendment on that question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">A detailed account of the discussion that ensued between Ferguson, Coit, and the trial court would not benefit the bench, bar, or public. It is sufficient to note that defendants\u2019 position was that the Fifth Amendment privilege was unavailable to Fahey, because the statute of limitations had run as to the conduct referenced in the question. Coit, however, disagreed that the privilege was necessarily unavailable, particularly in that Fahey had not yet been sentenced for the crimes to which he had pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Ultimately, the trial court indicated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any findings with regard to statutes of limitation [.]\u201d Ferguson, defendants\u2019 attorney, sought clarification after which the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: So Mr. Coit\u2019s going to advise his client to invoke the Fifth in areas where he\u2019s uncomfortable because he doesn\u2019t know whether or not the statute has run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cMR. FERGUSON: <em>And I\u2019m going to invite you to tell Mr. Coit and Mr. Fahey they don\u2019t have a Fifth Amendment right to do that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And I\u2019m not going to do that. If he invokes his Fifth Amendment, then he\u2019s going to invoke his Fifth Amendment, and he won\u2019t testify in that area.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\u201cMR. FERGUSON: Okay. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: So do you want to proceed with that witness or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">\u201cMR. FERGUSON: No, I am not proceeding with that witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Accordingly, Fahey did not testify before the jury. Plaintiffs, however, called Pattillo as a witness during their rebuttal case. Pattillo testified that, in light of the \u201cchecks and balances\u201d that were in place at Forest Products, it would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for inventory to come in and then be removed from the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">On cross-examination, Pattillo testified that he had not had a discussion with Fahey in December 2001 concerning the ability to take funds from Forest Products and that he had been unaware of Fahey\u2019s embezzlement. Pattillo further testified that (1) he was responsible for reconciling the inventory as reflected in the computer system with the inventory reflected in the traders\u2019 spreadsheets on a monthly basis; (2) there were occasions when he instructed Fahey to make adjustments to inventory; and (3) he usually gave Fahey information concerning where the adjustment needed to be made, which \u201cprobably had [his] initial on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In sum, as framed by the parties, the jury\u2019s determination of the breach of contract claim reduced to a single, fundamental question: Had Greenwood paid for inventory that it did not receive from Forest Products?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Plaintiffs asserted that Schmidt\u2019s reconstruction of both companies\u2019 books revealed that Greenwood had paid Forest Products for $819,731.68 in inventory that it had not received and that Greenwood\u2019s overpayment resulted from Fahey\u2019s manipulation of the books to hide his embezzlement from Forest Products. According to plaintiffs, although Fahey was an employee of Greenwood, Fahey\u2019s actions were attributable to Forest Products because it had the right to exercise control over his actions. Conversely, for their part, defendants posited that Greenwood\u2019s overpayment, if any, was caused by Greenwood\u2019s own <em>employees </em>\u2014 viz., Fahey and Pattillo \u2014 who had performed accounting services for Forest Products under the management and administrative services provision of the APA and whose conduct could not be attributed to Forest Products.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">As pertinent here, \u201cthe jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim, which included damages in the amount of $819,731.68 for the overpayment of inventory.\u201d <em>Greenwood </em>I, 238 Or App at 478. \u201cThe jury also found in favor of defendants on their counterclaim for nonpayment on the promissory notes in the amount of $1,043,757.00.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">After the conclusion of the trial in this case, Fahey was sentenced in the criminal action. Subsequently, on May 31, 2006, Fahey executed an affidavit, which defendants submitted in support of their motion for a new trial. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>affidavit, Fahey described in detail Pattillo\u2019s conduct in instructing Fahey to remove phantom inventory from Forest Products\u2019 books before it was sold to Greenwood \u2014 which, in turn, substantiated defendants\u2019 fundamental assertion that Greenwood had not, in fact, overpaid for inventory \u2014 that is, Greenwood received exactly what it had paid for. Specifically, Fahey averred, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Sometime between December 2001 and February 2002 I had a memorable lunch with my superior [Pattillo].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">\u201c5. At our lunch Pattillo discussed with me the potential of my taking funds from [Forest Products]. Pattillo indicated to me that I could take funds from [Forest Products] accounts and in exchange I would not protest or object to accounting irregularities and/or practices resulting from his orders directing me to make entries into the [Forest Products] accounting system and/or ignore irregular accounting entries into the [Forest Products] accounting system performed by Pattillo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201c6. From February 2002 until December 2002 I proceeded to transfer [Forest Products] funds to my accounts. My method of dispersal required Pattillo to sign off and acknowledge that funds from [Forest Products] were being paid via ACH transfer to my personal accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">\u201c14. I understood that [Greenwood] was subject to public accounting/auditing requirements that required [Forest Products] to make efforts to determine the exact amount of inventory being sold to [Greenwood] by [Forest Products], for every Inventory Sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">\u201c15. Accordingly, [Greenwood] required a physical count of the inventory to be performed by [Forest Products] prior to * * * each Inventory Sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">\u201c17. [Forest Products] utilized Navision Financials (\u2018Navision\u2019) as its computer accounting system. Navision contains inventory journals that allow for manual manipulation of inventory levels present on the computer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-12\">\u201c18. For each Inventory Sale a physical count would be performed. If the inventory for the physical count was less than the inventory registered on the computer accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>system, Pattillo instructed me to remove the excess inventory from Navision, so that the Navision accounting of inventory would match the physical count of inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">\u201c19. My expertise and background in accounting makes it clear to me that the manipulation of inventory that I performed at Pattillo\u2019s instruction was not in accordance with regulations governing accounting practices and procedures. There is no accounting justification for the inventory manipulations I performed at the request of Pattillo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201c20. I was aware that by removing inventory from the Navision accounting system I was doing so in exchange for Pattillo ignoring my transfer of [Forest Products\u2019] funds to my personal account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201c21. With regard to the improper inventory entries, I have been provided with the Navision database for Forest Products for the period of time in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201c22. For each removal of inventory from the Navision accounting system I would label such removal of inventory with the term \u2018NEGAPP.\u2019 It is of note that after December 2002 I ceased making \u2018NEGAPP\u2019 entries into the Navision [s]ystem because by that time Pattillo had been taught by me how to make those entries and no longer needed me to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201c23. \u2018NEGAPP\u2019 is the term created by me and refers to the inventory entries made by me at the instruction of Pattillo that resulted in the reduction of [Forest Products\u2019] inventory as reflected on the Navision accounting system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201c24. Using the Navision system I was able to isolate the NEGAPP entries performed by me by performing [a specified query.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">25. The NEGAPP entries also correspond to a particular \u2018PIP\u2019/Order file for [Forest Products]. Each NEGAPP can be traced to a \u2018PIP\u2019/Order file by doing [a specified query] in the Navision system [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">\u201c*** I Was able to determine the PIP/Order files that were associated with each NEGAPP. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">\u201c26. The importance of tracing the NEGAPP to a [Forest Products] order file is that I can then verify the fact that a purchase order for the inventory exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201c27. By tracing the NEGAPP entries through the Navision accounting system I determined that the NEGAPP entry was applied to PIP/Order files * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">\u201c28. Each time there was an Inventory Sale I would have to make several NEGAPP entries at the request of Pattillo prior to the occurrence of the Inventory Sale. After I made these NEGAPP entries I would have Pattillo first approve a draft run of the inventory journal by having him initial my NEGAPP entries on the Navision system. I have not been able to review those documents, but I am aware that Pattillo signed off on all my NEGAPP entries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u201c30. By using the Navision system I was also able to determine that even though my NEGAPP entry removed inventory from the [Forest Products] computers, [Forest Products] issued checks for the payment for the \u2018removed\u2019 inventory (i.e. removed by me from the Navision system). I have printed out the [Forest Products] checks issued for inventory removed from Navision through the NEGAPP entry. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201c31. These checks reflect that even though I was told to remove the inventory via a NEGAPP entry, a check was issued for payment by [Forest Products] to the particular supplier owed for the purchase of inventory by [Forest Products].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201c33. I am also aware that [Forest Products] used an \u2018Access Database,\u2019 a Microsoft program to track the inventory movements of the \u2018XL\u2019 (extended life program) program after purchase. I have never had any ability to make entries of any kind into the \u2018Access Database,\u2019 but Pattillo did have the ability to make entries into the \u2018Access Database.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">In sum, the averments of Fahey\u2019s affidavit, if believed, established the following: After the closing date of the APA in February 2002, Pattillo (1) directed Fahey to manually manipulate inventory in Forest Products\u2019 computer system in a way that \u201cwas not in accordance with regulations governing accounting practices and procedures\u201d and (2) gave Fahey documents \u201csign[ing] off\u2019 on those inventory manipulations. Because Greenwood was subject to public accounting and auditing requirements, a physical count was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>before a unit of inventory was sold to Greenwood. <em>See </em>264 Or App at 3-4 (describing selling of inventory units). When the physical count was less than the inventory reflected in the computer system, Pattillo instructed Fahey to remove the excess inventory from the system. Moreover, based on Fahey\u2019s review of the system itself, he described the specific search queries that could be used to isolate entries resulting in the removal of inventory and substantiated that Forest Products issued checks to suppliers for the inventory that had been removed. Forest Products used a different computer database to track what occurred after the issuance of the checks, and Pattillo \u2014 not Fahey \u2014 had the ability to make entries into that database.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">After Fahey executed his affidavit \u2014 but before defendants filed their motion for new trial \u2014 the court \u201cdecided plaintiffs\u2019 equitable claims [for rescission and reformation of the notes] in defendants\u2019 favor and entered a judgment awarding damages according to the jury\u2019s verdicts.\u201d <em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 613. The court, by order, also unsealed Fahey\u2019s deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Defendants filed a motion for a new trial under ORCP 64 B, raising a variety of grounds. As pertinent here, defendants sought a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4), relying primarily on Fahey\u2019s affidavit as newly discovered evidence that warranted a new trial under the rule. Specifically, defendants contended that \u201cmost of the information\u201d in Fahey\u2019s affidavit \u201cwas neither discussed nor disclosed in his deposition.\u201d In particular, unlike Fahey\u2019s deposition testimony, his affidavit \u201cspecifically identified], on a step-by-step basis, exactly how manipulation of the inventory occurred\u201d at Pattillo\u2019s instruction. Defendants explained that, although \u201cit was generally known\u201d to Ferguson that Pattillo had knowledge of Fahey\u2019s embezzlement, \u201cthe exact method of how this was accomplished, and the resulting manipulation of the inventory, was neither known nor capable of discovery.\u201d According to defendants, the jury\u2019s consideration of Fahey\u2019s affidavit \u201cwould have significant effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">During the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court indicated that, to obtain a new trial, defendants had \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>pretty heavy standard burden that [it] need[ed] to meet\u201d and that defendants \u201c[had not] met that burden.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court did not enter a timely order denying defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, and, as a result, the motion was deemed denied. <em>See </em>ORCP 64 F(1) (so providing).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Thereafter, the trial court entered a supplemental judgment awarding plaintiffs their attorney fees on the breach of contract claim and awarding defendants their attorney fees on the counterclaim for nonpayment of the promissory notes. However, the court denied defendants their claimed expert expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Defendants appealed the general judgment and the supplemental judgment for attorney fees, raising seven assignments of error. Plaintiffs cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">On appeal, we concluded that defendants were entitled to a directed verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. <em>Greenwood I, </em>238 Or App at 480-82. Our disposition obviated the need to consider defendants\u2019 third through sixth assignments of error. <em>Id. </em>at 482. However, we addressed defendants\u2019 seventh and final assignment of error pertaining to the trial court\u2019s supplemental judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 482-85. Given our reversal of the judgment on the breach of contract claim, we reversed the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to plaintiffs on that claim and remanded for a determination of defendants\u2019 entitlement to fees. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83. We also concluded that defendants \u2014 who were awarded attorney fees as the prevailing party on their counterclaim for nonpayment of the promissory notes \u2014 were also entitled to recover expert expenses and remanded for the trial court to award reasonable expert expenses to defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 482-85. Finally, because it had not been preserved, we rejected plaintiffs\u2019 sole contention on cross-appeal concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for rescission as to the promissory note issued in June 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">On review, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe trial court in this case properly rejected each of the grounds that defendants raised at trial for granting their motion for a directed verdict on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim.\u201d <em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 620. As a result, the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>reversed our decision to the contrary and remanded for us to consider the following assignments of error that had been obviated by our disposition or that we needed to readdress because our decision had been predicated on defendants\u2019 entitlement to a directed verdict: (1) defendants\u2019 fifth assignment of error concerning purported instructional error; (2) defendants\u2019 sixth assignment of error concerning the denial of their new trial motion; and (3) the part of defendants\u2019 seventh assignment of error concerning the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendants that they are entitled to a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim. That disposition again requires the reversal of the attorney fee award for plaintiffs and obviates the need to consider defendants\u2019 assignment of error concerning purported instructional error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we turn to the dispositive issue on remand: defendants\u2019 entitlement to a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">As before the trial court, relying primarily on Fahey\u2019s post-trial affidavit, defendants contend that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a new trial on the breach of contract claim, because that newly discovered evidence \u201cdisclosed [Pattillo\u2019s] involvement in embezzlement.\u201d Defendants explain that the affidavit gave a \u201cvery different\u201d and \u201cthorough explanation of the accounting errors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>how those may not have implicated at all the accuracy of the inventory transferred to and paid for by Greenwood.\u201d According to defendants, in light of that evidence, \u201c[t] he jury would have understood that there may well have been no inaccuracy at all with the inventory amounts transferred between the companies (this was plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of how defendants [] breached the contract)\u201d and \u201cprobably would have changed the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Plaintiffs remonstrate that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion should be sustained for either of two primary alternative substantive reasons. First, the evidence was not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d in that (according to plaintiffs) defendants failed to exercise reasonable diligence in acquiring and producing that evidence at trial. Second, defendants failed to demonstrate that the new evidence would probably change the result if a new trial is granted. With respect to the latter, plaintiffs emphasize both that defendants presented other evidence at trial in support of their contention that Greenwood had, in fact, received what it had paid for (and, thus, had not overpaid) \u2014 and that the jury, by necessary implication, had not credited that evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Pursuant to ORCP 64 B,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">\u201c[a] former judgment may be set aside and a new trial granted in an action where there has been a trial by jury on the motion of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u201cB(4) Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which such party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In <em>State v. Arnold, </em>320 Or 111, 120-21, 879 P2d 1272 (1994), the Supreme Court held that, to justify a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4), newly discovered evidence must meet the following six requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\u201c(1) It must be such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">\u201c(2) It must be such as, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered before or during the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201c(3) It must be such that it cannot, with reasonable diligence, be used during trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">\u201c(4) It must be material to an issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">\u201c(5) It must not be merely cumulative; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">\u201c(6) It must not be merely impeaching or contradicting of former evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">(Footnote omitted.) Although \u201c[t]he first three requirements are independently essential,\u201d the last three \u201care closely related to the first.\u201d <em>State v. Acree, </em>205 Or App 328, 334, 134 P3d 1069 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">When a trial court denies a new trial motion, \u201c[a]ssuming that the trial court made no predicate legal error, we review the court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. However, as we explained in <em>Mitchell v. Mt. Hood Meadows Oreg., </em>195 Or App 431, 457, 99 P3d 748 (2004),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cthe determination of whether the requirements of ORCP 64 B(4) are met is not the kind of decision that involves more than one legally permissible choice to be made by the trial court. <em>See State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (Tf there is only one legally correct outcome, then \u201cdiscretion\u201d is an inapplicable concept.\u2019). Rather, <em>Arnold </em>teaches us that the decision to be made by the court under ORCP 64 B(4) is initially a legal determination about the adequacy of the movant\u2019s grounds for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As previously explained, 264 Or App at 15-16, defendants\u2019 new trial motion was ultimately deemed denied because the court did not enter a timely order resolving it. Thus, the issue in this case is a legal one \u2014 that is, whether the requirements of ORCP 64 B(4) have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We agree with defendants that the requirements of ORCP 64 B(4) have been satisfied in this case. That is so for three salient reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em>First, </em>even though defendants\u2019 motion relied, in part, on the deposition transcript, the primary basis of the motion was Fahey\u2019s post-trial affidavit, which presented qualitatively different information than did the deposition transcript. During his deposition, Fahey described, in general terms, his thesis concerning Pattillo\u2019s inventory manipulation scheme involving the removal of phantom inventory from Forest Products\u2019 books and written communications to Fahey confirming Pattillo\u2019s instructions to remove such inventory. However, it was not until Fahey executed the affidavit \u2014 based on his review of the Navision database \u2014 that defendants had (1) evidence of the specific database coding and search queries that demonstrated <em>how </em>the removal of phantom inventory occurred and (2) evidence of the specific transactions for which checks were issued for the removed inventory. Thus, in determining whether defendants are entitled to a new trial, the proper focus is on Fahey\u2019s affidavit, not the deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\"><em>Second, </em>and notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 contentions to the contrary, defendants \u201ccould not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced the evidence [contained in Fahey\u2019s affidavit] at the trial.\u201d <em>Arnold, </em>320 Or at 120. In his affidavit in support of the new trial motion, Ferguson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>averred that, before trial, he had \u201chad the occasion to have conversations with [Fahey] in the presence of his criminal attorney\u201d and that \u201c[substantial limitations were placed upon the questions [he] was able to ask [Fahey] by his criminal attorney, as a result of the then pending criminal charges.\u201d Further, Ferguson averred that, at the time of trial, \u201ca significant amount of information\u201d in Fahey\u2019s affidavit \u201cwas not know[n] to [him]\u201d and that he did not believe that he \u201cwould have been permitted to inquire into the subject matter during [his] various conversations with [Fahey], because [of Fahey\u2019s] pending criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">With respect to reasonable diligence, we begin by noting that Ferguson\u2019s averments are consistent with Fahey\u2019s deposition testimony about the limitations that Coit placed on Fahey\u2019s pretrial discussions with Ferguson and Forest Products\u2019 attorneys in the conversion action described above, 264 Or App at 8-9.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Perhaps ironically, but for plaintiffs\u2019 unethical procurement of Fahey\u2019s deposition, defendants would not have discovered information about Fahey\u2019s thesis concerning Pattillo\u2019s purported inventory manipulation. Further, Coit\u2019s successful efforts at the time of trial in this case to seal Fahey\u2019s deposition testimony \u2014 which was unethically procured by <em>plaintiffs </em>and which appears to be what alerted defendants to Fahey\u2019s thesis concerning Pattillo\u2019s inventory manipulation scheme \u2014 -demonstrate that Coit would not have permitted defendants to inquire into this subject matter either before or during trial. Indeed, when defendants called Fahey as a witness at trial outside the presence of the jury and attempted to inquire about Pattillo\u2019s purported inventory manipulation, Coit advised Fahey to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege \u2014 and, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 protests, the trial court effectively precluded defendants from eliciting testimony from Fahey about that manipulation. In sum, under the totality of the circumstances in this case, defendants, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have discovered and presented Fahey\u2019s putative testimony, which, as set out in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>post-trial affidavit, coherently and precisely detailed and substantiated <em>how </em>Pattillo\u2019s manipulation occurred in a way that did not result in Greenwood\u2019s overpaying for the inventory that it received from Forest Products.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><em>Third, </em>that new evidence is qualitatively of the sort that, if believed, \u201cwill probably change the result.\u201d <em>Arnold, </em>320 Or at 120. That is, the evidence of Pattillo\u2019s scheme of directing the manipulation of \u201cphantom inventory\u201d as presented in the post-trial affidavit \u2014 evidence which, if believed, demonstrated that Greenwood had not overpaid Forest Products for inventory or at least substantially subverted plaintiffs\u2019 evidence to the contrary \u2014 is just the type of evidence that, if believed, \u201cwould probably lead a reasonable person to a different decision from that reached by the jury.\u201d <em>Acree, </em>205 Or App at 337. That is so, not the least, because Fahey\u2019s conduct, the direction and oversight of that conduct, and the evidence of the \u201creconstructed\u201d inventory entries on which plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based, were central to this dispute. It is especially telling that, once Fahey\u2019s trial testimony had been precluded, plaintiffs, in their rebuttal case, called Pattillo to elicit testimony ostensibly refuting any possibility of the manipulation of phantom inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In <em>Aeree, </em>we noted that \u201cthere inheres in the words \u2018will probably\u2019 an internal tension\u201d in that \u201c[t]he word \u2018will\u2019 connotes certainty, whereas \u2018probably\u2019 ordinarily means that a particular result is more likely than not to occur.\u201d 205 Or App at 334-35. Nonetheless, we concluded that \u201cwill probably\u201d reflects a \u201cprobability\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 335. That conclusion was informed by the Supreme Court\u2019s prior observation that the party seeking a new trial bears the burden of showing a \u201cstate of undisputed facts.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, in <em>Aeree, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of a new trial motion based on videotaped evidence that directly rebutted the state\u2019s theory that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the defendant constructively possessed the drug-related evidence and contradicted one of the state\u2019s primary witnesses. In doing so, we explained that the new evidence \u201cwould have substantially undermined the state\u2019s [constructive possession] theory\u201d and that, once the accuracy of the state\u2019s witness\u2019s testimony \u201cwas called into question, the jury may have been more likely to credit [other testimony] that [the] defendant did not know that any drug paraphernalia was present in the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337; <em>see also State v. Farmer, </em>210 Or App 625, 643, 152 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 645 (2007) (noting that, in some cases, our assessment of whether newly discovered evidence will probably change the result \u201cnecessarily [has been] based not on a prediction that the jury will believe the evidence but rather on an assessment that the evidence could be believed by a reasonable jury and, if so, would probably change the result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Here, again, the evidence in Fahey\u2019s affidavit was material to the fundamental question at the core of this case: Did Greenwood pay Forest Products for inventory that Greenwood did not receive? As noted above, 264 Or App at 11 n 12, the jury\u2019s answer to that question was different depending on the time period involved \u2014 that is, as to the earlier inventory purchases, the jury found that there was an overpayment (which was reflected in the verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim), but, as to the final purchase reflected in the promissory notes, the jury found that there was no overpayment (which was reflected in the verdict in favor of defendants on their claim for nonpayment of the notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">At the least, the evidence in Fahey\u2019s post-trial affidavit would have contradicted Pattillo\u2019s rebuttal testimony concerning the impossibility of someone removing inventory from Forest Products\u2019 books \u2014 and, concomitantly, would have corroborated defendants\u2019 evidence that the amounts of the final inventory purchases were accurately reflected in the notes. But even more importantly, given the jury\u2019s verdict for plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim, Fahey\u2019s affidavit directly rebutted plaintiffs\u2019 theory that Schmidt\u2019s reconstruction demonstrated that Greenwood overpaid for inventory as a result of Fahey\u2019s manipulation of the books to hide his own embezzlement from Forest Products and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>substantiated, in detail, the actions that Fahey took at Pattillo\u2019s direction beginning after the February 28, 2002, closing date of the APA \u2014 that is, actions that would have related to the breach of contract claim. If the accuracy of plaintiffs\u2019 theory were called into question with the contrary evidence in Fahey\u2019s affidavit about how inventory was manipulated in the Navision system without causing Greenwood to pay for inventory that it did not receive, the jury \u201cmay have been more likely to credit\u201d other testimony supporting defendants\u2019 theory that Greenwood had not paid Forest Products for inventory that Greenwood did not receive.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Acree, </em>205 Or App at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Thus, we agree with defendants that the evidence in Fahey\u2019s affidavit was \u201c[n]ewly discovered evidence, material for [defendants], which [they] could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at trial.\u201d ORCP 64 B(4). Accordingly, defendants are entitled to a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Given that disposition of defendants\u2019 sixth assignment of error, we turn to defendants\u2019 seventh assignment of error pertaining to the supplemental judgment. In light of our conclusion that defendants are entitled to a new trial on the breach of contract claim, the attorney fee award to plaintiffs on that claim must be reversed. ORS 20.220(3)(a) (providing that, when a party appeals a judgment to which an award of attorney fees relates, \u201c[i]f the appellate court reverses the judgment, the award of attorney fees or costs and disbursements shall be deemed reversed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In sum, on remand, we conclude that defendants are entitled to a new trial on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim under ORCP 64 B(4) and, as a consequence, the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs on that claim must be reversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Our disposition obviates the need to consider defendants\u2019 assignment of error on appeal concerning purported instructional error. Further, as explained above, 264 Or App at 17 n 13, we adhere to and readopt our reasoning in <em>Greenwood I, </em>concerning defendants\u2019 entitlement to recover reasonable expert expenses as the prevailing party on their counterclaim for nonpayment of the promissory notes, 238 Or App at 482-85, and rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, <em>id. </em>at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">On appeal, (1) general judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claim for breach of contract reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed; (2) plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fee award in supplemental judgment on breach of contract claim reversed and remanded; (3) defendants\u2019 attorney fee award in supplemental judgment on counterclaim for nonpayment of promissory notes remanded for the court to award reasonable expert expenses to defendants.

Plaintiffs did not challenge those two determinations in the Supreme Court. <em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 615 n 8.

However, we leave it to the Court of Appeals to make that determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-9\"><em>Greenwood II, </em>351 Or at 621 n 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b38-5\"> Defendants also contend that Fahey\u2019s affidavit demonstrates that <em>Greenwood </em>\u2014 viz., their vice president Pattillo \u2014 directed Fahey\u2019s activities such that Forest Products was not responsible for any losses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\"> Plaintiffs also raise a procedural objection, <em>viz., </em>that the denial of defendants\u2019 new trial motion is unreviewable because, as a practical matter, the asserted \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence could have been presented at trial but for the trial court\u2019s ruling, which effectively sustained Fahey\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege at trial \u2014 and defendants have not assigned error to <em>that </em>ruling. That failure, plaintiffs posit, is procedurally preclusive. <em>See, e.g., Sansone v. Garvey, Schubert &amp; Barer, </em>188 Or App 206, 226-27, 71 P3d 124, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 16 (2003) (involving a request for a new trial because of attorney misconduct to which no objection had been made during trial; reasoning that \u201c[t]he general rule is that the denial of a motion for a new trial is not reviewable on appeal when the motion is based on alleged errors committed during the trial\u201d and that \u201cit is incumbent on a party to make a proper objection during trial and to assign error to the ruling on that objection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention is unavailing for two interrelated reasons. First, defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial is predicated on, as pertinent here, newly discovered evidence and not on some purported legal error at trial (as contemplated in <em>Sansone). </em>Second, the gravamen of defendants\u2019 appellate challenge to the denial of their new trial motion does not partake of a belated collateral attack on the trial court\u2019s ruling as to the privilege but, instead, presumes the correctness of that ruling \u2014 a presumption, which, as noted, appears to be well founded. <em>See </em>264 Or App at 9 n 10. Thus, we agree with defendants that they have \u201cno obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>mount a fruitless constitutional argument\u201d in order to pursue and obtain review of their claim to a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b41-5\"> Although, as part of his plea agreement, Fahey had agreed to cooperate with Forest Products\u2019 efforts to locate missing assets, Coit intentionally and significantly limited the subject matter and particular information that Fahey provided Ferguson and Forest Products\u2019 attorneys in the conversion action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> In <em>State v. Farmer, </em>210 Or App 625, 641-42, 643, 152 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 645 (2007), we acknowledged that the meaning of that phrase was unclear and declined to clarify it. However, we aptly observed that, \u201c[i]f newly discovered evidence has to create an undisputed state of facts, it could almost never be grounds for a new trial: if it conflicted with the existing evidence, it would not be undisputed, but if it did <em>not </em>conflict with the existing evidence, it typically would be cumulative.\u201d Id. at 642 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> To be sure, as plaintiffs point out, the fact that Fahey was a \u201cfelonf,] convicted of a crime of dishonesty,\u201d could well bear on the assessment of his credibility in a new trial. Nevertheless, Fahey\u2019s putative testimony is extremely detailed, particularly with respect to the documentation of inventory manipulations Pattillo allegedly directed, and is at least ostensibly internally consistent \u2014 and a trier of fact could certainly determine that, in the totality of the circumstances, Fahey would be motivated to tell the truth rather than to lie under oath and consequently incur further penal consequences. Thus, and contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the new evidence is <em>not </em>\u201csimply too unbelievable to change the result if a new trial were granted.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>210 Or App at 643.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
