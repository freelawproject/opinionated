J.</author>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">This is a personal injury case involving a claim by plaintiff against her insurer, defendant, after plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident by an uninsured motorist. After the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $5,856.49 in damages, the court awarded plaintiff $25,182 in attorney fees. Defendant challenges plaintiffs entitlement to attorney fees and, in the alternative, the amount awarded. Plaintiff cross-appeals, arguing that the court erred in excluding certain evidence and that the court\u2019s error was prejudicial to her claim for damages. We conclude that the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was erroneous and prejudicial, so we reverse and remand on plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal. On defendant\u2019s appeal, we conclude that plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees, but we remand on the question of the amount of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The facts are undisputed. While driving on 1-84 with her husband and children, defendant\u2019s car was hit from behind by a negligent, intoxicated, and uninsured motorist. As a result, plaintiff suffered a broken nose and other physical injuries, as well as pain, suffering, and emotional distress. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff submitted to defendant an \u201capplication for [uninsured motorist] benefits and proof of loss.\u201d Eight months then elapsed before defendant made its first attempt to settle the claim, offering $3,00o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 742.061. Subsequently, and before plaintiff filed this action, defendant raised the offer to $6,000. Plaintiff, whose original demand was for $25,000 in uninsured motorist benefits (her policy limits), rejected the offer after her attorney conferred with his partners and two independent defense attorneys, and, based on their advice, estimated that the case was worth considerably more than the amount offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Court-annexed arbitration ensued. The arbitrator awarded plaintiff $11,826.99 in damages and $9,259 in attorney fees. Defendant, however, appealed the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>award to the circuit court. At trial, the court did not allow plaintiff to submit evidence that, following the accident, she had continuing nightmares about it and fear of driving in the dark. The court reasoned that, because plaintiffs damages were limited by the insurance policy, her action sounded in contract and were, in turn, limited by statute to damages that \u201carise out of bodily injury.\u201d That phrase, the court held, ruled out compensation for plaintiffs fear and nightmares. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiff $856.49 in economic damages and $5,000 in noneconomic damages, for a total that was lower than the amount of defendant\u2019s final settlement offer. Plaintiff subsequently submitted a statement seeking attorney fees of $25,182, based on a rate of $300 per hour, which was 20 percent higher than her attorney\u2019s usual hourly rate because he took the case on a contingency basis. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court entered an award for the full amount requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">On appeal, defendant challenges plaintiffs entitlement to attorney fees and, in the alternative, the amount awarded. In a cross-appeal, plaintiff challenges the court\u2019s ruling that excluded evidence of continuing emotional distress and fear. We begin with plaintiffs cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">At a pretrial hearing, defendant made a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to preclude plaintiff from offering evidence of damages for emotional distress unless such damages resulted from bodily injury. The court granted the motion, and, at trial, allowed plaintiff to testify about her state of mind in the immediate aftermath of the accident, but excluded evidence of plaintiffs long-term nightmares about the incident and her continuing fear of driving in the dark \u2014 nightmares and fears that had not abated at the time of trial. The court apparently agreed with defendant\u2019s argument that the policy and statutory language limiting emotional distress damages precluded consideration of emotional distress beyond the immediate aftermath of the physical impact. Plaintiff argued, and argues again in her cross-appeal, that evidence of the continuing emotional distress should have been admitted because it was directly related to the physical, bodily injury that she experienced from the accident itself. She notes that the insurance contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>as well as statutes to which the contract must conform, ORS 742.504, covered plaintiff for general damages resulting from bodily injury, and that her fears and nightmares clearly fell within that category. Defendant, not offering any response to that argument, appears to concede the error. We agree. Both ORS 742.504(l1)(a) and defendant\u2019s policy allow recovery for \u201cgeneral *** damages *** because of bodily injury\u201d caused by the accident. Subsequent emotional harm resulting from the accident occurs \u201cbecause of\u2019 that accident. <em>See, e.g., Porter v. Headings, </em>270 Or 281, 283-84, 527 P2d 403 (1974) (court erred in excluding the plaintiffs evidence that automobile accident caused subsequent fear that plaintiffs unborn child was injured); <em>Fehely v. Senders, </em>170 Or 457, 461, 464, 135 P2d 283 (1943) (providing that emotional injuries following physical injury include \u201cmental suffering * * * whether permanent or temporary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Defendant, however, contends that the erroneous exclusion of the evidence does not constitute reversible error because it was not prejudicial. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3 (judgment of trial court must be affirmed if error is harmless); ORS 19.415(2) (\u201cNo judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d); OEC 103(1) (evidentiary error not presumed to be prejudicial). According to defendant, excluding evidence of lingering post-accident emotional distress was harmless because plaintiff was allowed to testify at some length about her emotional state at the time of the accident. The excluded testimony, in other words, would have been merely cumulative. We disagree. We will reverse based on evidentiary error if the excluded evidence had some likelihood of affecting the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Gritzbaugh Main Street Prop. v. Greyhound Lines, </em>205 Or App 640, 654, 135 P3d 345, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 628, 142 P3d 514 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 299 (2007). That is the situation here. There is a significant difference between a contained, short period of emotional distress immediately following physical injury and persistent, lingering, and long-term emotional distress. The court erred in excluding plaintiffs testimony, and we cannot say that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">That being the case, we must reverse and remand. However, on remand, the question of attorney fees may arise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>We therefore address defendant\u2019s arguments on that question. Defendant first contends that the court erred in awarding attorney fees to plaintiff under ORS 742.061. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if settlement is not made within six months from the date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insurance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the action and any appeal thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201c(3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to actions to recover uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits if, in writing, not later than six months from the date proof of loss is filed with the insurer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201c(a) The insurer has accepted coverage and the only issues are the liability of the uninsured or underinsured motorist and the damages due the insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201c(b) The insurer has consented to submit the case to binding arbitration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The \u201ctender\u201d referred to in subsection (1) must be timely, that is, it must be made within six months after filing the proof of loss. <em>Accord Wilson v. Tri-Met, </em>234 Or App 615, 622, 228 P3d 1225, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 669 (2010); <em>Petersen v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>162 Or App 462, 465, 986 P2d 659 (1999). Thus, under subsection (1), a defendant insurer will have to pay attorney fees if a claim is not settled within six months from the date of proof of loss and the plaintiff claimant recovers more than \u201cthe amount of any tender made by\u201d the insurer within six months from the date of proof of loss, <em>unless </em>the insurer has reached the \u201csafe harbor\u201d of subsection (3), that is, has accepted coverage <em>and </em>consented to binding arbitration. ORS 742.061(1), (3). In this case, it is undisputed that the claim was not settled within six months from the date that plaintiff submitted proof of loss; that, within that same time period, defendant did not make any tender (or, phrased alternatively, made a tender of zero dollars), thus exposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>itself to liability for attorney fees if plaintiff recovered any amount; and defendant did not reach the safe harbor of subsection (3) because it did not consent to binding arbitration. Taking these facts and ORS 742.061 into account, the trial court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Defendant, however, argues that its tender of $6,000, even though it was not made within six months of proof of loss, nonetheless defeated plaintiffs claim for attorney fees because that amount exceeded plaintiffs recovery ($5,856.49). In other words, defendant argues that it <em>did </em>make a timely tender that exceeded plaintiffs recovery. To reach that conclusion, defendant maintains that, contrary to <em>Petersen </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>the tender does <em>not </em>have to occur within six months of the proof of loss. Those cases, defendant argues, are distinguishable, because they did not deal with a tender made before the action at issue was filed. According to defendant, applying the rule of <em>Petersen </em>and <em>Wilson </em>(tender must be made within six months of proof of loss) in a case like this would defeat the underlying policy objective of ORS 742.061, as expressed in <em>Dockins v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>329 Or 20, 985 P2d 796 (1999), which, in turn, relied on <em>Dolan v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>133 Or 252, 255, 289 P 1057 (1930). That policy objective is to \u201cdiscourage expensive and lengthy litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We are not persuaded. Defendant\u2019s argument depends, first, on the dubious assertion that the statute\u2019s underlying policy purpose could be discerned, not from legislative history or text, but from a Supreme Court case decided early in the last century. It also depends on the proposition that <em>Petersen </em>and <em>Wilson </em>should be limited to situations in which that policy would be furthered, despite the fact that neither <em>Peterson </em>nor <em>Wilson </em>contains any limiting language. Finally, it depends on the proposition that applying the rule of <em>Petersen </em>and <em>Wilson </em>to the facts of this case, where the six-month time limit began before filing, would in fact undermine the policy objective. We are not persuaded that any of those assumptions is correct. Certainly, not all three are, particularly in light of what the trial court characterized, correctly, as \u201cclear\u201d contrary case law and statutory text. Plaintiff qualified for attorney fees under ORS 742.061.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Defendant\u2019s alternative argument is that the court erred with respect to the amount of fees awarded. That argument has two parts: First, defendant argues that the amount should have been zero dollars; second, it argues that defendant\u2019s hourly rate of $300 per hour was not reasonable. We review these issues for abuse of discretion. ORS 20.075(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In explaining its attorney fee decision, the court wrote in a letter opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cI am not convinced that the court is required to consider the factors listed in ORS 20.075 when the condition precedents under ORS 742.061 are satisfied. Nevertheless, I have considered the factors identified in ORS 20.075(1) and I find that attorney fees in the amount of $25,182.00 are reasonable. It is of particular note that the insurer did not adjust its post-arbitration settlement posture in light of the award of attorney fees and costs but instead chose to make their $6,000 offer *** their full and final offer ***. The hourly rate of $300.00 is reasonable considering the contingency nature of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">We note initially that, the trial court\u2019s doubts to the contrary notwithstanding, the court <em>is </em>required to consider the ORS 20.075 factors even when a plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement to attorney fees under ORS 742.061. ORS 20.075 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201c(1) A court shall consider the following factors in determining whether to award attorney fees in any case in which an award of attorney fees is authorized by statute and in which the court has discretion to decide whether to award attorney fees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c(a) The conduct of the parties in the transactions or occurrences that gave rise to the litigation, including any conduct of a party that was reckless, willful, malicious, in bad faith or illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201c(b) The objective reasonableness of the claims and defenses asserted by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201c(c) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting good faith claims or defenses in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201c(d) The extent to which an award of an attorney fee in the case would deter others from asserting meritless claims and defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u201c(e) The objective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties and their attorneys during the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201c(f) The objective reasonableness of the parties and the diligence of the parties in pursuing settlement of the dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201c(g) The amount that the court has awarded as a prevailing party fee under ORS 20.190.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201c(h) Such other factors as the court may consider appropriate under the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201c(2) A court shall consider the factors specified in subsection (1) of this section in determining the amount of an award of attorney fees in any case in which an award of attorney fees is authorized or required by statute. In addition, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of an award of attorney fees in those cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201c(a) The time and labor required in the proceeding, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved in the proceeding and the skill needed to properly perform the legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">\u201c(b) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment by the attorney would preclude the attorney from taking other cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">\u201c(c) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">\u201c(d) The amount involved in the controversy and the results obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">\u201c(e) The time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">\u201c(f) The nature and length of the attorney\u2019s professional relationship with the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">\u201c(g) The experience, reputation and ability of the attorney performing the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-15\">\u201c(h) Whether the fee of the attorney is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\">\u201c(3) In any appeal from the award or denial of an attorney fee subject to this section, the court reviewing the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>may not modify the decision of the court in making or denying an award, or the decision of the court as to the amount of the award, except upon a finding of an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">\u201c(4) Nothing in this section authorizes the award of an attorney fee in excess of a reasonable attorney fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It is therefore true that a court does <em>not </em>have discretion to decide <em>whether </em>to award attorney fees under ORS 742.061; that statute provides that, if the prerequisites are met, \u201ca reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees <em>shall </em>be taxed as part of the costs of the action and any appeal thereon.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the ORS 20.075(1) factors do not need to be considered in deciding <em>whether </em>to award attorney fees. However, subsection (2) applies to the court\u2019s decision regarding the <em>\u201camount </em>of an award of attorney fees in any case in which an award of attorney fees is authorized <em>or required </em>by statute.\u201d (Emphases added.) In such cases \u2014 including this one under ORS 742.061, which <em>requires </em>an award of fees \u2014 the court <em>\u201cshall </em>consider the factors specified in subsection (1) of this section. *** In addition, the court <em>shall </em>consider the following factors in determining the amount of an award of attorney fees in those cases.\u201d (Emphases added.) Additional factors follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Thus, in determining the amount of attorney fees to be awarded, the court was obligated to consider the relevant factors in both subsection (1) and (2) of ORS 20.075.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, in doing so, the court could in effect negate the command of ORS 742.061(1) (\u201ca reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorney fees shall be taxed\u201d) by determining that a reasonable amount is zero dollars. <em>See State v. Starr, </em>210 Or App 409, 414, 150 P3d 1072 (2007) (\u201cThe trial court entered an order, granting attorney fees and costs in the amount of zero dollars [.]\u201d); <em>accord State v. Nyhuis, </em>251 Or App 768, 772, 284 P3d 1229 (2012) (generally rejecting argument that \u201cnothing\u201d is not \u201can amount\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Both parties in this case cite and rely heavily on <em>Erwin v. Tetreault, </em>155 Or App 205, 214, 964 P2d 277 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 330 (1999), in which this court stated that \u201cthe critical consideration\u201d is \u201c\u2018objective reasonableness.\u2019\u201d Defendant, emphasizing that its offer of $6,000 could not possibly be unreasonable when the jury ultimately awarded plaintiff less than that amount, quotes <em>Erwin: </em>\u201c[A] defendant, who makes an objectively reasonable settlement offer, should not be required to fully fund a plaintiffs unreasonable rejection of that offer and consequent expenditure of fees to secure an incremental gain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff, in response, points out that <em>Erwin </em>also states, \u201cObjective reasonableness must be assessed in light of the parties\u2019 circumstances and knowledge at the time settlement was tendered and rejected and not by some <em>post hoc </em>reference to the result actually obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff then argues that defendant unreasonably refused to raise its $6,000 offer even immediately before trial, at which time it knew that plaintiff\u2019s counsel had received estimates that the case was worth between $10,000 and $50,000 and the arbitrator had awarded plaintiff $11,826.99 in damages. Defendant replies that the appropriate time to gauge reasonableness is, as <em>Erwin </em>states, \u201cat the time settlement was tendered and rejected,\u201d that is, almost a year before the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">To the extent that the parties propose categorical answers to the question of when parties\u2019 conduct should be deemed objectively reasonable, we disagree with both; we conclude, instead, that each case must be decided on its own facts. For example, we can envision situations in which a party\u2019s refusal to negotiate could be objectively unreasonable even after a case has been submitted to a jury. Similarly, we could also envision situations in which a refusal to negotiate even before a complaint is filed could be objectively unreasonable. In the present case, however, we cannot reach any decision. That is so, because the case is remanded to the trial court, which must ultimately make a decision based on the totality of the circumstances \u2014 and some of those circumstances have not yet occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Reversed and remanded on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> The eight-month lapse is significant because, as discussed below, under relevant statutes as currently interpreted by case law, by failing to tender an offer to plaintiff within <em>six </em>months of plaintiffs filing of proof of loss, defendant failed to meet one of the prerequisites for avoiding mandatory attorney fees. <em>See </em>264 Or App at 240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> In <em>Petersen, </em>162 Or App at 466, this court held that the ORS 20.075(1) factors did not apply to cases in which the trial court was required to award fees. In its next session, the legislature amended ORS 20.075 so as to compel courts to consider the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and (2) when \u201can award of attorney fees is authorized <em>or required </em>by statute.\u201d Or Laws 2001, ch 417, \u00a7 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
