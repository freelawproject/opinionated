He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to exclude testimony by the lead detective that defendant asserts was a comment on the credibility of another witness. Defendant did not object to the testimony when it was given, but he contends on appeal that he preserved the error with a pretrial motion that sought to prevent the state\u2019s witnesses from commenting on the credibility of other witnesses. He argues, alternatively, that if the error was not preserved, we should determine that the trial court\u2019s failure to strike the testimony <em>sua sponte </em>is plain error and should exercise our discretion to correct it. We conclude that the error was not preserved and, because it is plausible that defendant had a strategic purpose for not objecting, the trial court\u2019s failure to strike the testimony is not plain error. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that disallowed the introduction of a treatise to impeach a detective\u2019s testimony. Defendant, however, did not preserve that error because he did not make an offer of proof. Finally, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct as plain error the trial court\u2019s failure to cure <em>sua sponte </em>the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law during closing argument that defendant was no longer presumed innocent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Defendant\u2019s original convictions were reversed and remanded for a new trial by the Supreme Court. <em>State v. Salas-Juarez, </em>349 Or 419, 245 P3d 113 (2010). Defendant was retried and again convicted based on events that occurred early one morning, soon after the bars were closed in downtown Medford. While defendant was walking alone, Russell, whom defendant had never met, walked up to defendant. That chance encounter sparked events that resulted in the stabbing of Lunsford, who died in the hospital a couple of hours later, and the attempted stabbing of another victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The events were set in motion when, after leaving a bar, Russell ran into a group of eight to 10 people while walking home and some members of that group shouted out to him, \u201cwhite power\u201d and \u201cwhite pride.\u201d Russell denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>being a racist, and someone in the group shouted out that Russell was a \u201cnigger lover.\u201d Russell continued walking past the group and thereafter encountered defendant, a Hispanic man, who had also just left one of the downtown bars. Russell told defendant that there was a group of people nearby who were racists. Together, defendant and Russell went to confront the group and, upon meeting them, defendant took off his shirt and belt. Defendant started swinging the belt around and yelling obscenities.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Three witnesses \u2014 Lunsford\u2019s brother, Barnett, and Crowley, who was the victim of the attempted stabbing\u2014 testified that both Russell and defendant had knives and took them out during the fight, and that defendant stabbed Lunsford. Barnett stated that Russell was not near Lunsford during the stabbing. Crowley also testified that defendant attacked him with a knife and that he had to lunge away to avoid being stabbed. Russell, for his part, testified that he pulled his knife out to scare off some members of the group that came at him, and, that he had been hit on the back of the head early on in the fight, after which he dropped to the ground and was kicked in the side.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Defendant fled. A few minutes later, he waved down approaching police officers, who arrested and brought defendant to the police station. The police did not find Lunsford\u2019s blood on defendant\u2019s hands or clothes. Defendant did not have a knife and the police did not find a knife in the area where the fight occurred. Later in the investigation, police discovered that defendant had purchased a distinctive knife about two weeks before the stabbing and had carried it in a belted sheath every day, including the day before the early morning stabbing. After the police brought defendant to the police station, defendant talked to them but did not admit to stabbing Lunsford, though he did admit that he had gone with Russell to confront the victims and that he had taken off his belt and used it in the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Shortly after the fight, Russell also ran and was initially not identified by anyone as a participant, as no one knew him. A few days later, the police determined that Russell was the person they were looking for and attempted to interview him. He declined to speak with them and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>invoked his right to counsel. Later, represented by counsel, Russell came forward to give a statement to police about his participation in the fight and what he had witnessed. He disclosed that he had had a knife, which he had brandished during the fight, that someone had punched him in the head and knocked him down, that he had heard someone yell, \u201cHe\u2019s been stabbed,\u201d and that he had run away. Police officers executed a search warrant at Russell\u2019s home and found a t-shirt and shorts that looked like clothes that witnesses had described Russell wearing on the morning of the fight. They also found a black-handled folding knife. Lunsford\u2019s blood was not on those items.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">At trial, defendant\u2019s counsel offered an alternative to the stated version of what happened. He insisted that the eyewitnesses who identified defendant as the stabber mixed up Russell with defendant and that their testimony was not consistent with the objective evidence. According to him, much of Russell\u2019s story was true, except that Russell stabbed Lunsford before getting knocked out of the fight when he was hit on the back of the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We first address defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred when it failed to exclude testimony by the lead detective, Young, commenting on the credibility of another witness, Russell. On direct examination by the prosecutor, Young stated his thoughts about the statement that Russell gave to investigators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: From an investigative standpoint, what was the next thing that occurred during the proffer, that you felt was of interest to you, as a detective, a case agent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\u201c [YOUNG]: That the information I had [at] that point, from the witness statements, to what I knew of the scene, again, this is on August 22nd, <em>I did not find Mr. Russell\u2019s statement to be evasive or </em>\u2014 and <em>it appeared to fit with the circumstances, it appeared to be truthful, to me.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant contends that, under <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983), and <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 629-30, 756 P2d 620 (1988), that statement on Russell\u2019s credibility was impermissible vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we address whether defendant\u2019s claim of error was preserved. To support his contention that he preserved the assigned error, defendant points to his pretrial motion that sought to \u201cpreclud [e] all State witnesses from offering an opinion about the credibility of the defendant or any other witness. <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, [234 P3d 117] (2010); <em>State v Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 284-85, [844 P2d 195] (1993).\u201d Defendant did not provide any further explanation in support of the motion, but the state offered possible context by noting that, in defendant\u2019s first trial, detectives had been cross-examined with accusations that they \u201chad jumped to conclusions\u201d and that their investigation was incomplete, and their credibility had been attacked. The court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">However, that pretrial motion and order did not serve to preserve defendant\u2019s assignment of error. To preserve an argument for appeal, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Defendant does not explain how the pretrial motion \u2014 a generalized statement of the law (as we explain below) that applied to the trial regardless of whether the motion was granted \u2014 satisfied the requirements for preservation, particularly because, in this case, the trial was lengthy \u2014 about two weeks \u2014 and involved dozens of witnesses. Without an objection by defendant to specific testimony and an explanation for that objection, any error was not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention sufficiently so that it could be corrected. Therefore, any error was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Nevertheless, conceding that he did not object or move to strike the vouching comment when it was made, defendant argues that under ORAP 5.45(1), the error is one \u201cof law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his view, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>court was required, in light of Oregon case law that strongly proscribes a witness from commenting on the credibility of another witness, to exclude Young\u2019s testimony <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">An error is plain error if it (1) is legal error; (2) is \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) appears on the record, meaning that \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it [.] \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). In Oregon, testimony commenting on the credibility of a witness is impermissible vouching and plain error. A witness is prohibited from \u201cgiv[ing] an opinion on whether he believes a witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Middleton, </em>294 Or at 438; <em>see State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 285, 844 P2d 195 (1993) (\u201c[A] witness may not testify about the credibility of another witness.\u201d). The Supreme Court amplified the importance of that rule when it stated, \u201cWe have said before, and we will say it again, but this time with emphasis \u2014 we really mean it * * * The assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact[.]\u201d <em>Milbradt, </em>305 Or at 629. Application of the rule is \u201cstraightforward\u201d when \u201cone witness states directly that he or she believes another witness, or that the other witness is honest or truthful.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 357; <em>see State v. Lowell, </em>249 Or App 364, 366-68, 277 P3d 588, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (admission of detective\u2019s testimony that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think that [the defendant] was being very honest\u201d during his interview was plain error). \u201cIn light of <em>Milbradt, </em>this court has held that the trial court has a duty, <em>sua sponte, </em>to prevent testimony that is a comment on a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 177, 180, 308 P3d 352 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 700 (2014) (citing <em>State v. McQuisten, </em>97 Or App 517, 520, 776 P2d 1304 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The state argues that there is a reasonable dispute as to whether Young\u2019s comment \u2014 that Russell\u2019s statement \u201cappeared to be truthful\u201d \u2014 was vouching. That is so, it contends, because such a statement was not necessarily a comment on Russell\u2019s <em>credibility, </em>but rather was offered to show that Russell\u2019s statement fit with other evidence in the investigation. In other words, Russell\u2019s statement had an <em>effect </em>on Young that explained why he continued the investigation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the way that he did.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, according to the state, Young\u2019s testimony had \u201cindependent relevance.\u201d We are not persuaded. Young\u2019s comment that he found Russell\u2019s statement \u201ctruthful\u201d and not \u201cevasive\u201d is a straightforward instance of vouching. That the comment related to his decision-making process for the investigation is of no consequence; investigators routinely make credibility determinations out of court, but that does not create an exception to the prohibition against relaying those credibility determinations in their in-court testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The state also contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to strike Young\u2019s comment was not plain error because it is plausible that defendant\u2019s failure to object was a strategic choice. An error does not qualify as plain error if the record contains a competing inference that the party may have had a strategic purpose for not objecting. <em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 169-70, 130 P3d 780 (2006). We have observed that such a competing inference for purposes of plain error review must be a plausible inference. <em>See State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 512, 228 P3d 688 (2010) (\u201cthe inference [of a strategic reason for not objecting] that the state posits is not plausible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We conclude that it is plausible that defendant chose not to object to Young\u2019s comment because Russell\u2019s statement included assertions of fact that supported defendant\u2019s theory that Russell, not defendant, was the stabber. Indeed, defendant\u2019s counsel pointed out in his opening statement that Russell would testify consistently with defendant\u2019s statements and that his testimony would be believable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cAnd when [Russell] takes the stand, he\u2019s a witness. * * * Russell is going to testify, and a lot of what he testifies, is \u2014 very believable. <em>And </em>\u2014 and <em>we\u2019re going </em>\u2014 we\u2019re <em>going to submit to you, that most, if not everything he says is right. </em>He probably didn\u2019t have a good memory of this incident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>and he gives a good rendition of the facts, and he may not remember stabbing anybody. *** <em>But he </em>\u2014 he <em>is very consistent in other aspects of his </em>\u2014 of <em>his testimony, and </em>\u2014 and <em>I think largely believable, it\u2019s just the fact that the State has penned him in.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">(Emphases added.) In the follow-up to Young\u2019s vouching comment, the detective related, as anticipated by defendant, that many of Russell\u2019s statements matched what defendant had recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Now, we have not seen [defendant\u2019s] statement to Detective Newell, but were many of the statements [defendant] gave to Detective Newell, regarding the events, corroborated by * * * Russell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Such as?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Such as, they did not know each other, or had not met in any way, shape or form, prior to this. And I found that interesting, too, because as I said before, I believed we would have some relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And does * * * Russell specifically confirm [defendant\u2019s] statement about the other guy being knocked down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\u201c[YOUNG]: As far as him being knocked down? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: As far as * * * Russell being knocked down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And he felt, by a belt or a punch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Does he confirm [defendant\u2019s] statement regarding the other guy getting beat up pretty good?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-17\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Does he confirm [defendant\u2019s] statements regarding what clothing he was wearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-18\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-19\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And you confirmed that through the search warrant, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes. The other thing about the proffer, that \u2014 that I found interesting, is \u2014 is Mr. Russell did not appear to basically, clean it up for himself. He admits that he had a knife, and had a knife out at that scene. He did not omit that fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And did he also tell you specifically, that he never saw a knife in [defendant\u2019s] hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c[YOUNG]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Young\u2019s testimony \u2014 that Russell reported that he brandished a knife, was knocked down, and did not see defendant wield a knife \u2014 supports defendant\u2019s theory that Russell engaged with the victims and, though lacking an admission that Russell stabbed Lunsford, is consistent with the view that Russell committed the crime. We agree, therefore, that it is plausible that defendant may have refrained from objecting to Young\u2019s vouching testimony because Russell\u2019s statement, which Young found truthful, contained details about the stabbing that defendant himself asserted made Russell the more probable perpetrator. Under those circumstances, the trial court was not obligated to <em>sua sponte </em>exclude Young\u2019s credibility testimony, and its failure to do so therefore is not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We next turn to defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in preventing him from impeaching the testimony of one of the detectives with the introduction of a treatise about eyewitness investigation, as allowed by OEC 706. For the following reasons, we conclude that defendant did not adequately preserve any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Detective Harris-Powers testified about two eyewitnesses to the stabbing. Crowley, the victim of the attempted stabbing, told her that he had seen defendant fatally stab Lunsford and he identified defendant in a photo lineup. Barnett, who was among the victims, told her that defendant was the person who was closest to Lunsford during the fight and that defendant had stabbed Lunsford. Defendant\u2019s attempt to impeach Harris-Powers\u2019s testimony went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Same scenario, somebody comes in and steals my wallet, but this time points a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>at everybody and leaves. You have heard of what we call weapon focus in your \u2014 in your line of work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">\u201c[HARRIS-POWERS]: I do not think I have ever heard those terms specifically, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. There have been studies on eyewitness testimony, and \u2014 and tell me if you are familiar with this, that when I have *** interaction with you, it is one thing if I have an interaction with you and I do not carry a weapon. It is another, if I have got a knife or a gun in my hand, you are going to focus on that knife or that gun, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201c[HARRIS-POWERS]: I am not familiar with that study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: How long have you been a detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201c[HARRIS-POWERS]: Eight years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Sound right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\u201c [HARRIS-POWERS]: I [t] could happen. I have interviewed numerous people, and people over the years, and everybody seems to focus on different things for whatever reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Tell me if you think this sounds correct, * * * when a weapon is present, witnesses divert their attention away from the perpetrator to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: You can just ask her if she is familiar with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Sure, sure. I am holding *** a book \u2014 *** \u201cEyewitness Identification\u201d and it is a lawyer\u2019s resource for expert testimony written by Roger Terry, PhD. Are you familiar with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-16\">\u201c[HARRIS-POWERS]: I am not, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-17\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Let me read you a portion of it and let me tell you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-18\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Objection, Your Honor, if she is not familiar with it, he cannot impeach her with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Let me \u2014 let me ask you another question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Thus, the trial court did not allow defendant to cross-examine Harris-Powers with the treatise because the detective said that she was unfamiliar with it. Defendant argues that that was error because OEC 706<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows for a treatise established as a reliable authority to be used for impeachment purposes, regardless of whether the witness is familiar with it. He relies on <em>State v. Morgan, </em>251 Or App 99, 107, 284 P3d 496 (2012) (\u201cOEC 706 does not require that the witness being cross-examined be personally familiar with a learned treatise if its reliability is established in another authorized way\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for his contention that a witness need not be familiar with a treatise that is used for impeachment purposes. In <em>Morgan, </em>however, the defendant made an offer of proof. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">To preserve a challenge to the exclusion of evidence, \u201ca party ordinarily must make an offer of proof as to the content of the excluded evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Olmstead, </em>310 Or 455, 459-60, 800 P2d 277 (1990); <em>see </em>OEC 103(1)(b) (a party can assign error to a trial court\u2019s excluding of evidence if \u201cthe substance of the evidence was made known to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked\u201d). If a party fails to provide an offer of proof, the error can be preserved \u201cif \u2018[t]he questions asked and the arguments presented to the court on the issue were adequate to inform the trial court of the substance of the evidence and its error in excluding it.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Lasky, </em>259 Or App 307, 315, 314 P3d 304 (2013) (quoting <em>Schacher v. Dunne, </em>109 Or App 607, 610, 820 P2d 865 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 74 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u201cThe purpose of this rule is to assure that the appellate courts are able to determine whether it was error to exclude the evidence and whether any error was likely to have affected the result of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Affeld, </em>307 Or 125, 128, 764 P2d 220 (1988). Another purpose for the rule is to \u201cassure that the trial court can make an informed decision\u201d because \u201c[a]n offer of proof permits the parties to raise additional arguments, if appropriate, and gives the court an opportunity to reconsider its ruling and correct any error.\u201d <em>Olmstead, </em>310 Or at 461. We do not require an offer of proof if such an offer was \u201cimpossible because of a trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the offer of proof to be <em>made\u201d Affeld, </em>307 Or at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Here, defendant did not make an offer of proof that would allow us to properly evaluate whether the treatise could be used to impeach Harris-Powers. The record shows that defendant desired to introduce a treatise that opined about the unreliability of eyewitness testimony \u2014 specifically, a theory about so-called \u201cweapon focus\u201d \u2014 to call into question the accuracy of Crowley\u2019s and Barnett\u2019s eyewitness accounts. What is not clear, however, is what excerpts from the excluded treatise defense counsel would have used as a basis for his questions to Harris-Powers and what questions, based on those excerpts, he would have asked. To be sure, OEC 706 liberally allows for the introduction of a learned treatise,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but \u201cfor purposes of impeachment[,] *** <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>not * * * as substantive evidence.\u201d In this case, we are unable to determine, because of defendant\u2019s failure to provide an offer of proof or from the context of the attempt to introduce the treatise, how he would have used it to challenge Harris-Powers\u2019s testimony, as opposed to using it as substantive evidence to question the reliability of the investigation\u2019s eyewitness accounts. We therefore conclude that the asserted error was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Lastly, we turn to defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s failure to, <em>sua sponte, </em>take \u201cimmediate, corrective action\u201d when the prosecutor stated \u2014 without objection by defendant \u2014 during closing argument that \u201c[a]s [defendant] sits there, now, he is guilty. Presumption of innocence was at the beginning.\u201d The prosecutor misstated the law, but, as in <em>State v. Sanchez- Jacobo, </em>250 Or App 621, 282 P3d 880 (2012), <em>rev </em>den, 353 Or 280 (2013), and for similar reasons, we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> We reject defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> The state cites <em>State v.

Both cases are inapposite. <em>Odoms </em>concerned \u201ca relevant out-of-court statement,\u201d which, \u201crecounted at trial, generally may not be excluded merely because it is phrased in the form of an opinion.\u201d 313 Or at 83. In <em>Nefstad, </em>a prosecutor cross-examined a witness to impeach him; the prosecutor\u2019s questions were \u201cnot even an indirect comment on defendant[\u2019s] *** guilt.\u201d 309 Or at 556.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> OEC 706 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">\u201cUpon cross-examination, an expert witness may be questioned concerning statements contained in a published treatise, periodical or pamphlet on a subject of history, medicine or other science or art if the treatise, periodical or pamphlet is established as a reliable authority. A treatise, periodical or pamphlet may be established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness, by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. Statements contained in a treatise, periodical or pamphlet established as a reliable authority may be used for purposes of impeachment but may not be introduced as substantive evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b88-9\"> We note that in <em>Morgan, </em>another witness established the treatise at issue as a reliable authority, as required by OEC 706 by testifying that it was an authoritative reference for police officers. 251 Or App at 107-08. In this case, the record does not show that defendant established the treatise as a reliable authority by one of the three methods set out by OEC 706: 1) testimony or admission by the witness; 2) other expert testimony; or 3) judicial notice. Harris-Powers was not familiar with the treatise and could not have established it as reliable. Defendant did not have an expert witness do so, and the trial court did not take judicial notice of its reliability. Regardless of whether defendant made an offer of proof as to the contents of his cross-examination for impeachment purposes, his failure to establish the reliability of the treatise is fatal to his claimed error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\"> Defendant brings to our attention Professor Laird Kirkpatrick\u2019s comments on OEC 706:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\u201cThe writing may be used only for impeachment. Nonetheless, the rule serves an important purpose. It allows a party seeking to impeach an expert with a learned treatise to more easily establish that the treatise is a \u2018reliable authority.\u2019 Rather than being dependent on the testifying expert to acknowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>that the treatise is a reliable authority, the cross examiner can establish its authoritativeness by other means, such as the testimony of other experts (e.g., the party\u2019s own expert) or by requesting the court to take judicial notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW\">Laird C.
