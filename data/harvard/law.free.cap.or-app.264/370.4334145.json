J.</author>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In this criminal case, defendant represented herself at trial and was convicted of several prostitution-related crimes. On appeal, she argues that her convictions should be reversed because she did not knowingly and voluntarily waive her right to counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review for errors of law, <em>State v. Langley, </em>351 Or 652, 666, 273 P3d 901 (2012), and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The procedural facts of this case are as follows. Defendant was charged by information with six counts of attempted prostitution under ORS 167.007 and ORS 161.405, and six counts of unlawful prostitution procurement activity under Portland City Code 14A.40.050. She was represented by a series of six court-appointed attorneys. All of the attorneys had difficulty working with defendant; four of them moved to withdraw as counsel because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Due to concerns about defendant\u2019s mental health, one of the attorneys had defendant evaluated to determine whether she was able to aid and assist in her own defense. On May 3, 2011, the date set for trial, defendant appeared in court with her sixth attorney, Crow, who had filed a motion to withdraw as defendant\u2019s attorney. The prosecutor explained to the court that defendant was \u201crepresented by Mr. Crow, and we have just been up to [the Criminal Procedure Court] \u201d and \u201cwere sent back down here, and a substitution of attorney, or a release of attorney, was denied, Your Honor.\u201d Crow then informed the court that he was \u201cprepared to proceed with trial\u201d but that defendant \u201cmay have something she wants to say to Your Honor.\u201d Defendant then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201c[Crow] hasn\u2019t subpoenaed my main witness. He said the Court wouldn\u2019t allow him to. He didn\u2019t know my criminal record when I came to talk to him yesterday. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cI am facing consecutive charges, and I don\u2019t feel that he has done anything to help me in this matter. I mean he didn\u2019t even know my criminal record the day before trial, and I don\u2019t want him to represent me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">At that point, the trial court explained to defendant that \u201cwhat my job is, is to do trials for this month in misdemeanor cases,\u201d and that \u201cprocedural issues that lead up to those trials\u201d are \u201cresolved by the criminal procedure courts * * * so that when a case comes here they\u2019re ready for trial.\u201d The court explained that it had not seen Crow\u2019s motion to withdraw, because the motion had already been decided by a different judge. A colloquy ensued, which we quote at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I didn\u2019t request for [Crow] to get off my case. He requested to get off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: And he told me that I wasn\u2019t going to be going to court today, that first thing in the morning he was going to get \u2014 he was dropping the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: So I came ill prepared. I\u2019m not dressed for court, I\u2019m not ready for court, and- \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So this is the time that we have set for trial. Your lawyer did a motion to no longer serve as your lawyer. The Court denied that motion so we are ready to proceed for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: So my other options \u2014 Do I have another option?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, you keep talking, and I\u2019m trying to talk and so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019m sorry, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014only one of us can speak and the other one can listen, and that\u2019s the way we need to communicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** So here\u2019s our situation. We are set for trial. You have a lawyer that\u2019s been appointed for you and so that\u2019s the current setup. If you are wishing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>proceed in a different manner, then you need to let me know that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So go ahead. What is it that you\u2019re asking for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: To \u2014 If you\u2019re forcing me to rep \u2014 -in order for me to get a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not forcing you to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Okay. Now, if the Court is\u2014 To me, I don\u2019t feel safe with this attorney. I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s worked on my case, at all. We haven\u2019t even \u2014 We discussed it one time very briefly, and like I said, he hasn\u2019t subpoenaed even my main witness, and I want to testify and we haven\u2019t gone over any of my testimony. I would- \u2014 don\u2019t want to be with \u2014 If I have to go by myself to get a fair trial, I would prefer to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Is that what you\u2019re asking for ? Because the choices here </em>\u2014 We <em>are set for trial today, and the Court\u2019s understanding is that this case originated back in May of 2010, so we are going to trial today.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: So I haven\u2019t even gotten full discovery. No one\u2019s given me none of the evidence. I haven\u2019t gotten to see anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: [Defendant], my job is to act as the trial judge in this case. The Court, not this Judge, but the Court has made rulings on this case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014that have brought it here today for trial, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, and the Court this afternoon, the Criminal Procedure Court Judge, addressed the issue that your lawyer brought to the Court of wanting to withdraw as your lawyer, and the Criminal Procedure Court Judge denied that motion so we\u2019re not revisiting that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">\n<em>\u201cSo here\u2019s the choices. We\u2019re proceeding with trial. [Crow] is going to represent you or you will represent yourself.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>I\u2019ll represent myself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: <em>So you are not wanting him to act as your lawyer; is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>No. Correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So there is currently a motion that has been filed by your lawyer. <em>Are you wanting him to represent you for purposes of that motion and then end his representation, or are you asking that the Court say, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re representing yourself for all purposes from here forward\u2019? Which of those is it that you\u2019re </em>wanting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>I don\u2019t really know. I don\u2019t even understand what you just said to me.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The trial court then clarified that Crow had filed a motion to dismiss based on multiplicity of charges. Defendant responded that she \u201cthought I had three motions filed; one for a change of venue and for \u2014 against [prior bad acts] and one to * * * sever my cases. There should be four motions.\u201d Defendant, Crow, and the court then discussed what other motions had been previously filed by defendant\u2019s other attorneys, which resulted in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: What about the other motions that were supposed to be? So they\u2019re just gone and then those don\u2019t count and I can\u2019t argue those because they disappeared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: We have not said that. <em>All I\u2019m trying to do at this point is initially make the determination whether you want Mr. Crow to represent you any </em>longer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>I don\u2019t want him to represent me, at all, for anything.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014for any purpose whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Any purpose whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. All right. So we will allow you to represent yourself, right? <em>You understand you have a right to be represented by a lawyer here, </em>right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>I don\u2019t understand anything that you\u2019re saying, Your Honor. All I know is that he\u2019s not ready and he\u2019s lied to me already and I don\u2019t want him to be my attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Let\u2019s back up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying; no, I don\u2019t.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. You understand that you\u2019re charged with one, two, three, four, five, six- \u2014 six counts of attempted prostitution and six counts of prostitution procurement, correct? You understand those are the charges, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. You understand the gentleman next to you is Mr. Crow, and he is a lawyer. He\u2019s been appointed by the Court to represent you, right? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>And you understand that you are asking that he not represent you, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>What I\u2019m asking for is a fair trial, and I believe that if he go </em>\u2014 if <em>he is my attorney during this trial, I will not get a fair trial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Okay. So I will take that as a yes, that you\u2019re asking that he not represent you. So we will allow you to proceed forward as </em>\u2014 in <em>your own defense, representing yourself. Okay? And Mr. Crow will no longer have any obligation to represent you on any issue in this case. That\u2019s what you\u2019re asking for, </em>correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: <em>Correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">\u201cSo [the prosecutor] will represent the State, you will represent yourself, and we\u2019ll proceed forward on the case with our trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">Defendant then expressed a desire to subpoena a witness and asked the court for a setover to allow her to prepare her case. The court denied the motion and disputed defendant\u2019s contention that the court was \u201cforcing\u201d her to go to trial. The court excused Crow from the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and stated, \u201cNo, we are not forcing you. We are providing a forum for you to have a trial on the charges that have been brought against you. So Mr. Crow will no longer be representing you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The state indicated that it was ready to proceed with trial, and the court made the following finding on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201cOkay. So I\u2019m going to find, based on all that you\u2019ve told me here so far, that you\u2019re making a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent right to waive the right to counsel here. <em>You understood that you had a right to counsel, you had counsel. </em>You\u2019re asking us not allow \u2014 to not allow him to represent you and so we\u2019re going to go ahead and find that, as we said, you\u2019ve made a knowing, voluntary, intelligent waiver of your right to counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Defendant proceeded to represent herself with regard to the pending motions, maintaining at various points that she was being forced to represent herself and was unable to understand what the prosecutor and trial court were talking about. The court denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motions and allowed the state to introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s previous convictions for prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Defendant then represented herself throughout the course of the jury trial. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s \u201cleeway\u201d and attempts to explain certain procedural aspects of the trial (such as the difference between direct examination and cross-examination), defendant often (including during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument) repeated her concerns that she did not understand the procedure and did not want to be <em>pro se. </em>The court, each time, explained that it had already found that defendant had knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel, and that it would not revisit the question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury convicted defendant of two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>attempted prostitution (Counts 1 and 11) and five counts of unlawful prostitution procurement activity (Counts 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12), and acquitted her of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s ruling that she knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel. Defendant argues that she did not voluntarily choose to represent herself; she contends that she was forced to represent herself rather than accept counsel whom she reasonably believed was ill-prepared for trial. She further argues that, even assuming that her choice was voluntary, it was not knowingly made because the record does not demonstrate that she understood the risks of self-representation. In response, the state argues that defendant voluntarily waived her right to counsel by \u201cconsistently and repeatedly\u201d insisting on representing herself. The state further argues that defendant\u2019s waiver was knowingly made because, although the trial court did not advise defendant of the risks of self-representation, the record establishes that defendant was aware of particular risks \u2014 including the charges against her, the penalty she faced, and the fact that she had not subpoenaed witnesses \u2014 and that she was aware of certain benefits counsel could provide \u2014 including access to discovery and knowledge of how to argue motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, a defendant has the right \u201cto be heard by himself and counsel * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A defendant may waive the right to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>represented by counsel in a criminal proceeding, but the waiver \u201cmust be voluntarily and intelligently made.\u201d <em>State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 132, 831 P2d 666 (1992). \u201cVoluntarily\u201d refers to whether the waiver is an intentional act that is not coerced, whereas \u201cintelligently\u201d refers to \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132 n 8 (emphasis added). Whether there has been an intentional and knowing waiver of counsel \u201cdepend [s] on the particular circumstances of each case, including the defendant\u2019s age, education, experience, and mental capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is \u201cthe intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right, [a] trial court should focus on what <em>the defendant </em>knows and understands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In order to validly waive counsel, a defendant must not only know that he or she has the right to counsel, the defendant must understand the risks of self-representation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u201cA colloquy on the record between the court and the defendant wherein the court, in some fashion, explains the risks of self-representation is the preferred means of assuring that the defendant understand the risks of self-representation. The more relevant information that a trial court provides to a defendant about the right to counsel and about the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, the more likely it will be that a defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege and that the record will so demonstrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 133. However, \u201cArticle I, section 11, does not require a catechism by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134. \u201cThe failure of a trial court to impart a particular piece of information to a defendant will not, of itself, require reversal of a conviction if the record as a whole shows that the defendant knew of his or her right to counsel and that the waiver of counsel was an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of that known right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, <em>Meyrick </em>does not require that a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>know and completely appreciate every potential risk of self-representation in his or her case. Nor does <em>Meyrick </em>prescribe particular risks that a defendant must understand.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>172 Or App 414, 423, 19 P3d 925 (2001). \u201cConversely, however, a defendant\u2019s abstract knowledge that there may be risks and disadvantages of self-representation, without any appreciation of what those risks might be, is insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c\u2018Understanding\u2019 under <em>Meyrick </em>means that a defendant, in the totality of the circumstances, substantially appreciates the material risks of self-representation in his or her case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Accordingly, we have held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s general awareness that a lawyer might be helpful is not sufficient to establish a knowing waiver of counsel. <em>See, e.g., State v. Erb, </em>256 Or App 416, 423, 300 P3d 270 (2013) (defendant\u2019s written waiver of counsel, which stated that she was \u201caware of the help a lawyer might be to me,\u201d was insufficient to establish that the defendant was aware of the risks of self-representation); <em>State v. Reed, </em>247 Or App 155, 161-62, 268 P3d 756 (2011) (evidence that defendant had appeared at prior probation violation hearings, both with and without counsel, was insufficient to show a knowing waiver of counsel); <em>State v. Massey, </em>160 Or App 197, 199, 981 P2d 352 (1999) (evidence that defendant had worked as a paralegal, had been involved in several civil lawsuits before the commencement of his criminal case, and had been represented by several different lawyers in the criminal case was insufficient to establish that defendant understood the risks of proceeding <em>pro se); State v. Richardson, </em>159 Or App 592, 600-01, 978 P2d 435, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 479 (1999) (trial court\u2019s statement that \u201ca lawyer may be able to assist you in challenging the indictment\u201d was insufficient under <em>Meyrick); State v. Chambers, </em>150 Or App 336, 339, 946 P2d 300 (1997) (instructing a <em>pro se </em>defendant as to the importance of subpoenaing witnesses and that he should \u201cget some help from an attorney or somebody on how to make sure you get that done\u201d was inadequate to assure that defendant was aware of the risks of self-representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Similarly, we have held that a trial court\u2019s statement to a defendant that she \u201cmay be at a disadvantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>without a lawyer\u201d and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgement that she \u201cmay be\u201d did not demonstrate that the defendant adequately understood the risks of self-representation. <em>Erb, </em>256 Or App at 423; <em>see also State v. Culver, </em>198 Or App 267, 270-71, 108 P3d 104 (2005) (colloquy in which the trial court asked the defendant whether he understood that he would be \u201cat a disadvantage\u201d if he represented himself was insufficient under <em>Meyrick)', State v. Meyer, </em>116 Or App 80, 84, 840 P2d 1357 (1992) (trial court\u2019s warning that jury trials are \u201ckinda tricky\u201d did not adequately inform defendant of the risks of self-representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In this case, the trial court did not speak to defendant about the risks of self-representation. As recounted above, the court focused on whether defendant wanted to be represented by Crow or proceed <em>pro se. </em>The colloquy between the court and defendant was focused entirely on which of those options defendant wanted. The court asked defendant, \u201cYou understand you have a right to be represented by a lawyer here, right?\u201d When defendant responded that she did not \u201cunderstand anything that you\u2019re saying, Your Honor,\u201d the court went over the charges with defendant (\u201cYou understand that you\u2019re charged with * * * six counts of attempted prostitution and six counts of prostitution procurement, correct?\u201d), and asked defendant whether she understood that \u201cthe gentleman next to you is Mr. Crow, and he is a lawyer.\u201d The court then asked defendant, \u201cAnd you understand that you are asking that he not represent you, correct?\u201d When defendant then reiterated that she did not believe she would get a fair trial with Crow as her attorney, the court replied, \u201cOkay. So I will take that as a yes, that you\u2019re asking that he not represent you,\u201d and released Crow from his duty to represent defendant. At no point during that colloquy \u2014 or at any point before defendant purportedly waived her right to counsel \u2014 did the trial court discuss the risks of self-representation or determine whether defendant understood those risks. That failure to even mention any of the risks of self-representation, or put on the record any facts indicating that defendant understood the risks, is akin to the circumstances that we have described as <em>prima facie </em>error. <em>E.g., Erb, </em>256 Or App at 423 (holding that the trial court had committed <em>prima facie </em>error where \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>comment regarding the disadvantages of self-representation was extremely general\u201d and \u201c [t]he court did not offer any warnings regarding the specific risks of self-representation, nor did it ask defendant any questions that would have revealed the extent of defendant\u2019s knowledge of those risks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Nonetheless, the state argues that the record \u201cshows that before [defendant] waived her right to counsel, she was aware of the following risks\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u201c\u2022 that she had been charged with six counts of attempted prostitution and six counts of prostitution procurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c\u2022 that she faced \u2018six months\u2019 on one of the charges; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201c\u2022 that she had the right to call witnesses, and that she had not subpoenaed a witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">(Footnotes and record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Furthermore, the state argues, defendant was aware of the following \u201cbenefits counsel could provide\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">\u201c\u2022 she knew that she intended to be a primary witness and would want to testify, but that she had not discussed her testimony with counsel yet;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">\u201c\u2022 that defense counsel had access to discovery and evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">\u201c\u2022 that she had several (at least three) pretrial motions for the court, including a motion to change venue, and that she was \u2018not an attorney\u2019 and \u2018[did not] know how to argue\u2019 such a motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">(Footnotes and record citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">We are not persuaded that defendant\u2019s awareness of those risks is sufficient to demonstrate that she understood the risks <em>inherent in self-representation. </em>Awareness of the first two risks that the state identifies \u2014 the charges against her and the potential penalty \u2014 might suggest that defendant understood, in an abstract sense, the consequences of trial, but it does not demonstrate that she understood any of the added risk inherent in proceeding without counsel. Nor is defendant\u2019s awareness of the difficulty in securing witness testimony sufficient to demonstrate that she understood the danger of self-representation. In fact, we have stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>even a trial court\u2019s explicit instruction to a <em>pro se </em>defendant as to the importance of subpoenaing witnesses, and warning that he should \u201cget some help from an attorney or somebody on how to make sure you get that done,\u201d would have been inadequate to convey the \u201cdangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>150 Or App at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Defendant\u2019s awareness of certain benefits of counsel are, on this record, also insufficient to demonstrate that she understood the risks inherent in self-representation. The first two benefits of counsel identified by the state are services that, in defendant\u2019s view, her appointed attorney had not provided. Defendant\u2019s decision to proceed without counsel was based, in large part, on her belief that Crow was unprepared because he had refused to subpoena her witness and had not spoken with her about her testimony. Thus, even though she was aware that attorneys can provide those benefits, it does not follow on this record that she understood how self-representation \u2014 as opposed to keeping Crow as her attorney \u2014 posed inherent risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Finally, defendant\u2019s awareness that attorneys, unlike herself, would know how to argue motions is not, on this record, sufficient to demonstrate the level of awareness of the risk of self-representation that is required for a knowing waiver of the right to counsel. As explained above, in the absence of a sufficient warning about the dangers of self-representation or specific information about the benefits of counsel, we have consistently rejected the argument that a generalized understanding of a lawyer\u2019s services demonstrates knowledge of the risks of self-representation. <em>See Erb, </em>256 Or App at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In sum, where a trial court puts a defendant to the type of choice that was offered <em>here </em>\u2014 i.e., keep your attorney or proceed <em>pro se </em>\u2014 the court must determine that the defendant understands the risks of self-representation, to ensure that the waiver of the right to counsel is an intelligent relinquishment of that right. Because the trial court did not engage in a colloquy with defendant about those risks, and the record does not otherwise establish that defendant sufficiently understood them, we must reverse and remand. Although the record reflects that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>was extremely patient with defendant, who made repeated outbursts during trial, that patience does not remedy the prejudice that resulted from proceeding to trial without an attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion for a continuance; by accepting inconsistent verdicts from the jury; and by failing to grant her motion for a judgment of acquittal on certain counts. In light of our remand, we need not address the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance or its acceptance of the jury\u2019s verdicts. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments regarding her motions for a judgment of acquittal because they raise unpreserved claims of error that do not constitute error apparent on the record. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355-56, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (setting forth the requirements for plain-error review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\"> Toward the end of trial, defendant presented a motion requesting appointed counsel, which the court denied. The court explained that it was denying that motion for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201call of the reasons that we have given before, finding that you made a knowing, voluntary, intelligent right to your waiver of a right to counsel after having had at least six court-appointed lawyers prior to beginning the trial and having had Judge Fuchs deny your motion just before the trial started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>for \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, it wasn\u2019t your motion, your attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw, and that motion was denied by Judge Puchs, the criminal procedure court judge because, for the record, in Multnomah County, that\u2019s how we proceed on such a motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201cWhen we get that kind of motion it\u2019s decided by the criminal procedure court judge, so then you folks came back down after that motion was denied and then you informed the Court that you wanted to proceed without that lawyer, and we told you what the two choices were. You would have that lawyer represent you or you could proceed and represent yourself, and you chose to represent yourself after a full discussion of that issue, so that motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In response to defendant\u2019s contention that she had only four lawyers on her case, the court explained that its \u201cruling on whether you knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived your right to counsel * * * had nothing to do with whether you\u2019ve had four lawyers or six lawyers so it\u2019s not a factor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> Defendant also argues that she did not validly waive her right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>conclude that defendant did not validly waive her Article I, section 11, right to counsel, we do not reach that argument or further discuss the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b403-5\"> The state has not suggested that the court\u2019s ruling on the waiver of counsel, if error, was harmless. Suffice it to say that, given the nature of the evidence, the arguments presented at trial, and the conduct of the trial generally, we are unable to tell what the outcome of defendant\u2019s case would have been if she had been represented by counsel. <em>See Erb, </em>256 Or App at 427 (applying the test for harmless error in a similar context).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\"> Because we remand on the ground that the state failed to establish that defendant\u2019s waiver was made knowingly, we do not address her contention that the waiver was not voluntary and that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s \u2018choice\u2019 to defendant to proceed to trial with court-appointed counsel or represent herself was impermissible\u201d under <em>Langley, </em>351 Or 662.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
