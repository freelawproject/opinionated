J.</author>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. He appeals, raising four assignments of error. In his first and second assignments, he asserts that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence. We reject those assignments without published discussion. In his third and fourth assignments, he asserts that the court erred in imposing $18,000 in court-appointed attorney fees and an $18,000 indigent contribution. Defendant acknowledges that those claims of error are unpreserved but asks us to review and correct them as \u201cplain error,\u201d that is, as errors of law \u201capparent on the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, we agree with defendant that the trial court erred in imposing the challenged financial obligations, that the errors are plain, and that it is appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to correct them.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Under ORS 151.505 and ORS 161.665, a trial court may order a defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees and other costs. However, in order for a court to do so, there must be evidence that the defendant \u201cis or may be able to pay\u201d the fees and costs. ORS 151.505(3) (so providing); ORS 161.665(4) (same). \u201cA court cannot impose fees based on pure speculation that a defendant has funds to pay the fees or may acquire them in the future.\u201d <em>State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 634, 284 P3d 573 (2012); <em>see State v. Kanuch, </em>231 Or App 20, 22, 217 P3d 1082 (2009) (trial court erred in imposing $15,000 in court-appointed attorney fees on the defendant, who had been convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years, where there was no evidence that the defendant was or might be able to pay the fees). The state bears the burden of proving that a defendant is or may be able to pay fees. <em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In this case, defendant was charged with a murder committed in 2011, and he applied for court-appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>counsel. The trial court waived the $20 application fee and appointed counsel for defendant. Defendant\u2019s case proceeded to a bench trial, where his defense was that he killed the victim as a result of an extreme emotional disturbance. <em>See </em>ORS 163.135 (providing for extreme emotional disturbance defense to murder). In support of his defense, defendant presented an expert witness who testified about defendant\u2019s history of depression and alcohol abuse, among other things. The trial court found defendant guilty and sentenced him to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. At sentencing, the court ordered defendant to pay $673 in assessments, $4,000.73 in restitution, a $9,327 fine, $18,000 in court-appointed attorney fees, and an $18,000 indigent contribution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not address whether defendant was able to pay the ordered amounts or might be able to pay them in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">As mentioned, on appeal, defendant asserts that the trial court committed plain error by ordering him to pay the court-appointed attorney fees and indigent contribution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to defendant, \u201cthe record contains no evidence to support a finding that defendant had the ability to pay his attorney fees and other expenses incurred in his defense.\u201d He contends that the only evidence regarding his ability to pay was that he was 45<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> years old, had a history of underemployment and unemployment due to his depression and alcohol abuse, and was facing a sentence of life ijnprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In response, the state asserts that the trial court did not commit plain error because \u201cnothing in this record tends to show that the defendant was unemployable.\u201d \u201cTo the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>contrary,\u201d the state asserts, \u201cthe record shows that defendant had held good jobs in the past.\u201d In support of its assertion, the state quotes a portion of the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert witness where the witness said that defendant had \u201cseveral fairly good jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Whether there is sufficient evidence for a trial court to find that a defendant is or may be able to pay fees or other costs under ORS 151.505 or ORS 161.665 is a question of law, which we review for errors of law. <em>See Bacote v. Johnson, </em>333 Or 28, 33-34, 35 P3d 1019 (2001). In order for the erroneous imposition of fees or other costs to constitute \u201cplain error,\u201d the error must be apparent on the face of the record. That is, the relevant facts and legal error must be clear from the record itself. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (ruling that an unpreserved error is reviewable as \u201cplain error\u201d if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the legal point is obvious \u2014 that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) to reach the error, \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">At the outset, we reject the state\u2019s argument that the trial court did not err because \u201cnothing in this record tends to show that the defendant was unemployable.\u201d As we have held, accepting such an argument would impermissibly \u201cshift [ ] the burden of proof to defendant\u201d by requiring \u201cdefendant to demonstrate that he or she <em>cannot </em>pay attorney fees.\u201d <em>Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 716 (emphasis added); <em>see also Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App at 635 n 6 (\u201c[T]he state bears the burden of proving that a defendant is or may be able to pay attorney fees. A defendant is not required to prove that he or she is unable to pay them.\u201d) (Citations omitted.)); <em>Kanuch, </em>231 Or App at 24 (rejecting argument that a court can impose attorney fees \u201cunless a defendant demonstrates that he or she cannot pay them\u201d). Thus, whether the trial court erred depends on whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was or might be able to pay the $18,000 court-appointed attorney fees and the $18,000 indigent contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We conclude that the trial court committed plain error; the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was or might be able to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the court-appointed attorney fees or indigent contribution. First, there was no evidence from which the court could find that defendant was able to pay the challenged financial obligations; the record contains no evidence that defendant had financial resources that would enable him to pay the substantial obligations. Second, there was no evidence from which the trial court could find, without speculating, that defendant might acquire such resources in the future. Defendant was 52 years old at the time of sentencing, and he was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. It is speculative whether he will ever be released, and it is even more speculative that, if he is released, he might be able to obtain employment that would enable him to pay the $18,000 court-appointed attorney fees and the $18,000 indigent contribution, particularly in light of his history, age, and other court-imposed financial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The state points out that defendant\u2019s expert witness testified that defendant had \u201cseveral fairly good jobs\u201d in the past, but that testimony \u2014 read in full \u2014 is insufficient to support a finding that defendant might be able to pay the challenged financial obligations in the future. While describing defendant\u2019s problems with depression and alcohol abuse and the effects of those problems on his employment, the witness testified that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201chad a period of time where he worked in construction; had several fairly good jobs and then that\u2019s the point where he just couldn\u2019t function any longer and started working for temp agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">According to the witness, \u201cthe point where [defendant] just couldn\u2019t function any longer\u201d occurred in the early \u201c2000s,\u201d approximately a decade before defendant\u2019s crime, trial, and sentencing. Consistent with the witness\u2019s testimony, the trial court found that defendant had \u201ca long history of depression and substance abuse,\u201d \u201cdifficulties holding down jobs for extended periods of time,\u201d and \u201c[flinancial problems due to underemployment, or unemployment.\u201d Thus, although there was evidence that defendant \u201chad several fairly good jobs\u201d in the past, those jobs were too distant in time to support a finding that defendant might be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>pay the court-appointed attorney fees and indigent contribution. <em>See State v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App 346, 348, 332 P3d 338 (2014) (rejecting \u201c[t]he [state\u2019s] argument that, with court-ordered alcohol and mental health treatment, [the] defendant would be employable in the future\u201d because it \u201cfails to account for the facts that [the] defendant is homeless, mentally ill, and on a immigration hold with the likelihood of being deported\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Thus, the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to support a finding that defendant had the financial resources or employment opportunities that would enable him to pay the challenged financial obligations at the time of sentencing, and it was also insufficient to support a finding that that he might acquire those resources or opportunities during or after his lengthy prison term. Therefore, the trial court committed plain error by imposing the court-appointed attorney fees and indigent contribution. <em>See Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 716.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Having determined that the court committed plain error, we turn to the question whether we should exercise our discretion to review and correct the error. \u201cWhen a plain error is established, we still must determine if it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error, considering, among other things, The gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way.\u2019\u201d <em>Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 716-17 (quoting <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991)). In <em>Coverstone, </em>we exercised our discretion to reverse the trial court\u2019s imposition of court-appointed attorney fees, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u201cAs defendant points out, the error is grave. Defendant was ordered to pay $8,000, a substantial sum. Moreover, contrary to the state\u2019s view, this is not a case where, had it been alerted to the issue, the trial court could easily have determined that defendant could or would be able to pay the fees. The record contains no evidence of any financial resources available to defendant. And, defendant was sentenced to a lengthy prison term \u2014 375 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">260 Or App at 717.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">For reasons similar to those in <em>Coverstone, </em>we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the erroneous imposition of court-appointed attorney fees and the indigent contribution in this case. The errors are grave, in that defendant was ordered to pay a substantial sum, $18,000 in court-appointed attorney fees and an additional $18,000 indigent contribution, for a total of $36,000 in addition to the approximately $14,000 in other financial obligations. And, this is not a case in which the trial court could have made the necessary finding regarding ability to pay if the issue had been brought to its attention; as discussed above, there was no evidence that defendant was able to pay the court-appointed attorney fees or might be able to pay them in the future. <em>See Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App at 349 (noting that, in that case, \u201cwhile there is some speculative evidence that [the] defendant might find work in the future, the actual evidence is to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees and indigent contribution reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> ORAP 5.45(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> The court did not specify the basis for the indigent contribution.

Similarly, under ORS 161.665, in cases in which a defendant has been convicted, a court can order the defendant to pay costs, including \u201ca reasonable attorney fee for counsel *** and a reasonable amount for fees and expenses incurred pursuant to preauthorization under ORS 135.055.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> Defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s imposition of the assessments, restitution, or fine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"><em> </em>Although defendant\u2019s brief states that he was 45 years old at the time of sentencing, the record reflects that defendant was born on June 28, 1960, and was therefore 52 years old at the time of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\"> <em>See also State v.
