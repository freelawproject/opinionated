He failed to comply with the terms of that probation by, in the words of the trial court, presenting \u201cpositive U. A.\u2019s, resisting arrest, [and] faking medical issues.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of those violations, the trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to a net of 60 months\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision. The trial court denied defendant AIP eligibility on the ground that defendant\u2019s probation history demonstrated that defendant was not a \u201cgood fit\u201d for an AIP and that defendant did not have \u201cany chance of completing the program.\u201d In so doing, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s contention that it was required to find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny AIP eligibility to defendant. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for AIPs, arguing that ORS 137.750(1) required the trial court to find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny eligibility, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that the trial court erred by not making those findings. We review for legal error the trial court\u2019s determination that it was not required to find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny eligibility for AIPs, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Had defendant committed his offenses before January 1, 2009, he would be correct about what findings the trial court needed to make to deny AIP eligibility. Before that date, ORS 137.750(1) (1997), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 2 (Spec Sess), governed the determination of whether a defendant was eligible for AIPs, among other things. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201cWhen a court sentences a defendant to a term of incarceration upon conviction of a crime, the court shall order on the record in open court as part of the sentence imposed that the defendant may be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release, <em>alternative incarceration program </em>or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which the defendant is otherwise eligible at the time of sentencing, <em>unless the court finds on the record in open court substantial and compelling reasons to order that the defendant not be considered for such leave, release or programs\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">ORS 137.750(1) (1997) (emphases added). That is, the statute <em>required </em>a trial court to order a defendant\u2019s eligibility for, among other things, AIPs, <em>unless </em>the trial court found \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In 2008, the legislature changed the process for determining eligibility for AIPs by passing House Bill (HB) 3638.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That measure (1) amended ORS 137.750 to eliminate all references to AIPs<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) enacted ORS 137.751 to govern AIP eligibility going forward. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>(Spec Sess) (removing references to AIPs in ORS 137.750); Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 1 (Spec Sess) (enacting ORS 137.751). The newly-enacted statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201c(1) When a court sentences a defendant to a term of incarceration that exceeds one year, <em>the defendant may request a determination of the defendant\u2019s eligibility for release on post-prison supervision under ORS 421.508 (4).[</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>The court <em>shall order </em>in the judgment that the Department of Corrections may release the defendant on post-prison supervision under ORS 421.508 (4) <em>only if, after a hearing, the court finds that:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201c(a) The defendant meets the eligibility requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201c(b) The defendant was not on probation, parole or post-prison supervision for an offense listed in ORS 137.712 (4) or 811.705 (2)(b) at the time of the commission of the current crime of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\u201c(c) The defendant has not previously been released on post-prison supervision under ORS 421.508 (4);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201c(d) The harm or loss caused by the crime is not greater than usual for that type of crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201c(e) The crime was not part of an organized criminal operation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">\u201c(f) After considering the nature of the offense and the harm to the victim, the defendant\u2019s successful completion of the program would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">\u201c(A) Increase public safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">\u201c(B) Enhance the likelihood that the defendant would be rehabilitated; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">\u201c(C) Not unduly reduce the appropriate punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au3\">ORS 137.751(1) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>As a result of the passage of HB 3638, ORS 137.750(1) no longer governs a trial court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIPs; ORS 137.751(1) does. And, under that statute, a trial court is no longer obligated to consider a defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIPs at the time of sentencing; instead, it is up to the defendant to affirmatively request such consideration. <em>See </em>ORS 137.751(1) (providing that \u201cthe defendant <em>may request </em>a determination of the defendant\u2019s eligibility for release on post-prison supervision\u201d (emphasis added)). Additionally, the state no longer must prove \u2014 and a trial court no longer must find \u2014 \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny eligibility; rather, the burden is on the defendant to show that the specified eligibility requirements are met. If the court agrees, it must make findings with respect to those statutory requirements. <em>See </em>ORS 137.751(l)(a)-(f) (specifying requisite findings for an order of eligibility). As one proponent of the measure, the public safety advisor to then-Governor Kulongoski, explained to legislators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that we are <em>reversing the presumption which is now on the state </em>to prove by clear and compelling circumstances that the defendant should not be eligible. What we\u2019re doing in section one is saying that <em>the burden is the defendant\u2019s to articulate why they should be considered </em>and, with respect to those findings that the court needs to make, if all of the other eligibility requirements are met, that\u2019s going to be an issue of judicial discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Testimony, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 3638, Feb 15, 2008 (statement of Joe O\u2019Leary) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Again, as a result of these legislative changes, a trial court is no longer required to find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny eligibility for AIPs. For that reason, the trial court in this case correctly concluded that it was not required to find \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIPs, and did not err by denying eligibility for AIPs without making such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> AIPs are prison programs that the Department of Corrections (DOC) offers to select offenders. As DOC rules explain, an AIP is a \u201chighly structured corrections program that includes intensive interventions, rigorous personal responsibility and accountability, physical labor, and service to the community.\u201d OAR 291-062-0110(1). AIPs have two phases: (1) a 180-day residential phase, and (2) a 90-day \u201cnon-prison/transitional leave\u201d phase. Offenders who complete a full AIP are eligible for sentence reductions. Oregon Department of Corrections, Issue Brief - 2013, <em>Alternative Incarceration Programs </em>(May 23, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In referring to a trial court\u2019s determination regarding \u201celigibility for AIPs\u201d and \u201cAIP eligibility,\u201d we refer to the trial court\u2019s decision under ORS 137.751 as to whether an offender is eligible for early release under ORS 421.508(4) following the successful completion of an AIP. Ultimately, the DOC determines which offenders can participate in AIPs. ORS 421.508(l)(a). However, absent a trial court\u2019s determination under ORS 137.751 of eligibility for release under ORS 421.508(4), an offender is not eligible for early release as a result of participation in an AIP. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> The record reflects that defendant faked a heart attack to avoid submitting a required urine sample.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> Defendant is not the only one to have overlooked this statutory change in procedure. <em>See State v.
