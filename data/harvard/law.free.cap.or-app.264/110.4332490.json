The order permitted petitioners\u2019 neighboring landowner, Lytle, to maintain a reservoir in a stream that runs on his property as well as petitioners\u2019 properties, with certain conditions. The circuit court set aside and remanded the order on the basis that Lytle\u2019s permit application was substantively deficient and that the department had misapplied the relevant statute, ORS 537.409, when it concluded otherwise. Petitioners now ask this court to reverse and remand the order on additional grounds. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. Petitioners, Noble and Hillison, each own property along a stream. The stream is an unnamed tributary to Beaver Creek, which flows into the Willamette River near Oregon City. Respondent Lytle also owns property along the stream, downstream from Noble and upstream from Hillison. A small dam along the stream on Lytle\u2019s property creates a reservoir. Lytle\u2019s reservoir was created sometime before he purchased his property in 1975. Lytle applied to the department for a reservoir permit under ORS 537.409, a statute that establishes an \u201calternate\u201d and expedited permit application process for qualifying small reservoirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The owner of a small reservoir may apply for a permit for the reservoir under ORS 537.409 if, in addition to satisfying other criteria not at issue on appeal, the reservoir does not \u201cpose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources as determined by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife\u201d and does not \u201cinjure any existing water right[.]\u201d ORS 537.409(1). An application must include sufficient information to demonstrate that the reservoir meets those criteria. ORS 537.409(2). During a 60-day period after public notice of the application, any person may submit written comments and may request that the department deny the application on the basis that the reservoir \u201c[w]ould pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources\u201d or \u201c[w]ould result in injury to an existing water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>right [.]\u201d ORS 537.409(5). In response to such a request, the department must conduct a public-interest review of the reservoir application. ORS 537.409(6). That review is limited to \u201cissues pertaining to *** [w]ater availability[,] *** [potential detrimental impact to existing fishery resources!,] and *** [potential injury to existing water rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Within 180 days of receiving a permit application, the department must issue a final order \u201cgranting or denying the permit or granting the permit with conditions.\u201d ORS 537.409(7). If the department does not find \u201cinjury or impact under subsection (6) * * * [and] issues a final order under subsection (7) * * * allowing the issuance of a permit,\u201d the order is subject to review as provided in ORS chapter 183 as an order in other than a contested case. ORS 537.409(9)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Here, upon receiving Lytle\u2019s application, the department sent comment forms to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (Fish and Wildlife) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (Environmental Quality) regarding the issues of harm to fishery resources and water rights. In response to the department\u2019s solicitation, a Fish and Wildlife fish biologist, Faucera, submitted comments to the department concluding that, although fish were present in the creek fed by the stream, Lytle\u2019s proposed reservoir would not \u201cpose a significant detrimental impact to an existing fishery resource!.]\u201d Faucera also indicated that certain specific conditions \u2014 namely, limiting the period of use of the reservoir from November through March and requiring installation of state-approved fish-screening and by-pass devices prior to diversion of any water \u2014 could be applied \u201cto mitigate the detrimental impact to an existing fishery resource [.]\u201d The Environmental Quality representative, Karen Williams, stated in her comments that she did not know whether the reservoir would \u201cpose a significant detrimental impact to an existing fishery resource\u201d because, \u201c [according to [the department\u2019s] maps, a dam blocks fish passage to Beaver Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Petitioners submitted comments to the department opposing issuance of the permit on the bases that the proposed reservoir \u201cwould have a significant detrimental impact on the fishery resource of the Unnamed Stream\u201d and \u201calso <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>would injure existing water rights.\u201d Petitioners requested that the department deny the application. Petitioners also requested that, if the department nevertheless determined that it would grant the permit, that the permit \u201cbe conditioned to limit the season of use to winter months (November through February), to require mechanisms for release of water during non-winter months, and to require structures sufficient to provide fish passage in all seasons.\u201d Petitioners further requested that the permit also be \u201cconditioned to require suitable measuring devices, to require measuring and reporting by the permit holder, and to require mechanisms sufficient to ensure passage of water in excess of any legal impoundment rights.\u201d According to petitioners, the \u201clatter conditions are necessary to make proper regulation of the permit possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Following a public-interest review, the department issued an order (Order #1) granting Lytle a permit. The permit required Lytle to adhere to the conditions suggested by Faucera \u2014 limitation of use to the months of November through March and installation, maintenance, and operation of fish-screening and by-pass devices consistent with department standards \u2014 as well as additional conditions requiring that Lytle provide for \u201cmeans to evacuate water when determined necessary by the Water Resources Director to satisfy prior downstream water rights * * * [and] pass all live flow outside the storage season described * * * \u201d The permit also granted the department the discretion to require Lytle to install a measuring device and to measure and report water use information. The department concluded that, as conditioned, the reservoir \u201cwill not injure any existing water rights and does not pose potential detrimental impacts to existing fishery resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Petitioners sought judicial review of Order #1. However, the parties subsequently agreed to try to resolve the dispute through mediation. Pursuant to that agreement, the department withdrew Order #1 and, along with it, Lytle\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The mediation failed and the department reprocessed Lytle\u2019s application. The department solicited and received comments from the local watermaster as well as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>second set of comments from Faucera at Fish and Wildlife. The watermaster concluded that the proposed reservoir had \u201cthe potential to injure existing water rights [,]\u201d but that conditions could \u201cbe applied to mitigate the potential injury to existing water rights [.]\u201d Regarding mitigation, the water-master opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u201cBased on my experience with this stream and Beaver Creek mainstem, Nov 1 - May 31 is a more realistic storage season. Both streams are regulated every year to satisfy senior rights. Permit should be conditioned to limit storage to that period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cAlso, condition with a staff gage that measures the entire range and stage between full reservoir level and dead pool storage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In Faucera\u2019s new round of comments, she stated that she had observed that various fish were present in the stream and that the reservoir \u201cmay impact water quality in downstream waters, which may impact native fish.\u201d Faucera concluded that the proposed reservoir would \u201cpose a significant detrimental impact to an existing fishery resource\u201d and, more specifically, that \u201c[a]ny diversion or appropriation of water for storage during the period June through October poses a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.\u201d Faucera also concluded that the same conditions that she had proposed previously \u2014 limitation of use to certain months and installation of fish screening and by-pass devices \u2014 would \u201cmitigate the significant detrimental impact\u201d and \u201chelp protect downstream waters and fish populations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The department then issued a second final order (Order #2) granting Lytle a permit, concluding again that, as conditioned, the reservoir \u201cwill not injure existing water rights and does not pose potential detrimental impacts to existing fishery resources.\u201d The department again adopted the conditions recommended in the comments that it had solicited. Petitioners filed a petition for review, challenging Order #2. However, the department withdrew that order and the accompanying permit, based on a clerical error in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The department subsequently re-evaluated the application, confirmed the review received from Fish and Wildlife regarding Order #2, as well as petitioners\u2019 comments, and issued a third final order and permit, which the department asserted was \u201cconditioned to address concerns raised in both that review and the comments received, where appropriate.\u201d That order is the subject of this appeal and contains the following pertinent findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">\u201c5. Water is available in the unnamed stream, tributary to Beaver Creek, for the proposed use according to the Department\u2019s water-availability model and the watermaster\u2019s assessment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\u201c17. Because water is available, the Department finds that existing water rights would not be injured by the proposed use. Should water not be available to senior water rights in the future, this relatively junior allocation would be regulated according to the doctrine of prior appropriation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\u201c18. Based upon information provided by [Fish and Wildlife], the Department has determined that as conditioned, the proposed use will not pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The permit included the same, or substantively similar, mitigating conditions, and mandatory and discretionary monitoring and reporting requirements, that were contained in the permit granted by Order #2.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Petitioners sought judicial review of the department\u2019s ultimate order, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Lytle\u2019s application did not contain, as required by ORS 537.409(2), sufficient information to demonstrate that the reservoir was eligible for the alternate permit application process <em>(i.e., </em>that it would not injure any existing water right or pose significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources). Petitioners also argued that the order erroneously interpreted ORS 537.409 as requiring a showing of no \u201csignificant\u201d detrimental impact to existing fishery resources when the appropriate standard is no \u201cpotential\u201d detrimental impact. Petitioners additionally asserted that substantial evidence did not support the department\u2019s findings that the reservoir permit would not injure existing water rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>or, as conditioned, pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The Clackamas County Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on the petition. In support of their case, petitioners submitted dozens of exhibits and called 13 witnesses, including department employees, Environmental Quality employees, Fish and Wildlife employees, a water-master, and two independent experts \u2014 a hydrologist and an aquatic biologist. Petitioners\u2019 witnesses included Faucera and several other state agency employees who were directly involved with the review of Lytle\u2019s application. The department called an additional five witnesses: four from the department \u2014 a water resources engineer, a watermaster, a division administrator, and the deputy director \u2014 and a Fish and Wildlife fish biologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Petitioners elicited testimony that they contended undermined or contradicted the data and conclusions that the department and the other state agencies relied on in concluding that the Lytle reservoir satisfied the criteria of ORS 537.409. The department elicited testimony that it urged demonstrated that the state agencies had carefully weighed ample evidence in arriving at their conclusions that the reservoir satisfied ORS 537.409.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The court set aside and remanded the order on the ground that the \u201capplication was insufficient to initiate an ORS 537.409 permit review process, because it did not proffer credible data that demonstrated compliance with all statutory eligibility criteria.\u201d The court rejected petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments. The court declined to consider petitioners\u2019 argument that the department erroneously interpreted the statutory standard, concluding that that argument was actually \u201can indirect attack on the vagueness of ORS 537.409, a question not properly before this court.\u201d Thus, the court applied the \u201csubstantial detrimental impact\u201d standard as it reviewed the record. The court made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the following ruling regarding petitioners\u2019 substantial evidence contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">\u201cThe parties elicited more than twenty hours of testimony and submitted more than 200 exhibits into the record in this case. It is clear that the parties disagree about [the department\u2019s] conclusions regarding the water availability and the impact on existing fishery resources in this case. However, each party elicited significant evidence in support of their divergent opinions on those issues. The court is convinced that neither party\u2019s position is definitive. Having considered the conflicting evidence, the court is confident that a reasonable person could agree with the agency\u2019s conclusions in the Final Order and Permit. Therefore the court must defer to the agency\u2019s choices regarding which conflicting evidence it relied upon[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We first resolve the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the relevant quantum of \u201cdetrimental impact to existing fishery resources\u201d that, pursuant to ORS 537.409(1), precludes the availability of the expedited permit process established by that statute. In their second assignment of error, petitioners argue that the circuit court \u201cerred in not setting aside the final order on grounds the record cannot support a finding of no \u2018potential detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.\u2019\u201d Petitioners\u2019 argument thus consists of two parts: first, that \u201cORS 537.409 require[s] a finding of no \u2018potential detrimental impact\u2019\u201d and, second, that \u201cthe record cannot support that finding.\u201d The department counters that the applicable standard is \u201csignificant detrimental impact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We review a circuit court\u2019s decision regarding an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory provision for legal error. <em>England v. Thunderbird, </em>315 Or 633, 638, 848 P2d 100 (1993). Based on the plain language of ORS 537.409, we conclude that the applicable standard for approval or denial of a reservoir permit under that statute is whether the reservoir poses a \u201csignificant detrimental impact\u201d to existing fishery resources. Because we reject the first part of petitioners\u2019 argument, regarding the relevant standard, we do not reach their attendant argument regarding the inadequacy of the evidence to satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We begin by reviewing, in relevant part, the text of ORS 537.409. Under subsection (1) of that statute, an owner of a reservoir may only submit an application for a permit under that statute \u201cif the reservoir *** [d]oes not pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources * * *.\u201d Under subsection (5), \u201cany person may submit detailed, legally obtained information in writing, requesting the department to deny the application for a permit on the basis that the reservoir * * * [w] ould pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.\u201d Following such a request, subsection (6) requires the department to conduct a public-interest review of the application \u201climited to issues pertaining to[,]\u201d in relevant part, \u201c[potential detrimental impact to existing fishery resources [.]\u201d Subsection (7) mandates that, within 180 days \u201cafter the department receives an application for a permit under subsection (1),\u201d the department issue a final order \u201cgranting or denying the permit or <em>granting the permit with conditions\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Pursuant to subsection (9), \u201c[i]f the department does not find injury or impact under subsection (6) of this section and the department issues a final order under subsection (7) of this section allowing the issuance of a permit, the order shall be subject to judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">To support their argument that ORS 537.409 requires a finding of \u201cno potential detrimental impact\u201d to existing fishery resources, petitioners necessarily focus on subsection (6), which contains the only reference in ORS 537.409 to \u201cpotential detrimental impact.\u201d But the text of subsection (6) does not require a finding that a reservoir poses no potential detrimental impact; instead, it limits the scope of any review conducted pursuant to subsection (5) to certain issues, including those \u201cpertaining to * * * [potential detrimental impact * * * \u201d Those are two distinct requirements, and petitioners\u2019 attempt to extrapolate from the latter to the former runs into multiple problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Foremost among those is the fact that ORS 537.409 expressly refers to \u201csignificant detrimental impact\u201d multiple times as the relevant standard. Subsection (1) declares that the permit process under ORS 537.409 is only available for reservoirs that \u201cdo[] not pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.\u201d And, perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>most damaging to petitioners\u2019 theory of the applicable standard, subsection (5) requires any person requesting that the department deny an application on the basis of detrimental impact to existing fishery resources, to submit \u201cdetailed * * * information in writing *** that the reservoir *** [w]ould pose a significant detrimental impact\u201d to such resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In an attempt to reconcile these references to \u201csignificant detrimental impact\u201d with their proffered interpretation of the relevant standard, petitioners ultimately narrow their argument to contend that subsection (6) \u201cdescribes the substantive standard for decision\u201d whenever someone requests the denial of an application. Petitioners offer no satisfactory explanation, nor can we discern any, for why the legislature would require an applicant to supply information demonstrating that the reservoir does not pose a \u201csignificant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources\u201d and similarly require a party opposing an application to submit \u201cdetailed\u201d information that the reservoir would pose a \u201csignificant detrimental impact,\u201d but then deny the applicant\u2019s requested permit if the applicant fails to satisfy a considerably stricter \u201cpotential detrimental impact\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In an ultimately unavailing effort, petitioners argue that the legislative history of ORS 537.409 and related statutes, ORS 537.405 and ORS 537.407, supports their conclusion that the department must deny an application if the reservoir poses a \u201cpotential\u201d detrimental impact. Through the passage of House Bill (HB) 2376, those three statutes were enacted as part of Oregon Laws 1995, chapter 752, and they all require the department to consider \u201csignificant detrimental impact.\u201d Only ORS 537.409 contains a reference to \u201cpotential detrimental impact.\u201d The first two statutes provide procedures for <em>exemption </em>or <em>certification </em>of pre-existing small reservoirs. <em>See </em>ORS 537.405 (exemption); ORS 537.407 (certification).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute at issue here, ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>537.409, establishes a <em>permitting </em>process for reservoirs not in existence or not approved by the state before January 1, 1995, <em>i.e., </em>future reservoirs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Petitioners are correct that the legislative history reveals that this statutory differentiation of distinct reservoir classes reflects a legislative decision to regulate preexisting small reservoirs more leniently than future reservoirs. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tape Recording, House Water Policy Committee, HB 2376, Feb 2,1995, Tape 13, Side B (statement of HB 2376 work group member Richard Kosesan that HB 2376 \u201cdeal[s] with ponds that are in existence, exempt [s] those ponds from permitting certification requirements *** and deal[s] with future ponds in a different manner \u2014 basically set[s] up some harsher and stricter stipulations for the construction of future ponds\u201d)- Petitioners attempt to reason from that fact that the legislative history thus \u201cshows that ORS 537.409 was meant to be more restrictive, and that the word \u2018potential\u2019 in ORS 537.409(6) was meant to convey a more restrictive substantive standard for \u2018alternate\u2019 permits when someone objects based on fishery and/or injury issues.\u201d However, the legislative history undermines that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">That history clarifies that the mechanism that the legislature established to regulate future reservoirs more strictly than pre-existing reservoirs was the overall permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>process, not the use of a standard stricter than that employed for pre-existing reservoirs. Kosesan explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">\u201cthe exemption applies to those existing ponds that do not injure existing water rights or do not pose a significant detrimental impact to fishery resources; we felt those were two very, very strong standards that we could use to look at the exemption. For future ponds, again the same size, 9.2 acre feet or less, individuals would be required to go through a process and obtain a water right permit; but again, we\u2019ve used the standards of protection for fish and protection for existing water right holders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Tape Recording, Senate Water and Land Use Committee, HB 2376, Apr 27, 1995, Tape 129, Side A (statement of Kosesan). For example, the process established for future reservoirs in ORS 537.409, unlike the exemption and certification procedures for pre-existing reservoirs, allows any person to oppose an application on the basis of sufficient detrimental impact to existing fishery resources and provides for public-interest review of contested applications. In other words, petitioners are correct that the legislature intended ORS 537.409 to be more restrictive than ORS 537.405 and ORS 537.407. However, we conclude, based on the legislative history as well as our earlier textual analysis, that the legislature chose to accomplish that intent by means of a stricter <em>procedure, </em>not by means of a stricter <em>standard </em>applied within that procedure. Thus, we reject petitioners\u2019 invitation to conclude that, in essence, the legislature intended ORS 537.409 to require the department to permit a reservoir that does not presently pose a \u201csignificant\u201d detrimental impact \u2014 which, it bears articulating, allows for a reservoir that does, in fact, pose some detrimental impact, as long as that impact is not \u201csignificant\u201d \u2014 but deny a permit if it poses any \u201cpotential\u201d detrimental impact, <em>i.e., </em>any chance of harm, present or future, on existing fishery resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Stated another way, given the language and logic of ORS 537.409, the word \u201cpotential\u201d as used in that statute refers, not to a finding of <em>possible detrimental impact, </em>but, rather, to a <em>possible finding </em>of significant detrimental impact. Under the permit application process, an applicant must, first, \u201cprovide sufficient information to demonstrate\u201d that a reservoir <em>\u201c[djoes not </em>pose a significant detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>impact to existing fishery resources as determined on the basis of information submitted by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife [.]\u201d ORS 537.409(1), (2) (emphasis added). Once that information has been submitted and the applicant has made the required showing that the reservoir does not pose a significant detrimental impact, then, any person may submit detailed information \u201crequesting the department to deny the application for a permit on the basis that the reservoir *** <em>[w]ould </em>pose a significant detrimental impact ***.\u201d ORS 537.409(5) (emphasis added). The shift from the present tense (\u201cdoes not\u201d) in subsections (1) and (2), to the conditional mood (\u201cwould\u201d) in subsection (5), reflects the shift from the <em>actuality </em>of the applicant\u2019s showing that the reservoir poses no significant detrimental impact, to the <em>possibility, </em>introduced by the party opposing the application, that it does. With subsection (5), the legislature recognized that, although an applicant has already submitted information demonstrating that the reservoir poses no significant detrimental impact, an opposing party may be able to overcome that showing. Because that procedure precedes the public review in which the presence or absence of such impact will be conclusively determined, the conclusion that the reservoir does indeed pose a significant detrimental impact is merely \u201cpotential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We turn now to petitioners\u2019 two remaining assignments of error, in which they assert that the circuit court erred in ruling that substantial evidence supports the department\u2019s findings that the reservoir would not injure existing water rights or, as conditioned, pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources. Like the circuit court, we conclude that the department\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In review of an agency decision under ORS 183.484(5)(c), in other than a contested case, the circuit court \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if it finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d \u201cWhole record\u201d review requires consideration of the facts before the agency when it issued the order, as well as additional evidence developed for the circuit court\u2019s review of that order, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>evidence that detracts from as well as supports the agency\u2019s order. <em>Norden v.

Bunn, </em>198 Or App 21, 25 n 4, 108 P3d 37 (2005), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>341 Or 306, 142 P3d 1054 (2006). On appeal, this court reviews the circuit court\u2019s judgment to determine whether it correctly assessed the agency\u2019s action under those standards. <em>G.A.S.P. v. Environmental Quality Commission, </em>198 Or App 182, 187, 108 P3d 95, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005). \u201cIn practical effect, that means that we directly review the agency\u2019s order for compliance with the standards set out in ORS 183.484(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not reweigh or assess the credibility of the evidence in the record or substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Middleton v. Dept. of Human Services, </em>219 Or App 458, 473, 183 P3d 1041, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 94 (2008). Thus, \u201cin a case in which expert opinions have been offered on both sides of an issue, it is usually clear that a factfinder has found one or the other more persuasive, and substantial evidence and reason will exist to support the finding, without further explanation.\u201d <em>Castro v. Board of Parole, </em>232 Or App 75, 84, 220 P3d 772 (2009) (citing <em>Armstrong v. Asten-Hill Co., </em>90 Or App 200, 206, 752 P2d 312 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We readily conclude that the record here, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to conclude that the reservoir does not injure existing water rights or, with the conditions imposed by the department in the permit, pose a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regarding impact to fishery resources, the record reveals that the department based its finding on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>among other considerations, comments from multiple state agencies, including, as contemplated by ORS 537.409(1), Fish and Wildlife. Based on factors such as fish distribution maps, aerial photography, and other state agency data, Fish and Wildlife concluded that the reservoir, as conditioned in the permit, would not pose a significant detrimental impact. Before the circuit court, as noted above, the department elicited testimony from multiple witnesses supporting that finding, including such unequivocal statements as Faucera\u2019s testimony that \u201c[m]y belief is that if the permit and final order were conditioned with my recommendations, [the detrimental impact] would not be significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Significantly, even petitioners\u2019 own expert ultimately conceded when testifying before the circuit court that he did not have enough information to say that the Lytle reservoir itself posed a significant detrimental impact to existing fishery resources. To be sure, as the circuit court noted, petitioners also elicited significant evidence in support of their position. Their expert opined that the Lytle reservoir \u201cis having some incremental detrimental impacts\u201d on fish. And, their expert concluded that the Lytle reservoir \u201cin combination with other reservoirs,\u201d namely, the Vityuk, Stoyan, Wacker, and Olson ponds, on the stream was \u201chaving a significant detrimental impact on cutthroat trout habitat [.]\u201d Petitioners pointed out weaknesses in the testimony and opinions of the witnesses affiliated with the state, and they presented testimony from their own experts. However, as the circuit court noted in its ruling, \u201cthe choice between <em>which </em>conflicting evidence will be relied upon is up to the acting administrative body, provided that a reasonable person could agree with their conclusion after considering the evidence in the whole record.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We reiterate that substantial evidence review \u201cdoes not require [a] reviewing court to \u2018explain away\u2019 conflicting evidence.\u201d <em>Norden, </em>329 Or at 649; <em>see also Armstrong, </em>90 Or App at 206 (\u201cFor instance, * * * if there are doctors on both sides of a medical issue, whichever way the [agency] finds the facts will probably have substantial evidentiary support. We would not need to choose sides.\u201d). As we previously noted in <em>Armstrong, </em>\u201c[t]he difference between the \u2018any evidence\u2019 rule and the substantial evidence test * * * will be decisive only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>when the credible evidence apparently weighs overwhelmingly in favor of one finding and the [agency] finds the other without giving a persuasive explanation.\u201d 90 Or App at 206. After hearing, in essence, the same arguments regarding the same evidence that the parties have presented to us, the circuit court concluded that this was not such a case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument regarding injury to existing water rights, because it is based on two faulty premises: First, that the department\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence because it is premised on a condition imposed by the permit. Second, that absent that condition, there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that, according to petitioners, the department actually was supposed to make, namely, <em>\u201ca </em>finding of no \u2018potential\u2019 injury to existing water rights.\u201d The first part of petitioners\u2019 conjunctive theory fails because, as the text of ORS 537.409 plainly states, the department may issue \u201ca final order granting or denying the permit <em>or granting the permit with </em>conditions.\u201d ORS 537.409(7) (emphasis added). The second part of petitioners\u2019 theory fails independently for the same reasons, articulated at length above, that we have rejected petitioners\u2019 similar argument regarding the appropriate standard for assessing detrimental impact to existing fishery resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In sum, we hold that the applicable standard for assessing detrimental impact to existing fishery resources under ORS 537.409 is whether a reservoir poses a \u201csignificant detrimental impact\u201d to such resources. We also hold that the circuit court correctly concluded that substantial evidence supported the department\u2019s findings regarding injury to water rights and detrimental impact to fishery resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> In a separate appeal, petitioners challenged a subsequent related order by Fish and Wildlife approving a fishway that Lytle constructed to satisfy the conditions imposed by the department in the order at issue here. <em>See Noble v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, </em>250 Or App 252, 279 P3d 345 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>355 Or 435, 326 P3d 589 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> More specifically, ORS 537.405 establishes the following exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cReservoirs in existence on or before January 1, 1995, that store less than 9.2 acre-feet of water or with a dam or impoundment structure less than 10 feet in height, are found to be a beneficial use of the water resources of this state. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, such reservoirs are exempt from regulation by the Water Resources Commission and the Water Resources Department and are not required to obtain a permit or certificate</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ORS 573.405 (1). And, pursuant to ORS 537.407, the \u201cWater Resources Department shall issue a water right certificate to any person who submitted an application for a reservoir under section 4, chapter 595, Oregon Laws 1993.\u201d ORS 537.407(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> We use the terms \u201cpre-existing\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d here because those are the terms that the legislature used when discussing the portions of HB 2376 that were ultimately enacted as ORS 537.405, ORS 537.407, and ORS 537.409. As the legislature did, we use those terms because they offer a useful shorthand for distinguishing between those reservoirs that qualify for approval under ORS 537.405 and ORS 537.407, and those which do not but which may qualify for a permit under the terms of ORS 537.409. We pause to clarify that, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Noble, </em>355 Or at 438 n 1, when discussing Lytle\u2019s reservoir and a second, neighboring reservoir,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201c[b]ecause the Lytle and Stoyan dams existed before January 1, 1995, store less than 9.2 acre-feet of water, and are less than 10 feet in height, the owners could have notified [the department] of their existence on or before January 31, 1997, as provided in ORS 537.405, and obtained more or less automatic recognition that the dams and associated ponds were a beneficial use and exempt from most regulation by [the department]. Having failed to do so before the statutory deadline, the owners of the Lytle and Stoyan ponds proceeded under an alternative water right permit process, set out in ORS 537.409 * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-5\"> A main premise of petitioners\u2019 substantial evidence argument is that this court should categorically disregard the primary source of the department\u2019s finding, Fish and Wildlife\u2019s comments, because those comments only indicate how to mitigate what Faucera concluded would otherwise be a \u201csignificant\u201d detrimental impact. Once that evidence is off the table, petitioners argue, very little evidence remains supporting the department\u2019s finding, and that evidence is undermined by petitioners\u2019 countervailing evidence. To the extent that petitioners\u2019 premise, in effect, merely restates their contention that the relevant standard is no \u201cpotential\u201d detrimental impact, we have already rejected that argument. To the extent that, alternatively, petitioners mean to argue that Faucera stopped short of actually concluding that there is not a significant detrimental impact, we conclude that, based on the facts regarding Fish and Wildlife\u2019s comments, a reasonable person could conclude that Faucera intended to convey that the mitigating conditions that she recommended would render the detrimental impact posed by the reservoir less-than-significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
