J.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">This case involves the long term care of a protected person, Symons, who was moved by her guardian and conservator, Smith, from one care facility to another. When Smith refused to disclose the address of the facility to which she had moved Symons, the Long Term Care Ombudsman (LTCO) petitioned the circuit court for an order compelling Smith to provide the LTCO with that information. The LTCO maintained that it had not only the legal authority to visit Symons at that address, but a legal obligation to do so even if doing so caused Symons distress, until and unless Symons herself personally informed the LTCO that she did not want the visits. Smith, on the other hand, argued that she had a legal obligation to act in the best interest of Symons and that disclosing Symons\u2019s address would be contrary to that interest. The circuit court agreed with Smith and denied the petition. The LTCO appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Most of the facts are undisputed. Where a dispute exists, we accept the trial court\u2019s findings where there is evidence in the record to support them. <em>Crimson Trace Corp. v. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, </em>355 Or 476, 489, 326 P3d 1181 (2014). Symons suffered a stroke in 2002 at the age of 58. As a result, she is partially paralyzed, has a severely compromised ability to communicate, and is easily manipulated. When the events relevant to this litigation began, she was receiving long term adult foster care at a facility called Maria\u2019s Care Home. While there, she became dissatisfied with the relative then serving as her guardian and conservator. That relative was replaced by Smith, who is an attorney, a registered nurse, and a court-approved fiduciary. In February 2010, however, Symons (through counsel) filed an objection to Smith. While Symons, her attorney, the representatives of Maria\u2019s Care Home, and Smith attempted to reach an agreement, Symons appears to have vacillated between wanting to keep Smith as her guardian, to change guardians, and to remove the guardianship and conservatorship entirely. Ultimately, no new guardian was appointed. The LTCO nonetheless responded to some concerns that Symons had by invoking its obligation to open an investigation into the care she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>receiving. <em>See </em>ORS 441.109(1) (LTCO \u201cshall *** [investigate and resolve complaints made by or for residents of long term care facilities\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">On January 30, 2012, Smith \u2014 concerned about Symons\u2019s treatment at Maria\u2019s Care Home \u2014 moved Symons to another facility. Apparently, the transition was not smooth; a Department of Human Services representative concluded that Maria\u2019s Care Home interfered with Symons\u2019s transfer and caused her stress. Smith subsequently notified the court that the transfer had occurred. The notice did not disclose the address or name of the new facility, nor was it expressly required to; Smith did not send a copy of the notice to the LTCO, which she <em>was </em>required to do. ORS 125.320(3) (c)(B). The LTCO learned of the transfer independently and, in a letter to the court, explained that it needed Symons\u2019s address in order to complete its investigation of her treatment. Before the court could act, the LTCO filed a Petition to Disclose Protected Person\u2019s Information, seeking an order requiring Smith to reveal Symons\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">At the hearing to address that petition, the deputy LTCO argued that, under the relevant statutes and rules, the LTCO has the right of entry into adult foster care facilities and to interview residents in private regarding complaints, and, if the protected person did not want to communicate with the LTCO, that decision had to be communicated directly to the LTCO and not by an intermediary. Thus, the LTCO argued, the order to disclose Symons\u2019s whereabouts was necessary in order for the LTCO to perform its statutory obligations. Smith, in response, presented the court with a letter from Fisher, a psychologist who was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>as the court-appointed visitor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fisher supported Smith\u2019s refusal to disclose Symons\u2019s location to the LTCO, noting that \u201c[t]he involvement of the [LTCO] in the past has escalated Ms. Symons emotionally and has been expensive.\u201d At the end of the hearing, the court ruled, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: [I]t\u2019s absolutely true that I\u2019ve put tremendous weight on Dr. Fisher\u2019s perceptions and reports and recommendations, and, frankly, there\u2019s \u2014 Ms. Symons has a lawyer, has a guardian, has a conservator, has Dr. Fisher looking out for her best interest. I\u2019m aware that historically, and apparently from what I can glean today, currently there\u2019s conflict between people who care about and want to protect Ms. Symons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cThe evidence that I have is that the reason that the [LTCO] wants to contact Ms. Symons is to report back to her from a complaint that occurred, I think in 2010 * * *. That was certainly [the deputy LTCO\u2019s] testimony * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\u201cMs. Symons, as a practical matter, cannot communicate and cannot understand what\u2019s going on here and whether \u2014 and so if I balance the potential agitation and harm that comes to Ms. Symons versus the [LTCO] wanting to report back to her or, frankly, to see how she\u2019s doing, I have to, again * * * figure out what\u2019s best for Ms. Symons, and it\u2019s my finding and my order that it\u2019s not \u2014 that the guardian is not required, in this particular rare circumstance, to disclose a protected person\u2019s information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Identifying the parties\u2019 positions and emphasizing certain facts and conclusions will facilitate resolving this case. The LTCO maintains, in essence, that it has a statutory mandate to contact residents of long term care facilities, without exception, in order to resolve a complaint about the resident\u2019s situation, and that, by refusing to disclose Symons\u2019s location, Smith is interfering with that mandate. That much of the LTCO\u2019s position is correct. The LTCO\u2019s duties \u2014 which, by statute, it <em>\u201cshall </em>carry out\u201d \u2014 include \u201c [i] nvestigat [ing] and resolvfing] complaints made by or for residents of long term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>care facilities.\u201d ORS 441.109(1) (emphasis added). In order to perform that duty, the LTCO \u201cshall have the right of entry into long term care facilities at any time considered necessary and reasonable\u201d by the LTCO, in order to \u201c[i]nvestigat[e] and resolv[e] complaints\u201d and \u201c[i]nterview[] residents.\u201d ORS 441.117(l)(a), (b). In conducting its investigation, the LTCO \u201cshall have access to long term care facility records that relate to\u201d that investigation. OAR 114-005-0030(2). When the investigation is done, the LTCO \u201cshall report opinions or recommendations to the party or parties affected thereby.\u201d ORS 441.121. Most relevant to this case, \u201cNo person shall willfully interfere with the performance of the [LTCO\u2019s] official duties,\u201d and \u201c[individuals interfering with the [LTCO\u2019s] official duties will be referred to the appropriate agency for sanctions or other actions.\u201d OAR 114-006-0000. By refusing to disclose Symons\u2019s location, Smith is clearly interfering with the LTCO\u2019s performance of its immediate duties\u2014 investigating and reporting on complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Smith does not deny that assertion. However, she maintains that, as Symons\u2019s guardian, she has a superseding duty to promote Symons\u2019s interests. That, too, is correct. Her mandate as a court-appointed guardian is to \u201cpromote and protect the well-being of the protected person,\u201d ORS 125.300(1), and she can be removed by the court whenever, in the court\u2019s judgment, doing so \u201cis in the best interests of the protected person,\u201d ORS 125.225(1). Her duties include \u201cprovid [ing] for the care, comfort and maintenance of the protected person.\u201d ORS 125.315(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Further, the court ruled that Smith\u2019s decision to withhold Symons\u2019s address was, in fact, in Symons\u2019s best interest. Although the LTCO, in one brief footnote, contends that the court\u2019s conclusion is not supported by sufficient evidence, we disagree. Symons\u2019s attorney and the court-appointed visitor both supported Smith\u2019s assertion that disclosing Symons\u2019s address would <em>not </em>be in her best interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Thus, put succinctly, this case requires us to determine whether, as the LTCO maintains, ORS chapter 441 requires the court to compel Symons\u2019s guardian to help the LTCO perform its statutorily mandated duties, even when performing those duties is contrary to Symons\u2019s interest. We conclude that the LTCO\u2019s position is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Most obviously, where statutes appear to impose conflicting duties on parties or create ambiguity with respect to a party\u2019s duties, the conflict or ambiguity generally is resolved through adjudication \u2014 here, by the court that has jurisdiction over the protective proceeding. The mandate of the court in protective proceedings is to protect the welfare of protected persons, and the court\u2019s authority in pursuing that objective is extremely broad. Subject to exceptions that are not relevant to this case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201ca court having jurisdiction over a protective proceeding shall exercise continuing authority over the proceeding. * * * [T]he court may act upon the petition or motion of any person or upon its own authority at any time and in any manner it deems appropriate to determine the condition and welfare of the respondent or protected person and to inquire into the proper performance of the duties of a fiduciary appointed under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">ORS 125.025(1). In the present case, the parties chose to submit their dispute to the court, the court resolved it in favor of Smith, and the court\u2019s resolution was supported by sufficient evidence. The fact that the resolution privileged Smith\u2019s obligation over the LTCO\u2019s is simply a result of the court performing its inherent dispute-resolving adjudicative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Second, the parties\u2019 duties are not on a par with each other. It is true that the LTCO and the guardian both have the ultimate objective of protecting Symons\u2019s welfare. However, the LTCO\u2019s connection to that objective is indirect and instrumental. Its direct function is to monitor care facilities and investigate complaints; that function, <em>in turn, </em>serves to promote the welfare of the protected person. The guardian\u2019s duty, on the other hand, is immediately and directly to promote and protect the welfare of the protected person. Thus, when the LTCO\u2019s performance of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>immediate and direct function (monitoring long term care facilities, investigating complaints, and resolving them) no longer serves to promote its ultimate function (promoting the protected person\u2019s welfare), it makes no sense to insist that the LTCO\u2019s performance of its function must proceed without interference from the guardian\u2019s performance of <em>its </em>function. In sum, the court did not err in denying the LTCO\u2019s petition to compel Symons\u2019s guardian to act contrary to Symons\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> The federal Older Americans Act, 42 USC \u00a7 3001 <em>et seq., </em>provides federal funding to be used by states for implementing and operating programs to protect the vulnerable elderly. To receive these funds, a state must, among other things, establish and operate an Office of the State Long Term Care Ombudsman. 42 USC \u00a7 3058g(a)(1). Oregon\u2019s response is ORS 441.100 to 441.153, entitled \u201cLong Term Care Ombudsman.\u201d The 2013 and 2014 Legislative Assemblies passed amendments to that chapter, Oregon Laws 2013, chapter 717, and Oregon Laws 2014, chapter 117, which became operative on July 1, 2014. The changes are inconsequential for purposes of this opinion. For convenience, we use the text that was operative when the case was tried, briefed, and argued. Further, many of the duties of the LTCO may be performed by a designee. ORS 441.109(8). Hereafter, our references to the LTCO are to that entity or a designee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-11\"> A \u201cvisitor\u201d is \u201ca person appointed by the court * * * for the purpose of interviewing and evaluating a respondent or protected person.\u201d ORS 125.005(11).

Smith agrees that our review of historical facts is for any evidence, but maintains that the best interest determination is for abuse of discretion. We need not resolve that dispute here, however, because under either standard, the trial court\u2019s determination is adequately supported.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
