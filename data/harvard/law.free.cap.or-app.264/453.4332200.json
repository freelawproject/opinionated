Defendant makes three assignments of error on appeal. First, he disputes the admission of hearsay evidence. Second, he contends that the hearsay evidence violates his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Third, he challenges the trial court\u2019s purported merger, \u201cfor sentencing purposes,\u201d of convictions for unlawful delivery of methamphetamine and unlawful possession of methamphetamine. <em>See State v. Mason, </em>241 Or App 714, 718 n 4, 250 P3d 976 (2011) (observing that \u201cthe phrase \u2018merged for sentencing purposes\u2019 is a misnomer and should never be used because it improperly conflates two distinct parts of the criminal process\u201d). The state concedes that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay evidence but argues that the error was harmless. We conclude that the error was not harmless, and we reverse and remand on defendant\u2019s first assignment of error. We need not address defendant\u2019s second and third assignments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u201c[I]n our assessment of whether the erroneous admission of disputed evidence was harmless, we describe and review all pertinent portions of the record, not just those portions most favorable to the state.\u201d <em>State v. Maiden, </em>222 Or App 9, 11, 191 P3d 803 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 618 (2009). We review to determine \u201cthe possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arose from a routine traffic stop. Defendant was driving, and his girlfriend, Buchanan, was in the passenger seat when Deputy Speldrich signaled defendant to pull over. Officer Thomsen arrived to assist Speldrich with the stop. Thomsen discovered that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>had a warrant for his arrest. Thomsen instructed defendant to get out of the car, but defendant refused. Defendant rolled up the car\u2019s windows. According to Speldrich, defendant took a plastic bag from his lap, containing what Speldrich believed to be methamphetamine, and gave it to his passenger, Buchanan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Buchanan stuffed the bag into her pants. When defendant and Buchanan refused to open the car window or door, Speldrich smashed the passenger-side window with his asp baton. They were then removed from the car and patted down.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">During the officers\u2019 subsequent search of the car, Thomsen found a digital scale disguised as a cell phone, lithium batteries consistent with the batteries powering the scale, a wad of loose cash on the driver\u2019s side floorboard, some small empty plastic baggies, and a metal mint tin containing \u201ccut,\u201d a substance used to bulk up a drug\u2019s volume before its sale. Defendant denied possessing any controlled substances and told Thomsen that he had only handed Buchanan money while in the car. A bag of methamphetamine, weighing 24.68 grams, was recovered from Buchanan at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of methamphetamine,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unlawful possession of methamphetamine, interfering with a peace officer, and tampering with physical evidence. At trial, defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that the methamphetamine belonged to Buchanan and that he had no knowledge of the drug. Defendant testified that Buchanan struggled with drug addiction, and, except for some \u201crelapses,\u201d he had been drug-free for the past six years. Defendant described other items found in the car \u2014 the scale and small empty baggies \u2014 as Buchanan\u2019s jewelry-making things, but he did not explain the mint tin containing \u201ccut.\u201d A witness testified that defendant had admitted that the scale found in the car belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The state tried the case on the theory that the methamphetamine belonged to defendant. During Speldrich\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>direct testimony, he described a conversation he had with Buchanan after her arrest. Defense counsel timely objected that the statements were inadmissible hearsay. Defense counsel indicated that he was making <em>\u201ca </em>continued objection for the sense that it\u2019s hearsay\u201d to \u201c [e] very thing [Speldrich] says about *** Buchanan[.]\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, and Speldrich testified that Buchanan \u201coriginally * * * said that the bag was hers * * * [a]nd then she admitted that it was [defendant\u2019s].\u201d The trial court did not offer a limiting instruction as to the nature of those statements, and Buchanan did not testify at defendant\u2019s trial. The trial court also admitted partial recordings of defendant\u2019s phone conversations with Buchanan and defendant\u2019s family members. Those conversations included Buchanan\u2019s suggestive but vague statement that she was \u201ctaking\u201d charges for defendant and defendant\u2019s admonishment that Buchanan should not \u201cgo against\u201d him despite police pressure to do so. The jury found defendant guilty of all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay evidence and that the error likely affected the outcome of the verdict. The state concedes the error but responds that it was harmless. The state argues that Buchanan\u2019s other pretrial statements undercut her credibility so as to make her statement to Speldrich of little persuasive value. The state stresses other evidence, including defendant\u2019s admission that the scale was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Oregon Evidence Code defines hearsay as <em>\u201ca </em>statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d OEC 801(3). Unless an exception applies, hearsay is not admissible. OEC 802. A trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence, however, does not always require reversal. <em>See Davis, </em>336 Or at 32; Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3 (if \u201cthe judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed notwithstanding any error committed during the trial\u201d). Evidentiary error is not presumptively prejudicial. OEC 103(1); <em>State v. Morgan, </em>251 Or App 99, 108, 284 P3d 496 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The question here is whether \u201cthere [is] little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>336 Or at 32. The focus of the inquiry is \u201con the possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThat inquiry requires us to examine the nature of the error that occurred * * * and the context of that error. If the particular issue to which the error pertains has no relationship to the jury\u2019s determination of its verdict, then there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson, </em>338 Or 560, 576, 113 P3d 423 (2005) (internal citation omitted). We must consider the totality of the circumstances to decide whether the trial court\u2019s error meets that standard. <em>See State v. Kitzman, </em>323 Or 589, 613-15, 920 P2d 134 (1996) (discussing several factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">This court has emphasized that reversal is required where \u201cerroneously admitted statements were both qualitatively different than the evidence that the jury heard, and were presented to the jury as bearing directly on the central issues in the case, <em>viz., </em>defendant\u2019s *** general credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Painter, </em>255 Or App 513, 523, 300 P3d 179 (2013) (citing <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 34) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Erroneously admitted evidence is less likely to be harmless if it pertains to the \u201cheart\u201d of the state\u2019s \u201cfactual theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This case reduces to a dispute between defendant\u2019s and Speldrich\u2019s account of events.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Speldrich testified that he saw defendant reach into his lap and hand Buchanan a bag of methamphetamine. The state did not present any other direct evidence that defendant had possession and knowledge of the drugs, although it did present circumstantial evidence of drug-related activity: the scale, the empty baggies, and the tin containing \u201ccut.\u201d Defendant provided a contrary account when testifying that he had only handed Buchanan cash, that the drugs belonged to Buchanan, that the scale and empty baggies had an innocent explanation, and that defendant (unlike Buchanan) did not have an ongoing problem with methamphetamine use. Given that the erroneously admitted evidence was central to the parties\u2019 theories of the case and bore directly on defendant\u2019s credibility, we cannot say that there was \u201clittle likelihood\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>evidence affected the jury\u2019s verdict. The erroneous admission of Buchanan\u2019s hearsay statement was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Convictions for unlawful delivery of methamphetamine, unlawful possession of methamphetamine, and tampering with physical evidence reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\"> Because the assigned errors do not pertain to defendant\u2019s conviction for interfering with a peace officer, that conviction is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> Speldrich saw \u201ccrystalline powder\u201d that looked like methamphetamine inside the bag that defendant \u201chanded off\u2019 to Buchanan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> The count for unlawful delivery of methamphetamine was charged as a commercial drug offense, ORS 475.900.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> The recorded phone conversations did not resolve that factual dispute by providing unambiguous evidence of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
