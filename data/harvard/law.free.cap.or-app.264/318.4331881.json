The state contends that the evidence was admissible because it would have been inevitably discovered under the Lane County Sheriffs Office inventory booking policy, and that that inventory booking policy is constitutional because such a policy is necessary to prevent dangerous chemicals or explosive devices from entering the jail\u2019s storage facilities. Our recent decision in <em>State v. Davis, </em>262 Or App 555, 325 P3d 790 (2014), which held that a version of the Lane County inventory booking policy virtually identical to the one at issue here was constitutionally deficient, is dispositive of the issue. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was error. Accordingly, we reverse and remand his conviction for unlawful possession of methamphetamine and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Conviction for unlawful possession of methamphetamine reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> Defendant does not challenge his convictions for resisting arrest, ORS 162.315, and interfering with a peace officer, ORS 162.147.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
