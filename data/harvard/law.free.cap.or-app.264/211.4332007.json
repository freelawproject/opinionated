We conclude that the trial court erred by applying the former statutory framework rather than the current statutory framework, but affirm because defendant was \u201cactively instrumental\u201d in bringing about that error and therefore invited it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Defendant was convicted of multiple offenses, including first-degree burglary as charged in Count 1 of the indictment. At sentencing, defendant requested that the trial court determine that she was eligible for AIPs. The state argued that the court should deny AIP eligibility for \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons,\u201d namely, defendant\u2019s \u201cpersistent involvement in * * * past sanctions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in response, asserted that \u201cit\u2019s our position that there are not essential and compelling reasons to deny AIP for good time[.]\u201d The trial court denied AIP eligibility with respect to Count 1. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">\u201cAnd I would find that on count 1, because there are multiple victims, I would order that there be 936 program[s],[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] <em>but I find substantial and compelling reasonfs] to order that AIP would not be appropriate on count 1. </em>All right. As a separate criminal episode and separate victims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of AIP eligibility with respect to Count 1. She argues that the trial court applied the wrong legal framework to determine her eligibility for AIPs when it used the \u201csubstantial-and-compelling-reasons\u201d test under ORS 137.750(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the trial court instead should have applied the criteria in ORS 137.751(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to assess her eligibility for AIPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We agree that the trial court applied the wrong legal test to determine defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIPs. However, defendant not only failed to preserve that issue for appeal, but she also affirmatively invited any error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The trial court\u2019s decision is consistent with the statutory framework as it existed for offenses committed prior to January 1, 2009. Prior to that date, ORS 137.750(1) (1997), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 2 (Spec Sess), governed the determination of whether a defendant was eligible for AIPs. As we observed in <em>State v. Cross, </em>264 Or App 205, 207, 331 P3d 1073 (2014), that statute <em>\u201crequired </em>a trial court to order a defendant\u2019s eligibility for, among other things, AIPs, <em>unless </em>the trial court found \u2018substantial and compelling reasons\u2019 to deny eligibility.\u201d (Emphases in original.) In 2008, however, the legislature enacted House Bill (HB) 3638 and altered the process for determining AIP eligibility. Under the current statutory framework, ORS 137.751(1), not ORS 137.750(1), governs a trial court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s eligibility for AIPs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 2 (Spec Sess) (removing references to AIPs in ORS 137.750); Or Laws 2008, ch 35, \u00a7 1 (Spec Sess) (enacting ORS 137.751). Under ORS 137.751(1), \u201c[T]he state no longer must prove\u2014 and a trial court no longer must find \u2014 \u2018substantial and compelling reasons\u2019 to deny eligibility; rather, the burden is on the defendant to show that the specified eligibility requirements are met.\u201d <em>Cross, </em>264 Or App at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In denying AIP eligibility on the ground that there were \u201csubstantial and compelling reason [s]\u201d to do so, the trial court erroneously applied the statutory framework set forth in ORS 137.750(1). However, the general rule is that if an appellant \u201c\u2018was actively instrumental in bringing about\u2019 the error, then the appellant \u2018cannot be heard to complain, and the case ought not to be reversed because of it.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>201 Or App 261, 269, 119 P3d 794 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 34 (2006) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Oregon Railroad Co., </em>45 Or 211, 216-17, 77 P 119 (1904)). Here, defendant\u2019s conduct was actively instrumental in bringing about that error; both defendant and the state invoked the \u201csubstantial-and-compelling-reasons\u201d framework of ORS 137.750(1) in arguing the issue of defendant\u2019s AIP eligibility to the trial court, and neither party alerted the court that the framework for determining eligibility for AIPs had changed. For that reason, we decline to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> AIPs are prison programs that the Department of Corrections (DOC) offers to select offenders. As DOC rules explain, an AIP is a \u201chighly structured corrections program that includes intensive interventions, rigorous personal responsibility and accountability, physical labor, and service to the community.\u201d OAR 291-062-0110(1). AIPs have two phases: (1) a 180-day residential phase, and (2) a 90-day \u201cnon-prison/transitional leave\u201d phase. Offenders who complete a full AIP are eligible for sentence reductions. Oregon Department of Corrections, Issue Brief - <em>2013, Alternative Incarceration Programs </em>(May 23, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In referring to a trial court\u2019s determination regarding \u201celigibility for AIPs\u201d and \u201cAIP eligibility,\u201d we refer to the trial court\u2019s decision under ORS 137.751 as to whether an offender is eligible for early release under ORS 421.508(4) following the successful completion of an AIP. Ultimately, the DOC determines which offenders can participate in AIPs. ORS 421.508(l)(a). However, absent a trial court\u2019s determination under ORS 137.751 of eligibility for release under ORS 421.508(4), an offender is not eligible for early release as a result of participation in an AIP. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> Specifically, the state contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201cThis is a defendant who has had her chance.
