Defendant approached a stranger on a MAX train in Portland and repeatedly groped her, including her genital area. At trial, defendant requested a special jury instruction, arguing that a \u201cknowing <em>mens rea </em>ought to attach\u201d to the \u201clack of consent\u201d element of the crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court declined to give that instruction. On appeal, defendant contends that that was error. In light of <em>State v. Wier, </em>260 Or App 341, 317 P3d 330 (2013), we disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">A party is generally entitled to have a proposed jury instruction given if the instruction accurately states the applicable law. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>329 Or 327, 334, 986 P2d 1160 (1999). On appeal, defendant argues that his proposed instruction is a correct statement of law because, pursuant to ORS 161.095(2), a \u201cdefendant is only guilty of third-degree sexual abuse if a jury finds that he acted with a culpable mental state with respect to the element that the victim does not consent.\u201d The state disagrees that any mental state requirement applies to the \u201cdoes not consent\u201d element. In the alternative, the state argues that, even if some culpable mental state must accompany that element, \u201cknowing\u201d is not the applicable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">After the parties briefed this case, we decided <em>Wier, </em>206 Or App 341. That case also involved a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction on the elements of third-degree sexual abuse. The defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction included this phrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if the person knowingly subjects another person to sexual contact and the victim does not consent to the sexual contact and <em>if the person knows that the victim does not consent to the sexual contact.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 344 (emphasis in original). We agreed with the defendant that \u201clack of consent\u201d is an element that relates directly to the evil sought to be prevented by the crime of third-degree sexual abuse and, as such, the state must prove that the defendant acted with a culpable mental state as to that element. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52 (citing <em>State v. Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App 129, 147, 235 P3d 710 (2010), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>351 Or 486, 286 P3d 568 (2011)). We rejected, however, the defendant\u2019s argument that the applicable mental state was \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-53 (concluding that the state was required to prove only \u201cthat a defendant acted, at a minimum, with criminal negligence with respect to lack of consent\u201d). Consequently, we held that \u201c[t]he trial court did not err in declining to provide the jury with defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on third-degree sexual abuse because the instruction incorrectly stated that the state had to prove that defendant acted knowingly with respect to the second victim\u2019s lack of consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In this case, defendant requested an instruction that the mental state of \u201cknowing\u201d attaches to the \u201cdoes not consent\u201d element. That is precisely the instruction that we rejected in <em>Wier. </em>Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to issue defendant\u2019s requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> ORS 163.415 defines sexual abuse in the third degree as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of sexual abuse in the third degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnO\">\u201c(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">\u201c(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">\u201c(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years ofage[.j\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
