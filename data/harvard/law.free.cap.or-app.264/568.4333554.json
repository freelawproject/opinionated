The order upheld the results of premium audit billings issued by petitioner\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, SAIF Corporation (SAIF), for three audit periods: July 1, 2008 to July 1, 2009; July 1, 2009 to July 1, 2010; and July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011. <em>See </em>ORS 737.318; OAR 836-043-0110 (workers\u2019 compensation premium audit program); ORS 737.505 (appeals to the director of DCBS). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We begin by providing some background information for the discussion that follows. An employer pays workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums based on the risk associated with its business. <em>Lemma Wine Co. v. Natl. Council on Comp. Ins., </em>194 Or App 371, 373-74, 95 P3d 238 (2004). Employers are assigned risk classifications based on the general nature of the business. <em>Id. </em>When an individual employee performs multiple jobs with different levels of risk, the employer can qualify for multiple classifications for that employee, provided that the employer maintains \u201cverifiable payroll records\u201d concerning the work that the individual employee performs. OAR 836-042-0060(1). If an employer does not maintain verifiable payroll records for an individual employee as required, \u201cthe entire payroll of the employee shall be assigned to the highest rated classification [.]\u201d OAR 836-042-0060(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Under OAR 836-042-0060(4), payroll records are \u201cverifiable\u201d if they have the following characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">\u201c(a) The records must establish a time basis, and the time basis must be hourly or a part thereof, daily or part thereof, weekly or part thereof, monthly or part thereof or yearly or part thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201c(b) For each salaried employee, the records must also include time records in which the salary is converted to an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly rate and then multiplied by the time spent by the employee in each classification exposure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c(c) The records must include a description of duties performed by the employee, to enable the insurer to determine correct classification assignment. Records requiring additional explanation or interpretation are not considered to be verifiable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">\u201c(d) The records must be supported by original entries from other records, including but not limited to time cards, calendars, planners or daily logs prepared by the employee or the employee\u2019s direct supervisor or manager. Estimated ratios or percentages do not comply with the requirement of this subsection and are not acceptable for verification. Verifiable records must be summarized in the insured employer\u2019s accounting records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Thus, in order to be considered \u201cverifiable\u201d pursuant to the rule, payroll records must meet all of the listed characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With that context in mind, we turn to the facts of this case, which are undisputed. Petitioner is a business owned by Mr. and Mrs. Cornett. Petitioner\u2019s work includes tree pruning and lawn maintenance and, on rare occasions, other work such as masonry work and building fences. Petitioner has been audited several times in the past, and has been permitted to divide its payroll classifications between classification code 0106 (tree and shrub pruning, above ground level) and the lower-risk classification code 9102 (lawn maintenance performed from the ground level).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Petitioner maintained its records as follows: Mr. Cornett kept a \u201cdaily log\u201d of employee hours based on verbal reports from each crew at the end of each work day. For each job, Mr. Cornett would record the person or business being billed, the crew members assigned to the job, the number of hours worked per crew member, and whether the work performed was \u201cAG\u201d (performed \u201cabove ground\u201d) or \u201cBG\u201d (performed with \u201cboots on the ground\u201d). Mr. Cornett used the initials \u201cAG\u201d to designate work that was \u201cabove ground,\u201d that is, work that, in his opinion, fell within classification code 0106. He used the initials \u201cBG\u201d to designate work that was performed with \u201cboots on the ground,\u201d that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>work that, in his opinion, fell within classification code 9102. Once a week, Mr. Cornett provided each employee\u2019s weekly hours to Mrs. Cornett, who input the data into QuickBooks for payroll purposes. At the end of each month, Mr. Cornett created a \u201cmonthly summary,\u201d in which he summarized each employee\u2019s hours for the month, dividing the hours between \u201cAG\u201d and \u201cBG\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Other than designating the employees\u2019 work as \u201cAG\u201d or \u201cBG,\u201d the daily log did not describe the specific duties that each employee had performed on each job. However, when petitioner would first bid on a job, it would create an invoice that provided, among other things, a general description of the services to be performed \u2014 for example, \u201cRemove and stump grind dead cedar tree right side of home as facing,\u201d or \u201cTrim two maple trees in front yard.\u201d By consulting the invoice generated for a particular job, one could generally determine the type of work that the employees had performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In August 2010, an auditor, on behalf of SAIF, issued a final premium audit billing (billing) to petitioner for the period of July 1, 2008 to July 1, 2009. As relevant to this case, the auditor determined that the records that petitioner provided for the audit did not enable him to determine the correct classification assignment and did not meet the requirements for verifiable records under OAR 836-042-0060. The auditor assigned the \u201cvast majority of subject payroll\u201d to the higher-risk classification code 0106, resulting in a billing of $63,397.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In May 2011, the auditor issued two additional billings to petitioner, for the periods of July 1, 2009 to July 1, 2010, and July 1, 2010 to January 1, 2011. Again, the auditor determined that the time records did not include a description of the work performed by employees and did not meet the requirements for verifiable time records under OAR 836-042-0060. The two audits resulted in billings of $170,465.73 and $85,300.63, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">At petitioner\u2019s request, a hearing was held to review the three billings. In a proposed order, an administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that \u201c[petitioner\u2019s] payroll records do not satisfy the criteria for verifiable time records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>set out in OAR 836-042-0060 and therefore do not support a division of payroll among class codes 0106 and 9102,\u201d and that the billings for the three audit periods were correct. Specifically, the ALJ concluded that (1) petitioner\u2019s payroll records failed to satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) because its \u201cdaily log contains no description of duties performed by the employee\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (2) petitioner failed to satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d) because it \u201chas no other contemporaneous records to establish employees\u2019 time basis and work activity\u201d and therefore petitioner\u2019s \u201cdaily log cannot be audited for accuracy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The director of DCBS (the director) issued a final order, in which he adopted and incorporated the ALJ\u2019s reasoning and conclusions of law and affirmed the billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Petitioner now appeals the director\u2019s final order, arguing that the director erred as a matter of law in concluding that petitioner did not maintain verifiable payroll records in accordance with OAR 836-042-0060(4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, petitioner challenges the conclusion that its payroll records \u2014 consisting of petitioner\u2019s daily logs, monthly summaries, and invoices \u2014 do not satisfy the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) and (d). According to petitioner, the daily logs together with the invoices \u201cinclude a description of duties performed\u201d sufficient to satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c), and the daily logs include original entries created by a manager, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d). In addition, petitioner argues that because the director has previously issued an order stating that petitioner maintained verifiable records \u2014 and this court upheld that order in <em>R &amp; R Tree Service, Inc. v. SAIF, </em>251 Or App 735, 286 P3d 1232 (2012) <em>(R &amp; R </em>I) \u2014 the director erred when it concluded otherwise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Respondents DCBS and SAIF respond that petitioner\u2019s payroll records fail to satisfy the requirements of both OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) and (d). First, respondents argue that petitioner\u2019s invoices are not payroll records, and that, even if they are considered part of petitioner\u2019s payroll records, the records do not include a description of duties performed that is sufficient \u201cto enable the insurer to determine correct classification assignment\u201d without \u201cadditional explanation or interpretation,\u201d as required by OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c). Second, respondents argue that petitioner\u2019s daily logs do not satisfy OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d) because they are not filled out by a \u201cdirect supervisor or manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We review an agency\u2019s conclusions for legal error. ORS 183.482(8)(a). As an initial matter, we address petitioner\u2019s argument that our previous decision in <em>R&amp;RI </em>controls the outcome of this case. Following an audit for the period of July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008, the director concluded that petitioner had not met its burden of proof in support of a different or divided classification under OAR 836-042-0060. <em>R&amp;RI, </em>251 Or App at 739. We noted that \u201c[a] significant focus of petitioner\u2019s three assignments of error is on whether the director of DCBS erred in concluding that petitioner\u2019s records were not \u2018verifiable\u2019 payroll records, as defined in OAR 836-042-0060(4).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739-40. However, we determined that \u201cthe ALJ and the director concluded that, although petitioner\u2019s records were \u2018verifiable,\u2019 they were insufficient to \u2018disclose a specific allocation for each such individual employee,\u2019 OAR 836-042-0060(l)[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. Thus, the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s challenge to the final order based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>on its maintenance of \u2018verifiable\u2019 records [was] unavailing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the director\u2019s determination that, based on the extent of the errors that the audit had revealed, \u201cthe verifiable time records were not sufficient to justify a division between two codes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Petitioner \u201cinterprets this court\u2019s decision in [R <em>&amp; RI] </em>to be that the ALJ and the Director concluded the payroll records maintained by [petitioner] were verifiable * * * and the Director\u2019s Order was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d According to petitioner, \u201c[p]ayroll records maintained in the same way by the same person and [previously] found to be verifiable by the auditor, the ALJ, the Director, and this Court should continue to be found verifiable in a subsequent audit, absent any rule change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We disagree with petitioner\u2019s interpretation of <em>R &amp; R I. </em>The issue in that case was not whether the payroll records were verifiable under OAR 836-042-0060(4), but whether, given the errors revealed by the audit, the records were sufficient to \u201cdisclose a specific allocation for each such individual employee,\u201d under OAR 836-042-0060(1). We rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that the director had erred by concluding that the payroll records were not \u201cverifiable,\u201d because the director had made no such conclusion. Thus, we did not reach the merits of the petitioner\u2019s argument regarding that issue. Indeed, we noted that, \u201cin any event, the spreadsheets that [the] petitioner maintained were not supported by original time cards or other work logs prepared by the employees or the employees\u2019 direct supervisor. <em>See </em>OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740 n 5. Although that comment was <em>dictum, </em>it contradicts petitioner\u2019s contention in this case that its payroll records were previously \u201cfound to be verifiable by * * * this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We now turn to the parties\u2019 arguments regarding OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) and (d). As noted, OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) states that \u201c[t]he records must include a description of duties performed by the employee, to enable the insurer to determine correct classification assignment. Records requiring additional explanation or interpretation are not considered to be verifiable[.]\u201d OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>requires that \u201c[t]he records must be supported by original entries from other records * * * prepared by the employee or the employee\u2019s direct supervisor or manager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Petitioner asserts that \u201c [i]t is the invoices which are part of [petitioner\u2019s] payroll records, <em>taken together with the daily log\u2019s classification of the work </em>as [\u201cAG\u201d or \u201cBG\u201d], that provides a description of the duties performed by the employee sufficient\u201d to satisfy OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c). (Emphasis added.) Petitioner then argues that the daily logs satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d). However, even assuming \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that petitioner\u2019s daily logs and invoices satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c), those records \u201cmust be supported by original entries from <em>other </em>records.\u201d OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d) (emphasis added). Thus, the daily log cannot satisfy both the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c) and OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d). Petitioner has failed to point to any \u201coriginal entries from other records\u201d that support its payroll records, regardless of whether the payroll records consist of the daily logs by themselves or the daily logs taken together with the invoices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060 (4)(d) have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Petitioner failed to maintain verifiable payroll records, as required - by OAR 836-042-0060(1), because its payroll records were not \u201csupported by original entries from other records,\u201d as required by OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d). Thus, the director did not err when it upheld the three billings at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\"> Petitioner was also authorized to use classification codes for \u201cbid\u201d work and office work; the use of those codes is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\"> The ALJ appears to have determined that the invoices, which petitioner would create when it first bid on a job and would then consult to determine the type of work the employees had performed, are not part of petitioner\u2019s payroll records. The ALJ stated that, \u201cto determine what work activity an employee performed on any given day, requires consulting the particular invoices for the jobs the employee worked,\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause the daily log requires additional explanation or interpretation to ascertain what duties the employee performed that day it cannot be considered as verifiable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\"> The ALJ decided that petitioner\u2019s invoices do not satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d) because they are not contemporaneous and they \u201coccasionally require additional explanation or interpretation to ascertain the proper pairing with the daily log, and/or to determine the correct classification assignment for the work performed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> In a second assignment of error, petitioner argues that when the rules are correctly interpreted and applied, \u201c[t]here is no substantial evidence to support the Director\u2019s conclusion that the employer\u2019s payroll records were not verifiable and did not support a division of payroll.\u201d Under ORS 183.482(8)(c), this court \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if the court finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Substantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d However, petitioner does not challenge the director\u2019s findings of fact; instead, petitioner argues that there is no substantial evidence to support the director\u2019s legal conclusion that the payroll records were not \u201cverifiable.\u201d In effect, petitioner makes the same argument in both assignments of error; thus, we do not address each assignment of error separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> At oral argument, petitioner argued for the first time that the invoices, by themselves, satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c), and the daily logs satisfy the requirements of OAR 836-042-0060(4)(d). Even were we to consider that argument, petitioner has failed to explain how the invoices, without more, provide \u201ca description of duties performed by the employee, to enable the insurer to determine correct classification assignment\u201d without \u201crequiring additional explanation or interpretation.\u201d OAR 836-042-0060(4)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
