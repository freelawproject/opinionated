Appellant argues that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the record does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cbecause of a mental disorder,\u201d she is \u201c[u]nable to provide for basic personal needs and is not receiving such care as is necessary for health or safety.\u201d ORS 426.005(l)(e)(B). The state concedes that the evidence is legally insufficient for involuntary commitment and that the judgment should be reversed. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse the commitment judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in prohibiting her from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Finding that an individual \u201cis a person with mental illness\u201d is a condition precedent to the issuance of an order prohibiting the purchase or possession of a firearm, ORS 426.130(1)(a)(D). <em>State v. Thierman, </em>161 Or App 175, 176, 984 P2d 320 (1999). Accordingly, the reason for our reversal of the commitment judgment also requires reversal of the firearms order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
