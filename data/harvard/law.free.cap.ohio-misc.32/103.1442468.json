C. 3937.30 to 3937.39 on the nonrenewal of a ninety day automobile insurance policy. The controlling facts are not in dispute. On July 11, 1970, plaintiff insurer (here praying for a declaratory judgment) issued to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>fendant insured a policy of automobile insurance including' uninsured motorist coverage. On its face the stated policy period was July 7,1970 to October 11,1970. On September 20th. the insurer mailed the insured a \u201cNotice of Expiration and Renewal Order,\u201d which recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">\u201cYour policy expires on the due date shown (10/11/70). Please return this portion with your check or money order payable to Financial Indemnity Company in the self-addressed envelope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cReceipt by the company of the \u2018amount due\u2019 on or before the due date will renew your policy. If payment is not made your policy will expire on the \u2018due date.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Defendant insured claims not to have received this notice, but for reasons set out below, this is not material. No payment of the \u201camount due\u201d was made to the insurer prior to October 11th.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On October 16th the company mailed the insured a document entitled \u201cInsurance Policy Notice of Lapse,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cThe above continuing policy lapsed on the lapse date shown because the renewal premium has not been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cYou may renew your policy with a lapse of coverage by paying one of the four premium options shown above plus the late charge. This must be done within 30 days of the lapse date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The lapse date was shown thereon as October 11th.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">On October 16th defendant insured was involved in an automobile collision and claims coverage under the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Subsequent thereto the insured paid an additional premium and the insurer issued a \u201cRenewal Certificate\u201d showing a renewal of the policy effective 11/7/70 to 2/7/71, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">\u201cYour policy has been renewed, but there was no coverage in force between the lapse date and the effective date of the renewal period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">The prayer of plaintiff insurer is that the court enter a declaratory judgment construing the insurance policy and the applicable Ohio statutes and find that the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>was not in force on October 16, 1970. The matter is before the court on plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the pleadings and affidavits filed in support of the motion..</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">There can be no question that under its terms the policy expired on October 11, 1970 and therefore provided no coverage on October 16, 1970. However, it is equally clear that the policy being an \u201cautomobile insurance policy\u201d within the meaning of R. C. 3937.30 is governed by the provisions of R. C. 3937.31 <em>et seq. </em>The language of paragraph (A) of R. C. 3937.31 is crucial in the matter. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cEvery automobile insurance policy issued or renewed on or after the effective date of this act shall be issued for a policy period of not less than two years or <em>guaranteed renewable for successive policy periods </em>totaling not less than two years. Where renewal is mandatory, <em>\u2018cancellation, </em>\u2019 as used in R. C. 3937.30 to 3937.39, inclusive, <em>includes refusal to reneio a policy </em>with at least the coverages, included insureds, and policy limits provided <em>at the end of the next preceding policy period. </em>No insurer may cancel any such policy except pursuant to the terms of the policy, and in accordance with 3937.30 to 3937.39, inclusive, and for one or more of the following reasons: * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">We believe this language means the policy before us was required to be \u201cguaranteed renewable for <em>successive </em>policy periods totaling not less than two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Plaintiff argues that the policy was never \u201ccancelled\u201d but simply \u201clapsed\u201d because of its termination date. Certainly plaintiff is correct that in insurance law there is a distinction between \u201cexpiration\u201d or \u201clapse\u201d and \u201ccancellation.\u201d However, the statute above set out says where renewal is mandatory, as it is here, \u201ccancellation\u201d as used in these sections included refusal to renew a policy. But, argues plaintiff, we did renew the policy and always stood ready to renew the policy for up to a two year period. In our judgment this is not the type of renewal contemplated by the statute, which requires that the policy be \u201cguaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>teed renewable for <em>successive </em>policy periods.\u201d The word \u201csuccessive\u201d means following each other without interruption. It is a synonym of the word \u201cconsecutive.\u201d If the word \u201csuccessive\u201d is to be given any meaning as it must in statutory interpretation, it can only mean that. Otherwise, it could have been omitted from the sentence entirely. This conclusion is buttressed by the use of the* words \u201cat the end of the next preceding policy period\u201d in the following sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We are here involved with a question of the intent of the Legislature. Plaintiff has submitted the affidavit of a former member of the Ohio General Assembly who sponsored the bill which became the act enacting the sections of the code with which we are here concerned. This affidavit seeks to interpret the intent of the Legislature. We believe that the meaning of the act must be determined from the words of the statute itself. The court cannot consider what an individual legislator, even the author of the bill, states he understood them to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">A review of the act entitled \u201cAn Act to Enact R. C. 8937.30 to 3937.39, inclusive, relative to cancellation and non-renewal of auto insurance,\u201d printed in 133 Ohio Laws 1007, leads us to the conclusion that coverage under automobile insurance policies, whether written for a two-year period or for ninety-day periods renewable for periods up to two years cannot be terminated except by compliance with the cancellation requirements set out therein. Not only do the words of the act itself so indicate but the logic of the situation dictates the same result. The obvious intent of the act was to prevent termination of coverage until the insured had gotten a good, clear notice that coverage was to terminate in adequate time to take care of the matter or obtain other coverage. If insurers could circumvent this legislative intent by simply writing ninety-day policies, the act would rapidly become ineffective. That the Legislature did not intend this result is clear in the language that \u201ccancellation\u201d includes \u201crefusal to renew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We conclude then that before an insurer can refuse to. repew for a period comppepcing at the teppiipatiop of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>preceding period of coverage, he must comply with the cancellation requirements of R. C. 3937.30 to 3937.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The issue then becomes was plaintiff\u2019s \u201cNotice of Expiration and Renewal Order\u201d mailed September 20th or its \u201cInsurance Policy Notice of Lapse\u201d mailed October 16th, a \u201ccancellation\u201d of the insurance under the above sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">R. C. 3937.32 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cNo cancellation of an automobile insurance policy is effective, unless it is pursuant to written notice to the insured of cancellation. Such notice shall contain: * <em>* '*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201c(C) The effective date of cancellation of the policy, which shall not be earlier than thirty days following the date of notice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201c(D) An explanation of the reason for cancellation and the information upon which it is based, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201c(E) Where cancellation is for nonpayment of premium at least ten days notice from the date of mailing of cancellation accompanied by the reason therefore shall be given; * <em>* </em>*\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">The notice mailed September 20th could not have been a cancellation for nonpayment of premium because under the terms of the policy no premium was due until October 11th. It did not give an effective date of cancellation \u201cnot earlier than thirty days following the date of the notice.\u201d Accordingly, under R. C. 3937.32 it was not an effective cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The \u201cInsurance Policy Notice of Lapse\u201d mailed by plaintiff on October 16, 1970, even if it had complied with all other requirements of the above section, could not have effected a cancellation prior to October 26, 1970. Therefore, we conclude that the provisions of R. C. 3937.33 that \u201cin the event of the insurer\u2019s failure to comply with any requirement of this section, such cancellation shall be ineffective and the policy shall continue in force until such time as it is cancelled or otherwise terminated pursuant to law and the terms of the policy\u201d govern the issue here before us and defendant\u2019s policy was in effect on October 16,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary jiulgment denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
