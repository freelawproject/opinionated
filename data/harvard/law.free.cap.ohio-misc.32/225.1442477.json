A.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b239-14\">Hogan, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_N\">The plaintiff, at the times of interest in this case, was an \u201cair carrier\u201d as that term is used in Ch. 20 of 49 U. S. Code. As such, it had filed with the \u201cBoard\u201d tariffs applicable to various of its carriages. Having done so, it was subject to 49 U. S. Code, Section 1373 and specifically (b) of that section, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cNo air carrier shall charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for air transportation, or for any service in connection therewith, than the rates, fares and charges specified in its currently effective tariffs * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Section 1472(d) of Title 49 makes it a criminal offense for any air carrier or ticket agent or employee or representative thereof to willfully grant or give, or cause to he offered, granted, or given, any rebate or other concession in violation of the provisions of the Act, and specifically makes it a criminal offense for any such person to suffer or permit any shipper to obtain transportation or services at less than the published tariff rates. For some period of time prior to 1959 \u2014 ending at a time more than six years before the commencement of this action \u2014 the defendant made some three thousand shipments (at least) via the plaintiff\u2019s air carrier services. Each of these shipments was represented or covered by an \u201cair bill.\u201d This is a written instrument which corresponds to a railroad bill of lading. For our purposes we may assume that each air bill was actually signed by both the shipper, the defendant, and also by the air carrier, the plaintiff. Each air bill contained a blank for the insertion of the charge for the service. Apparently the charge was actually inserted in the air bill after the shipper had signed it \u2014 in our view, it makes no difference whether the insertion was after or before, since that was the practice of the parties anyway. In any event, in each of the some three thousand shipments, the actual charges inserted in the air bill were less than the tariff rates \u2014 that is, less than the applicable rates on the published and filed tariffs of the plaintiff. The defendant paid only what it was charged, of course, and the purpose of this action is to recover the undercharge in accordance with the requirements of the above statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">For jurisdictional purposes \u2014 there is no problem of the requisite amount. The parties are each residents or citizens of California, so there is no diversity jurisdiction, of course.. Early in this controversy the defendant objected to the subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that tig <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>federal question was involved. The plaintiff at that time resisted the objection to jurisdiction and based its resistance on 28 U. S. Code, Section 1337, which, of course, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-3\">\u201cThe district court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any act of Congress regulating commerce * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">That, of course, is the equivalent of claiming that this action arises under a federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">There is no issue of fact at all on this point \u2014 every service rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant involved in this controversy was rendered more than six years before this case was filed in February of 1968. Every air bill involved was signed and delivered more than six years before that date and every statement covering all the transactions involved in this case found some issue prior to the six-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Concededly the plaintiff\u2019s cause or causes of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of this action. The defendant has moved for a summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The question is novel. While Congress has provided statutes of limitation governing actions by licensed or permitted freight forwarders or against them (49 U. S. Code, Section 1006a \u2014 two or three years as the case may be) and while Congress has provided a statute of limitations for such actions involving railroad common carriers and water common carriers (49 U. S. Code, Section 16\u2014 three years) Congress has provided no statute of limitations applicable to an action by or against an air carrier to recover undercharges or the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The duty of a district court in this circuit in the face of a plea of the statute of limitations is set forth in <em>Val Decker Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Corn Products Sales Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1969), 411 F. 2d 850. We need not repeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The applicable rule of generality is set forth in <em>International Union, United </em>Automobile, <em>etc., Workers </em>v. <em>Hoosier Cardinal Corp. </em>(1965), 383 U. S. 696, at 705, 86 S. Ct. 1107, at 1113, 16 L. Ed 2d 192, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cAccordingly, since no federal provision governs, we hold that the timeliness of a * # * suit, snch as the present-one, is to be determined, as a matter of federal law, by reference to the appropriate state statute of limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">There are three Ohio statutes of limitation of possible application. It. C. 2305.06 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cAn action upon a specialty or an agreement, contract, or promise in writing shall be brought within 15 years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The plaintiff claims that this is the applicable statute\u2014 relying on numerous cases which refer to a bill of lading or to an air bill as a \u201ccontract in writing\u201d between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">R. C. 2305.07 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">\u201cAn action upon a contract not in writing, express or implied, or upon a liability created by statute, other than a forfeiture or penalty, shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">The defendant claims that this is the applicable Ohio statute. The claim has two bases. First, periodically the plaintiff would tally up the charges and render the defendant a cumulative bill, which leads the defendant to the contention that this is an action on an account. An action on an account clearly in Ohio is subject to the six-year statute. The second basis rests on the Mahoning County Court of Appeals case of <em>Rudolph </em>v. <em>Husat </em>(1961), 187 N. E. 2d 190 \u2014in that case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201cIn order for an action to come within statutes of limitation governing actions upon a specialty or agreement, contract or promise in writing, the action must grow out of a written instrument which acknowledges indebtedness, or promises to pay in such terms as to make supplemental evidence unnecessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The defendant points to the necessity of the tariffs as supplemental evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">The third statute is R. C. 2305.13. This statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">\u201cAll actions by carriers for recovery of their charges or part thereof, arising out of the intrastate transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of persons or property in this state * * * shall be begun within three years of the time the cause of action accrues. * * * The cause of action in respect of a shipment of property shall accrue upon the delivery thereof by the carrier. \u2018Overcharge\u2019 as used in this section means charges for transportation services in excess of those applicable thereto under the tariffs lawfully on file with the public utilities commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">It is the conclusion of this court that the \u2018 \u2018 appropriate state statute of limitations\u201d to refer to \u201cas a matter of federal law\u201d is either the six-year or the three-year statute for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">First \u2014 This actually is not an action on a contract. The price stated in the contract is not what the plaintiff seeks to recover \u2014 it is the difference between a tariff price and the price contracted for. But for the federal statutes referred to above, the contract would have been a perfectly valid one.. The statute is as necessary a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action as it is for the jurisdiction of this court. The Fifth Circuit has aptly said in a case involving an air carrier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cSuch tariffs, at least those which are factors in determining the carrier\u2019s charges, have the force and effect of statutes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Associated Air Transport </em>(5th Cir. 1960), 275 F. 2d 827 at p. 833.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Essentially the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is or are the undercharge sections of the federal statutes which have been referred to hereinabove. Essentially this is an action on a \u201cstatute\u201d and for that reason the Ohio six-year statute would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Secondly, in the search for the \u201cappropriate state statute\u201d the question is ever present \u2014 is the search for literacy or is the search for the substantive. Ohio has clearly expressed itself on the time within which any carrier should be able to sue to recover an undercharge. True it is, the expression was directed to \u201cintrastate\u201d shipment. For good reason \u2014 Ohio\u2019s right of power to directly limit in <em>haec verbae, </em>the time within which one could exercise a federal right would be of dubious validity. We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the search is for the substantive without regard to technical literacy. See <em>Vanderboom </em>v. <em>Sexton </em>(8th Cir. 1970), 422 F. 2d 1233, in which the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201cThe basic standard for determining which of the various local periods of limitation to utilize is that it should be \u2018one which effectuates the federal policy at issue.\u2019 \u201d Citing <em>Charney </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(6th Cir. 1967), 372 F. 2d 97.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">See, also, <em>Englander Motors, Inc., </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1961), 293 F. 2d 802; <em>Reliford </em>v. <em>Eastern Coal </em>(6th Cir. 1958), 260 F. 2d 447; <em>Charney </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(6th Cir. 1967), 372 F. 2d 97; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Schlachter </em>(6th Cir. 1968), 389 F. 2d 231; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Zeitler </em>(6th Cir. 1964), 326 F. 2d 119. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Auto Workers, </em>in determining the applicable state statute (whether the long or short period of limitations should be described as the one most effectuating federal policy) it is quite in order to look to the federal statutory regulation in the general field. As we have seen, the applicable limitation periods provided by Congress in related fields, such as water shippers or land shippers, is a short two- or three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The fifteen-year section is not the most \u201cappropriate\u201d section. Either the six-year section or the three-year section is. It is not necessary in this case to decide which and we do refrain from so deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The amended complaint will be and it hereby is dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>Complaint dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
