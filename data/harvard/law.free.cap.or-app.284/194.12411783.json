Nelson, </em>282 Or App 427, 386 P3d 73 (2016), <em>State v. Dugan, </em>282 Or App 768, 387 P3d 439 (2016), and <em>State v. Avila, </em>283 Or App 262, 388 P3d 383 (2016), that ORS 161.067(3) is inapplicable to this case because defendant\u2019s acts did not constitute \u201cthe same conduct or criminal episode\u201d as the phrase is used in that statute. We reject the state\u2019s argument based on our decisions in <em>Nelson, Dugan, </em>and <em>Avila.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Alternatively, the state argues that the three sexual abuse verdicts should not merge because the acts that support those verdicts were not simultaneous and took place over the course of several minutes. That argument also fails in light of <em>Nelson, </em>in which we held that \u201cmerger of guilty verdicts for multiple acts of sexual contact with different body parts constituting sexual abuse is proper where the defendant\u2019s conduct occurred in one location, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u2018without interruption by any \u201csignificant\u201d event, and without a pause in the defendant\u2019s aggression.\u2019\u201d <em>Dugan, </em>282 Or App at 772 (quoting <em>Nelson, </em>282 Or App at 447). In this case, as in <em>Nelson, </em>the record does not contain evidence that would allow a nonspeculative inference \u201cthat \u2018something of significance\u2019 occurred between the defendant\u2019s sequential acts of touching.\u201d 282 Or App at 446. Accordingly, we agree with defendant that the trial court should have merged the guilty verdicts for first-degree sexual abuse into a single conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Convictions on Counts 2, 3, and 4 reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of conviction for one count of first-degree sexual abuse; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> ORS 163.427(1) provides that a person commits the crime of first-degree sexual abuse if, among other things, that person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(a) Subjects another person to sexual contact and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201c(A) The victim is less than 14 years of age[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> ORS 161.067(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to he separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from other such violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-5\"> Our disposition that the trial court erred by entering multiple convictions for first-degree sexual abuse obviates the need to reach defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he argues that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences on two of his convictions for first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
