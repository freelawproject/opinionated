J.</author>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Petitioner requests judicial review of the Board of Psychologist Examiners\u2019 final order that suspended petitioner\u2019s license to practice as a psychologist associate and assessed a $10,000 civil penalty. The board notified petitioner that it intended to discipline him for (1) listing the abbreviation \u201cPsyA\u201d after his name on letterhead, business cards, signature blocks, and websites, (2) using the phrase \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d to describe his degree in at least one of those forums, and (3) indicating that he \u201chas been practicing psychology for 15 years\u201d on at least one website. An administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a proposed order that granted summary determination to the board, concluding that petitioner engaged in \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d under ORS 675.070(2)(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and violated the prohibition in ORS 675.020(1)(b) against representing \u201coneself to be a psychologist without first being licensed under ORS 675.010 to 675.150.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">After rejecting petitioner\u2019s exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s order, the board issued a final order that adopted the ALJ\u2019s proposed order with minor modifications, concluding that petitioner was \u201cengaged in immoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d because he created a \u201cserious risk to public health or safety\u201d by misleading and deceiving the public about his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>academic degree and credentials.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 675.070(2)(d)(A) (conduct that is a danger to the health or safety of the public is \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d). Accordingly, the board suspended petitioner\u2019s psychologist associate license for one year<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, because it concluded that petitioner\u2019s conduct was \u201cdeliberate and with knowledge,\u201d assessed a $10,000 civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">On judicial review, petitioner argues that the ALJ committed legal error by concluding that the conduct that he admitted to violated ORS 675.020(1)(b) and ORS 675.070 (2)(d). He argues that his use of \u201cPsyA\u201d was not misleading to the public because he also included phrases such as \u201cpsychologist associate,\u201d \u201clicensed psychologist associate\u201d or \u201cPortland psychologist associate\u201d immediately following his use of \u201cPsyA.\u201d Alternatively, he asserts that, even assuming that his use of \u201cPsyA\u201d was a falsification of his academic degree or professional credentials, the board \u201cfailed to adduce substantial evidence to connect such a falsification with any public detriment.\u201d Similarly, he asserts that his use of \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d were not misleading in the context in which he used those words and did not constitute a danger to the health or safety of the public. As for the AL J\u2019s conclusion that he held himself out as a licensed psychologist, he asserts that the ALJ erred because a psychologist associate is authorized by the applicable statutes to \u201cpractice psychology\u201d\u2014at least to a limited extent. Finally, petitioner asserts that, even if his conduct merited discipline, the $10,000 penalty should be remanded for reconsideration because whether petitioner engaged in \u201cwillful or reckless disregard for the law\u201d was a factual issue that could not be resolved on summary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In response, the board first asserts that petitioner failed to preserve the arguments that he makes on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>On the merits, the board argues that, based on the totality of petitioner\u2019s undisputed conduct and the summary determination record, the ALJ permissibly concluded that petitioner\u2019s conduct would mislead the public into thinking that petitioner had a doctoral degree in psychology and was a licensed psychologist, and thus, it represented a risk to the public health and safety. The board also asserts that the relevant statutes unambiguously state that only a \u201cdoctoral level psychologist\u201d is licensed to \u201cpractice psychology,\u201d so petitioner\u2019s assertions that he \u201chas been practicing psychology for 15 years\u201d violated ORS 675.020(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Ultimately, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact remained that precluded a ruling for the board on summary determination. Thus, the ALJ erred by granting summary determination to the board, and we reverse and remand the board\u2019s final order for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We begin with the relevant undisputed background and procedural facts. Petitioner earned a Master of Arts degree in psychology. His transcript indicated that he \u201cmajored\u201d in psychology with an \u201cemphasis\u201d in clinical psychology. He is licensed by the board as a psychologist associate under ORS 675.065 and, pursuant to ORS 675.065(3), received approval from the board to \u201cfunction without immediate supervision.\u201d Psychologist associate licenses are issued to applicants who meet certain statutory requirements, possess a \u201cmaster\u2019s degree in psychology\u201d from an approved program, and \u201care deemed competent to perform certain functions within the practice of psychology under the periodic direct supervision of a psychologist\u201d licensed in Oregon, unless they receive approval to practice without such supervision, as petitioner was. ORS 675.065(1), (3). The \u201cfunctions within the practice of psychology\u201d that a psychologist associate may perform \u201cmay include but are not restricted to administering tests of mental abilities, conducting personality assessments and counseling, including educational and vocational planning.\u201d ORS 675.065(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In May 2013, the board issued a notice to petitioner that it intended to impose a civil penalty of $5,000 against him for violating ORS 675.070(2)(d), based on allegations that petitioner placed \u201cPsyA\u201d followed by the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201cLicensed Psychologist Associate\u201d behind his name on letterhead, business cards, signature block, and websites available to the public. The board\u2019s notice indicated that \u201cPsyA\u201d was not a \u201crecognized abbreviation in the field of psychology, either as an academic degree or professional license designation,\u201d and asserted that use of that abbreviation constituted \u201cstatements that are false, deceptive or fraudulent regarding [petitioner\u2019s] academic degree.\u201d Accordingly, the board alleged that petitioner\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d under ORS 675.070(2)(d) and violated an ethical standard adopted by the board that prohibited false or deceptive statements. <em>See </em>OAR 858-010-0075(1) (adopting the ethical principles and code of conduct of the American Psychological Association). Subsequently, the board amended its notice to allege that petitioner\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d and references to \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d on letterhead and websites also violated ORS 675.070(2)(d) because that conduct constituted \u201cfalse, deceptive or fraudulent statement [s]\u201d regarding petitioner\u2019s academic degree and credentials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the board alleged that petitioner\u2019s conduct violated ORS 675.020(1)(b), which prohibits representing oneself as a psychologist without first obtaining a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">The board\u2019s amended notice proposed suspending petitioner\u2019s psychologist associate license for one year and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty. Petitioner requested a contested case hearing and the board referred the case to an ALJ with the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Petitioner answered the board\u2019s notices by admitting that he used the abbreviation \u201cPsyA\u201d to stand for \u201cpsychologist associate\u201d in various publicly available forums, but noting that he never did so without also \u201cspelling out some variant of\u2018psychologist associate.\u2019\u201d He also admitted to using \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d to describe his degree, but argued that he did so because his master\u2019s degree program emphasized clinical psychology. As for his statement that he \u201chas been practicing psychology for 15 years,\u201d he asserted that ORS chapter 675 authorizes psychologist associates to perform \u201ccertain functions within the practice of psychology,\u201d so his use of that phrase was not false, deceptive, or fraudulent. In short, he admitted to most of the conduct alleged by the board, but denied that that conduct constituted \u201cfalse, deceptive, or fraudulent statements\u201d that would harm the public, or amounted to representing \u201coneself to be a psychologist\u201d even though he was not a licensed psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\">Subsequently, petitioner and the board moved for summary determination under OAR 137-003-0580, which \u201cprovides for an administrative \u2018summary determination\u2019 proceeding that is akin to a trial court summary judgment proceeding under ORCP 47.\u201d <em>Lucke v. DPSST, </em>247 Or App 630, 633, 270 P3d 251 (2012). In that proceeding, the ALJ is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, OAR 137-003-0580(7), and grant the motion if there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact that is relevant to resolution of the legal issue as to which a decision is sought\u201d and \u201cthe party filing the motion is entitled to a favorable ruling as a matter of law.\u201d OAR 137-003-0580(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In its motion, the board asserted that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of fact\u201d and, thus, \u201cno requirement for a fact finding hearing.\u201d The board claimed that petitioner\u2019s conduct \u201cis established as a matter of law\u201d and \u201chis use of the initials \u2018PsyA\u2019 are not recognized in the profession and, therefore, constitute a false, deceptive or fraudulent statement.\u201d In essence, the board asserted that, based on petitioner\u2019s admissions to using the unrecognized abbreviation \u201cPsyA\u201d in various communications, the ALJ was left to conclude as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>a matter of law that his conduct violated ORS 675.070 (2)(d), ORS 675.020(1)(b), or applicable ethical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">In support of its motion, the board submitted an affidavit of the executive director of the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission (OHECC). The executive director averred that the OHECC oversees the Office of Degree Authorization (ODA), which, in turn, \u201cadministers laws, standards, and services that protect students, holders of legitimately earned degrees, institutions, *** and licensing boards.\u201d The executive director noted that he had \u201cnot come across the degree designation * * * \u2018PsyA\u2019 for a Psychologist Associate,\u201d there \u201cis no credible reference to such a degree as a recognized abbreviation in the field of Psychology,\u201d and, although it \u201cwould be appropriate\u201d for a licensed psychologist associate to list the initials \u201cM.A.\u201d or \u201cM.S.\u201d and the words \u201cLicensed Psychologist Associate\u201d behind their name, \u201c[i]t is not appropriate, but rather, misleading to the public, to use \u2018PsyA\u2019 in association with a person\u2019s name as a credential to signify a degree level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In his response, petitioner disagreed that his admission to certain conduct extinguished any genuine issues of material fact, noting that the \u201conly behavior\u201d that he admitted to was the use of \u201cPsyA\u201d to \u201cindicate my LICENSE as an independent licensed Psychologist Associate.\u201d Therefore, he disputed that using \u201cPsyA\u201d\u2014even assuming that it was not a \u201crecognized\u201d abbreviation\u2014was potentially misleading to the public because, in context, the public would understand that the abbreviation referred to petitioner\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The ALJ granted the board\u2019s motion, concluding in her proposed order that petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA\u201d signified or advertised a degree or credential \u201cthat is false and misleading to the public.\u201d Specifically, she noted that \u201cPsyA\u201d is not a recognized abbreviation in the field of psychology, although it is similar to initials used to designate a doctorate in psychology, and that, by using it \u201cin the same location that licensed psychologists place the initials \u2018Psy.D\u2019 and \u2018Ph.D,\u2019\u201d petitioner signified a degree or credential that was misleading to the public. Accordingly, she concluded that that conduct \u201chas a serious detrimental effect on the health and safety of the public\u201d and constituted \u201cimmoral or unprofessional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>conduct\u201d under ORS 675.070(2)(d). Similarly, the ALJ concluded that using \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d on a website available to the public was a \u201cfalse, deceptive, or fraudulent statement\u201d because it signified that petitioner had a doctorate in psychology. Finally, the ALJ concluded that petitioner\u2019s listing of \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d in conjunction with the word \u201cdegree\u201d was false and misleading to the public because it signified that he had a doctorate in clinical psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\">The ALJ also concluded that petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA,\u201d \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology,\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d violated the prohibition in ORS 675.020(l)(b) against holding oneself out as a psychologist without first obtaining a license. The ALJ proposed suspending petitioner\u2019s license for one year and assessing a civil penalty of $10,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Petitioner filed exceptions to the proposed order. The board denied the exceptions and issued a final order, which was substantively the same as the ALJ\u2019s proposed order. Petitioner sought judicial review of the board\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We review orders that result from the grant of summary determination for legal error. <em>Hamlin v. PERB, </em>273 Or App 796, 798-99, 359 P3d 581 (2015); <em>see also </em>ORS 183.482(8)(a). As noted, under OAR 137-003-0580, summary determination is appropriate if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact that is relevant to resolution of the legal issue as to which a decision is sought\u201d and the party filing the motion, \u201cis entitled to a favorable ruling as a matter of law.\u201d Accordingly, our review requires us to determine if there was a genuine issue as to any material fact that is relevant to resolution of the legal issues presented by the motion\u2014here, whether petitioner violated ORS 675.070(2)(d) or ORS 675.020(1)(b)\u2014 and if not, whether the board was entitled to a favorable ruling as a matter of law. As is the case with a motion for summary judgment, because the board would bear the burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>on the alleged violations at the contested case hearing, to be entitled to summary determination, the board\u2019s evidence must be such that all reasonable factfinders would have to conclude that petitioner commited the violations alleged by the board. ORS 183.450(2) (\u201cThe burden of presenting evidence to support a fact or position in a contested case rests on the proponent of the fact or position.\u201d); <em>see Wieck v. Hostetter, </em>274 Or App 457, 470, 362 P3d 254 (2015) (explaining that a party that has the burden of proof on an issue at trial has the burden of producing evidence to establish that issue as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">On review, we understand petitioner to argue that, viewing the \u201cfacts\u201d in the light most favorable to him, the board lacked a \u201clawful basis\u201d to conclude that he violated ORS 675.020(1)(b) and ORS 675.070(2)(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to the allegations that he violated ORS 675.070(2)(d), he claims that the conduct that he admitted to\u2014using the abbreviation \u201cPsyA,\u201d referencing a master\u2019s degree in clinical psychology, and stating that he \u201cpractices\u201d psychology\u2014did not entitle the board to a ruling as a matter of law that he engaged in \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to petitioner, that is so because, when his use of those descriptors is considered within the context in which he used them, whether that conduct would have misled or deceived the public as to his degree or credentials presented a genuine issue of material fact that was not resolved by the summary determination record. Put another way, he complains that the summary determination record did not establish that his conduct would in fact have misled or deceived the public such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Similarly, he asserts that the summary determination record failed to establish as a matter of law that his conduct, including his statement that he had been \u201cpracticing psychology for 15 years,\u201d was a violation of the prohibition against holding oneself out to be a psychologist without first obtaining a license. <em>See </em>ORS 675.020(1)(b). In particular, he asserts that the governing statutes \u201cpersuasively establish that psychologist associates do 'practic[e] psychology,\u2019 albeit with a more limited scope of practice than psychologists,\u201d noting that psychologist associates are authorized under ORS 675.065 to \u201cperform certain functions within the practice of psychology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The board argues that, because it is undisputed that petitioner (1) used the abbreviation \u201cPsyA\u201d where a \u201cdegree designation\u201d should be placed, (2) represented that he had a degree in clinical psychology, and (3) stated that he \u201chas been practicing psychology for 15 years,\u201d the board appropriately concluded that petitioner had misled the public into believing that he had a doctorate degree in clinical psychology and was a licensed psychologist. Given those circumstances, the board asserts that it was entitled to a favorable ruling as a matter of law that petitioner engaged in \u201cimmoral or unprofessional conduct\u201d and \u201crepresented [him] self to be a psychologist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Before we discuss the merits, we briefly address the board\u2019s contention that petitioner did not preserve his assignments of error. <em>See Thomas Creek Lumber v. Board of Forestry, </em>188 Or App 10, 30, 69 P3d 1238 (2003) (noting that the preservation requirements of ORAP 5.45 \u201capply not only to appeals of trial court judgments but also to petitions for judicial review of agency action\u201d). In short, the board contends that petitioner\u2019s arguments on judicial review were not made in his exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">As we recently explained, at least where, as here, the applicable statutes and rules do not make the filing of exceptions a mandatory prerequisite to judicial review, \u201cfiling exceptions is not necessary to preserve an argument that is already before the board.\u201d <em>Watts v. Board of Nursing, </em>282 Or App 705, 709, 386 P3d 34 (2016). Rather, it is sufficient that the petitioner raised the issues before the ALJ. <em>Id. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>this instance, the arguments that petitioner makes on judicial review were fairly put before the board in petitioner\u2019s response to the board\u2019s summary determination motion. In particular, petitioner, although acknowledging that he had used \u201cPsyA\u201d in various forums, argued to the board that the use of that abbreviation was not necessarily \u201cmisleading,\u201d essentially contending that the record left genuine issues of material fact to be determined. Petitioner also put before the board similar arguments regarding whether his use of \u201cclinical psychology\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d violated ORS 675.070(2)(d) or ORS 675.020(1)(b). Accordingly, we conclude that petitioner preserved the arguments he makes on judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">As to the merits, we agree with petitioner that summary determination was inappropriate in this instance because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioner, there remained genuine issues of material fact as to whether petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA,\u201d \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology,\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d was misleading or deceiving to the public. The AL J\u2019s conclusions that petitioner violated ORS 675.070(2)(d) and ORS 675.020(1)(b) required a factual finding that petitioner\u2019s conduct would have misled the public into believing that petitioner was a licensed psychologist with a doctorate in psychology. Based on the summary determination record, we conclude that that was a disputed issue of material fact, which was inappropriate to resolve at the summary determination stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">To review, the summary determination record consisted solely of the conduct that petitioner admitted to and an affidavit from the executive director of OHECC. That evidence established that (1) petitioner was a psychologist associate with a master\u2019s degree in psychology with an emphasis in clinical psychology who was authorized to \u201cperform certain functions within the practice of psychology\u201d; and (2) petitioner, in various forms and in combination with various additional descriptors, used an unrecognized abbreviation (PsyA) that is similar to degree designations for licensed psychologists, and he indicated in various public forums that he had a \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d degree and \u201chas been practicing psychology for 15 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to petitioner, a reasonable factfinder, considering the totality of the circumstances, could find that petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA,\u201d \u201cMaster of Arts Clinical Psychology,\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology,\u201d would not have misled or deceived the public into believing that petitioner had a doctorate in psychology. For example, petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA\u201d in conjunction with references to his license as a psychologist associate and other surrounding contextual clues does not establish, as a matter of law, that petitioner was using \u201cPsyA\u201d to represent his degree. Nothing in the record establishes that a degree designation (rather than a license designation) always follows a person\u2019s name. Further, the record does not establish, as a matter of law, that the public would have understood \u201cPsyA\u201d to represent a doctorate in psychology, particularly given other contextual clues in the surrounding text that petitioner was a licensed psychologist associate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Similarly, a reasonable factfinder could conclude\u2014 on this record\u2014that the public would not be misled into believing that petitioner had a <em>doctoral </em>degree in clinical psychology by listing his degree as <em>\u201cMaster of Arts </em>Clinical Psychology.\u201d Again, viewing that description in the light most favorable to petitioner, a reasonable factfinder could find that petitioner\u2019s description of his degree would not have misled the public into believing that he had a doctorate in psychology. Similarly, on this record, a reasonable factfinder could find that petitioner\u2019s reference to \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d was not misleading or deceiving given the surrounding textual clues and the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s conduct also violated ORS 675.020(1)(b) is subject to similar problems. We understand the ALJ to have concluded that, because petitioner made representations that would have misled the public into believing that he held a doctorate in psychology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>and was a licensed psychologist, he violated ORS 675.020 (1)(b)\u2019s prohibition against representing oneself as a psychologist.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have rejected the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s representations necessarily would have misled the public as a matter of law; consequently, and for similar reasons, summary determination on the issue of whether petitioner\u2019s conduct violated ORS 675.020(1)(b) was also inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\">To be clear, we are simply concluding that the record on summary determination was not sufficient to eliminate any issue of material fact as to whether petitioner\u2019s conduct was misleading or deceiving. As we stated in <em>Watts, </em>\u201c [i] f there is evidence creating a relevant fact issue, then no matter how \u2018overwhelming\u2019 the moving party\u2019s evidence may be, or how implausible the nonmoving party\u2019s version of the historical facts, the nonmoving party, upon proper request, is entitled to a hearing.\u201d 282 Or App at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\"> ORS 675.070(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">\u201cThe board may impose a sanction listed in subsection (1) of this section against any psychologist or psychologist associate or applicant, or, if applicable, any unlicensed person found in violation of ORS 675.010 to 675.150, when, in the judgment of the board, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">\u00ab* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">\u201c(d) Is guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct or of gross negligence in the practice of psychology, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-10\">\u201c(A) Any conduct or practice contrary to recognized standard of ethics of the psychological profession or any conduct or practice that constitutes a danger to the health or safety of a patient or the public, or any conduct, practice or condition that adversely affects a psychologist or psychologist associate\u2019s ability to practice psychology safely and skillfully.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-11\"> ORS 675.020(2) provides that to \u201crepresent oneself to be a psychologist\u201d means \u201cto use any title or description of services incorporating the words \u2018psychology,\u2019 \u2018psychological,\u2019 \u2018psychotherapy\u2019 or \u2018psychologist,\u2019 or to offer or render to individuals or to groups of individuals services included in the practice of psychology.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-6\"> Although the board\u2019s final order is the order that we are charged with reviewing on judicial review, because the orders of the hoard and the ALJ are substantively the same, for ease of reference, we generally refer to the AL J\u2019s order throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\"> The board stayed \u201call but 30 days of the suspension\u201d provided that petitioner \u201csubmits a written request to the Board to stay the suspension\u201d and provides \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d that he had removed the words \u201cclinical psychology\u201d or \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d and the initials \u201cPsyA\u201d from all materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b817-5\"> The board specifically cited to 14 websites that it asserted provided examples of petitioner\u2019s conduct. The administrative record does not contain the full text of any of those websites. Instead, the board simply provided the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for the websites and quoted text from those websites that the board found objectionable. The following quoted text from the board\u2019s notice represents the various ways that petitioner listed his degree, license, and credentials on those websites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cChristian Wolff, Psy.A, Portland Psychologist Associate Psychotherapist &amp; Counselor\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">\u201cChristian Wolff, MS, Psy.A, Licensed Psychologist Associate, Counseling <em>&amp; </em>Psychotherapy in Portland, Oregon\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">\u201cChristian Wolff, Psy.A, Psychologist Associate\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">\u201cChristian Wolff, MA, Psy.A * * * Master of Arts Clinical Psychology\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">\u201cChristian Wolff, Psy.A, Portland Psychologist Associate: Counseling &amp; Psychotherapy in NW Portland.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\"> The ALJ concluded that petitioner did not violate any applicable ethical standards because those standards only applied to licensed psychologists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-5\"> Petitioner does not complain that the ALJ\u2019s order exceeded the scope of the board\u2019s summary determination motion to the extent that the board\u2019s motion was based solely on petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cPsyA,\u201d yet the ALJ\u2019s order also relied on the board\u2019s allegations as to his use of \u201cclinical psychology\u201d and \u201cpracticing psychology\u201d to conclude that petitioner violated the applicable statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> At times in petitioner\u2019s brief, he frames his arguments in terms of a lack of substantial evidence. Given that we are tasked with reviewing an order entered on summary determination to determine if there remain any genuine issues of material fact, those references to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d appear inapt. Nevertheless, petitioner also correctly frames the issue as whether the board was entitled to judgment as a matter of law given the undisputed facts and viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\"> Perhaps if petitioner had used a recognized abbreviation for a licensed psychologist (i.<em>e., </em>Ph.D. or Psy.D), a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find that such conduct is misleading or deceiving to the public. <em>Cf. Topaz v. Board of Examiners for Engineering, </em>255 Or App 138, 147, 297 P3d 498, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013) (petitioner did not dispute that using the abbreviation for professional engineer <em>(i.e., </em>P.E.) implied that he was a professional engineer and could perform engineering work). But, on the record here, we cannot conclude that the mere use of an unrecognized abbreviation compels such a finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> We do not understand the board to have concluded that a licensed psychologist associate such as petitioner violates ORS 675.020(1)(b) by representing that the person is qualified to provide particular psychological services that the person is authorized to provide under the person\u2019s license. Such a construction of the statute would be problematic, given that licensed psychologist associates can permissibly provide specified services. <em>See </em>ORS 675.065.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
