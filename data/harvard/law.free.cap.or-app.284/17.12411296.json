J.</author>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Petitioner Kenneth Thomas appeals from judgments of the circuit court dismissing his petition for a writ of review and his second amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The proceedings arise out of petitioner\u2019s objections to an order of the Wasco County Board of Commissioners granting a permit for an \u201coutdoor mass gathering\u201d to petitioner\u2019s neighbor. ORS 433.750 (2013) (authorizing a county governing body to \u201cissue a permit upon application\u201d for an outdoor mass gathering).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issues on appeal relate to the interplay of Oregon\u2019s land use laws and those governing outdoor mass gatherings. For the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that the circuit court did correctly enter judgment for respondents on the writ of review petition but that it erred in dismissing the second claim of petitioner\u2019s second amended complaint in the declaratory judgment action. We therefore reverse and remand the judgment dismissing the declaratory judgment action and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A. <em>Issuance of the Outdoor-Mass-Gathering Permit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The relevant facts and chronology are undisputed. Respondent Wolf Run Ranch, LLC (Wolf Run) owns 254 acres in Wasco County. The subject property is partially forested and is zoned for forest use; within the parcel is a field of approximately 92 acres. The property also includes a single-family dwelling, several small barns, garages and other outbuildings, and a driveway to the dwelling. Petitioner owns timbered land adjacent to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In March 2013, respondent Moonshine Events, LLC, doing business as \u201cWhat the Festival\u201d (Moonshine), filed an application with the county seeking a permit for an outdoor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>mass gathering on Wolf Run, with an anticipated festival attendance of 4,000 to 5,000 attendees and 600 to 800 staff. The event was to be held from July 25 to 28, 2013. The permit application included a site plan showing proposed development to the property to accommodate the festival, including additional and expanded roads, several parking areas, an area to be leveled by \u201ccut and fill\u201d for use as a splash pool, and other water storage areas. A proposed new roadway would provide primary access to the festival.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\">ORS 433.735(1) defines an \u201coutdoor mass gathering\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">\u201can actual or reasonably anticipated assembly of more than 3,000 persons which continues or can reasonably be expected to continue for more than 24 consecutive hours but less than 120 hours within any three-month period and which is held primarily in open spaces and not in any permanent structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Under ORS 433.745(1), a person who seeks to \u201chold, conduct, advertise or otherwise promote\u201d an outdoor mass gathering may do so by permit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 433.745(2) states that a permit for an outdoor mass gathering \u201cdoes not entitle the organizer to make any permanent physical alterations to or on the real property.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The procedures for seeking a permit for an outdoor mass gathering are set forth in ORS 433.750(1), which provides that the governing body of a county shall issue a permit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">\u201cwhen the organizer demonstrates compliance with or the ability to comply with the health and safety rules governing outdoor mass gatherings to be regulated according to the anticipated crowd and adopted by the Oregon Health Authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">A county must hold a hearing on an application for an outdoor mass gathering, publish notice of the hearing, and give notice to local law enforcement, fire, and health officials. ORS 433.750(2) - (4). A county\u2019s authorization of an outdoor mass gathering is not a land use decision. ORS 197.015(10)(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The county held a public hearing on May 8, 2013. Witnesses described the development that would be necessary to hold the festival and to satisfy state health and safety standards, including the cutting of trees to accommodate the construction of a parking area, a ticket booth, and new access road; multiple vehicle-arrival lanes; a stream crossing for vehicles; and a culvert.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Petitioner appeared at the hearing and contended that the proposed improvements would effect permanent alterations to the property that were not allowed without permits and that had not been approved under applicable land use statutes and ordinances. A county planner testified that the county did not intend to permit any sort of permanent infrastructure in conjunction with the outdoor-mass-gathering permit, and that the required road (which the parties do not dispute is a permanent improvement) was a \u201cdriveway\u201d already allowed in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the existing residential use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the hearing on May 8, 2013, the Wasco County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved respondents\u2019 application for a permit for an outdoor mass gathering on the subject property, and it issued an order approving that gathering, with 11 conditions. Moonshine undertook to improve the property as required by the county\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">B. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Challenges to the Permit and the Trial Court\u2019s Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">1. <em>Petitioner\u2019s LUBA challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Petitioner challenged the county\u2019s order granting the outdoor-mass-gathering permit through various channels. One of those routes involved an appeal of the county\u2019s order to the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA). Petitioner acknowledged that the county\u2019s granting of the permit was not itself a land use decision subject to LUBA\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>ORS 197.015(10)(d) (excluding from the definition of a \u201cland use decision\u201d the \u201cauthorization of an outdoor mass gathering as defined in ORS 433.735\u201d). Nonetheless, petitioner argued, the county\u2019s approval encompassed a separate land use decision to approve permanent alterations to the property, specifically an access road and a parking lot, that are expressly prohibited by ORS 433.745(2). LUBA dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal, explaining that \u201cthe county made only a single decision * * * which approves the [outdoor mass gathering], including the access road and the parking areas.\u201d LUBA reasoned, further, that petitioner\u2019s arguments that the county had erroneously approved permanent physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>alterations to the land in violation of ORS 433.745(2) should be presented to the circuit court, on petition for review of the order. Petitioner did not seek review of LUBA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">2. <em>Petitioner\u2019s code-compliance complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Petitioner also sought relief from the county\u2019s order granting the outdoor-mass-gathering permit via Wasco County\u2019s Land Use and Development Ordinance (LUDO), Section 15.010, under which it is the duty of the county planning director or the director\u2019s designee to \u201cto enforce the provisions\u201d of the county\u2019s ordinances \u201cpertaining to property use and to the construction, erection, location or enlargement of any structure located within Wasco County[,]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner filed a complaint with the county\u2019s code compliance officer, alleging that the improvements required by the permit would result in permanent physical alterations to the subject property in violation of ORS 433.745(2) and in violation of state and local land use laws. On May 23, 2013, the county\u2019s compliance officer rejected petitioner\u2019s complaint and issued a \u201cnotification of non-violation\u201d (NNV), stating that the county did not find any code violations in connection with the county\u2019s conditions for the permit. The NNV explained that the parking and vehicle staging areas were \u201ctemporary\u201d and that the \u201cdriveway\u201d and culvert were permitted in conjunction with the existing dwelling and residential use. The NNV stated additionally that the county\u2019s code compliance program was not the mechanism for challenging the approval of an outdoor mass gathering, and that any challenge to the permit must be taken up in the circuit court, pursuant to ORS 433.750(5). Petitioner did not appeal the May 23 NNV to LUBA or otherwise challenge it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>3. <em>The writ of review proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">As the county\u2019s NNV signaled, ORS 433.750(5) provides that \u201c[a]ny decision of a county governing body on an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering may be appealed to a circuit court for the county as provided in ORS 34.020 to 34.100.\u201d On May 14, 2013, petitioner filed a circuit-court petition for a writ of review of the county\u2019s order granting the outdoor-mass-gathering permit. Among other contentions, petitioner alleged that the permanent improvements to be made to the property to comply with the county\u2019s health and safety conditions are prohibited by state land use laws. Petitioner sought a stay of the permit to prevent further alterations of the property. The county responded that the improvements were temporary or were allowed under previous land use authorizations. The county, Wolf Run, and Moonshine also contended that petitioner should have challenged the outdoor-mass-gathering permit indirectly, by appealing the NNV to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In early July 2013, the circuit court issued a letter opinion affirming the county\u2019s decision to issue the permit. The court rejected petitioner\u2019s contention that the county\u2019s outdoor-mass-gathering permit had authorized permanent alterations on the property, in violation of ORS 433.745(2). The court reasoned that, although ORS 433.745(2) states explicitly that an outdoor-mass-gathering permit does not authorize permanent improvements, any inquiry as to whether proposed permanent improvements complied with land use laws was beyond the county\u2019s jurisdiction in the context of the permitting process, and that the \u201ccounty governing body * * * is not charged with considering the potential for a violation of this statute when reviewing the permit application.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">\u201cAlthough I agree with the premise that the County lacks jurisdiction in the [outdoor mass gathering] Permit process to approve permanent improvements, I cannot find from the record that the County did any such thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201cPetitioner does not argue that the County expressly approved unlawful permanent improvements on the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Rather, Petitioner argues that the County was aware, or should have been aware, that applicant would be making unlawful permanent improvements to the property in anticipation of holding the [outdoor mass gathering], and by approving the [outdoor mass gathering] permit the County tacitly approved the unlawful permanent improvements, thus exceeding its jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">\u201cThis argument is buttressed somewhat by certain statements made in the Order approving the [outdoor mass gathering] permit. In its second Finding of Fact, the Board \u2018recognizes the procedural and legal requirements of * * * the Wasco County Land Use and Development Ordinance.\u2019 * * * In its Conclusions of Law, the Board notes that its decision is \u2018consistent with *** the Wasco County Land Use and Development Ordinance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">\u201cIn my view, however, these statements are surplusage, not license. During the May 1 [outdoor mass gathering] permit hearing, the County directed Petitioner to take any land use concerns to the County\u2019s Code Compliance Office. *** The County\u2019s Order specifically states: \u2018This decision does not constitute tacit approval for any other development or use.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cGiven the criteria for the granting of [outdoor mass gathering] permits described above, the issue whether applicant intended to make unlawful improvements to the property could play no role in the decision, either for or against. It is simply not relevant to the <em>permit </em>process. [Footnote omitted.] During oral argument on July 2, Petitioner characterized the County\u2019s disregard of his concerns regarding permanent improvements as a \u2018de facto approval\u2019 of the improvements. I feel the County\u2019s disregard is more properly characterized as recognition that, in the context of the [outdoor mass gathering] permit process, the County has no jurisdiction to delve into it. By ignoring Petitioner\u2019s concerns regarding permanent improvements, the County did not exceed its jurisdiction, it limited itself to matters within its jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">(Emphasis circuit court\u2019s.)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Thus, the court concluded, in the outdoor-mass-gathering permitting process, the county\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d is limited to considering whether the property owner can comply with health and safety requirements, and does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>include consideration of whether the property owner has the land use approvals required to comply with conditions for the issuance of the permit. The court also considered and rejected petitioner\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the county\u2019s findings with respect to public safety and health requirements, and concluded that, because health and safety requirements had been met, the county was required to grant the permit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the court dismissed petitioner\u2019s writ of review petition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">4. <em>The declaratory judgment action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On the same day that the circuit court rejected the petition for writ of review, petitioner filed a declaratory judgment action in the Wasco County Circuit Court, naming as defendants the county, Wolf Run, and Moonshine, and seeking a declaration that the permit had been issued in violation of land use laws. Petitioner asserts that the claim for declaratory relief is proper under ORS 197.825(3), which provides that the circuit courts retain jurisdiction to grant declaratory, injunctive, or mandatory relief in a proceeding brought to enforce the provisions of an adopted comprehensive plan or land use regulation. Petitioner also relied on LUDO section 15.040, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cWhen a building or other structure is, or is proposed to be, located, constructed, maintained, repaired, altered, or used, or any land is, or is proposed to be, used in violation of this Ordinance, * * * any person whose interest in real property within the County is or may be affected by the violation, may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, institute injunction, mandamus, abatement, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>appropriate proceedings to prevent, temporarily or permanently enjoin, abate, or remove the unlawful location, construction, maintenance, repair, alteration or use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In his declaratory judgment action, petitioner also sought an injunction requiring removal of unpermitted improvements and prohibiting further development on the subject property in violation of state and federal law or in the absence of required permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The circuit court dismissed petitioner\u2019s declaratory judgment action on July 16, 2013, for the reasons set out below. The festival was held, as scheduled, less than two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">A. <em>The Trial Court Correctly Entered Judgment for Respondents in the Writ of Review Petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Petitioner appeals both the judgment dismissing the writ of review proceeding and the judgment dismissing the declaratory judgment action. We begin our analysis with the writ of review judgment. As noted, ORS 433.750(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cAny decision of a county governing body on an application for a permit to hold an outdoor mass gathering may be appealed to a circuit court for the county as provided in ORS 34.020 to 34.100.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In a writ of review proceeding, the circuit court is required to allow the writ \u201cin all cases in which a substantial interest of a plaintiff has been injured\u201d and in which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">\u201can inferior court including an officer or tribunal other than an agency as defined in ORS 183.310(1) in the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial functions appears to have:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">\u201c(a) Exceeded its jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">\u201c(b) Failed to follow the procedure applicable to the matter before it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">\u201c(c) Made a finding or order not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201c(d) Improperly construed the applicable law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-6\">\u201c(e) Rendered a decision that is unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">ORS 34.040(1). As explained above, the trial court dismissed the writ of review proceeding because, it ruled, the county was not required to determine compliance with land use laws as part of its permitting of an outdoor mass gathering and, therefore, had properly confined its jurisdiction in granting that permit. Petitioner challenges that ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Before discussing the merits of petitioner\u2019s challenge, we note that the 2013 festival has been held and that the permit authorizing it has expired. That might give rise to questions concerning the justiciability of petitioner\u2019s appeal and whether it has become moot. But, as petitioner points out, the improvements to the subject property that form the basis for petitioner\u2019s objections to the permit remain, and those improvements allegedly continue to adversely affect petitioner\u2019s property by creating a fire hazard. <em>See Barnes v. Thompson, </em>159 Or App 383, 386, 977 P2d 431, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 447 (1999) (even if the main issue in controversy has been resolved, collateral consequences may prevent the controversy from being moot under some circumstances). Further, it is undisputed that the festival is anticipated to be an annual event with a requirement for annual permits and that the permanent improvements already made to the property will bear on the issuance of future permits. Respondents do not argue to the contrary. Given the continuing collateral effects, we agree with petitioner that the writ of review challenge of the county\u2019s order is not moot, and we therefore proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error challenging the dismissal of the writ of review petition, petitioner asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that the county was not required to consider whether Wolf Run and Moonshine had the land use approvals necessary to allow them to comply with the health and safety conditions that the county imposed as a condition of granting the outdoor-mass-gathering permit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Respondents do not dispute petitioner\u2019s assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that the planned improvements did not have land use approvals. Rather, they contend that the circuit court correctly interpreted the statutory provisions to preclude consideration of land use issues in the context of the outdoor-mass-gathering permitting process, and also to preclude consideration of whether land use approvals had been obtained for permanent improvements required to satisfy health and safety conditions for the permit. That dispute presents a question of statutory construction that we review as a matter of law. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We begin with the text of the key statutory provisions. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). As we have previously explained, under ORS 433.745(1), a person seeking to organize an outdoor mass gathering must obtain a permit from the county governing body. ORS 433.750 and ORS 433.755 describe the process for applying for and reviewing an application for a permit for an outdoor mass gathering. ORS 433.750(1) provides that in considering an application for an outdoor mass gathering,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">\u201c[t]he governing body of a county in which an outdoor mass gathering is to take place <em>shall issue a permit upon application when the organizer demonstrates compliance with or the ability to comply with the health and safety rules governing outdoor mass gatherings </em>to be regulated according to the anticipated crowd and adopted by the Oregon Health Authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Petitioner argues that a permit may be granted under ORS 433.750 only if the applicant satisfies a burden to \u201cdemonstrate compliance with or the ability to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>with the health and safety rules for outdoor mass gatherings.\u201d When necessary land use approvals have not been obtained, petitioner contends, an applicant cannot meet that burden. Petitioner further contends that, because ORS 433.745(2) provides that an outdoor-mass-gathering permit \u201cdoes not entitle the organizer to make any permanent physical alterations to or on the real property,\u201d the applicant must demonstrate that any permanent improvements necessary to comply with health and safety rules are separately permitted or approved. If, petitioner contends, \u201ccompliance means breaking the law, the organizer does not have the necessary \u2018ability\u2019\u201d to comply with the health and safety requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Respondents do not dispute that, necessarily, approvals for permanent improvements must be pursued through means other than the outdoor-mass-gathering permitting process. However, they contend that whether an applicant has obtained the necessary approvals is beyond the scope of the county\u2019s consideration in the context of an application for an outdoor-mass-gathering permit. In respondents\u2019 view, the part of ORS 433.750 that we have emphasized above requires the county to issue a permit for an outdoor mass gathering if the applicant shows that it can comply with the health and safety rules governing outdoor mass gatherings, regardless of whether the permanent improvements necessary to achieve compliance would require land use approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">As support for their construction, respondents invoke statutory context, including, specifically, ORS 197.015 (10) (d) and ORS 433.763(l)(c)(A). Respondents reason that, because, under ORS 197.015(10)(d), an authorization of an outdoor mass gathering is not a land use decision, land use considerations do not come into play in the outdoor-mass-gathering permitting process. Respondents contrast that statutory provision to ORS 433.763(l)(c)(A), which applies when a gathering is anticipated to last longer than 120 hours, and under which the applicant must show that \u201c[a]ny permits required by the applicable land use regulations have been granted.\u201d Respondents contend that if the legislature had also intended that an applicant must show necessary land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>use approvals to obtain a permit for an outdoor mass gathering, it could have so stated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">After considering the pertinent statutory provisions in context, we conclude that respondents are correct: ORS 433.750 does not require an applicant for an outdoor-mass-gathering permit to demonstrate compliance with land use regulations. First, the text of the pertinent statutes does not include that requirement. ORS 433.750, which prescribes what must be included in an application for an outdoor-mass-gathering permit, does not specify that the applicant must demonstrate compliance with land use regulations. And ORS 433.745 states only that the outdoor-mass-gathering permit does not, itself, authorize permanent physical alterations to the property on which the gathering will occur. It simply is silent regarding how authorization for any such alterations might be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Consideration of statutory context points to the same conclusion. ORS 433.763 applies to gatherings that are expected to last longer than gatherings that may be authorized by outdoor-mass-gathering permits. That statute expressly requires that a county considering whether to authorize a longer-duration gathering determine that \u201c [a] ny permits required by the applicable land use regulations have been granted.\u201d ORS 433.763(l)(c)(A). We will not, as petitioner urges, read a similar requirement into ORS 433.750, which governs applications for outdoor mass gatherings; such an interpretation would conflict with our duty \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted\u201d from that statute. ORS 174.010; <em>see also State v. Bailey, </em>346 Or 551, 562, 213 P3d 1240 (2009) (when the legislature includes an express requirement in one statute but omits it from another, it may be inferred that the omission is deliberate).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Indeed, the distinctions between the statutes related to outdoor mass gatherings and those of longer duration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>suggest that the legislature contemplated that outdoor mass gatherings would be held in the open air and would not require permanent improvements of the sort that might implicate land use regulations. That is reflected both in ORS 433.735(1), which defines an \u201coutdoor mass gathering\u201d as one \u201cwhich is held primarily in open spaces and not in any permanent structure,\u201d and in ORS chapter 197, which excludes authorization of outdoor mass gatherings from the definition of \u201cland use decisions.\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(d). It is unsurprising, then, that applications for outdoor-mass-gathering permits are not subject to land use requirements, in contrast with applications for gatherings of longer duration. That an outdoor mass gathering may, nonetheless, sometimes involve permanent alterations does not alter the meaning or operation of the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">We conclude that neither ORS 433.745 nor ORS 433.750 requires an applicant for an outdoor-mass-gathering permit to demonstrate compliance with land use laws. Nor do those statutes require a county to consider an applicant\u2019s compliance with those laws in evaluating an application for an outdoor mass gathering. The circuit court therefore did not err in entering judgment for respondents in the writ of review proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">B. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Dismissing the Declaratory Judgment Action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his second claim for declaratory relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that claim, petitioner alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Wolf Run and Moonshine have constructed and are constructing various permanent improvements for which they did not seek county approval and for which no development permits had been issued, and that the county was allowing the development in violations of land use regulations and state law. Petitioner also alleged that the improvements would cause him irreparable harm. Accordingly, he sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting the county from allowing the development and the use of the improvements, and a permanent injunction ordering Wolf Run and Moonshine to cease development of the improvements, to desist from using the improvements, and to remove them.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In dismissing petitioner\u2019s second claim for declaratory relief, the trial court relied on three alternative grounds. We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The trial court first concluded that the allegations of petitioner\u2019s second claim for declaratory judgment were \u201cso lacking in clarity\u201d as to not present a justiciable controversy as to whether the development was being carried out in violation of law. We have reviewed the complaint and conclude that the allegations sufficiently alleged controversies as to whether Wolf Run and Moonshine had obtained the land use approvals necessary for the development of the subject property and whether the county was allowing the development in violation of land use laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The trial court next concluded that petitioner\u2019s challenges presented land use issues within LUBA\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction that should have been pursued through an appeal of the county\u2019s NNV, and not through a claim for declaratory relief. ORS 197.825(1) (LUBA is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to review land use decision). Wolf Run and Moonshine continue to assert on appeal that the NNV was a final decision applying land use regulations that could have been appealed directly to LUBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The trial court was incorrect, because the NNV was not a land use decision reviewable by LUBA. ORS 197.015(10)(a) defines a \u201cland use decision\u201d as a final decision that \u201cconcerns the * * * application of\u2019 \u201c[a] land use regulation.\u201d Arguably, the county\u2019s NNV did concern land use regulations, given that it determined that the improvements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>proposed in conjunction with the festival did not violate the LUDO. But, we conclude for two reasons that the NNV did not constitute an \u201capplication\u201d of land use regulations, as contemplated by ORS 197.015(10)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">First, the NNV was not issued in response to an application or other filing seeking a determination as to whether certain uses are permissible. Second, the NNV did not purport to <em>directly </em>interpret or apply land use regulations, but instead determined only whether the improvements properly were allowed pursuant to existing uses of the property. Those characteristics of the NNV are significant under <em>Mar-Dene Corp. v. City of Woodburn, </em>149 Or App 509, 514, 944 P2d 976 (1997). In that case, a land owner appealed to LUBA from the City of Woodburn\u2019s decision not to take enforcement action against a property owner that had substantially, but not fully, complied with a previously granted access condition for development. LUBA concluded that the city\u2019s action was not a \u201cland use decision\u201d and was, instead, subject to the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction over enforcement proceedings. That was so, LUBA reasoned, because the city\u2019s decision was not based on the interpretation of a previous land use decision or the application of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance but instead on a determination that a previous condition had been substantially complied with and others had not. 149 Or App at 513. LUBA observed that, \u201c[although these could be relevant considerations during enforcement proceedings, they do not proceed from the interpretation and application of land use regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We affirmed LUBA\u2019s order, noting that the city\u2019s decision did not have the \u201cdirect effect of determining whether a use could be conducted\u201d and was not \u201cresponsive to applications or other filings that sought determinations about whether the uses were permissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515. Rather, the city determined only whether to take action to enforce a previously imposed development condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Here, similarly, the NNV decided only that the challenged uses did not violate land use laws because they were allowed under the existing residential use. As in <em>Mar-Dene, </em>that decision did not have the <em>direct </em>effect of approving the challenged uses. Nor was the NNV a response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>to an application or other filing that sought a determination as to whether the uses that were required as conditions for the festival permit were permissible. The NNV simply determined that the uses were permitted under previous authorizations. Under <em>Mar-Dene, </em>the NNV was therefore not a land use decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">That conclusion comports with the part of ORS 197.015(10) that defines what is <em>not </em>a land use decision, and provides that it does not include a decision \u201c [t]hat is made under land use standards that do not require interpretation or the exercise of policy or legal judgment [,] \u201d ORS 197.015(10)(b)(A), or that \u201capproves or denies a building permit issued under clear and objective land use standards.\u201d ORS 197.015(10)(b)(B). In <em>Tirumali v. City of Portland, </em>169 Or App 241, 7 P3d 761 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 674 (2001), we explained that, in determining whether a decision that would otherwise qualify as a \u201cland use decision\u201d is exempt from the statutory definition of that term by ORS 197.015(10)(b)(A) and (B) because it does not require an interpretation of an ordinance or land use regulation or the exercise of policy or judgment, the inquiry is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cwhether [the applicable land use regulations] can plausibly be interpreted in more than one way. If so, they are ambiguous, and it would follow that the relevant city provisions are not \u2018clear and objective,\u2019 ORS 197.015(10)(b)(B), and that they cannot be applied without interpretation, ORS 197.015(10)(b)(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Here, the NNV did not purport to resolve ambiguities in the county\u2019s permitting ordinances or to provide an interpretation of the ordinances or the existing permits resulting from the exercise of policy or legal judgment. <em>Tirumali, </em>169 Or App at 246. Rather, the NNV merely determined that there had been no violation, reasoning that the parking and vehicle staging areas required by the permit were \u201ctemporary\u201d and reciting the conclusion of planning staff that the proposed \u201cdriveway\u201d and culvert were permitted in conjunction with the existing dwelling and residential use. It is not apparent to us how those determinations were the result of an interpretation of an ambiguous ordinance or regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>as described in <em>Tirumali. </em>Our conclusion that the NNV fell outside the definition of a land use decision under ORS 197.015(10)(b) is consistent with TirumaWs approach to that question. In sum, we conclude that petitioner could not have pursued an appeal of the NNV to LUBA to address his concerns relating to development on the subject property.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">As the premise for its final alternative ground for dismissal, the trial court observed that petitioner had appealed the county\u2019s order approving the outdoor-mass-gathering permit to LUBA. The court agreed with respondents\u2019 contention that the LUBA appeal was \u201canother action pending between the same parties for the same cause,\u201d ORCP 21 A(3). That conclusion was incorrect. The appeal to LUBA challenged the county\u2019s order granting the permit, which, as we have held, was reviewable only by writ of review. The declaratory judgment action, in contrast, challenges the development that Wolf Run and Moonshine completed to satisfy conditions for the permit but without necessary land use approvals. Thus, the LUBA appeal is not an action \u201cfor the same cause.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The remaining question is whether petitioner\u2019s second claim for declaratory relief presented land use issues that were, for other reasons, beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In light of LUBA\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over land use decisions, the circuit courts cannot engage in land use decision making or administrative review of land use decisions. But the circuit courts do have jurisdiction to grant declaratory, injunctive, or mandatory relief in a proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>arising from a decision described in ORS 197.015 (10)(b) or in a proceeding brought to enforce land use regulations. ORS 197.825(3)(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We said in <em>Doughton v. Douglas County, </em>90 Or App 49, 55, 750 P2d 1174 (1988), that the purpose of ORS 197.825(3)(a) is \u201cto enable local governments and members of the public to compel compliance with local land use legislation, under circumstances where the noncompliance is not embodied in a discrete land use decision.\u201d And more recently, we explained in <em>Flight Shop, Inc. v. Leading Edge Aviation, Inc., </em>277 Or App 638, 644, 373 P3d 177 (2016), that a party \u201cmay bring an enforcement action in circuit court when a violator engages in an land use contrary to a zoning ordinance and that violator \u2018has filed no application to allow that use or have it declared permissible through a land use decision.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Clackamas County v. Marson, </em>128 Or App 18, 22, 874 P2d 110, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 572 (1994)). We conclude that petitioner\u2019s second declaratory judgment claim is such a proceeding and is authorized by ORS 197.825(3). The circuit therefore erred in dismissing it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In A155158, dismissal of plaintiffs second claim for declaratory relief reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.

We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing and, although the excerpt cited by respondents could be viewed in isolation to make that concession, when the transcript is considered in its entirety, it is clear that petitioner\u2019s counsel made the exact opposite argument: that the county\u2019s Board of Commissioners lacked authority, in the context of the hearing on the permit, to issue the permit if health and safety considerations required permanent changes to the property.

The court also held that its determination on the petition for writ of review either preclusively resolved or rendered moot petitioner\u2019s allegations in the first claim for relief seeking a declaration that Wolf Run and Moonshine shall not hold the festival in the absence of a valid permit.
