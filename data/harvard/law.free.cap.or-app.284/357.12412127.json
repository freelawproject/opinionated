In the first assignment of error, he seeks reversal of the guilty verdict on first-degree burglary of a dwelling, ORS 164.225.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s amendment of the indictment done as trial was about to commence. The amendment revised Count 3 from burglary \u201cwith the intent to commit the crime of <em>assault </em>therein\u201d to burglary \u201cwith the intent to commit the crime of <em>coercion </em>therein.\u201d (Emphases added.) Defendant argues that the change was impermissible because it was a substantive amendment, accomplished without approval of a grand jury. Defendant argues that the amendment was substantive because the specific crime that a defendant is alleged to have intended to commit in the dwelling is a material element of a burglary charge. We conclude that, even if the trial court had erred in allowing the amendment, the error is harmless. We have considered and reject defendant\u2019s second assignment of error without written discussion. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">A grand jury indicted defendant with eight offenses based on his entry and actions in the home of a husband and wife. As originally filed, the indictment alleged, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cCOUNT 1 [First Degree Burglary]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and knowingly enter or remain in a dwelling * * * with the intent to commit the crime of harassment therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cThe state further alleges that the above-described offense was committed in an occupied dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cThe state further alleges that, during the commission of the above-described offense, the defendant caused or threatened physical injury to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\u201cCOUNT 2 [Harrassment]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201cThe defendant *** did unlawfully and intentionally harass or annoy [husband] *** by subjecting [husband] to offensive physical contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-3\">\u201cCOUNT 3 [First Degree Burglary]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and knowingly enter or remain in a dwelling * * * with the intent to commit the crime of assault therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThe state further alleges that the above-described offense was committed in an occupied dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cThe state further alleges that, during the commission of the above-described offense, the defendant caused or threatened physical injury to another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cCOUNT 4 [Coercion]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201cThe defendant * * * did unlawfully and knowingly compel and/or induce [wife] to abstain from engaging in conduct in which [wife] had a legal right to engage, to wit: calling the police, by means of instilling in [wife] a fear that if [wife] engaged in the conduct contrary to said compulsion and/or inducement, defendant would unlawfully cause physical injury to [wife] and/or [husband].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Just before trial, the prosecutor told the court that defendant was charged with two counts of burglary in the first-degree. One charge (Count 1) alleged burglary with the intent to commit harassment, and the other charge (Count 3) appeared to allege burglary with the intent to commit assault. The prosecutor explained, however, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201c[s]hortly before the grand jury went in with the victims, I ended up changing the second count theory [Count 3], which was with intent to commit [the] crime of coercion. And that was the way it was presented to [the] grand jury, which is also why it ended count three, count four became coercion as opposed to assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">The prosecutor said that, due to a clerical error when she was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-13\">\u201ctyping up the indictment, * * * it auto-filled from the DA\u2019s or complainant\u2019s information into the indictment with an assault instead of a coercion. So right now the way it stands while the grand jury indicted them on the\u2014a burglary with intent to commit a crime of coercion, it stands right now as a kind of assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Defendant objected to the amendment. The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201cSo based on the state\u2019s representation that the jury\u2014the grand jury did not decide count three as burglary in the first degree of an occupied dwelling causing physical injury with the crime of assault, but they indicted with the crime of coercion, the court does have the authority to amend the indictment to correctly state what the grand jury indicted the defendant for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cSo I will strike assault therein on count three, and write in coercion. And that kind of makes sense too with the way the indictment reads in terms of, you know, count one is burglary with harassment. And count two is harassment. So count three will be burglary in the first degree with coercion. And count four is coercion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Defense counsel then said, \u201cI\u2019d like to voice my objection again to the amendment of the indictment. I know that in a burglary charge the crime that the person is alleged to have committed upon the unlawful entry is an essential element.\u201d Defense counsel argued \u201cthat the court doesn\u2019t have the authority to amend the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The trial court reiterated its position that the amendment was to correct a clerical or scrivener\u2019s error. The court then explored whether the amendment would have an effect on defendant\u2019s trial preparation, asking whether defendant was prepared to go forward in light of the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of strange but because it\u2019s been changed on you, I think lawfully, but you\u2019ve had what, one day or less than a day\u2019s notice of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">\u201cDoes that change your preparation for trial? And are you * * * okay going forward at this point? Or do you somehow, because that changes your strategy, do you need a reset of some sort? That\u2019s the real issue at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Defense counsel replied, \u201cI\u2019m not asking for a reset, Your Honor.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Defense counsel stated, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">In the trial court file, the revised indictment shows the court\u2019s handwritten amendment by interlineation to Count 3, striking the word \u201cassault\u201d and adding the word \u201ccoercion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s bench trial, the court found defendant guilty of all counts in the amended indictment. The court determined that the burglary counts, Count 1 and Count 3, would merge and it entered a judgment of conviction and sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court lacked authority to amend the indictment, because the amendment altered a material element of the burglary charge. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 5 (prohibiting a trial court from permitting a substantive amendment to an indictment).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant stresses that to make a substantive amendment requires resubmitting the charge to the grand jury. <em>See State v. Long, </em>320 Or 361, 370 n 14, 885 P2d 696 (1994) (\u201cIf the error is of substance, the state may seek permission to resubmit the matter to the grand jury. If the error is of form only, the court may amend the indictment by interlineation.\u201d). Although defendant asserts that the amendment was a matter of substance, not form, defendant does little to discuss the distinctions between the two. <em>See State v. Wimber, </em>315 Or 103, 113-15, 843 P2d 424 (1992) (explaining considerations).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The state argues that the amendment of the burglary count was authorized because the intended crime that was the goal of the burglary\u2014that is, the crime that defendant is alleged to have intended within the dwelling\u2014 is not a material element of the burglary count itself. In the alternative, the state argues that, even if the trial court erred, any error was harmless because, in fact, the grand jury had already considered the burglary charge with an intended crime of coercion and had indicted defendant on <em>that </em>version of burglary. In the state\u2019s view, resubmission of the amended charge to the grand jury, as would ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>have been required for a substantive amendment, <em>would </em>not have affected the result of the proceedings in this case, inasmuch as the grand jury did consider burglary with coercion as the intended crime. The state implies that a second grand jury should reach the same result on the same evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">We need not reach the initial question whether a change in designating the crime that was intended to have been accomplished during the burglary was a change of a material element of the burglary count itself. That is so because we agree with the state that, in these unique circumstances, any error in amending the indictment was harmless. However, we explain that conclusion somewhat differently than does the state. That is, any error was harmless because amendment of the indictment did not affect the verdict or substantially affect the rights of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Our conclusion is premised on the function of an indictment. Under ORS 132.550(7), an indictment must contain, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c[a] statement of the acts constituting the offense in ordinary and concise language, without repetition, and in such manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The purposes of such a statement are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201c(1) to provide notice so as to enable the defendant to prepare a defense; (2) to identify the crime so as to provide protection against additional prosecution for the same crime; (3) to inform the court as to what charges are being brought against the defendant; and (4) to ensure that the defendant is tried only for an offense that is based on facts found by the grand jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\"><em>State v. Burnett, </em>185 Or App 409, 415, 60 P3d 547 (2002). With those things in mind, we have recognized that an \u201cindictment that serves those functions satisfies the requirements of ORS 132.550(7).\u201d <em>State v. Eberhardt, </em>225 Or App 275, 279, 201 P3d 915 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 608 (2010). And, \u201c[b]y the same token, any error in an indictment that does not prejudice satisfaction of those same functions is harmless error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>If error is harmless, this court is required to affirm a defendant\u2019s conviction even when a trial court commits error; and error is harmless if there is little likelihood that the error affected the verdict or substantially affected the defendant\u2019s rights. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3; <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 28, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003); <em>see also </em>ORS 19.415(2) (\u201cNo judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d). We have determined that alleged error in an indictment was harmless where the purposes of an indictment were satisfied and the defendant suffered no prejudice from the arguable error. <em>Eberhardt, </em>225 Or App at 279-81 (despite alleged defect in indictment about the defendant\u2019s knowledge of a prior conviction, the defendant had notice of charge, the opportunity for an unimpaired defense, and an agreed jury instruction addressed to the same issue\u2014the need for the defendant to have knowledge of prior conviction). Similarly, we have determined that, where error in a jury instruction was essentially amending an indictment by adding grounds on which to convict for hindering prosecution, the error was nonetheless harmless because, under the circumstances, no evidence permitted the jury to have convicted the defendant on any other grounds than the one ground alleged in the indictment. <em>State v. Burk, </em>282 Or App 638, 646-47, 386 P3d 148 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In this case, defendant was not prejudiced by the indictment\u2019s amendment, whether through a lack of notice, an inability to defend, a risk of double jeopardy, or being tried on a charge other than that which the grand jury had charged him. Defendant was already aware from the face of the indictment of the charges arising from the incident. Defendant has not argued below or on appeal that he was prejudiced by the lack of notice of the charge. And, he has not argued that he suffered any prejudice to his defense due to the amendment immediately before trial. <em>See State v. Guckert, </em>260 Or App 50, 60, 316 P3d 373 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 840 (2014) (harmless error despite variance between indictment and trial court\u2019s instructions to jury, in part, because the \u201cdefendant was not prejudicially deprived of an available defense\u201d). Although the trial court twice asked defendant if he needed more time, he did not request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no danger that defendant was tried on a charge other than what the grand jury had intended because the trial court made findings that the burglary charge\u2014with coercion as the intended <em>crime\u2014had </em>been submitted to the grand jury and that the grand jury had intended to return an indictment that matched the amended charge. The trial court made those findings when it accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the grand jury proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In a case where a prosecutor brought a scrivener\u2019s error to a trial court\u2019s attention mid-trial, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cIn future cases, the better practice would be for the state to advise the court before trial that, due to a perceived error in form in the indictment, the state believes that it should be amended. The court could then hear the parties\u2019 arguments on the issue and thereafter make a finding\u2014 which is what the constitutional provision actually contemplates\u2014as to what had occurred, in order to alleviate any doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Long, </em>320 Or at 370 n 14 (citing <em>State v. Woodson, </em>315 Or 314, 316-17, 845 P2d 203 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As suggested in <em>Long, </em>the prosecutor in this case did advise the court, before trial began, that there was a perceived error in the form of the indictment, requiring amendment. The prosecutor reported that she had presented to the grand jury Count 3 as burglary with the intent to commit coercion. She explained how the error had occurred on the form employed when she was preparing the indictment; the term \u201cassault\u201d was \u201cauto-filled\u201d rather than the intended term, \u201ccoercion.\u201d After allowing the parties to argue, the court made findings. The trial court found that the indictment, as originally filed, contained a scrivener\u2019s error, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that the grand jury actually intended to indict defendant on the amended charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Concluding that any error was harmless under these circumstances, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> Defendant was also convicted of harassment, ORS 166.065; coercion, ORS 163.275; fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160; interfering with a peace officer, ORS 162.247; resisting arrest, ORS 162.315; and aggravated harassment, ORS 166.070.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> Article VII (Amended), section 5, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c(6) An information shall be substantially in the form provided by law for an indictment. The district attorney may file an amended indictment or information whenever, by ruling of the court, an indictment or information is held to be defective in form.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> In <em>Wimber, </em>the court posed three or four questions by which to determine whether a change in an indictment is one of form or substance. <em>Wimber, </em>315 Or at 114-15. We do not recount those questions here because we do not reach the merits of the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> Similarly, defendant has not suggested that this sequence of events has left any uncertainty about the charges intended or tried, such that he faces a risk of double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> As was the case in <em>State v. Delaney, </em>160 Or App 559, 562 n 3, 984 P2d 282, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 358 (1999), \u201c[o]n appeal, [the] defendant does not contend that the court erred in receiving evidence, including the prosecutor\u2019s representations as an officer of the court, describing the evidence submitted to the grand jury or the process by which the indictment was generated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
