This is not an \u201cexceptional\u201d case and therefore does not warrant <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (providing that the court will exercise its discretion to review <em>de novo </em>\u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d). Accordingly, \u201c\u2018we view the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. M. </em>A., 276 Or App 624, 625, 371 P3d 495 (2016) (quoting <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013)). Reviewing under that standard, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellant has been in the custody of the Oregon Health Authority since March 2015 based on the court\u2019s determination that appellant is a \u201cperson with mental illness.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 426.130(l)(a)(C). As pertinent to this case, a \u201cperson with mental illness\u201d is a \u201cperson who, because of a mental disorder\u201d is \u201c[d]angerous to self.\u201d ORS 426.005(l)(f)(A). After appellant spent a year in the custody of the Oregon Health Authority, the court determined that appellant\u2019s commitment should be continued for up to an additional 180 days, on the basis that appellant is \u201cstill a person with mental illness and is in need of further treatment.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 426.307(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The determination that an individual is \u201cstill a person with mental illness\u201d must be based on \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d as must the determination at the time of the initial commitment. ORS 426.307(6); ORS 426.130(l)(a). As we have emphasized in the context of an initial commitment, the evidence that the person presents a danger to self \u201cmust partake of a particularized, and highly probable, threat to [the] appellant\u2019s safe survival, including a risk of substantial harm, in the near future.\u201d <em>State v. S. R. J., </em>281 Or App 741, 749, 386 P3d 99 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>That standard is met here by the evidence and the permissible inferences that the trial court could have drawn from that evidence. Appellant suffers from hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and impulsive behavior. The hallucinations cause her to become very agitated and to run and scream. She was involuntarily committed in March 2015, after her hallucinations caused her to run into traffic on a busy road. The police and fire department were called and redirected traffic. Appellant ran from the police and, in the course of running, fell and badly scraped her palms on the asphalt. Appellant has been hospitalized ever since. At the hearing to consider continuing appellant\u2019s commitment, a doctor who is familiar with appellant\u2019s circumstances testified that she \u201ccommonly will hear voices from demons\u201d that tell her to run and that she responds \u201cby running, screaming up and down the hallways.\u201d In the doctor\u2019s opinion, outside of the hospital setting, appellant\u2019s \u201cpsychosis would worsen. And she would become psychotic. She would run into traffic, which is what got her admitted initially.\u201d Thus, he concluded that appellant\u2019s \u201cimpulsivity puts her at risk of self-harm by running in traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Although appellant argues that the evidence of risk is speculative, we disagree. There is evidence that impulsively running and screaming as a result of hallucinations continues to be a common behavior for appellant. Although recently that behavior has been confined to hospital hallways, that is because appellant has been confined to a hospital since March 2015. When appellant was last in the community, those same hallucinations caused her to run uncontrollably into traffic. She actually injured herself in that incident, and the court could infer that appellant\u2019s pattern of impulsively running, without regard for her surroundings, creates a highly probable risk of more substantial harm in the future. That evidence of the risk that appellant presents to herself is sufficient to permit the court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s mental disorder makes her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>a danger to self. <em>See State v. D. R., </em>239 Or App 576, 585-86, 244 P3d 916 (2010) (concluding that the evidence was sufficient to permit commitment when the appellant was \u201cstill suffering from the same deficiencies in attention and judgment\u201d that had caused her, on the day she was hospitalized, to cross \u201ca street with her head down, causing two cars to halt\u201d and to \u201crun a stop light and three stop signs\u201d); <em>cf. S. R. J., </em>281 Or App at 753 (concluding that evidence that the appellant\u2019s delusions once caused her to stand in the middle of an intersection with traffic stopped in all directions, with no evidence that she had placed herself at risk of being hit by a vehicle, was insufficient to support civil commitment).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> Neither party has suggested that the standard for proving that an individual is \u201ca person with mental illness\u201d should be different at a recommitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>hearing than at an initial commitment hearing. <em>See State v. D. S., </em>243 Or App 328, 333, 258 P3d 1250 (2011) (\u201cTo justify continued commitment ***, the state must do more than establish that appellant was dangerous *** at one time; it must establish a factual foundation to predict appellant\u2019s future dangerousness based on his condition at the time of the hearing in the context of his history.\u201d (Internal citations omitted.)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
