J.</author>\n<p id=\"b588-3\">Defendant appeals an order denying his motion for DNA testing, arguing that the trial court erroneously concluded that he had not met the requirements set out in ORS 138.692 and, in particular, that he had failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>showing that DNA testing would, assuming exculpatory results, establish his actual innocence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In defendant\u2019s affidavit in support of his motion, he included the results from prior DNA testing of a sweat jacket associated with robberies for which he was convicted, which identified defendant as a major contributor of DNA to the sweat jacket and were used as evidence against him in his criminal trial. Reviewing the trial court\u2019s determination for legal error, <em>see State v. Romero, </em>274 Or App 590, 599, 360 P3d 1275 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 794 (2016), and given the prior DNA results, we conclude that defendant has not established how favorable DNA tests results from retesting the sweat jacket would establish his actual innocence. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Defendant was convicted in 2008, following a bench trial, of two counts of first-degree robbery with a firearm, three counts of second-degree robbery with a firearm, and three counts of felon in possession of a firearm. The convictions arose from two robberies committed at a Portland bar on different dates in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In 2009, defendant moved to allow independent testing of forensic evidence under ORS 138.690 (\u201cA person may file in the circuit court in which the judgment of conviction was entered a motion requesting the performance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing on specific evidence * * *.\u201d). As required by ORS 138.692(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he also provided an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>affidavit, which acknowledged that the evidence at issue, a white sweat jacket decorated with gold logos, had already been tested by Dr. Scott, a forensic scientist, at the Oregon State Police Forensic Laboratory (OSP crime lab). That test, according to the affidavit and an attached lab report, indicated that three individuals contributed DNA evidence to the sweat jacket and identified defendant as the major contributor. Defendant also stated in his affidavit that his criminal trial counsel had obtained state funding to hire a DNA expert, Intermountain Forensics, for his defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant also swore that the sweat jacket did not belong to him and that he had never worn it. In defendant\u2019s view, because he had no connection to the sweat jacket, he could not have contributed any of the discovered DNA. He also asserted that an independent test will \u201cprove as a matter of factual evidence that there does not exist any DNA from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Defendant that contributes to the mixture of three individuals.\u201d Therefore, defendant posited that \u201csuch a test will prove as a matter of fact that the State obtained its conviction upon fabricated evidence that has not been established as evidence of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The trial court ruled that defendant\u2019s affidavit did not satisfy the requirements of ORS 138.692(1) and denied defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing. Defendant appeals the order, arguing that, because the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the DNA testing statute was to set a \u201clow bar\u201d for DNA testing, the task of the trial court deciding the motion must be to order testing if the \u201ctheory put forward by the defendant <em>could </em>result in proof of the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Further, defendant asserts that the facts alleged in the pleadings must be viewed in the light most favorable to defendant, the party required to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Under that standard, defendant contends that he met all of the requirements set out in ORS 138.692(1), namely, that he attested that he was innocent of the robbery felonies for which he was convicted, ORS 138.692(l)(a)(A)(i); he identified the specific evidence to be tested\u2014the sweat jacket secured in the investigation\u2014and put forth a theory of defense that independent DNA testing would support, ORS 138.692(l)(a)(B); he included the results of the DNA testing conducted by the OSP crime lab, ORS 138.692(l)(a)(C); and, he presented a <em>prima facie </em>showing that DNA testing of the sweat jacket would, assuming exculpatory results, establish his actual innocence, ORS 138.692(l)(b). In particular, his theory of defense is that DNA testing will establish that he never wore the sweat jacket used as evidence connecting him to the robberies and that the OSP crime lab testing results were fabricated or erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The state responds that the trial court correctly determined that defendant did not meet his burden of making a <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual innocence, as required by ORS 138.692(l)(b)(A), because, even if DNA retesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>results were different from the initial testing, they would not exonerate defendant. Moreover, in the state\u2019s view, even if independent DNA testing were to result in not finding a match with defendant\u2019s DNA, there could be a number of explanations that could explain such results. Further, the state argues, defendant\u2019s assertions that he never wore the sweat jacket, and that the DNA testing results were fabricated, are conclusory and offered without any evidence to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">After briefing and argument in this case, we decided <em>Romero, </em>which addressed what ORS 138.692(1) requires of a defendant\u2019s affidavit supporting a request for DNA testing. In <em>Romero, </em>the defendant filed a motion for DNA testing and, in supporting affidavits, identified two specific sex toys and the victim\u2019s nightgown which he sought to have tested for DNA evidence. 274 Or App at 591-92. The defendant\u2019s theory was that the absence of the victim\u2019s DNA on the sex toys would exonerate him by impeaching the victim\u2019s testimony, and the absence of his DNA on the nightgown, or DNA evidence pointing to another perpetrator, would prove that he was not the perpetrator of the crime. <em>Id. </em>After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the defendant had failed to make a showing as to how DNA testing might exonerate him. <em>Id. </em>at 593. On appeal, the defendant argued that DNA evidence, assuming exculpatory results, would \u201cundermine\u201d the state\u2019s theory used to convict him by either revealing that none of the DNA belonged to him or the victim or by revealing the DNA of the true perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 594. Moreover, the defendant construed the requisite showing required by ORS 138.692 in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201c[I]n order to satisfy the requirements for DNA testing, it is sufficient to (1) identify the evidence to be tested, (2) state a theory of defense, and (3) attest to the defendant\u2019s innocence of the crime of conviction. If a defendant satisfies those requirements through pleadings, then the court is only required to consider whether the defendant\u2019s theory of defense \u2018could\u2019 prove his innocence, assuming exculpatory DNA results. According to defendant, the trial court does not have to weigh the strength of other evidence against the defendant in making its determination and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>likewise, a defendant does not need to prove how the DNA results would overcome the evidence presented during the defendant\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">274 Or App at 595. The state responded, conceding that the defendant need not offer conclusive proof of actual innocence, that a defendant must nevertheless \u201cestablish!] a <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual innocence by presenting some evidence or providing some context to show how the potential DNA results could support a finding of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Construing the meaning of ORS 138.692(l)(b)\u2014 \u201cDNA testing of the specified evidence would, assuming exculpatory results, establish the actual innocence of the person\u201d\u2014we reasoned that, \u201c [c] ontrary to defendant\u2019s approach, something more than a defendant\u2019s mere assertion of his innocence is required to make the <em>prima facie </em>showing required by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Further, we stated that, in \u201cassessing whether a defendant has made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that exculpatory DNA evidence would establish \u2018actual innocence,\u2019 we are called upon to assess whether there is some likelihood that such evidence would give rise to reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. Although we did not establish the level of likelihood required to change the factfinder\u2019s assessment of reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we did conclude that a <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>innocence \u201cnecessarily requires the defendant to establish a logical relationship between the presumed exculpatory DNA results and the defendant\u2019s theory of defense in the context of the underlying trial proceedings, as will be required for a later showing of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599. And, we concluded that the defendant failed to explain a logical relationship between the presumed exculpatory DNA testing results and a theory of defense that addressed the overall case against him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><em>Romero </em>is dispositive of defendant\u2019s arguments in this case concerning what is required under ORS 138.692(1) to establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of actual innocence: Defendant must establish a logical relationship between the presumption that independent testing would not find his DNA on the sweat jacket and his theory of defense, in such a way as would lead to a finding of actual innocence. He has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">That is so because, other than the bare allegations that the initial DNA test results were wrong or fabricated, defendant did not present anything in his affidavit that calls into question the legitimacy or accuracy of the OSP crime lab\u2019s results. Defendant failed to substantiate his claim with evidence supporting that allegation, such as some factual basis for calling into question the integrity of Scott or the OSP crime lab. Likewise, defendant did not put forward any basis for a court to find that the methods of Scott or the OSP crime lab were faulty or inadequate, or that the sought-for independent DNA testing would employ better or more accurate testing methods. Without such a showing, the best defendant could hope to demonstrate with results that do not show his DNA on the sweat jacket are merely results that differ from the original testing\u2014especially because the kind of evidence at issue is not susceptible to the kind of highly exculpatory or exonerative weight afforded by DNA evidence in other circumstances (such as when there can only be a single perpetrator of a crime or when the fact of the crime itself is at issue). Also, the initial DNA test results already indicated DNA of two other unknown individuals, so a retest that indicated DNA of other individuals would be duplicative of evidence available in defendant\u2019s original trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Accordingly, even if we assume that the results of independent retesting of the sweat jacket would not show defendant\u2019s DNA, and would thus be favorable to defendant, there is no reason to believe that that evidence would establish defendant\u2019s actual innocence. The trial court therefore did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> In 2015, the legislature amended, as relevant here, ORS 138.690 and ORS 138.692. Or Laws 2015, ch 564, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Those amendments do not apply to defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing because he sought and was denied relief in 2009.

In <em>Schlup, </em>to show procedural or \u201cgateway\u201d actual innocence, a prisoner seeking habeas corpus review of procedurally defaulted claims of constitutional error leading to conviction must establish that, in light of new evidence, \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found [the] petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 513 US at 327. The Court clarified that standard in <em>House, </em>stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201cthe <em>Schlup </em>standard does not require absolute certainty about the petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence.
