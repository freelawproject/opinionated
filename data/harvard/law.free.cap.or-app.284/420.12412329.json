J.</author>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of a final order of the Oregon State Board of Nursing suspending petitioner\u2019s psychiatric mental-health nurse-practitioner certificate for 60 days. On review, we write only to address the arguments that petitioner makes in conjunction with her first assignment of error, in which she challenges the board\u2019s determination that she committed fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board contends, among other things, that each of those arguments is unpre-served. We agree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We state the facts relevant to petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error as the board found them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of the events giving rise to this case\u2014events that involve petitioner\u2019s interactions with one particular patient\u2014petitioner was a certified psychiatric mental-health nurse practitioner. Petitioner provided counseling and medication management for the patient beginning in December 2008. The patient was a minor when he began treatment but turned 18 while still under petitioner\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">At the patient\u2019s final session with petitioner in December 2010, petitioner advised the patient\u2019s mother that his account balance would need to be paid in full by the time of his next appointment, in January 2011. The patient missed the January 2011 appointment. Later that month, petitioner left a voicemail message on the patient\u2019s mother\u2019s phone, reminding her of the balance due on the account and advising her that the patient now owed an additional fee for the missed appointment. Another appointment for the patient was scheduled in February. Two days before that scheduled appointment, petitioner again left a voicemail message with the patient\u2019s mother reminding her that the balance on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>account needed to be paid before the appointment. On the morning of the scheduled appointment, petitioner left a message for the patient\u2019s mother, cancelling the appointment because of the unpaid balance. Later that day, the patient\u2019s stepfather left a voicemail for petitioner, informing her, in abusive terms, that she would not be receiving payment and that the patient would seek treatment elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The patient made no further attempts to reschedule his appointment with petitioner, and he began receiving treatment elsewhere. A few days after the cancelled February appointment, petitioner left a voicemail message on the patient\u2019s mother\u2019s phone, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c[Y]ou have a balance due. You need to be accountable and pay your bill. Um and uh then I will release those records. Um but it will not happen until I can get to it, and um you do need to stop calling me, um don\u2019t make any threats because that um * * * you know I can go ahead, too and call the police about you know, your husband talked to me, the last time on the phone. So um pay the balance, find out, be accountable, what the amount is. I have it with me right now. And um it\u2019ll all work out just fine. Bye, Bye.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Petitioner had no further communication with the patient\u2019s mother or stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Over the next year, the patient\u2019s new care provider attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the patient\u2019s records from petitioner. The patient also asked petitioner to send his records to the Navy, but petitioner informed him that he would need to sign a release and pay for copies of his records. In January 2012, the patient\u2019s mother filed a complaint with the \u201cfederal Office for Civil Rights,\u201d asserting that petitioner had wrongfully refused to provide the patient with his records until he paid the balance on his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In late 2012, the board issued a \u201cNotice of Proposed 60 Day Suspension of Nurse Practitioner Certificate\u201d to petitioner, based on allegations of fraud and conduct derogatory to the standards of nursing in accordance with ORS 678.111 and OAR 851-045-0070.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At petitioner\u2019s request, a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>on that notice was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ). Petitioner appeared without counsel and testified on her own behalf. Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a proposed order that determined, among other things, that one of petitioner\u2019s February 2011 voicemail message to the patient\u2019s mother constituted fraud, for purposes of ORS 678.111(1)(d). The ALJ explained that conclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\u201cORS 678.111(l)(d) prohibits fraud or deceit in the practice of nursing. Fraud means \u2018an instance or act of trickery or deceit * * * an intentional misrepresentation * * * for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him * * * \u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>904 (unabridged ed 2002). Deceit means \u2018the act or practice of deceiving (as by falsification, concealment, or cheating) * * * false representation used to defraud another ***.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at 584.) These definitions indicate that an intentional or false misrepresentation is not enough. There must be an illicit purpose to the statement, such as trickery or cheating, to support a finding of fraud or deceit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cIn the February *** voice mail message, [petitioner] stated that she would not release Patient\u2019s records until the outstanding account balance was paid. [ALJ states an opinion regarding when a provider may lawfully deny a request for records.] [Petitioner\u2019s] recorded demand that the account be paid in full before releasing Patient\u2019s records was an unlawful demand in which she intentionally misrepresented the law to induce payment on the account balance. [Petitioner\u2019s] conduct constituted fraud and deceit in the practice of nursing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Petitioner, still unrepresented, filed an extensive list of exceptions to the proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>In its final order, the board adopted the ALJ\u2019s determination that petitioner had committed fraud; the pertinent part of the final order is materially identical to the part of the ALJ\u2019s proposed order quoted above. Ultimately, the board suspended petitioner\u2019s certificate for 60 days based on its conclusion that petitioner had committed fraud and had violated ORS 678.111 in other ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">As noted, petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the board\u2019s determination that she committed fraud. She makes three arguments in conjunction with that assignment of error, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">First, petitioner argues that the board applied an incorrect definition of \u201cfraud.\u201d Instead of relying on the <em>Webster\u2019s </em>dictionary definition, petitioner contends, the board should have applied a nine-part common-law test for fraud that has developed in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., Conzelmann v. N.W.P. &amp; D. Prod. Co., </em>190 Or 332, 350, 225 P2d 757 (1950) (setting forth test). Petitioner did not include that argument in her exceptions to the proposed order. The argument is, therefore, not preserved for judicial review, and it presents no basis for reversal of the final order. <em>See Watts v. Board of Nursing, </em>282 Or App 705, 714, 386 P3d 34 (2016) (\u201c[T]he court will not review arguments presented for the first time on judicial review!.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Second, petitioner contends that the board improperly determined only by a preponderance of the evidence that she committed fraud; according to petitioner, the board should have applied a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard to that question. Again, petitioner did not include such an argument in her exceptions to the proposed order, which had expressly stated that the board had the burden to establish the alleged violations \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Accordingly, the argument is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Third, petitioner argues that\u2014no matter what definition of \u201cfraud\u201d or burden of proof applies\u2014the board erred in determining that petitioner committed fraud because no evidence in the record supports that determination. Specifically, in keeping with the dictionary definition of fraud adopted by the board, petitioner contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u201c[t]here was no evidence of a misstatement of fact or law, no evidence of fraudulent intent, no evidence of detrimental reliance, and no evidence of loss or harm.\u201d In response, the board argues, in part, that her argument is not preserved. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u201cIn general, to preserve a contention for appeal or judicial review, a party must provide the lower court or agency with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court or agency is able to consider the point and avoid committing error.\u201d <em>Becklin v. Board of Examiners for Engineering, </em>195 Or App 186, 199-200, 97 P3d 1216 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 16 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In asserting that her argument is preserved for judicial review, petitioner points to the detailed exceptions she filed to the ALJ\u2019s proposed order. Specifically, she relies on the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201c[T]he [voicemail] message left on [Patient\u2019s mother\u2019s] phone *** in response to messages left by [Patient\u2019s parents], which contained threats, being informed no payment would ever be made, tearing up a check for payment, being called a \u2018fucking bitch\u2019 by stepfather. The [voicemail] I left on [Patient\u2019s mother\u2019s] cell phone was taken out of context, \u2018as paying the account balance\u2019 had to do with an agreement with [Patient\u2019s mother] &amp; services being temporarily suspended * * * The [voicemail] was an emotional reaction to the names [Patient\u2019s stepfather] called me when he left a message.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Petitioner made additional, similar assertions in her exceptions. But each of those assertions amounted to disagreement with the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the significance of certain events, an explanation of why petitioner responded to the patient\u2019s parents as she did, or a contention that the AL J had taken her statements out of context. Petitioner did, at one point in her many pages of exceptions, assert that \u201c [t]here was absolutely \u2018no fraud and or deception\u2019 involved on my part.\u201d But petitioner made that assertion in conjunction with her claim that, \u201cIF \u2018in fact\u2019 I was \u2018refusing to release the records based on account balance,\u2019 the facts I bring to this case \u2018would have looked much differently.\u2019\u201d In other words, to the extent that petitioner asserted in her exceptions that she had not committed fraud, that assertion was tied to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>contention that her refusal to release the patient\u2019s records was not based on his unpaid account balance\u2014petitioner did not then link that assertion to a claimed lack of evidence regarding misstatement, fraudulent intent, detrimental reliance, and harm, as she does on judicial review. Thus, petitioner failed to provide the board with an explanation of her objection to the proposed order that was \u201cspecific enough to ensure that the [board could] consider the point and avoid committing error.\u201d <em>Becklin, </em>195 Or App at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Finally, petitioner briefly asserts that each of her three arguments establishes \u201cerrors of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d That bare assertion does not suffice to establish the criteria that an unpreserved argument must meet to qualify for plain-error review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201c(1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute, and (3) the error appears on the face of the record, so that we need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 551, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nor has petitioner explained why we should exercise our discretion to correct any error that is plain. <em>See State v. Carr, </em>215 Or App 306, 316, 170 P3d 536 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 109 (2008) (declining to address an unpre-served argument where the appellant failed \u201cto address the factors governing the exercise of this court\u2019s discretion to review asserted plain error\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to review petitioner\u2019s unpreserved arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> We reject without discussion petitioner\u2019s second through fourth assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> To the extent that petitioner does not challenge the board\u2019s factual findings on judicial review, those unchallenged findings are the facts for purposes of our analysis. <em>Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995). To the extent that petitioner challenges the board\u2019s findings in conjunction with her first assignment of error, we reject those challenges for the reasons set forth in this opinion. To the extent that her second through fourth assignments of error incorporate challenges to the board\u2019s factual findings, we reject those challenges without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> ORS 678.111 establishes the disciplinary actions the board may take against nursing licenses and the reasons needed for such actions.
