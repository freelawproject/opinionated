Employment Dept., </em>258 Or App 411, 310 P3d 1139 (2013) <em>CPCS I). </em>In that decision, we held that the department had erroneously applied provisions of the independent contractor statute, ORS 670.600, in determining that all of petitioner\u2019s paid musicians in 2009 were employees, triggering petitioner\u2019s obligation to pay unemployment tax. On remand, the department deemed 13 of the musicians to be independent contractors but held to its previous determination that the remaining musicians were employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">On review, petitioner makes three assignments of error. The first and second assignments challenge the department\u2019s application of two provisions of the independent contractor statute, ORS 670.600(3)(a) and (d). The third assignment raises a procedural challenge to the department\u2019s evident decision, on remand, to require an individualized showing as to each musician rather than to treat certain members of the orchestra as representative of the group. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the record establishes as a matter of law that the orchestra\u2019s musicians have made a \u201csignificant investment,\u201d within the meaning of ORS 670.600(3)(d), in the business of being musicians. Under the procedural circumstances of this case, and in light of our decision in <em>PCS I, </em>that is sufficient to prove that all the orchestra\u2019s paid musicians during the relevant time were independent contractors not subject to unemployment tax. The department\u2019s order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Most of the facts are set forth in <em>PCS I </em>and are repeated here (sometimes verbatim) only as necessary to provide context for the specific issues raised in this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Petitioner is a nonprofit organization that presents, in a typical year, five different musical programs, with two performances of each program. The musicians who perform with petitioner include both volunteer members and paid members; the paid members fill what are called \u201ccore\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>positions in the orchestra. For years, petitioner\u2019s core musicians worked without written contracts, but, in 2005, petitioner began entering into signed agreements with those performers. The contract states that petitioner seeks to \u201cengage as independent contractors a full complement of musicians necessary to present the concert series.\u201d The musicians must agree to attend all rehearsals and concerts, prepare for rehearsals and concerts to the satisfaction of the conductor and section leaders, and abide by the terms of petitioner\u2019s written personnel policy. Petitioner sets the content and scheduling of rehearsals and concerts. Petitioner\u2019s performance season runs from October through May, and includes approximately 10 concerts and 20 or 25 rehearsals. The musicians themselves provide almost all of the necessary equipment for their performances. Although petitioner provides sheet music for the programs, the musicians provide their own instruments and music stands. In general, the musicians own their instruments, many of which were purchased for thousands of dollars and cost hundreds of dollars each year to maintain. Musicians also must decide whether it is necessary to purchase performance aids, such as recordings of the musical piece, to prepare for rehearsals and concerts.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Following an investigation in 2009, the department determined that \u201call of petitioner\u2019s core musicians were employees and that petitioner\u2019s payments to those musicians constituted wages subject to unemployment taxation. Because petitioner had not paid unemployment taxes on payments to its musicians, the department issued a notice of tax assessment for unemployment contributions for 2009.\u201d <em>PCS I, </em>258 Or App at 419 (emphasis omitted). Petitioner contested the tax assessment before an administrative law judge (ALJ), who considered whether petitioner had carried its burden of proving that its musicians met the criteria for independent contractors in ORS 670.600(2). <em>See </em>ORS 657.040(1) (\u201cServices performed by an individual for remuneration are deemed to be employment * * * unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Director of the Employment Department that the individual is an independent contractor, as that term is defined in ORS 670.600.\u201d). ORS 670.600(2) provides that, for purposes of ORS chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>657 (unemployment insurance), an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d is a person who provides services for remuneration and who, in the provision of the services,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\">\u201c(a) Is free from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of the person for whom the services are provided to specify the desired results;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">\u201c(b) * * * [I] s customarily engaged in an independently established business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201c(c) Is licensed under ORS chapter 671 or 701 if the person provides services for which a license is required under ORS chapter 671 or 701; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201c(d) Is responsible for obtaining other licenses or certificates necessary to provide the services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Of procedural importance on appeal, the parties and the ALJ treated the four musicians who testified at the hearing as representative of petitioner\u2019s other \u201ccore\u201d musicians. At a prehearing conference, the department stated that it would call only two musicians to testify because \u201cmost of these musicians are similarly situated.\u201d The ALJ also made a statement to the effect that it would be unnecessarily duplicative to hear testimony from more than a few musicians, and encouraged petitioner to limit its presentation accordingly. At the hearing, the department\u2019s auditor testified that, because \u201call these people performed the same kind of service, doing the same types of things, * * * we didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to interview all of these individuals.\u201d Thus, four musicians testified at the hearing. As discussed further below, the ALJ ultimately affirmed the notice of tax assessment, reasoning that petitioner failed to carry its burden of proving that the musicians met each of the relevant, conjunctive criteria in ORS 670.600(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In <em>PCS I, </em>reviewing for legal error and substantial reason, we understood the dispute to hinge on the application of ORS 670.600(2)(a) and (b). 258 Or App at 420. Subsections (2)(c) and (2)(d) were not at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>As to subsection (2)(a), the \u201cdirection and control\u201d test, we concluded that the ALJ\u2019s determination that petitioner failed to meet that criterion lacked substantial evidence. The record, we explained, established that \u201cthe musicians\u2014all of whom were similarly situated\u2014were \u2018free from direction and control over the means and manner of providing the services, subject only to the right of [petitioner] to specify the desired results.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424 (quoting ORS 670.600(2)(a) (brackets in <em>PCS I)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We then turned to subsection (2)(b), which requires that petitioner\u2019s musicians be engaged in an \u201cindependently established business.\u201d ORS 670.600(2)(b). For purposes of that provision, a person is \u201cconsidered to be customarily engaged in an independently established business if any three of the following [five] requirements are met\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201c(a) The person maintains a business location:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201c(A) That is separate from the business or work location of the person for whom the services are provided; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201c(B) That is in a portion of the person\u2019s residence and that portion is used primarily for the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201c(b) The person bears the risk of loss related to the business or the provision of services ***[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">\u00ab* * \u2021 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">\u201c(c) The person provides contracted services for two or more different persons within a 12-month period, or the person routinely engages in business advertising, solicitation or other marketing efforts reasonably calculated to obtain new contracts to provide similar services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\u201c(d) The person makes a significant investment in the business, through means such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">\u201c(A) Purchasing tools or equipment necessary to provide the services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">\u201c(B) Paying for premises or facilities where the services are provided; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201c(C) Paying for licenses, certificates or specialized training required to provide the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\">\u201c(e) The person has the authority to hire other persons to provide or to assist in providing the services and has the authority to fire those persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">ORS 670.600(3). Petitioner had the burden of proving that its musicians met at least three of those requirements. <em>See </em>ORS 657.683(4) (the \u201cassessment of the director or authorized representative shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the protesting employing unit to prove that it is incorrect\u201d). The ALJ ruled that petitioner had failed to carry its burden and that \u201c\u2018[n]one of the musicians meets at least three of the five [criteria] for an independently established business.\u201d\u2019 <em>PCS I, </em>258 Or App at 425 (brackets in original). The ALJ reasoned that, although some of the musicians met the criterion in subsection (3)(c) by contracting with others or soliciting other work, none of the musicians met any of the other four criteria in subsections (3)(a), (b), (d), or (e). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We disagreed, concluding that the record established that the representative musicians fulfilled the criteria in both subsection (3)(b) (risk of loss) and subsection (3)(e) (authority to hire and fire). <em>Id. </em>at 426-28. Because of that, and in light of the AL J\u2019s determination that at least some of the musicians also satisfied the criterion in subsection (3)(c) (contracted services), it followed that \u201cat least some of the representative musicians satisfied the test for an \u2018independently established business\u2019 by meeting three of the five requirements in ORS 670.600(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. That conclusion, together with our analysis of the \u201cdirection and control\u201d issue, meant that \u201cat least some of the representative musicians should have been treated as independent contractors rather than employees for purposes of unemployment taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428-29. Accordingly, we reversed and remanded without reaching the question of whether petitioner\u2019s musicians satisfied any of the remaining criteria in ORS 670.600(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">On remand, no new proceedings occurred; the ALJ issued a new order based on the existing record. The ALJ concluded that the \u201ccontracted services\u201d criterion in ORS 670.600(3)(c) was satisfied by 13 of petitioner\u2019s musicians, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>but not by the others. The ALJ further determined that none of the musicians satisfied either ORS 670.600(3)(a) (business location) or ORS 670.600(3)(d) (significant investment). As such, the ALJ determined that 13 of petitioner\u2019s musicians fulfilled at least three of the five criteria in ORS 670.600(3), and were therefore independent contractors, but that the others did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">On review, petitioner challenges the ALJ\u2019s order on three grounds. First, petitioner argues that the ALJ incorrectly applied the \u201csignificant investment\u201d criterion for an independently established business, ORS 670.600(3)(d), and that the record establishes that petitioner\u2019s musicians satisfy that criterion. Second, petitioner argues that the ALJ incorrectly applied the \u201cbusiness location\u201d criterion, ORS 670.600(3)(a), as to one of the four musicians who testified at the hearing. Third, petitioner argues that the ALJ erred to the extent that it changed course on remand by requiring an individualized showing as to whether each of petitioner\u2019s core musicians was an independent contractor, rather than continuing to treat the four musicians who testified at the hearing as representative of the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Here, the \u201csignificant investment\u201d criterion is dis-positive. It is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s musicians supply the specialized equipment necessary to perform their work, most notably the musical instruments themselves, which typically cost thousands of dollars to purchase and hundreds more annually to maintain. <em>PCS I, </em>258 Or App at 416. Indeed, the department concedes that the <em>amount </em>of money spent by the musicians on their instruments and other equipment is sufficient to qualify as a \u201csignificant investment.\u201d And the department does not appear to deny that petitioner\u2019s core musicians are in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of providing paid musical services. In short, the record clearly establishes that the musicians have made significant investments in the equipment that is necessary to engage in the business of musical performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The ALJ found below, however, and the department argues on judicial review, that petitioner did not prove that its musicians made their investments as <em>business </em>investments. We understand the department\u2019s theory on review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to be that, although the musicians are in the music performance business and have spent significant sums on the tools necessary for that business, the missing link is proof that those sums were spent <em>in the business </em>rather than, say, for the \u201clove of music.\u201d The department also asserts that the musicians may have purchased their equipment before they became professional musicians, and that an expense incurred before the business was established cannot constitute a \u201csignificant investment in the business\u201d under ORS 670.600(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">We reject the department\u2019s view. The case on which the department relies, <em>Compressed Pattern, LLC v. Employment Dept., </em>253 Or App 254, 293 P3d 1053 (2012) <em>0Compressed </em>Pattern), is inapposite. In that case, Compressed Pattern, an architectural design company, hired Singer to provide architectural drafting services for some of its projects using computer-aided design (CAD) software. <em>Id. </em>at 255-56. Singer had recently been laid off by another architectural firm but was allowed to continue using that firm\u2019s offices, computers, and CAD software at no cost while performing services for Compressed Pattern. <em>Id. </em>As with his previous job, during the time that Singer provided drafting services for Compressed Pattern, he also continued to pursue his architectural license.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The Employment Department issued a tax assessment, determining that Compressed Pattern had paid wages to Singer without paying the required employment taxes on those wages. <em>Id. </em>at 257. Compressed Pattern appealed that determination, arguing that Singer was an independent contractor whose payment was exempt from such taxes. An ALJ ruled that Compressed Pattern had failed to show that Singer met three out of the five statutory requirements for an \u201cindependently established business\u201d under ORS 670.600(3). <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">On judicial review, among other things, we considered whether the ALJ erred in concluding that Singer had not made \u201ca significant investment\u201d in his business within the meaning of ORS 670.600(3)(d). <em>Id. </em>at 263. Compressed Pattern argued that Singer\u2019s efforts to obtain an architectural license\u2014which included paying more than $1,500 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>licensing exams\u2014were sufficient to prove that he had made a significant investment in the business by \u201c[playing for licenses, certificates or specialized training required to provide the services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting ORS 670.600(3)(d)(C)). We rejected that argument, concluding that Singer\u2019s pursuit of an architect license was not an investment in the business in which he was engaged <em>at the </em>time\u2014providing drafting services to Compressed Pattern. <em>Id. </em>at 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">According to the department, <em>Compressed Pattern </em>stands for the proposition that an investment made prior to the commencement of a business cannot be a \u201csignificant investment in the business\u201d for purposes of ORS 670.600(3)(d). Thus, the department appears to reason that, if petitioner\u2019s musicians purchased their instruments and other equipment at a time when they simply \u201cloved music,\u201d and before they entered into the business of musical performance, then those purchases cannot count as significant investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The department misreads <em>Compressed Pattern. </em>Our conclusion that Compressed Pattern failed to prove that Singer had made a \u201csignificant investment in the business\u201d did not flow from the fact that Singer had pursued his architectural licensure prior to beginning his drafting work for Compressed Pattern. Instead, our determination was based on the ALJ\u2019s factual findings, which were supported by substantial evidence, that (1) the drafting services that Singer provided did not require an architectural license and (2) Singer had failed to make <em>\u201cany </em>investment in the assets necessary to perform drafting services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264 (observing that Singer \u201cdid not purchase or pay for the CAD software or the printer necessary to create hard copies of drawings\u201d) (emphasis in original). Put differently, the problem in <em>Compressed Pattern </em>was that, although Singer made investments in becoming an architect, those investments bore no connection to the \u201cbusiness\u201d in which he was engaged for Compressed Pattern.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>In short, <em>Compressed Pattern </em>does not hold that investments made before the commencement of a business do not qualify as investments in the business. The department advances no other reason for such a construction of the statute, and we can think of none. As a logical and practical matter, a person is likely to incur expenses in pursuit of establishing a business before actually establishing it. Indeed, nothing in <em>Compressed Pattern </em>suggested that Singer\u2019s expenses toward architectural licensure would not have qualified as investments in the business <em>of being an architect. </em>Moreover, a person may wish to dedicate previously acquired assets toward a business purpose; the mere fact that such dedication occurs after those assets have been acquired does not diminish the value of the contribution. For those reasons, we are not persuaded that ORS 670.600(3)(d) calls upon the department to inquire into the subjective motivations of the core musicians at the time that they acquired their instruments and other specialized equipment. It is undisputed that the core musicians, at the relevant time, were in the business of musical performance; that the musicians\u2019 instruments were used for that business; and that the musicians made investments of sufficient magnitude to qualify as \u201csignificant.\u201d Those facts resolve this appeal in petitioner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">To the extent that the department argues that petitioner failed to carry its burden of proving that <em>all </em>core musicians made \u201csignificant investments\u201d in the business (as opposed to only the four musicians who testified at the hearing), we disagree. The department never asserted below that such an individualized showing was required, and it affirmatively stated that the testimony of only two musicians was necessary because \u201cmost of these musicians are similarly situated.\u201d The ALJ appeared to agree that testimony from numerous musicians would be unnecessarily duplicative and encouraged petitioner to limit its presentation accordingly. Furthermore, as explained above, the department\u2019s argument regarding the need for an individualized showing presumes that the subjective motivation behind each musician\u2019s purchase of his or her instrument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>relevant to the \u201csignificant investment\u201d inquiry under ORS 670.600 (3)(d), and we have rejected that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">In sum, the record compels the conclusion that petitioner\u2019s core musicians made \u201csignificant investment [s]\u201d in their businesses under ORS 670.600(3)(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because petitioner\u2019s core musicians satisfy the relevant criteria necessary to be considered independent contractors under ORS 670.600(2), their services are exempt from employment under ORS 657.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> Subsection (2)(c)\u2014which requires licensure for services that require a license under ORS chapters 671 or 701\u2014was never implicated by the facts of this case. As for subsection (2)(d) (requiring the person providing services to be \u201cresponsible for obtaining other licenses or certificates necessary to provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>services\u201d), although the ALJ ruled that petitioner failed to meet that criterion, the department declined to defend the ALJ\u2019s ruling on that rationale, and we observed in a footnote that the record did not support the ALJ\u2019s determination. <em>PCS I, </em>258 Or App at 420 n 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> The instant case is further distinguishable from <em>Compressed Pattern </em>in two meaningful respects. First, the architectural license that Singer pursued was not required to provide drafting services, whereas the musicians\u2019 instruments are necessary for the provision of services for petitioner. Second, unlike Singer, who \u201chad not made <em>any </em>investment in the assets necessary to perform drafting services,\u201d 253 Or App at 264 (emphasis in original), it is undisputed that petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>musicians made significant investments both in their instruments and other equipment necessary for the business of performing music.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b287-5\"> In light of our conclusion that petitioner\u2019s core musicians satisfy three of the five requirements in ORS 670.600(3), petitioner has satisfied its burden of proving that the musicians are \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established business\u201d for purposes of ORS 670.600(2)(b). Accordingly, we need not address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
