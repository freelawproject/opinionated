Those ordinances amended the county\u2019s Land Development Ordinance (LDO) to establish, among other things, the types of land on which medical and commercial marijuana cultivation would be permitted. In the first of her two assignments of error, petitioner contends that LUBA erred when it concluded that the ordinances\u2019 prohibition of marijuana production on lands zoned \u201crural residential\u201d was consistent with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. In her second assignment of error, petitioner contends that LUBA erred when it concluded that the ordinances\u2019 prohibition of marijuana production on rural residential lands is a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d of marijuana cultivation authorized by ORS 475B.340. As explained below, we affirm LUBA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We begin with a brief overview of the relevant law and procedural history. In 1998, Oregon voters approved the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act (OMMA), legalizing under state law the production and sale of marijuana for medical purposes. Or Laws 1999, ch 4. The OMMA was codified in ORS chapter 475B. In 2014, Oregon voters approved Ballot Measure 91, which legalized the production and sale of marijuana for recreational use under state law. Or Laws 2015, ch 614.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following the passage of Ballot Measure 91, the legislature adopted additional legislation enacting changes to both the medical and recreational marijuana statutes, including the provisions at issue in this appeal. Ballot Measure 91 and the subsequent enactments were also codified in ORS chapter 475B.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">ORS 475B.370 and ORS 475B.340 are central to this case. As relevant, ORS 475B.370 establishes that marijuana is \u201ca crop\u201d as the term is used in various farming and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>agriculture statutes. Those statutes include ORS 215.203, which authorizes local governments to adopt \u201cexclusive farm use\u201d zones and defines \u201cfarm use,\u201d in part, as \u201cthe current employment of land for the primary purpose of obtaining a profit in money by raising, harvesting and selling crops.\u201d ORS 475B.340 authorizes local governments to \u201cadopt ordinances that impose reasonable regulations\u201d on businesses licensed to produce or process marijuana or sell marijuana wholesale or retail under Oregon\u2019s recreational marijuana scheme. ORS 475B.340(2). The statute sets out some exceptions to what types of conditions a local government may impose on those activities and defines the term \u201creasonable regulations\u201d to include, among other things, \u201creasonable limitations on where a premises for which a license or certificate for [recreational marijuana production, processing, or wholesale or retail sale] may be located.\u201d ORS 475B.340(l)(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The facts relevant on review are brief and are drawn from LUBA\u2019s order and the local government record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>McPhillips Farm, Inc. v. Yamhill County, </em>256 Or App 402, 404, 300 P3d 299 (2013). Following the enactment of the relevant provisions of ORS 475B.340 and ORS 475B.370, the county approved the two ordinances that are the subject of this appeal: Ordinance 2016-3 and Ordinance 2016-4. The two ordinances are identical, except that Ordinance 2016-4 was enacted as an emergency ordinance of temporary duration and has since been superseded by the permanent Ordinance 2016-3. For the sake of clarity, we refer to both the ordinances as \u201cthe ordinance\u201d for the remainder of this opinion. The ordinance amended the county\u2019s LDO, which regulates land use within the county, to include various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>regulations on marijuana-related land use. Among various changes it made, the ordinance established the types of land on which medical and recreational marijuana production would be allowed and on which types it would be prohibited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Section 2 of the ordinance, under the heading Legal Findings, states that, as a result of the recent legislative enactments, \u201crecreational and medical marijuana production are considered a \u2018farm use.\u2019 The Board of Commissioners finds the Jackson County Land Development Ordinance does not allow a \u2018farm use\u2019 to occur within the Rural Residential and Rural Use zoning districts.\u201d The ordinance amended the LDO to allow marijuana production on lands zoned exclusive farm use (EFU), forest, and general and light industrial. Marijuana production was not authorized on lands zoned rural residential, rural use, urban residential, and commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Petitioner, a resident of Jackson County, testified against the ordinance before the county board of commissioners. After the board of commissioners adopted the ordinance, petitioner appealed to LUBA, arguing that the ordinance was unlawful because it conflicted with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. Petitioner also argued that the ordinance was invalid because it was not a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d as described and authorized under ORS 475B.340. Specifically, petitioner argued that the county had to demonstrate that it had a \u201csubstantial government interest\u201d in adopting the regulation in order for it to be reasonable. LUBA ultimately rejected petitioner\u2019s arguments and affirmed the county\u2019s adoption of the ordinances. Petitioner\u2019s arguments and LUBA\u2019s determination of petitioner\u2019s assignments of error are discussed in the course of our analysis below.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We begin our analysis with our standard of review. On review, we may reverse or remand a LUBA order only if it is \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure,\u201d \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d or \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found\u201d by LUBA. ORS 197.850(9). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Petitioner appears to contend in each assignment of error that the LUBA order is \u201cunlawful in substance,\u201d in that LUBA erroneously interpreted the law. For that reason, our role is to determine whether LUBA has made a \u201cmistaken interpretation of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Mountain West Investment Corp. v. City of Silverton, </em>175 Or App 556, 559, 30 P3d 420 (2001). Based on our analysis below, we conclude that LUBA correctly interpreted the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">In petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error, she contends that LUBA \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d when it concluded that the ordinance did not conflict with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. Before LUBA, petitioner argued that, \u201c[t]o the extent the Ordinance prohibits marijuana production (a farm use) on rural residential lands within the County, the Ordinance conflicts with the County\u2019s comprehensive plan,\u201d and is therefore invalid. <em>See </em>ORS 197.835(7)(a) (\u201c[LUBA] shall reverse or remand an amendment to a land use regulation or the adoption of a new land use regulation if * * * [t]he regulation is not in compliance with the comprehensive plan.\u201d). Petitioner argued that the county\u2019s comprehensive plan \u201crequires that marijuana be allowed to be grown on rural residential lands\u201d and, as evidence, quoted a paragraph from the comprehensive plan that discusses the benefits of small-scale agriculture in rural areas where \u201cparcelization and/or residential development\u201d has occurred. That paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">\u201cHowever, in areas where parcelization and/or residential development has already occurred, small scale agriculture is often the only way to keep land in productive farm use. Encouraging a variety of types of agriculture in the county provides a greater possibility of innovation and resiliency in the agricultural economy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Additionally, petitioner quoted language from a memorandum and a staff report by the county\u2019s Development Services Department in which county staff appear to anticipate that marijuana production would be authorized on rural residential lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On appeal, LUBA concluded that petitioner failed to show that the ordinance was inconsistent with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201cThe provision of the [comprehensive plan] that petitioner relies on merely describes the predominant farm uses in the county and describes small scale agriculture on parcelized lands as one of those farm uses. The language does not <em>require </em>the county to allow marijuana production on [rural residential]-zoned land and the county\u2019s decision to prohibit it on those lands is not inconsistent with anything in the [comprehensive plan] cited by petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">(Emphasis in original.) LUBA did not address the commentary from the county staff included in the memorandum and the staff report.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On review to us, petitioner argues that LUBA \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d in concluding that the ordinance does not conflict with the county\u2019s comprehensive plan. Petitioner asserts that the ordinance\u2019s prohibition of marijuana production on rural residential lands \u201cdirectly conflicts with the County\u2019s comprehensive plant,] which states the purpose of rural residential lands is to allow small-scale agriculture.\u201d We disagree. The language cited by petitioner from the comprehensive plan is not language of requirement\u2014 neither grammatically nor substantively. As LUBA noted, the quoted paragraph makes a broad declarative statement, but does not instruct or require the county to take any particular action.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Even assuming, without deciding, that the paragraph does require the county to encourage \u201ca variety of types of agriculture\u201d in \u201careas where parcelization and/or residential development has already occurred,\u201d the county\u2019s decision not to allow marijuana production on rural residential lands\u2014just one type of agricultural use\u2014would not violate that command, because requiring the county to encourage \u201ca <em>variety </em>of types of agriculture\u201d is not the same as requiring the county to permit <em>all </em>types of agriculture. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Finally, as to the statements by the county planning staff, petitioner does not argue\u2014nor can she\u2014that such statements are binding interpretations of the county comprehensive plan such that they could be understood to impose a requirement on the county where the text of the comprehensive plan itself does not. Accordingly, LUBA did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>not legally err in rejecting petitioner\u2019s arguments related to the county\u2019s comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error, she argues that LUBA erred in concluding that the ordinance was a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d authorized by ORS 475B.340. Petitioner does not contend that LUBA erred in reviewing the evidence; rather, petitioner contends that LUBA mistakenly applied the law. As noted, we therefore review to determine if LUBA\u2019s order is unlawful in substance because it made a \u201cmistaken interpretation of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Mountain West Investment Corp., </em>175 Or App at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In her arguments before LUBA, petitioner contended that, because the county did not make a finding in the ordinance declaring \u201cany substantial governmental interest the Ordinance is supposed to promote,\u201d the county failed to sufficiently justify its decision not to authorize marijuana production on lands zoned rural residential, making that restriction invalid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Noting that ORS 475B.340 is captioned \u201cLocal time, place and manner regulations,\u201d petitioner asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cOf course, the phrase \u2018time, place and manner\u2019 is a term of art in the law to denote the limits to which the government may restrict a right guaranteed a person by law. \u2018Time, place and manner\u2019 regulations are most often litigated in the context of cases involving freedom of speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Petitioner then cited a pair of United States Supreme Court cases that each considered whether a government regulation restricting rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution was \u201creasonable.\u201d Those cases held, respectively, that such restrictions are permissible only where the regulation advances a \u201csubstantial government interest,\u201d <em>United States v. Albertini, </em>472 US 675, 689, 105 S Ct 2897, 86 L Ed 2d 536 (1985), and the restriction is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to that interest, <em>Ward v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 US 781, 791, 109 S Ct 2746, 105 L Ed 2d 661 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, petitioner argued that, in the absence of a sufficient governmental interest, \u201cthe Ordinance is nothing more than an arbitrary execution of the County\u2019s police powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">As to that argument, LUBA concluded that petitioner had \u201cnot established that marijuana production is a protected interest under the First Amendment,\u201d and, therefore, the analogy to First Amendment case law was inapposite.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cThat ORS 475B.340 and 475B.500 use the similar phrase \u2018reasonable regulation\u2019 in listing the kinds of regulations that a county or city can impose on the sale or production of recreational and medicinal marijuana does not mean that the legislature intended to import into review of local zoning codes the doctrines and standards of review that courts have applied to First Amendment speech cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On review, petitioner argues that LUBA erred as a matter of law and generally repeats the same argument, asserting again before us that the ordinance is invalid because the county failed to make a finding that identified \u201cany substantial government interest\u201d advanced by the zoning decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We agree with LUBA that petitioner\u2019s citation to First Amendment case law is unavailing. Petitioner cites no authority for the proposition that a county\u2019s decision to prohibit marijuana production in some zoning districts, but not others, is subject to heightened constitutional scrutiny such that the county was required to justify its decision by identifying a \u201csubstantial government interest.\u201d Here, the county\u2019s contested zoning decisions are authorized, both generally and specifically, by statutes that petitioner does not contend are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ORS 215.050(1) (authorizing county governments to adopt and revise zoning ordinances); ORS 475B.340 (authorizing local governments to \u201cadopt ordinances that impose reasonable regulations\u201d on the production and sale of recreational marijuana, and listing as an example of such regulations \u201c[r] easonable limitations on where a premises for which a license [to produce marijuana] may be located\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">We pause here to note that, based on the arguments presented, we are not deciding what is a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d of marijuana production under ORS 475B.340. Rather, we merely hold that, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, Jackson County did not need to demonstrate a \u201csubstantial government interest\u201d to reasonably regulate marijuana production on rural residential lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We turn to an additional argument that petitioner asserts before us but did not fully develop before LUBA. Petitioner contends that the ordinance, at least as applied to the facts that exist in Jackson County, is unreasonable because, \u201c[b]y making the overwhelming majority of grow sites in Jackson County illegal, the County has managed to effectively eliminate grow sites in Jackson County.\u201d We understand petitioner\u2019s argument to be that LUBA made a \u201cmistaken interpretation of the applicable law,\u201d <em>Mountain West Investment Corp., </em>175 Or App at 559, when determining what is a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d <em>as applied </em>to the facts existing in Jackson County.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Petitioner did not develop a significant factual record on this issue before LUBA. Before LUBA, petitioner cited a statement that Representative Ken Helm made during deliberations of House Bill (HB) 3400 (2015), the bill that enacted the provisions authorizing and defining \u201creasonable regulations\u201d on recreational marijuana production. In discussing those \u201creasonable regulations,\u201d Representative Helm stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u201cI want to say a brief thing about what it means to be reasonable because it is a subjective term. *** The legislative history that is important to discuss is for those jurisdictions which allow medical and adult-use recreational marijuana and do not opt out in some prescribed fashion, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>may not use their local zoning code to effectively eliminate marijuana businesses or growth sites in their communities by, for example, finding zones in which it is very difficult to site these businesses, or putting them on the edge of town where nobody wants to go, or in some other way making it so difficult for these businesses to be sited that the businesses won\u2019t site in their communities. That\u2019s not reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Audio Recording, House Third Reading, HB 3400, June 24, 2015, at 1:45:30 (statement of Rep Ken Helm), https://olis. leg.state.or.us (accessed Mar 2, 2017). In her briefing before LUBA, petitioner did not further explain how that legislative history supported her argument. In her oral argument before LUBA, petitioner argued that Jackson County had effectively eliminated sites for growing marijuana in the county by barring such sites in rural residential lands where county residents currently grew medical marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">As to the legislative history cited by petitioner, LUBA concluded that, rather than help petitioner, \u201cthat legislative history tends to defeat petitioner\u2019s argument.\u201d LUBA focused on Representative Helm\u2019s statement that, in his view, an unreasonable regulation would be one where a local government attempts to \u201cuse their local zoning code to effectively eliminate marijuana businesses or growth sites\u201d by zoning those businesses or grow sites into difficult locations or otherwise \u201cmaking it so difficult for these businesses to be sited that the businesses won\u2019t site in their communities.\u201d Audio Recording, House Third Reading, HB 3400, June 24, 2015, at 1:45:30 (statement of Rep Ken Helm), https://olis.leg.state.or.us (accessed Mar 2, 2017). LUBA concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cGiven that the county allows marijuana production in the EFU zone and on lands zoned farm and forest, which together comprise more than a million acres in the county, and on industrial zoned land, the concerns stated by that legislator about the reasonableness of zoning regulations do not appear to be present in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">LUBA drew the one-million-acre figure from a footnote in the county\u2019s brief, which, in turn, relied on statistics presented to the county when it enacted the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Petitioner argues to us that, contrary to LUBA\u2019s statement, \u201cthere are not more than a million acres in the county of land zoned EFU, forest uses and industrial uses.\u201d Rather, petitioner argues, the record reflects that there are only 642,661 acres of land in <em>private ownership </em>in the EFU, forest resource, and commercial/industrial zoning districts in the county. Petitioner argues further that, \u201cjust because the land is <em>eligible </em>to grow marijuana does not, in fact, mean it is <em>available </em>to grow marijuana,\u201d and asserts that, in 2015, only four properties zoned EFU were either sold or listed for sale. (Emphases in original.) Petitioner also asserts that \u201cmost marijuana growers in Jackson County are on smaller pieces of land, primarily zoned rural residential,\u201d and that, by prohibiting marijuana production on such land, \u201cthe County has made the overwhelming majority of grow sites in Jackson County illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Petitioner does not argue that property in the zoning districts where marijuana production is authorized is unsuitable for marijuana production such that the owners of that land cannot engage in that use. Petitioner\u2019s argument is that, because only a few such properties happen to have been for sale in 2015, she and others in her position do not have easy access to that land. We note that the only evidence petitioner presents on appeal in support of her assertion that such land is insufficiently available is a statistic drawn from a letter that she herself wrote to the Jackson County Board of Commissioners stating that there were only four EFU-zoned properties that were sold or listed for sale in 2015. However, that assertion says nothing about whether other land was available for rent or lease under some other agreement, let alone the availability of land in the other zoning districts where marijuana production is authorized. Additionally, any zoning decision that prohibits a use in some zoning districts, but not others, will have the effect of making that activity unavailable to certain landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Based on the limited record before LUBA and the narrow argument presented by petitioner to us, we conclude that LUBA did not err in concluding that, as applied to the facts before it, the ordinance was a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d of marijuana under ORS 475B.340. Here again, petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>argument does not call on us to define what is a \u201creasonable regulation\u201d of marijuana under ORS 475B.340 for all purposes. Rather, it asks us to decide whether LUBA correctly concluded that this ordinance was reasonable as applied to the limited facts that were presented to LUBA. Even were we to assume that there are closer to 650,000 acres\u2014rather than one million\u2014of land on which a marijuana production business could be sited in Jackson County, petitioner still has not shown that LUBA legally erred in concluding that the ordinance is a \u201creasonable regulation.\u201d <em>Mountain West Investment Corp., </em>175 Or App at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Lastly, although petitioner argues that the county \u201chas made the overwhelming majority of grow sites in Jackson County illegal\u201d by not authorizing marijuana production on rural residential land, that argument is undercut, first, by petitioner\u2019s <em>own </em>assertion elsewhere in her brief that the county \u201cwas actively encouraging those who are growing on rural residential and rural use lands to make application with the county for a \u2018non-conforming use verification permit\u2019 in order to make legal grow operations located on these lands\u201d; and, second, by evidence in the record indicating that the county did take into consideration and included measures in the ordinance intended to allow marijuana producers on rural residential properties an opportunity to come into compliance with those regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In sum, petitioner has not shown that LUBA\u2019s decision \u201crepresented a mistaken interpretation of the applicable law <em>\u201d Mountain West Investment Corp., </em>175 Or App at 559. Therefore, LUBA\u2019s order upholding the ordinance was not \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> The manufacture, distribution, dispensation, and possession of marijuana are illegal under federal law, even when authorized by state law. <em>See </em>Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.; Gonzales v. </em>Raich, 545 US 1, 29, 125 S Ct 2195, 162 L Ed 2d 1 (2005); <em>United States v.
