J.</author>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Plaintiff, Harry DeWolf, brought a wrongful death action against defendant following the death of plaintiffs daughter, Taylur DeWolf, while she was snowboarding at defendant\u2019s ski resort. The jury found in favor of defendant, determining that defendant was not negligent. However, after entering a judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court granted a motion by plaintiff under ORCP 64 B for a new trial. Defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s order granting a new trial. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We begin with the relevant facts. Taylur was snowboarding at night at Mt. Hood Ski Bowl when she lost control while on the Dog Leg run, causing her to leave the run and collide with a tree. She died at the scene from her injuries. Plaintiff, as the personal representative of Taylur\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death action against defendant, the operator of Ski Bowl. Plaintiffs complaint alleged that defendant breached its duty of care to Taylur by (1) failing to warn of the degree of difficulty of the Dog Leg run; (2) failing to warn of the degree of difficulty or dangerous nature of a feature on the Dog Leg run (a reverse grade) that caused Taylur to lose control; (3) maintaining a dangerous feature on the Dog Leg run that was not reasonably obvious or apparent; (4) failing to eliminate or reduce the unreasonable risk of harm from that dangerous feature by routing non-experts away from it, eliminating the dangerous feature, warning customers about the feature, or guarding against the dangerous feature; and (5) failing to discover the dangerous feature on the Dog Leg run.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">During discovery, plaintiff requested, among other things, that defendant produce documents regarding injuries at Ski Bowl over 10 ski seasons, inclusive of the 2011-12 ski season\u2014the season in which Taylur died. Defendant refused to produce documents, and plaintiff brought a motion to compel. In April 2013, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion in part, ordering defendant to produce documents of injuries on the Dog Leg run during the two years before the day that Taylur died.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In November 2013, plaintiff brought two motions <em>in limine </em>related to the discovery order. First, plaintiff sought to exclude \u201cSki Bowl\u2019s claims of 40 years of safety\u201d because, before 2002, the claimed dangerous feature on the Dog Leg run was covered by trees. Second, plaintiff sought to exclude \u201cSki Bowl statements or data that there have not been other \u2018similar\u2019 injuries or deaths on Dog Leg run because defendant has not produced the injury data.\u201d Plaintiff argued that, because the court had ruled that injury data more than two years before Taylur\u2019s death was not within the scope of discovery, it would be fundamentally unfair to permit defendant to refer at trial to any data outside that date range.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In late November, about one and one-half weeks before the start of trial, the court held a single hearing on all of the motions <em>in limine </em>brought by plaintiff and defendant. With respect to plaintiffs two <em>in limine </em>motions described above, the court and the parties engaged in a lengthy colloquy. Because it is important to our analysis, we relate that colloquy at some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">With regard to plaintiffs motion to exclude defendant\u2019s claims of \u201c40 years of safety,\u201d the court granted it in part, \u201cin that we\u2019re not going to talk about the record of safety in areas outside the accident area,\u201d and denied it with respect to the accident area.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The court then took up plaintiffs motion to preclude defendant from discussing the absence of injuries or similar incidents on the Dog Leg run for time periods for which defendant had not produced documents. On that issue, the court began by explaining that its April 2013 discovery ruling was based on what the court believed the issues at trial were going to be, which at that time did not include defendant\u2019s defense of 40 years of safety. The court then explained that it would order an expanded scope of discovery in light of plaintiffs motion <em>in limine\\</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cI suppose if at the time I understood that you were going to claim 10 or 40 years of safety, I might have ordered you to produce evidence of any accidents on the Dog Leg run dating back as far as you say there haven\u2019t been. So that they can vet that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201c* * * <em>2\u2019H deny the motion on the condition that the defendants produce any documents supporting that there have been no accidents on the Dog Leg run for the period of time that they claim there haven\u2019t been.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">\u201cSo if you\u2019re going to say 40 years, you\u2019re going to have to produce any documents that you have in your possession, custody, or control of any accidents on the Dog Leg run for the last 40 years. And, again, we\u2019re just talking about the Dog Leg run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF]: Your Honor, just so I\u2019m clear, so they need to\u2014basically they\u2019ve produced a certain type and set of documents. They need to produce those for ten years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well it depends on what statement\u2014 again, I don\u2019t know what statements they\u2019re going to make at trial. If they stand up and say: There have not been any accidents on the Dog Leg run for the last 40 years, then\u2014if that\u2019s what your intention is, then you ought to produce records\u2014any records and documents in your custody or control regarding any accidents that occurred on the Dog Leg run for the last 40 years. Because you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re injecting it into the case. You\u2019re injecting the relevance of 40 years into the case. So they\u2019re entitled to that discovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Defendant responded that it would not assert at trial that there had been no accidents on the Dog Leg run\u2014 because there had been accidents\u2014but it would assert that there had been no accidents like Taylur\u2019s accident, specifically, an accident with an \u201cunexpected jump, fall line into the trees that launches people into the trees.\u201d Plaintiff objected to defendant being the arbiter of what constitutes an accident that is \u201csimilar,\u201d such that defendant\u2019s obligation to produce documents would be triggered. To that argument, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cBut I suppose what [plaintiff\u2019s] valid concern is it relies on you making the determination of what it means to be \u2018like this.\u2019 And so to the extent that you are construing \u2018like this\u2019 to mean someone had to die or somebody had to run into a tree, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. If somebody has been\u2014lost control after encountering the reverse grade, that, to me, is enough \u2018like this\u2019 to be discoverable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cSo what I\u2019m\u2014what I\u2019m saying is if you\u2019re going to make that claim, \u2018No accident has occurred like this for the last ten years,\u2019 they should get records going back ten years on any accidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF]: On the Dog Leg run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: On the Dog Leg run relating to somebody encountering a reverse grade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Plaintiff asked the court to broaden the order because defendant\u2019s accident documentation was not that specific. Defendant objected to that because of the volume of records involved. To that exchange, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201cFirst of all, it wasn\u2019t necessarily made clear to me when I ruled on [the motion to compel discovery], *** I don\u2019t think I was operating under the assumption that you were going to come into court and say: We\u2019ve got a record of ten years of safety with this particular terrain. Because if I knew you were going to say that, I\u2019d say: Well, you\u2019ve just injected relevance of ten years of records of accidents on\u2014 in that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201c* * *\u2014if you do intend to go back that far, I think they\u2019re entitled to records that go back that far. I mean, nobody\u2019s going to make you say: We\u2019ve got ten years of no accidents on\u2014on that\u2014that terrain that was exposed by the widening of the slope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\"* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">\u201cWhat\u2014I think they\u2019re entitled to records. If you are going to make that argument\u2014and you don\u2019t have to make the argument\u2014but if you are going to make the argument that nobody ever before complained of this reverse grade and unexpectedly catching air on this reverse grade, then you have the obligation to produce documents that support that assertion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">\u201cAnd it\u2019s too bad that it\u2019s close\u2014this close to trial. Maybe\u2014maybe in your opposition to the motion to compel it should have been more clear to me that you intended to make that argument. <em>It\u2019s not fair to the plaintiffs for you to\u2014for the Court to basically say: You get to decide what\u2019s similar or not similar.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: <em>Let me understand the ruling, then. You\u2019re talking about any accident on Dog Leg wherever it is?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: <em>As far back as you\u2019re going to go with your argument.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: <em>Any accident on Dog Leg?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Way at the top or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>No. Any accident involving a reverse grade and somebody encountering a reverse grade and having an </em>accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The court then had a short exchange with plaintiff clarifying that the order covered any reverse-grade accidents on the Dog Leg run, and not just any type of accident, because evidence of just any accident would not be admissible and because the court was \u201cnot controlling the how\u2014 what arguments the defendant!] want[s] to make.\u201d The court concluded the discussion with a summary of its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">\u201c[I]f you don\u2019t want to make that argument, then you don\u2019t have to produce those documents. But if you are going to make [an] argument going back ten years, then you\u2019re going to have to produce records of any reverse grade accidents on the Dog Leg run going back ten years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">In short, the court repeated several times that defendant\u2019s obligation to produce records covered any period of time for which defendant intended to argue at trial about a record of safety on the Dog Leg run. And, based on defendant\u2019s representations that its argument about safety would be limited to only \u201csimilar\u201d accidents, the court limited the scope of the order to what the court considered to be a \u201csimilar\u201d accident\u2014an accident involving a reverse grade on the Dog Leg run.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>After the court\u2019s ruling, defendant did not produce <em>any </em>responsive documents. At trial, defendant put on evidence that included many witnesses testifying, without regard to time period, that the entirety of Dog Leg is a safe, fun, hazard-free run that is suitable for intermediate skiers and snowboarders and their own children; a computer animation of a smooth run down the entire length of the Dog Leg run that was created based on conditions measured a year <em>after </em>Taylur\u2019s accident; two witnesses who testified that there had been no accidents on the Dog Leg run in the 40-year history of the run, or indeed anywhere at Ski Bowl, \u201csimilar\u201d to Taylur\u2019s, with \u201csimilar\u201d meaning a catastrophic injury; and argument emphasizing the overall safety of the Dog Leg run and lack of \u201csimilar\u201d incidents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>During defendant\u2019s presentation of its case, plaintiff moved to exclude testimony\u2014based on defendant\u2019s purported failure to comply with the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order\u2014after a defense witness testified about a lack of similar incidents, with the understanding that \u201csimilar\u201d meant a catastrophic injury. At the hearing on that motion, defense counsel represented to the court that they had looked through available documents and had not found any other incidents covered by the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order. Based on that representation, the court did not find a violation of its order and, accordingly, denied plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The jury returned a verdict for defendant, finding by a vote of nine to three that defendant was not negligent in any of the ways alleged in plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Following media coverage of the jury\u2019s verdict, plaintiffs counsel was contacted by Bowles, who had had a serious accident while skiing on the Dog Leg run a year after Taylur\u2019s accident. Bowles had notified defendant of his accident in a letter (the Bowles letter) that had stated that the site of his injury was \u201cLower bowl of Mt. Hood Ski Bowl; at or near dog leg.\u201d Bowles also gave plaintiff a video of his crash, taken by a helmet camera that he had been wearing, which showed Bowles falling in the area of the terrain change at which Taylur had had her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Plaintiff moved for a new trial under ORCP 64 B,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> submitting as supporting evidence Bowles\u2019s declaration, letter, and video footage. With regard to that evidence, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>argued that he was entitled to a new trial based on (1) defendant\u2019s misconduct in violating the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order by not disclosing the Bowles letter and by misrepresenting the location or nature of other incidents on the Dog Leg run to avoid disclosure of those incidents; (2) the newly discovered Bowles evidence; and (3) the trial court committing legal error or an abuse of discretion in permitting defendant to determine what was a \u201csimilar\u201d incident to Taylur\u2019s accident when complying with the court\u2019s order to produce documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those asserted grounds for a new trial invoked ORCP 64 B(l), B(2), B(4), and B(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In response, defendant argued that it was not required to disclose the Bowles letter because (1) the letter indicates that Bowles\u2019s accident did not occur on the Dog Leg run, and (2) Bowles\u2019s accident was one year after Taylur\u2019s accident and defendant had argued at trial only that there had been no prior similar incidents. Defendant further denied that it had misrepresented other incidents or that it had records of other similar incidents. With regard to the other two grounds advanced by plaintiff for a new trial, defendant argued that the Bowles evidence did not meet the standard for granting a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and that the trial court had not made any errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">At the hearing on plaintiffs motion, the trial court focused exclusively on defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>failing to produce the Bowles letter. With regard to defendant\u2019s assertion that defendant had argued at trial only that there had been no \u201cprior\u201d incidents, the trial court found that defendant had presented evidence and made arguments asserting the safety of, and no similar incidents on, the Dog Leg run up to the date of trial. The trial court pointed out, in particular, that the animated snowboard run down Dog Leg that defendant had presented at trial was based on conditions measured two days before Bowles\u2019s accident. Defendant conceded that the trial court was correct about that presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The court then focused on whether there was some other timing reason that would have caused its order not to cover the Bowles letter. Throughout the hearing, the court repeatedly asked defendant to leave aside the question about the location of Bowles\u2019s accident and answer whether it believed the Bowles letter to be covered by the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order, that is, whether the order covered the time period of Bowles\u2019s accident. At no point did defendant respond that the letter fell outside of the time period of the court\u2019s order. Rather, defense counsel conceded that, \u201cif [the letter] had said with specificity, you know, that it happened in the same or similar location, under the grounds that you set forth, then it would have been something that we would have produced.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Defense counsel did not answer whether they had reviewed the Bowles letter in connection with the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>in limine </em>order, arguing only and repeatedly that the letter indicated that Bowles\u2019s accident was not on the Dog Leg run at all, stating finally, \u201cAnd we would have done that [not disclose the accident] with any other incident report that had this location.\u201d Defendant\u2019s position was based on its conclusion that the letter indicated that Bowles\u2019s accident had occurred on the Lower Bowl <em>run </em>(as opposed to the lower bowl of the Ski Bowl resort) near where the Dog Leg run empties into the Lower Bowl run. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s position as a factual matter based on the wording of the Bowles letter. The court pointed out that the letter stated that the accident was \u201cat or near dog leg,\u201d not that it was on the Lower Bowl <em>run. </em>The court also pointed out that Ski Bowl is made up of two families of runs that people refer to as the \u201cupper bowl\u201d and the \u201clower bowl,\u201d and the Dog Leg run is in the \u201clower bowl.\u201d Given that, the court found that the letter was \u201cpretty clear\u201d that the accident happened on the Dog Leg run. The court also emphasized that defendant\u2019s argument ignored defendant\u2019s obligation to disclose documents that are \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of [admissible] evidence.\u201d The court then took plaintiffs motion for a new trial under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">While the motion for new trial was under advisement, defendant submitted supplemental briefing on the misconduct ground raised by the new-trial motion, asserting <em>for the first time </em>that the <em>in limine </em>order did not require production of the Bowles letter because the order did not cover incidents that had occurred after Taylur\u2019s accident and because the Bowles letter did not say that his accident was a reverse-grade accident. Plaintiff objected to that submission and repeated his arguments for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">After considering the additional submissions, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial in open court without taking further argument from the parties. The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cI am concluding that I made a legal error in creating an ambiguity about what defendant\u2019s obligations were with respect to discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cI think, in looking back at the transcript, and then in thinking about how the trial progressed, and then with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the motion <em>in limine </em>made by the plaintiff, I should have, particularly when the evidence came in with respect to the expert who testified about what the condition of the slope was a year later, and that\u2019s evidence * * * that there was no negligent design of the ski slope or that the ski slope didn\u2019t include anything unreasonably dangerous in it, which was based upon measurements he made about a year later, and particularly in light\u2014I think\u2014I think, in retrospect, I didn\u2019t correctly perceive how the issues were going to be presented in terms of\u2014I think I had too much of a focus on notice of a potentially unreasonable or dangerous\u2014unreasonably dangerous condition versus whether there was any unreasonably dangerous condition at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cAnd I think the thrust of the defendant\u2019s case, and obviously their argument that ultimately was successful with the jury, was there was nothing unreasonably dangerous at all about the slope, which makes information about accidents right up to the date of trial relevant and well within the scope of discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cI should have, as that became more clear to me, ruled that defendants were obligated to produce documents regarding accidents right up to the date of trial. That being said, I mean, I certainly didn\u2019t have in my mind that there was any accident. I remain-\u2014I think you probably got a sense from the hearing that we\u2014that we last held, that I\u2019m not convinced that defendants were relieved of an obligation to produce this document because it said Lower Bowl on or at Dog Leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cI think that particularly in light of the discovery standard, reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence, I can see where there\u2019s a judgment call there. But I think, in my view, the correct judgment is that that document has to be produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cIf ultimately it turns out it\u2019s at a different location and on a different slope, then the evidence can be kept out. That\u2019s-\u2014-that\u2019s how that gets dealt with. That\u2019s how that should have been dealt with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201cSo I am concluding that that has\u2014I think because that goes to a central issue in the case, and an issue on which the jury was divided nine to three, I think that materially affected the plaintiffs ability to present their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201cSo I\u2019m\u2014although it\u2019s\u2014frankly, I find this a difficult decision to make because it was a long and arduous trial [.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>* * * I recognize that this places burdens, frankly, on both parties, but I feel like I am obligated to grant a motion for a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We will affirm a trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial if any of the grounds argued in support of the motion for new trial is well taken and, as provided in ORCP 64 B, the well-taken ground materially affected the substantial rights of the moving party. <em>Gragg v. Hutchinson, </em>217 Or App 342, 347, 176 P3d 407 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 401 (2008) (citing <em>Williams v. Laurence-David, </em>271 Or 712, 718, 534 P2d 173 (1975)). Here, we confine our analysis to the court\u2019s determination of legal error and to defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct. \u201cWhen the trial court\u2019s order of a new trial is based on an interpretation of the law, we review that order for errors of law.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>332 Or 138, 151, 26 P3d 785 (2001). \u201cIf the trial court made no predicate legal error, then we review its decision for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Farmer, </em>210 Or App 625, 640, 152 P3d 904, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 645 (2007). With regard to whether the ground for a new trial involved conduct or evidence that materially affected the moving party\u2019s substantial rights, we will usually defer to a trial court\u2019s determinations of prejudicial effect, reviewing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gragg, </em>217 Or App at 347 (citing <em>Moore v. Adams, </em>273 Or 576, 579, 542 P2d 490 (1975)). \u201cThe trial court is the finder of fact at a hearing on a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>210 Or App at 640. As such, we apply our usual standard of review and defer to the court\u2019s explicit and implicit findings of fact if supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We start our discussion with the ground on which the trial court based its new-trial order\u2014\u201clegal error in creating an ambiguity about what defendants\u2019 obligations were with respect to discovery\u201d; specifically, that the court was not clear that its <em>in limine </em>order covered accidents occurring up to the date of trial. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court could not grant a new trial on that basis because the trial court\u2019s order simply did not contain the ambiguity that the trial court identified. Because that conclusion is entwined with how defendant has argued its case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>on that issue, we start our explanation with a brief summary of those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Defendant asserts that the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order only encompassed accidents that occurred before Taylur\u2019s accident because plaintiffs <em>in limine </em>motion only referred to injury data occurring before Taylur\u2019s accident, and the trial court\u2019s reference at the hearing to records \u201cgoing back ten years\u201d was a reference to plaintiffs document request that only requested documents up to the 2011-12 ski season.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given that understanding of the <em>in limine </em>order, defendant asserts that the court did not identify any legal error on which it could base a new trial. Additionally, defendant argues that the trial court did not legally err when it failed to require defendant to produce documents about accidents occurring after Taylur\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s arguments because they are not supported by the record. As set out at length above, 284 Or App at 437-40, the trial court clearly and repeatedly said that its order to produce records\u2014which was a condition that the court required defendant to fulfill so that the court would not exclude from trial defendant\u2019s arguments about a 40-year record of safety on the Dog Leg run\u2014was tied directly to whatever arguments and evidence defendant intended to present at trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In particular, the court repeatedly made clear that the time frame of its order covered the time period that defendant\u2019s safety arguments covered. In that way, the full scope of the court\u2019s order was entirely within defendant\u2019s control. At trial, defendant chose to put on evidence and to argue that the Dog Leg run has been safe and hazard-free for its entire history and that there have been no similar incidents for 40 years, including up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>time of trial. Thus, the Bowles letter, as a temporal matter, was unambiguously covered by the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In rejecting defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the time period covered by the trial court\u2019s order, we necessarily also reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion that it committed legal error in creating an ambiguity in its order, because the identified ambiguity does not exist. Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is no evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that the order was ambiguous. Because the trial court did not legally err in the manner identified by the court, the court could not grant a new trial on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Because we are tasked with affirming a trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial if any ground in the moving party\u2019s motion is well taken, we turn to the misconduct ground raised below by plaintiff, which we conclude is well taken. ORCP 64 B(2) provides that a new trial may be granted for \u201cmisconduct of the * * * prevailing party\u201d if that misconduct \u201cmaterially affect [ed] the substantial rights of [the moving] party.\u201d \u201cWhere misconduct is alleged, the focus is on the sufficiency of the evidence and the level of misconduct.\u201d <em>D.C. Thompson and Co. v. Hauge, </em>300 Or 651, 655, 717 P2d 1169 (1986). As noted, we defer to the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit factual findings that are supported by evidence in the record. However, the determination whether the conduct of defendant, as found by the trial court, constituted \u201cmisconduct\u201d under ORCP 64 B(2) is ultimately a question of law. <em>Cf State v. York, </em>291 Or 535, 539, 632 P2d 1261 (1981) (court\u2019s findings of fact on prosecutor\u2019s actions was binding on appeal, but \u201c[t]he conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s act was not \u2018misconduct\u2019 is a decision of law which is subject to appellate scrutiny\u201d; concluding that prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by improperly discouraging a witness from talking to the defense, even though the conduct was not expressly foreclosed by statute or rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Plaintiff argues that, although the court did not base its ruling on misconduct, the court still found that \u201c(1) defendant had an obligation to produce the Bowles document under [the court\u2019s] motion <em>in limine </em>ruling; (2) defendant improperly withheld that document; and (3) plaintiffs rights were materially affected.\u201d Based on our standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>review, plaintiff argues that those findings are sufficient for us to affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial based on prevailing-party misconduct. In addition, plaintiff argues that the record demonstrates that defendant engaged in other improper obstruction of discovery, particularly by improperly refusing to disclose documents based on defendant\u2019s own determination of what was admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">With respect to misconduct, defendant chose not to make arguments on appeal and instead \u201csimply incorporate [d] the arguments it made in the trial court.\u201d Defendant argued below that they could not have committed misconduct because the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order did not require disclosure of the Bowles letter because (1) Bowles\u2019s accident occurred a year after Taylur\u2019s accident, (2) the Bowles letter indicated that his accident was not on the Dog Leg run, and (3) the Bowles letter did not mention that his accident involved a \u201creverse grade.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As set forth above, the trial court\u2019s order unambiguously encompassed the Bowles letter, as a temporal matter. There is no reasonable reading of the record that could have led defendant to believe otherwise. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that defendant actually held that belief at the time that it told the court that it had no responsive documents. Tellingly, the <em>only </em>affidavit provided by defendant at any time that could be read as an explanation of <em>why </em>it did not produce the Bowles letter was that, at the time that Ski Bowl <em>received </em>the letter, \u201cSkibowl concluded that Bowles\u2019 accident occurred on the Lower Bowl run, at or near the juncture of the Lower Bowl and Dog Leg runs.\u201d Defendant also stated at the hearing on the new-trial motion that, setting aside the location issue, defendant would have produced the letter. We must determine whether defendant engaged in misconduct based on what defendant actually did, not on what defendant might hypothetically have done. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>It is sufficient for purposes of defendant\u2019s argument that we conclude that the court\u2019s order encompassed the Bowles letter based on when Bowles\u2019s accident occurred. .</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">We also conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that its order covered the Bowles letter, as a location matter. As discussed above, the only explanation that defendant gave for why it did not disclose the Bowles letter was because it understood the Bowles letter to say that the accident had occurred on the Lower Bowl run and not the Dog Leg run. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s explanation as a factual matter, which is supported by evidence in the record. The Bowles letter states that the accident location was \u201cLower bowl of Mt. Hood Ski Bowl; at or near dog leg.\u201d Based on that description, the court found that the Bowles letter did indicate that the accident had occurred on the Dog Leg run, because that is a lay understanding of the location of Dog Leg\u2014a run that is within the lower bowl of Ski Bowl. Defendant\u2019s explanation as to why it had concluded that the accident had not occurred on the Dog Leg run was based on a highly technical and intimate knowledge of the layout of Ski Bowl and, as the court found, was an unreasonable standard to apply to a layperson\u2019s identification of the accident\u2019s location. Thus, we conclude that it was misconduct for defendant to withhold the Bowles letter based on its unreasonable interpretation of the letter as stating that the accident had not occurred on the Dog Leg run.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s argument that it was not required to produce the Bowles letter because the court limited its order to \u201creverse grade\u201d accidents. We reject defendant\u2019s argument for two reasons. First, as with the timing issue, defendant did not provide evidence that it had withheld disclosure based on a belief that the Bowles letter was not covered by the court\u2019s order because the letter did not say that the accident involved a \u201creverse grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Second, the court determined that defendant had a discovery obligation to disclose the Bowles letter. As such, the court implicitly found that its order referencing \u201creverse grade\u201d accidents did not relieve defendant of the obligation to disclose the Bowles letter. We agree with the trial court. Under ORCP 36 B(2), which sets out the scope of discovery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u201c[i]t is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Nothing in the Bowles letter ruled out that the accident involved a \u201creverse grade.\u201d The letter, however, was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\u2014that is, a reverse-grade accident\u2014 because it provided enough information for plaintiff to discover the details of Bowles\u2019s accident. Thus, the Bowles letter was within the scope of the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order on the production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In sum, defendant\u2019s failure to produce the Bowles letter violated the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order. That violation, in turn, constitutes misconduct by a prevailing party under ORCP 64 B(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We next address whether defendant\u2019s misconduct materially affected plaintiffs substantial rights. Because the trial court determined that the failure of defendant to produce the Bowles letter did materially affect plaintiffs substantial rights (albeit based on legal error), we defer to the trial court\u2019s determination on that point, reviewing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gragg, </em>217 Or App at 347. The trial court determined that, because production of the letter \u201cgoes to a central issue in the case, and an issue on which the jury was divided nine to three,\u201d plaintiffs ability to present his case was materially affected. We conclude that the court acted within its discretion in making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff was not prejudiced because the Bowles letter would have been inadmissible at trial. The question is not whether the Bowles letter would have been admissible on its own, but whether evidence of Bowles\u2019s accident would have been admissible, as the disclosure of the letter would have enabled plaintiff to obtain the details of the accident. It is readily apparent from the record that the trial court would have admitted evidence of that accident. Bowles\u2019s declaration and helmet-camera footage established that his accident took place in the same area of the Dog Leg run as Taylur\u2019s accident. The trial court had already ruled that any such accident was sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201csimilar\u201d to be admissible at trial under the case law on which defendant relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u2022 We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence of Bowles\u2019s accident would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict because the jury heard evidence of another accident on the same terrain feature on the Dog Leg run the day after Taylur\u2019s accident. Defendant\u2019s argument ignores that defendant argued at trial, at length, that there was nothing wrong with the Dog Leg run, because, if there were something wrong, there would have been a pattern of similar accidents on the run. To rebut defendant\u2019s argument, it was crucial to plaintiff to produce evidence of any and all similar accidents. In light of the explicit argument made by defendant at trial, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that evidence of Bowles\u2019s accident would be merely \u201ccumulative\u201d because plaintiff had put on evidence of one other, similar accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In assessing the prejudice of defendant\u2019s misconduct in this case, we again emphasize the unusual and critical nature of the court order that defendant violated when it failed to produce the Bowles letter. It was not a minor discovery violation. Defendant violated a court order that conditioned defendant\u2019s ability to make its main argument at trial\u2014the lengthy history of a safe and hazard-free Dog Leg run\u2014on its compliance with the court\u2019s production order. It was significant that defendant preserved its ability to put on its entire defense at trial, and its violation of the attached condition was equally significant. We thus conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial in the unusual circumstances under which defendant\u2019s misconduct arose in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We also briefly address defendant\u2019s contention that, if we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial, we should review defendant\u2019s assignments of error asserting that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction and erred in admitting certain evidence during the original trial. We decline to review those rulings because the issues need to be addressed by the trial court in the first instance in the context of the new trial. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-12\"> As discussed below, defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal are largely based on its position that the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order covered only documents involving incidents that occurred before Taylur\u2019s accident. In its opening brief, defendant supports that position based on references in plaintiffs document request and motion <em>in limine </em>to \u201cprior\u201d incidents and based on some of the comments by the trial court at the hearing. If that was where defendant had stopped, we would not find ourselves making this comment. However, defendant proceeded in the reply brief, and at oral argument, to forcefully represent to us that the trial court <em>explicitly </em>ordered defendant to produce documents only of incidents that occurred before Taylur\u2019s accident\u2014going so far as to accuse plaintiff of misrepresenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the record in asserting that the court\u2019s order required defendant to produce documents covering whatever period of time that defendant chose to argue at trial about the safety of the run. Our review of the transcript reveals that plaintiff correctly characterized the trial court\u2019s order (and the court\u2019s discussion of that order) and that the record does not support defendant\u2019s contrary representations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-4\"> For example, defendant argued at length in closing that the entire Dog Leg run has been safe and hazard-free for 40 years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cWhat the overwhelming, and, by far, most credible evidence is, is that there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the Dog Leg run.

Because we conclude that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial based on prevailing-party misconduct, we do not discuss those alternative grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\"> At the hearing on the new-trial motion, the court said that its April order on plaintiffs motion to compel discovery had a temporal limit, stating, \u201c[s]o I didn\u2019t order that, and technically that document\u2019s [the Bowles letter] not covered by <em>that </em>order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Directly after making that statement, the trial court went on to say that its November order on the motion <em>in limine </em>covered <em>\u201cten years to today or something like that.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In its reply brief, defendant quoted the court\u2019s comment about its April order on plaintiffs motion to compel without context to imply that the court was talking about its November <em>in limine </em>order when it said that the Bowles letter was not covered by \u201cthat order.\u201d When plaintiff was asked about that quote at oral argument and whether it was a reference to the <em>in limine </em>order, plaintiff accurately represented that the trial court was referring only to the order to compel and <em>not </em>the <em>in limine </em>order. In rebuttal, defendant asserted that the quote in its reply brief was accurate, and further represented that it was a reference to any order of the court and constituted a finding by the court that it had never ordered production of the Bowles letter. The record contradicts defendant\u2019s assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> Defendant also argues that the trial court did not err because plaintiff did not make a request for the production of documents that would have encompassed the Bowles letter, and the trial court\u2019s April order on plaintiff\u2019s motion to compel did not encompass the letter. We reject that argument because it is inapposite'\u2014\u25a0 plaintiff never advocated for a new trial on that basis, and the trial court explicitly was not granting one on that basis. Rather, both plaintiff and the trial court referred only to the court\u2019s November order on plaintiffs motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\"> As set out in our description of the facts, the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>was held approximately one and one-half weeks before trial.
