Defendant\u2019s case was tried to the court. In the first of defendant\u2019s three assignments of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred by conducting a bench trial without having secured a written jury trial waiver from defendant. The state concedes that the trial court erred and that we must reverse and remand. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 11 (requiring that jury trial waivers be \u201cin writing\u201d); <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 530, 173 P3d 827 (2007) (holding that the trial court erred by conducting a bench trial in the absence of a written jury trial waiver and that, given the specific, constitutional requirement of a written waiver, this court had no discretion not to correct the error). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial. Because the record may develop differently on remand, we do not address defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
