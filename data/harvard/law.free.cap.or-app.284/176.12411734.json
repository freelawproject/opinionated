J.</author>\n<p id=\"b198-3\">Petitioner appeals a judgment denying post-conviction relief. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s dismissal, by way of summary judgment, of his claim based on criminal trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the giving of a \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d uniform jury instruction identical to that which the Oregon Supreme Court later disapproved in <em>State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>350 Or 576, 582-84, 260 P3d 439 (2011). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that (1) the first of the two alternative grounds on which the post-conviction court granted summary judgment was erroneous as a matter of law, <em>see, e.g., Walraven v. Premo, </em>277 Or App 264, 277-85, 372 P3d 1 (2016); and (2) petitioner proffered sufficient contravening evidence to preclude summary judgment on the second alternative ground. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The historical and procedural circumstances material to our review are undisputed. In March 2004, petitioner was charged, by way of a five-count indictment, with felonies against three victims, C, D, and E. The indictment further alleged that petitioner had committed each of those offenses \u201cjointly\u201d with five codefendants. Specifically, Count 1 (attempted murder) and Count 2 (second-degree assault) were based on conduct against C; Count 3 (first-degree robbery) pertained to conduct against D; and, finally, Count 4 (first-degree kidnapping with a firearm) and Count 5 (first-degree robbery with a firearm) were both based on conduct against E.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The criminal case proceeded to trial before a jury in the fall of 2004. The court\u2014without exception from petitioner\u2019s criminal defense counsel\u2014instructed the jury consistently with the then-extant accomplice liability \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d uniform jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cA person who aids or abets another in committing a crime, in addition to being criminally responsible for the crime that is committed, is also criminally responsible for any acts or other crimes that were committed as a natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>and probable consequence of the planning, preparation, or commission of the intended crime.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Immediately before the court so charged the jury, the prosecutor, anticipating that instruction, had highlighted the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d concept in closing argument. The jury found petitioner guilty on all counts, and the court entered consequent judgments with sentences imposing 400 months\u2019 total incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">After unsuccessfully appealing his convictions, petitioner timely initiated this action in January 2010. Thereafter, in August 2011, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>and petitioner subsequently filed his operative first amended petition for post-conviction relief. That petition included nine claims of inadequate representation by criminal trial counsel, including petitioner\u2019s fourth claim, which was based on his defense attorney\u2019s failure to object to the giving of the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With the first amended petition, petitioner submitted various \u201cexhibits,\u201d including two pages from the trial transcript pertaining to the fourth claim. The first of those pages set out a portion of the state\u2019s closing arguments in which (as described above) the prosecutor referred to the content of the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction and told the jury that that instruction was \u201cmost important\u201d with respect to its consideration of the charges based on conduct against C. The second transcript page showed that the court had, in fact, given that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment against all nine claims alleged in the first amended petition. With reference to the fourth claim, defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cPetitioner was tried in 2004. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in [Lopez-Minjarez] was not published until about seven years after petitioner\u2019s trial. <em>Petitioner has not provided any evidence to support a conclusion that all reasonable trial attorneys, in 2004, were objecting to the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 portion of the aider and abettor uniform instruction\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion related solely to the reasonableness of criminal trial counsel\u2019s conduct. The summary judgment motion did not assert, alternatively, that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to whether petitioner had been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Petitioner filed a response, including a declaration in which he averred, <em>inter alia, </em>that criminal trial counsel had, in fact, failed to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction. With respect to the fourth claim, the response remonstrated that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether trial counsel should have anticipated [Lopez-Minjarez]\u201d\u2014but rather, whether, in \u201ca complicated case such as Petitioner\u2019s\u201d and given the state of the law at the time of trial, including <em>State v. Anlauf, </em>164 Or App 672, 995 P2d 547 (2000), on which defense counsel in <em>Lopez-Minjarez </em>had relied, criminal trial counsel \u201cshould have at least preserved the argument for appellate review.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Defendant countered with a reply memorandum in which he reiterated, verbatim, his contention that \u201cpetitioner has not provided any evidence to support a conclusion that all reasonable trial attorneys, in 2004, were objecting to the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 portion of the aider and abettor uniform instruction.\u201d In addition, defendant asserted for the first time that, given the evidence at trial and the manner in which the case had been tried, \u201cthere is no reason to think that the jury * * * relied on the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019 instruction to find petitioner guilty on counts [one] and two\u201d of the indictment, relating to conduct against C. As factual support for that newly advanced \u201clack of prejudice\u201d contention, defendant submitted, for the first time on reply, extensive additional excerpts of the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">The post-conviction court allowed defendant\u2019s motion in part, granting summary judgment against five of petitioner\u2019s nine claims\u2014including the fourth claim\u2014and denying the motion as to the others. With respect to the fourth claim, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">\u201cThis claim presents no genuine issues of material fact. Clearly, trial counsel did not object to the Uniform Jury Instruction, but Petitioner fails to present any evidence that [failure to raise such an objection] was unreasonable based on the case law existing in 2004. Additionally, Petitioner fails to show how he was prejudiced by trial counsel not objecting to the instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Thus, the court granted summary judgment against the fourth claim on alternative grounds, concluding that petitioner had failed to demonstrate material factual issues with respect to each of the elements of post-conviction relief, <em>viz., </em>deficient performance by counsel and consequent prejudice. Following a trial on the remaining claims, the post-conviction court rejected those claims as well, and petitioner appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Our review of the allowance of summary judgment against petitioner\u2019s fourth claim implicates both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>substantive standards governing post-conviction relief and the procedural requisites and constraints of summary judgment. Very recently in <em>Garner v. Premo, </em>283 Or App 494, 389 P3d 1143 (2017), we summarized the \u201csettled legal principles\u201d pertaining to post-conviction relief claims based on purported deficient representation, including, specifically, failure to raise a legal challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201cA post-conviction petitioner who claims a deprivation of rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution must prove \u2018(1) that his lawyer failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and (2) that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result.\u2019 <em>Everett [v. Premo, </em>279 Or App 470, 478, 380 P3d 1099 (2016)]. A court considering whether a petitioner has met that burden must evaluate the adequacy of the lawyer\u2019s representation \u2018from the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without the distorting effects of hindsight.\u2019 <em>Lichau v. Baldwin, </em>333 Or 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002). A lawyer has performed inadequately, for purposes of the constitutional analysis, only if the lawyer\u2019s decisions \u2018reflect an absence or suspension of professional skill and judgment.\u2019 <em>Gorham v. Thompson, </em>332 Or 560, 567, 34 P3d 161 (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u2021\u2021 \u00ed\u00a1i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cThe mere fact that an attorney could have raised an argument does not establish that the attorney is inadequate for having failed to raise it; nor can the petitioner prevail simply by establishing that there was no evident downside to the attorney making such an argument. <em>Green </em>[v. <em>Franke, </em>357 Or 301, 314, 350 P3d 188 (2015)]. Rather, the pertinent question remains whether the lawyer\u2019s failure to make the argument \u2018constituted inadequate assistance, especially when viewed in light of the strategy that the petitioner\u2019s counsel did pursue.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">283 Or App at 501-02.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">In post-conviction proceedings, as generally, a movant defendant is entitled to summary judgment against a claim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cif the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, declarations and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. No genuine issue as to a material fact exists if, based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment. The adverse party has the burden of producing evidence on any issue raised in the motion as to which the adverse party would have the burden of persuasion at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">ORCP 47 C.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Here, as noted, the post-conviction court granted summary judgment against the fourth claim on two alternative bases, either of which, if sustained, would compel affirmance. Accordingly, we address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The post-conviction court first concluded that defendant was entitled to summary judgment because, although petitioner\u2019s criminal trial counsel did not object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction, petitioner had \u201cfail[ed] to present any evidence\u201d that the failure to raise such an exception was \u201cunreasonable based on the case law existing in 2004.\u201d Implicit in that conclusion is the court\u2019s acceptance of defendant\u2019s premise, asserted in the motion for summary judgment and reiterated in defendant\u2019s reply, that it was incumbent on petitioner to have proffered evidence \u201cto support a conclusion that all reasonable trial attorneys, in 2004, were objecting to the \u2018natural and probable consequences\u2019\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The post-conviction court erred in that regard. We and the Supreme Court have consistently held, in generally analogous circumstances, that the determination of whether criminal defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise a legal challenge breached the standard of \u201creasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d depends on \u201can examination of the state of the law at the relevant times,\u201d <em>Krieg v. Belleque, </em>221 Or App 36, 40, 188 P3d 413, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 317 (2008), and the potential risks and benefits of raising such a challenge. <em>See, e.g., Garner, </em>283 Or App at 505; <em>Krieg, </em>221 Or App at 40. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>generally Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 497-500, 112 P3d 320 (2005). Here, petitioner proffered evidence pertaining to those considerations that, at least, precluded summary judgment for defendant on the issue of whether criminal trial counsel\u2019s conduct breached the requisite standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In two recent decisions, issued after the post-conviction court entered judgment here, we have concluded that defense counsels\u2019 failure to except to the accomplice liability \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction in trials that (as here) occurred after we issued <em>Anlauf </em>in 2000 and before the Supreme Court issued <em>Lopez-Minjarez </em>in 2011 constituted a failure to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment. <em>See Walraven, </em>277 Or App 264; <em>Wade v. Brockamp, </em>268 Or App 373, 342 P3d 142 (2015).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><em>Walraven, </em>which substantially incorporated, but refined and amplified, <em>Wade's </em>reasoning is especially instructive. There, the petitioner had been charged with multiple counts of aggravated murder, as well as one count each of felony murder and intentional murder, all arising from an armed robbery and subsequent fatal shooting committed with his older brother. 277 Or App at 266-67. During the criminal trial\u2014which occurred in July 2000, six months after <em>Anlauf </em>issued\u2014the state presented evidence that either the petitioner had personally committed the murder or, even if he had not himself killed the victim (i.e., his brother had), he had at least participated with his brother in the armed robbery of the victim, which had immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>preceded the killing. <em>Id. </em>at 268-69. Given that evidence, the state proceeded, in part, on a theory of accomplice liability by which the jury could find the petitioner guilty of aggravated murder and intentional murder \u201cwithout finding that he intended to kill or help kill the victim, so long as it found that [he] was involved in the armed robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269. Accordingly, the state requested, and the court\u2014 without exception from the petitioner\u2019s defense counsel\u2014 gave a \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction (which was identical to that given in the present petitioner\u2019s criminal trial four years later). <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The jury found the petitioner guilty of aggravated murder, as well as felony murder and intentional murder, and the petitioner ultimately sought post-conviction relief, alleging that criminal trial counsel had been deficient in myriad respects, including in failing to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 266. Following a trial, the post-conviction court rejected all claims, including that pertaining to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 275. In so holding, the court found persuasive an explanation advanced by criminal defense counsel that, given the law existing at the time of the criminal trial, he \u201chad no reason to believe that an objection to the jury instruction would have been successful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. The post-conviction court further determined that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that he had been actionably prejudiced by criminal defense counsel\u2019s inaction in that regard. <em>Id. </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We reversed in part the post-conviction court\u2019s disposition of the claim based on the failure to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction. Specifically, we concluded that (1) counsel\u2019s inaction constituted a failure to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, <em>id. </em>at 279-85; and (2) while the petitioner had been consequently prejudiced with respect to the jury\u2019s consideration of the aggravated murder and intentional murder charges, he had not been so prejudiced with respect to the felony murder charge. <em>Id. </em>at 285-87.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Our conclusion regarding the breach of requisite care in. representation derived from the conjunction of three premises. First, the exercise of reasonable professional skill and judgment requires criminal defense counsel to research and analyze \u201c\u2018the law to the extent appropriate to the nature and complexity of the case.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283 (quoting <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 875, 627 P2d 458 (1981)). Second, given the \u201cnature and complexity of the case\u201d in Walraven\u2014including the prosecution\u2019s partial reliance on an accomplice liability theory that purported to \u201creliev[e] the jury of the requirement to find an element\u201d <em>(viz., </em>intent) of felony charges\u2014it was incumbent on counsel to investigate whether, or to what extent, the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction on which the state\u2019s theory depended comported with the existing law of accomplice liability. <em>Id. </em>at 283-84. Finally, reasonable investigation \u201cwould have led to the discovery of <em>Anlauf\u201d Id. </em>at 284. That \u201cdiscovery\u201d would, in turn, have caused any reasonable defense counsel to object to the instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201cAlthough <em>Anlauf </em>did not explicitly render the <em>instruction </em>obsolete (an issue we were not called upon to decide), we did establish that the erroneous accomplice liability theory\u2014that a defendant who participates in one crime is necessarily responsible as an accomplice for other crimes that were the natural and probable consequences of the intended predicate crime\u2014was not supported by statutes or case law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>see also id. </em>at 282 (summarizing <em>ratio decidendi </em>in <em>Wade: </em>\u201cTrial counsel\u2019s failure was not a failure to \u2018anticipate\u2019 reversal in the law of accomplice liability, as argued by the defendant, but rather a failure to compare the instruction to the law of accomplice liability, which would have led counsel to <em>Anlauf\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In so holding in <em>Walraven, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s efforts to distinguish <em>Wade </em>either on temporal grounds <em>(viz., </em>that while six years had elapsed between <em>Anlauf </em>and Wade\u2019s criminal trial, the interval between <em>Anlauf </em>and Walraven\u2019s criminal trial was only six months) and on differences in the evidence offered in the respective post-conviction proceedings, including affidavits by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>pertaining to discussions within the criminal defense bar and local practice norms. <em>Id. </em>at 282-84. While acknowledging the defendant\u2019s proposition that, because of the much shorter interval in <em>Walraven, </em>\u201cthe broader criminal defense bar had not yet had time to absorb the impact of <em>Anlauf </em>on the viability of the instruction,\u201d we concluded that that circumstance did not excuse trial counsel\u2019s failure because \u201cnothing prevented counsel from discovering the decision in preparing for a trial heavily dependent on a theory of accomplice liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. We further concluded that, given the controlling legal principles, evidence (of the sort submitted in <em>Wade, </em>but not in <em>Walraven) </em>that before the criminal trial, the criminal defense bar had engaged in listserve discussions of <em>\u201cAnlauf </em>and the instruction\u201d was \u201cnot essential\u201d to the conclusion that failure to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction was unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We return to this case. In opposing summary judgment, petitioner proffered evidence that, when viewed most favorably to his claim, would establish that (1) his criminal trial occurred after <em>Anlauf </em>issued; (2) he was charged with felonies, which, allegedly, he committed jointly with codefendants; (3) one of the state\u2019s theories of liability, with respect to one or more of the charged felonies, was that petitioner was liable as an accomplice because of the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d of other crimes in which he had participated jointly; (4) the criminal trial court gave the uniform accomplice liability \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction; (5) petitioner\u2019s defense counsel did not object to that instruction; and (6) the jury found defendant guilty of all charges. Those facts alone, without any additional evidence, constituted a <em>prima facie </em>showing that, by failing to object to the instruction, petitioner\u2019s criminal defense counsel breached the standard of reasonable professional skill and judgment. <em>See Walraven, </em>277 Or App at 284; <em>Wade, </em>268 Or App at 386-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As noted, the premise of the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was that petitioner had \u201cfail[ed] to present any evidence\u201d that the failure to raise such an objection \u201cwas unreasonable based on the case law existing in 2004.\u201d With respect-\u2014and with full appreciation that the court\u2019s ruling antedated <em>Wade </em>and Walraven\u2014we disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>As described immediately above, petitioner <em>did </em>present such evidence\u2014evidence that was, and is, legally sufficient to support the requisite determination as to the alleged \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of counsel\u2019s performance. Moreover, to the extent the post-conviction court assumed (as defendant repeatedly argued) that, to defeat summary judgment, petitioner was obligated to submit evidence of discussions or practice among other criminal defense attorneys circa 2004, that was incorrect. Rather, given the <em>post-Anlauf </em>timing of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, the nature of the charges against him, and the prosecution\u2019s reliance on a theory of accomplice liability predicated on the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction, additional evidence of that sort was \u201cnot essential\u201d to establish a failure of reasonable professional skill and judgment. <em>Walraven, </em>277 Or App at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In sum, the post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment on the first alternative ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Nor can the post-conviction court\u2019s disposition be affirmed in its entirety on its alternative rationale that petitioner had \u201cfail[ed] to show how he was prejudiced by trial counsel not objecting to the instruction.\u201d As noted, that matter was raised for the first time in defendant\u2019s reply memorandum, supplemented by additional excerpts from the criminal trial transcript.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Upon review of the summary judgment record, including the portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that petitioner proffered, we conclude that when \u201cviewed in a manner most favorable\u201d to petitioner, ORCP 47 C, the record discloses genuine issues of material fact as to whether petitioner was prejudiced with respect to either or both Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment (pertaining to conduct against C), but not as to Count 3 (pertaining to conduct against D), by criminal trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The post-conviction court erred in granting summary judgment against petitioner\u2019s fourth claim in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Judgment on petitioner\u2019s fourth claim reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> In a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, petitioner raises additional assignments of error pertaining to the disposition of some other claims.

In <em>Eklof, </em>we highlighted that temporal distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">\u201c[In <em>Wade, </em>we] distinguished that case from <em>Hale </em>because the underlying criminal trial in <em>Hale </em>was decided before <em>State v.
