For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The historical and procedural facts are undisputed. A Polk County grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with multiple sexual offenses. Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual abuse in the second degree (Counts 4 and 5) and no contest to another count of sexual abuse in the second degree (Count 8). In his sentencing memorandum, defendant argued that, under ORS 137.750, \u201cthe court does not have the authority to deny a defendant eligibility for \u2018reduction in sentence [;] \u2019 [o]nly the Department of Corrections, pursuant to ORS 421.121, has that authority!.]\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument, sentenced defendant to a total of 38 months\u2019 imprisonment, and denied defendant eligibility for \u201creduction in sentence\u201d on each count pursuant to ORS 137.750(1). The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>stated that it was denying a reduction in sentence \u201cbased upon [defendant\u2019s] violation of public trust, that is the trust placed in [defendant] * * * by the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">On appeal, defendant does not challenge the adequacy of the court\u2019s finding that there were substantial and compelling reasons for denying defendant\u2019s eligibility for any form of temporary leave from custody, work release, or program of conditional or supervised release. Rather, defendant reprises the argument that he made to the trial court\u2014that the trial court lacked the statutory authority to make him ineligible for a \u201creduction in sentence\u201d under ORS 137.750(1). Specifically, defendant notes that ORS 137.750(1) requires the sentencing court to order \u201cthat the defendant may be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of * * * reduction in sentence [.] \u201d and \u201cthe second clause of ORS 137.750\u2014after the \u2018unless\u2019 portion of ORS 137.750(1)\u2014does not refer to \u2018reduction in sentence.\u2019\u201d Thus, defendant contends that \u201cthe \u2018plain text\u2019 of ORS 137.750 [only] allows for a court to deny a defendant eligibility for \u2018leave, release or program\u2019\u201d and provides it no \u201cauthority to deny a defendant eligibility for \u2018reduction in sentence.\u2019\u201d Defendant asserts that \u201c[o]nly the Department of Corrections, pursuant to ORS 421.121, has that authority, depending on appropriate institutional behavior [.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The state responds, contending that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s argument has no merit because the list in the \u2018unless\u2019 clause is modified by the term \u2018such\u2019\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018such *** release\u2019 phrase in the last clause effectively reincorporates the preceding \u2018reduction in sentence\u2019 phrase in the opening clause.\u201d The state argues that the \u201cnecessary effect of a \u2018reduction in <em>sentence\u2019\u2014e.g., </em>pursuant to ORS 421.121\u2014is that defendant will be released early on his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The parties\u2019 arguments and the trial court\u2019s ruling present a question of statutory interpretation, which we review for legal error. <em>See State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 256, 971 P2d 879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reviewed for legal error.\u201d). When we interpret a statute, \u201c[w]e ascertain the legislature\u2019s intentions by examining the text of the statute in its context, along with relevant legislative history, and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>necessary, canons of construction.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 75, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (citing <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">We turn to the statutory text of ORS 137.750(1). As previously noted, ORS 137.750(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cWhen a court sentences a defendant to a term of incarceration upon conviction of a crime, the court shall order on the record in open court as part of the sentence imposed that the defendant may be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which the defendant is otherwise eligible at the time of sentencing, unless the court finds on the record in open court substantial and compelling reasons to order that the defendant not be considered for such leave, release or program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In disputes such as this, that center on how the legislature structured a statute, we consider \u201cthe meaning conveyed through the grammar and structure of the relevant provision\u201d to ascertain the statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>State v. Gonzalez-Valenzuela, </em>358 Or 451, 461, 365 P3d 116 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u201cThe \u2018doctrine of the last antecedent\u2019 is a long-recognized grammatical principle used in interpreting the text of statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Webb, </em>324 Or 380, 386, 927 P2d 79 (1996). That doctrine provides that \u201c [r] eferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Another \u201cfamiliar rule of grammar [is] that the word \u2018such\u2019 refers to the last antecedent.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Craddock, </em>228 Or 308, 316-17, 365 P2d 89 (1961). In that context, \u201csuch\u201d can be used as a device \u201cfor recapitulating *** the content of a neighboring expression, often with the effect of reducing grammatical complexity.\u201d Randolph Quirk <em>et al, A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language </em>76 (1985). Additionally, \u201c[ejvidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents * * * may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>324 Or at 386 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Norman J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.33, 270 (6th ed 1992) (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Here, the legislature followed those grammatical rules by using \u201csuch\u201d in the \u201cunless\u201d clause of ORS 137.750 to recapitulate the content of the neighboring expression. There is no indication that the legislature intended to exclude a \u201creduction in sentence\u201d by its use of the referential term \u201csuch.\u201d Moreover, the legislature separated the \u201cunless\u201d clause with a comma, suggesting the intention to have the \u201cunless\u201d clause apply to all antecedents. Thus, \u201csuch leave, release or program,\u201d in this context, refers to all antecedents before the \u201cunless\u201d clause in ORS 137.760 that are set forth as the category of certain programs a defendant may be eligible for, that is, \u201ctemporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release or program of conditional or supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Additionally, as to the fact that the \u201cunless\u201d clause does not specifically mention a reduction in sentence, our case law also points towards the rejection of defendant\u2019s argument that \u201c[o]nly the Department of Corrections, pursuant to ORS 421.121,\u201d has the \u201cauthority to deny a defendant eligibility for \u2018reduction in sentence.\u2019\u201d <em>See Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 100 (\u201cOur analysis of [the statute] is also informed by this court\u2019s prior construction of that statute or its predecessors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">As we have noted, \u201cthe potential benefits described in ORS 137.750 are not entitlements.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>205 Or App 338, 346, 134 P3d 1074, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 245 (2006). Instead, \u201cORS 137.750 requires a sentencing court to order that a defendant may be considered for release, leave, and certain sentencing programs for which the defendant is otherwise eligible unless the court makes a finding on the record that substantial and compelling reasons exist that warrant a contrary result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343 (footnote omitted). \u201cIncluded among such programs * * * [is] \u2018earned-time\u2019 sentence reduction, ORS 421.121 [.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343 n 4; <em>see also State v. Pierce, </em>272 Or App 762, 763, 358 P3d 324, <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 449 (2015) (\u201c\u2018earned time\u2019 is a sentence reduction program or time credit under ORS 421.121\u201d); <em>State v. Ivie, </em>213 Or App 198, 200-01, 159 P3d 1257 (2007) (discussing the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>history of ORS 137.750 and noting that \u201cearned time\u201d is a sentence modification program). In addition, a \u201cbar to sentence modifications, such as an order by the trial court denying [a defendant] consideration under ORS 137.750 for such modifications, * * * deprives [a defendant] of eligibility for a sentence reduction of up to 20 percent under ORS 421.121, among other consequences.\u201d <em>State v. Casiano, </em>214 Or App 509, 519, 166 P3d 599 (2007); <em>see also State v. Baskette, </em>254 Or App 751, 752-53, 295 P3d 177 (2013) (trial court committed plain error by not making findings required under ORS 137.750 to deny defendant eligibility for \u201cearned time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Furthermore, ORS 137.750(2) provides that \u201c[t]he executing or releasing authority may consider the defendant for a program described in subsection (1) of this section only upon order of the sentencing court appearing in the judgment.\u201d <em>See Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 96 (context includes other provisions of the larger section within which the disputed provision appears). ORS 137.750(3)(a) provides, in part, that the \u201c\u2018[executing or releasing authority\u2019 means the Department of Corrections [.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Based on the text and context, we conclude that a reduction in the term of incarceration under ORS 421.121 for \u201cearned time\u201d is a sentence modification program that the sentencing court may make a defendant ineligible for pursuant to ORS 137.750. Consequently, a reduction in a prison term based on \u201cearned time\u201d may only be granted by the Department of Corrections pursuant to ORS 421.121 if the sentencing court specifically orders that the defendant is eligible for such a reduction pursuant to ORS 137.750.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> ORS 137.750(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201cWhen a court sentences a defendant to a term of incarceration upon conviction of a crime, the court shall order on the record in open court as part of the sentence imposed that the defendant may be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which the defendant is otherwise eligible at the time of sentencing, unless the court finds on the record in open court substantial and compelling reasons to order that the defendant not be considered for such leave, release or program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">ORS 421.121(1) (2013) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in ORS 137.635, each inmate sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections for felonies committed on or after November 1,1989, is eligible for a reduction in the term of incarceration for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">\u201c(a) Appropriate institutional behavior, as defined by rule of the Department of Corrections; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">\u201c(b)(A) Participation in the adult basic skills development program described in ORS 421.084; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">\u201c(B) Obtaining a high school diploma, a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, a certificate or a degree from a post-secondary education institution as defined in ORS 337.511 or a journey level certification from a registered apprenticeship program as defined in ORS 660.010. The reduction described in this subparagraph may not exceed a period of 60 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> We also note that the voters of Oregon adopted Article I, section 44(l)(a) of the Oregon Constitution. Ballot Measure 74 (1999). Article I, section 44(l)(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] term of imprisonment imposed by a judge in open court may not be set aside or otherwise not carried out, except as authorized by the sentencing court[.]\u201d The \u201ceffect [of Article I, section 44(l)(a)] is to eliminate reductions for good conduct or other reasons unless authorized by the sentencing court and permitted by law.\u201d Official Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, Special Election, Nov 2,1999, 38. Thus, regardless of ORS 421.121, the Department of Corrections cannot give earned time to a defendant unless a sentencing court orders that a defendant is eligible for such a reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
