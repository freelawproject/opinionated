J.</author>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In 2007, the Oregon International Port of Coos Bay (the Port) began the process of applying to the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) for a permit to dredge part of Coos Bay to create a new multipurpose slip and marine terminal, along with an access channel connecting Coos Bay with that slip. After responding to DSL\u2019s requests for additional information, the Port submitted its completed application in December 2010. The next year, DSL issued a permit authorizing the Port to dredge 1.75 million cubic yards of material from Coos Bay. Specifically, the permit authorized the fill/removal activity of \u201cexcavating the access channel, placing dredge soil in a small non-tidal wetland,\u201d and undertaking mitigation measures. Petitioners\u2019 challenge to that permit led to a contested-case hearing and the parties\u2019 filings of cross-motions for summary determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After further administrative proceedings, the director of DSL issued a final order affirming the fill/removal permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Petitioners seek judicial review of that 2013 final order, challenging the director\u2019s ruling on the cross-motions for summary determination on two grounds. First, petitioners argue that the director erred in concluding that DSL was not required to consider the effects of operating the marine terminal when it evaluated and approved the Port\u2019s application for the fill/removal permit. Second, petitioners argue that the director erred in concluding that DSL\u2019s authority to regulate fill/removal activities in \u201cwaters of the state\u201d did not extend to the upland portions of the proposed construction. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">I. THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">To provide context for the parties\u2019 arguments, we briefly describe the statutory and regulatory framework <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>governing DSL\u2019s authority to issue fill/removal permits as it existed in December 2010, when DSL received the completed permit application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, \u201ca person may not remove any material from the beds or banks of any waters of this state or fill any waters of this state without a permit issued under authority of the Director of the Department of State Lands.\u201d ORS 196.810(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\">The term \u201cwaters of this state\u201d is statutorily defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201call natural waterways, tidal and nontidal bays, intermittent streams, constantly flowing streams, lakes, wetlands, that portion of the Pacific Ocean that is in the boundaries of this state, all other navigable and nonnavigable bodies of water in this state and those portions of the ocean shore, as defined in ORS 390.605, where removal or fill activities are regulated under a state-assumed permit program as provided [by federal law].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">ORS 196.800(14). DSL has adopted a rule that expressly includes estuaries and tidal bays, up to \u201cthe elevation of the highest measured tide,\u201d within its own definition of \u201cwaters of the state.\u201d OAR 141-085-0510(89); OAR 141-085-0515(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Coos Bay is a tidal bay and therefore is, under those definitions, a water of the state. Accordingly, the Port was required to obtain a permit from DSL before either removing any materials from the beds or banks of Coos Bay or filling that body of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In determining whether to issue the Port\u2019s requested fill/removal permit, DSL was required to consider certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>criteria pursuant to ORS 196.825. That statute provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">\u201c(1) The Director of the Department of State Lands shall issue a permit * * * if the director determines that <em>the project </em>described in the application:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201c(a) Is consistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state as specified in ORS 196.600 to 196.905; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201c(b) Would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201c(2) In determining whether to issue a permit, the director shall consider all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201c(a) The public need for the proposed fill or removal and the social, economic or other public benefits likely to result from the proposed fill or removal. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">\u201c(b) The economic cost to the public if the proposed fill or removal is not accomplished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">\u201c(c) The availability of alternatives to the project for which the fill or removal is proposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">\u201c(d) The availability of alternative sites for the proposed fill or removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">\u201c(e) Whether the proposed fill or removal conforms to sound policies of conservation and would not interfere with public health and safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-13\">\u201c(f) Whether the proposed fill or removal is in conformance with existing public uses of the waters and with uses designated for adjacent land in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-14\">\u201c(g) Whether the proposed fill or removal is compatible with the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations for the area where the proposed fill or removal is to take place or can be conditioned on a future local approval to meet this criterion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-15\">\u201c(h) Whether the proposed fill or removal is for stream-bank protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-16\">\u201c(i) Whether the applicant has provided all practicable mitigation to reduce the adverse effects of the proposed fill or removal in the manner set forth in ORS 196.800. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The word \u201cproject\u201d is not defined in ORS chapter 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Pursuant to its general rulemaking authority,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DSL promulgated rules that established regulatory standards for its review of permit applications. <em>See </em>OAR 141-085-0500 to 141-085-0785. DSL\u2019s rules largely echo the statutory criteria announced in ORS 196.825. OAR 141-085-0565(3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Our summary of the pertinent facts reflects the facts as described in the final order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 2007, the Port began seeking DSL\u2019s authorization to conduct removal and fill activities associated with constructing a marine terminal in Coos Bay. The Port\u2019s purpose is to develop \u201ca multi-berth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>multi-purpose shipping facility that will accommodate large vessels.\u201d The Port plans to dredge an access channel to connect a newly constructed slip to the bay. Although the project was initially configured to accommodate shipping of liquefied natural gas (LNG), DSL determined that the access channel and terminal will have independent utility, in that they will \u201cbe able to function regardless of the cargo that is shipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">As part of the required permitting process and under consolidated permitting procedures, the Port used a single application\u2014a Joint Permit Application Form\u2014to apply for authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), under the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act, as well as a permit from DSL under Oregon\u2019s fill/removal law, to \u201cdredge and maintain the access channel, connect the new slip to the access channel, and maintain the slip.\u201d The Port submitted its initial application in 2007, but DSL rejected the Port\u2019s materials as incomplete several times before accepting the Port\u2019s completed application in December 2010.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In its final application, the Port proposed that the construction of the new slip and access channel be completed in two phases\u2014the \u201cfreshwater\u201d phase and the \u201csaltwater\u201d phase\u2014to \u201cminimize impacts on fisheries, reduce the total period of estuary turbidity, and to extend the time available for construction.\u201d The Port described the \u201cbasic concept\u201d as being \u201cto excavate the majority of the proposed slip area * * * and construct most of the in-water structures while maintaining a natural physical barrier between the slip and Coos Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The freshwater phase will involve removing up to 4 million cubic yards of material inland from the shore of Coos Bay, in an upland area above the highest measured tide, to create a 45-foot deep terminal slip for the western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>berth. The Port explained in its application that, during the first phase, \u201c[t]he proposed slip would be excavated and dredged from existing upland. Most construction of the new slip and marine facilities would be conducted behind a berm that would isolate the construction area from the Coos Bay estuary.\u201d The Port described the \u201cberm\u201d as a \u201cnatural physical barrier between the slip and Coos Bay\u201d and further explained that \u201cOld Jordan Cove Road * * * runs along the Coos Bay shoreline and will be kept intact to form the crest of the berm during the entire freshwater phase.\u201d Thus, the freshwater phase will mostly take place on existing uplands behind a 40-foot wide berm that separates the terminal site from Coos Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The saltwater phase of the project will include dredging in the bay to create the access channel and, eventually, removal of the berm \u201cto connect the new slip with the access channel.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Port explained in its final application that the \u201conly construction activities planned within water after berm removal would be some minor dredging, installation of up to eight pilings *** and completion of riprap and bulkhead wall in the area where the berm was removed.\u201d Altogether, the application requested authorization to remove 1.75 million cubic yards of material from the waters of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Port asserted in its application that the freshwater phase \u201cwill include only upland excavation and construction [of a berth] not subject to regulation under * * * [the] Oregon Removal-Fill Statute because the work will not be in a jurisdictional wetland, water of the United States, or water of the State of Oregon.\u201d However, the Port acknowledged that the saltwater phase, which will take place \u201cin waters of the United States and waters of the State,\u201d is subject to the requirements of the fill/removal statute, ORS chapter 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In December 2011, DSL issued the original fill/ removal permit to the Port, which DSL modified later that month to make a minor administrative change not pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>here. The permit authorizes the saltwater phase, including placing up to eight concrete pilings and removing 1.75 million cubic yards of material to construct an access channel to the marine terminal. Significantly, DSL agreed with the Port that, because the freshwater phase is located in an upland area \u201cnot currently part of Coos Bay,\u201d DSL does not have authority over the freshwater phase of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Petitioners requested a contested case hearing on the permit, DSL referred that request to the Office of Administrative Hearings, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) was assigned to conduct the hearing. Petitioners asserted that the permit was flawed for several reasons, including that DSL had not considered the \u201cfuture uses of\u2019 the terminal, \u201cincluding coal export and liquefied natural gas and their effects on the relevant statutory criteria.\u201d Petitioners tied that argument to ORS 196.825, contending that DSL\u2019s duty to consider the effects of the \u201cproject\u201d included an obligation to consider the effects of the proposed terminal\u2019s <em>operation, </em>which DSL had not done. Further, petitioners challenged DSL\u2019s determination that the freshwater phase of construction was not within DSL\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction as a \u2018water of the state.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Before the hearing, the parties filed cross-motions for summary determination as to all the issues raised by petitioners. The ALJ ruled on the cross-motions, granting respondents\u2019 motions and denying petitioners\u2019 motion. The ALJ agreed with the Port that DSL was not required to consider the effects of operating the terminal. The ALJ also concluded that DSL\u2019s determination \u201cthat the dredging conducted behind the berm was not within [DSL\u2019s] jurisdiction was lawful.\u201d Because no issues remained, the ALJ issued a proposed order affirming DSL\u2019s approval of the permit. Petitioners and the Port filed exceptions, and the director issued an amended proposed order in early 2013. Petitioners filed additional exceptions to that amended proposed order, reiterating arguments they had made earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The director issued her final order in 2013, adopting the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions. The director explained that, because the upland area is located above the highest measured tide of Coos Bay and \u201ctidal bays are jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>to the elevation of the highest measured tide,\u201d the upland area is not a water of the state. Accordingly, she concluded, DSL will not have authority over the upland area until after the berm is breached and the newly dug slip fills with water from the bay. The director also rejected petitioners\u2019 contention that DSL erred by not considering the effects associated with operating the proposed terminal. Accordingly, the director \u201cconcur [red] with [the ALJ\u2019s] grants of summary determination\u201d and affirmed the permit issued to the Port. It is the director\u2019s final order that petitioners challenge in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Petitioners\u2019 challenges to the final order raise only legal issues; petitioners do not contest any of the statements of fact on which the order is based. Accordingly, we review for legal error. <em>Smith v. PERB, </em>235 Or App 159, 161, 230 P3d 88 (2010) (reviewing PERB order for legal error when order resulted from grant of summary determination); ORS 183.482(8)(a) (authorizing us to review an order in a contested case to determine if \u201cthe agency has erroneously interpreted, a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">On review, petitioners raise two assignments of error, both challenging the director\u2019s grant of summary determination to respondents and her concomitant denial of summary determination to petitioners. First, petitioners argue that the director erred when she concluded that DSL was not required to consider the effects of the proposed terminal\u2019s operation when determining whether to grant the Port\u2019s application for the fill/removal permit. Second, petitioners argue that the director erred when she concluded that the proposed freshwater phase activities did not fall within DSL\u2019s jurisdiction because the activities would not involve removing material from, or filling, \u201cwaters of the state.\u201d We address those arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>A. <em>The Effects of Operating the Marine Terminal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Petitioners\u2019 first argument is based on ORS 196.825(1), which states that the director shall grant a fill/ removal permit if she determines that \u201cthe project described in the application\u201d would be \u201cconsistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this state\u201d and \u201cnot unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation.\u201d Petitioners contend that the use of the word \u201cproject\u201d in that provision means that DSL was required to consider not only the effects of the fill and removal activities associated with constructing the proposed marine terminal but also the effects of operating that terminal once it is completed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Put succinctly, petitioners assert that \u201cproject\u201d encompasses \u201coperation.\u201d The director rejected that argument in the final order. Because DSL acknowledges that it did not consider the effects of the proposed terminal\u2019s operation when it issued the fill/ removal permit, petitioners conclude that the director erred by approving that permit. Respondents take a different view of ORS 196.825, contending that the term \u201cproject,\u201d as used in that statute, does not include ongoing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Thus, the meaning of the word \u201cproject,\u201d as used in ORS 196.825(1), is central to this dispute. In considering the meaning of that term, our goal is to discern the legislature\u2019s intentions. To do so, we examine the text of the statutes in context, along with relevant legislative history. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 172, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). For the following reasons, we conclude that the term \u201cproject,\u201d as used in ORS 196.825(1), relates to the construction of a proposed development and does not include the effects of operating that development after it is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Our inquiry begins with an examination of the statutory text. As noted, under ORS 196.825(1), issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>a fill/removal permit is conditioned upon a finding that the \u201cproject\u201d meets the statutory goals of protecting, conserving, and making the \u201cbest use\u201d of the state\u2019s waters, and that it would not unreasonably interfere with the state\u2019s \u201cparamount\u201d interest in navigation, fishing, and public recreation. In determining whether to issue a permit under that statute, the director is required to consider nine criteria that are listed in ORS 196.825(2). Only one of those listed criteria is phrased in terms of the \u201cproject.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 196.825(2)(c) (the director should consider \u201c[t]he availability of alternatives to the project for which the fill or removal is proposed\u201d). The remaining criteria are phrased in terms of the characteristics or effect of the \u201cproposed fill or removal.\u201d ORS 196.825(2) (a), (b), (d) - (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Because \u201cproject\u201d is not defined in ORS chapter 196, we first look to its common usage. <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201cproject\u201d both broadly and narrowly as \u201ca specific plan or design,\u201d \u201ca devised or proposed plan,\u201d and \u201can undertaking devised to effect the reclamation or improvement of a particular area of land.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1813 (unabridged ed 2002). Those definitions do not, themselves, strongly suggest either that \u201cproject\u201d encompasses a development\u2019s future operation or that it does not extend so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Greater insight into the legislature\u2019s intention can be found by considering the context in which the term \u201cproject\u201d is used in ORS chapter 196. We explored that context to some extent in <em>Examilotis v. Dept. of State Lands, </em>239 Or App 522, 535, 244 P3d 880 (2010). In that case, we evaluated the relationship between ORS 196.825 (2005) and the pertinent version of DSL\u2019s rules, adopted in 2006. <em>Examilotis, </em>239 Or App at 528. The 2005 version of ORS 196.825 required the director to issue a fill/removal permit if she determined that \u201cthe removal\u201d (rather than \u201cthe project\u201d) would be consistent with the broad statutory goals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ORS 196.825(1), (2) (2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The statute also listed several criteria that, similar to the criteria listed in ORS 196.825(2) (2009), mostly required DSL to analyze effects of the \u201cfill\u201d with a single exception\u2014 one criterion required consideration of the \u201cavailability of alternatives to <em>the project </em>for which the fill is proposed.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ORS 196.825(3) (2005) (emphasis added). One of DSL\u2019s rules set out standards for permit review that \u201cwere substantially similar\u2014but not identical\u2014to\u201d those statutory criteria. <em>Examilotis, </em>239 Or App at 528. Significantly, the rule used the term \u201cthe project\u201d where the analogous statutory criteria referred to \u201cthe proposed fill.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 528-29 (comparing statute to rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">On judicial review, the <em>Examilotis </em>petitioners challenged a DSL decision affirming issuance of a fill/removal permit, asserting that DSL had failed to consider \u201cproject\u201dwide effects, as the agency\u2019s rule then mandated. <em>Id. </em>at 536. DSL argued, first, that the word \u201cproject\u201d in its rule meant nothing more than \u201cfill and removal activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. Alternatively, DSL contended that it simply had not applied any requirements of its rule \u201cthat exceeded the permit criteria set out in ORS 196.825.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We affirmed, concluding that, to the extent that DSL\u2019s rule required it to analyze multiple aspects of the \u201cproject,\u201d the agency would exceed its statutory authority if it applied that rule. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38. We reached that conclusion after construing the word \u201cproject\u201d as used in ORS 196.825 (2005), holding that it must mean something more than the proposed fill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cGiven the separate requirements to consider alternatives to both \u2018the project for which the fill is proposed\u2019 and alternative sites \u2018for the proposed fill,\u2019 it is plain that \u2018project\u2019 means something different from \u2018the proposed fill.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 534. After considering dictionary definitions and other provisions of ORS 196.825 (2005)\u2014particularly those referencing \u201cthe project site\u201d and a \u201cproject plan\u201d\u2014we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that the statutory term \u201cproject\u201d meant \u201cthe development facilitated by the proposed fill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535. Accordingly, we held that the rule \u201cexceeded the agency\u2019s authority because it required DSL to review an application more broadly than would otherwise be required by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. We rejected the challenge to the fill/removal permit, which was premised on an argument that DSL should have\u2014but had not\u2014applied that aspect of the rule in considering the permit application. <em>Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><em>Examilotis </em>is helpful to our resolution of this case in two respects. First, it points to other provisions of ORS chapter 196 as providing context for discerning the meaning of the statutory term \u201cproject.\u201d We undertake a similar analysis below. Second, nothing in the opinion can be read to suggest that \u201cproject\u201d goes beyond project development to ongoing operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Following the lead of <em>Examilotis, </em>we next consider statutory context, including the various subsections of ORS 196.825 as well as other provisions of chapter 196, to determine whether they support, or undermine, petitioners\u2019 contention that \u201cproject\u201d includes ongoing operations of a proposed development. The structure of ORS 196.825 indicates that subsections (1) and (2) are part of the same inquiry. Subsection (1) provides that the director must issue a permit if she \u201cdetermines\u201d that the \u201cproject\u201d is consistent with certain overarching policies, and subsection (2) identifies specific criteria that the director must consider in <em>\u201cdetermining </em>whether to issue that permit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the criteria set forth in subsection (2) require DSL to evaluate both the \u201cproposed fill and removal\u201d and \u201cthe project\u201d (the latter only in the context of considering alternative sites), the general determination clause in ORS 196.825(1) must include the broader of the two terms\u2014\u201cproject\u201d\u2014for consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Thus, we conclude that \u201cproject,\u201d as used in ORS 196.825(1), is meant to encompass the same meaning it has as used in ORS 196.825(2)(c). No reference to ongoing operations is found either in the single criterion listed in ORS 196.825(2) that refers to the \u201cproject\u201d or in any of the other criteria, which refer to \u201cproposed fill and removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>More broadly, none of the other provisions in ORS chapter 196 that use the term \u201cproject\u201d suggest that the legislature intended that term to include ongoing operations of a development. For example, ORS 196.825(11)(b) states that a completed permit application must contain \u201call necessary information for the director to determine whether to issue a permit.\u201d The provision goes on to list what that \u201cnecessary information\u201d must include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">\u201c(A) A map showing the project site with sufficient accuracy to easily locate the removal or fill site;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201c(B) A project plan showing the project site and proposed alterations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201c(C) The fee required under ORS 196.815;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201c(D) Any changes that may be made to the hydraulic characteristics of waters of this state and a plan to minimize or avoid any adverse effects of those changes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u201c(E) If the project may cause substantial adverse effects on aquatic life or aquatic habitat within this state, documentation of existing conditions and resources and identification of the potential impact if the project is completed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">\u201c(F) An analysis of alternatives that evaluates practicable methods to minimize and avoid impacts to waters of this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\u201c(G) If the project is to fill or remove material from wetlands, a wetlands mitigation plan; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">\u201c(H) Any other information that the director deems pertinent and necessary to make an informed decision on whether the application complies with the policy and standards set forth in this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">ORS 196.825(11)(b). If the legislature had intended \u201cproject\u201d to encompass ongoing operations of a planned development, rather than just construction of the development itself, one would expect that the list of information required in a permit application would include at least some mention of operational activities. It does not. To the contrary, sub-paragraph (E) contemplates that \u201cthe project\u201d will at some point be \u201ccompleted,\u201d again indicating that \u201cthe project\u201d refers to the development itself, not to its ongoing operations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Subparagraph (G) also supports an interpretation of \u201cproject\u201d that does not include ongoing operations, as it contemplates that a project may involve nothing more than \u201cto fill or remove material [s]</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Similarly, ORS 196.682(1), which specifies conditions that DSL may put on a permit, requires DSL \u201cto ensure that the project\u201d meets certain design criteria, including being the minimum size necessary and being designed to minimize the need to alter waters of the state. Only one subsection of that statute can reasonably be understood to refer to ongoing operations; it requires DSL to ensure that \u201cthe project\u201d is \u201cdesigned to minimize impacts from implementing the project.\u201d ORS 196.682(1)(d). That provision, too, differentiates between \u201cthe project\u201d itself and the effects of its \u201cimplementation,\u201d perhaps including operations. Finally, ORS 196.805, which sets out the general policy underlying DSLs authority to issue fill/removal permits, reflects a focus on development that necessitates fill and removal activity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It does not reference the effects of operating the development after construction is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The legislative history of ORS 196.825 provides further support for an interpretation of \u201cproject\u201d that does not encompass the ongoing operations of a proposed development. Before 2007, ORS 196.825(1) required the director to issue a permit if she determined \u201cthat the <em>removal </em>described in the application\u201d would \u201cnot be inconsistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the water resources of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>state\u201d and that \u201cthe proposed <em>fill\u201d </em>would not unreasonably interfere with preserving the use of state waters for navigation, fishing, and public recreation. ORS 196.825(1), (2) (2005) (emphases added). As discussed above in conjunction with our review of <em>Examilotis, </em>the criteria then listed for the director\u2019s consideration\u2014with a single exception\u2014 referred exclusively to \u201cthe proposed fill,\u201d explaining, for example, that the director should consider \u201cthe economic cost to the public if the proposed fill is not accomplished.\u201d ORS 196.825(3)(b) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The 2007 legislature consolidated what had been subsections (1) and (2) of ORS 196.825 into subsection (1). In conjunction with that change, the legislature changed the references to \u201cremoval\u201d (in the previous version of subsection (1)) and \u201cfill\u201d (in the old subsection (2)) to \u201cproject.\u201d Or Laws 2007, ch 849, \u00a7 4. The result is that, as petitioners emphasize, ORS 196.825(1) calls for the director to issue a fill/removal permit if she determines that \u201cthe project\u201d meets the overarching goals set out in subsection (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The legislative history of that amendment strongly suggests that the legislature did not mean the change from \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cfill\u201d to \u201cproject,\u201d in ORS 196.825(1), to have any substantive significance. To the contrary, the director testified to the legislature that the amendment was intended to improve readability and consistency, not to substantively alter the statute. Hearing on HB 2105 Before the House Comm on Energy and Env\u2019t, 74th Legis Ass\u2019y (Feb 5, 2007) (Statement of DSL Director Louise Solliday). When asked about the change from \u201cremoval\u201d to \u201cproject,\u201d she responded that it was \u201cpurely\u201d a form-and-style change that was recommended by legislative counsel and that the amended wording reflected the agency\u2019s existing practice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In sum, the text, context, and legislative history of ORS 196.825 reveal that the legislature intended the word \u201cproject,\u201d as used in subsection (1) of the statute, to refer to the development that involves removal or fill activity. It does not, as petitioners argue, encompass the effects of post-construction operation of the development. Accordingly, use of the word \u201cproject\u201d in ORS 196.825(1) does not require DSL to consider post-construction operational effects of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>proposed development when determining whether to issue a fill/removal permit in conjunction with that development. The director did not err when she concluded that DSL was not required to consider ongoing operations of the proposed marine terminal when evaluating the Port\u2019s application for a permit under ORS 196.825. Petitioners\u2019 argument to the contrary presents no basis for reversal of the director\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\">B. <em>The Freshwater Phase of the Project and Removal of the Berm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Petitioners also challenge DSL\u2019s determination that it lacked authority to regulate the freshwater phase of the project, which centered around construction of the new slip and associated facilities. Again, as the permit explained, that slip will \u201cbe excavated and dredged from existing upland\u201d and most of the construction will \u201cbe conducted behind a berm that would isolate the construction area from the Coos Bay estuary.\u201d Although excavation of the slip will begin on dry land, as digging continues below the water table, the Port ultimately will perform \u201cwet excavation.\u201d Finally, after construction of the slip and marine facilities, the berm\u2014 some of which consists of material at or below the highest measured tide of Coos Bay\u2014will be removed to connect the new slip with the access channel constructed as part of the saltwater phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">DSL stated in the permit that, because the freshwater phase involves excavation upland, above the high-tide measurement, it does not require DSL\u2019s authorization. In her final order, the director agreed, concluding that DSL\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the dredging conducted behind the berm was not within its jurisdiction was lawful and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d The director explained, \u201cThe upland area where the proposed slip is to be constructed is not currently part of Coos Bay. It is above the highest measured tide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Petitioners do not dispute that the slip will be excavated behind the berm, in an upland area that is above the highest measured tide of Coos Bay. Nonetheless, they mount several challenges to the director\u2019s conclusion that DSL lacks authority to regulate the freshwater phase of the project. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>begin with petitioners\u2019 assertion that the freshwater activities constituted \u201cchannel relocation\u201d involving the taking of more than 50 cubic yards of material from a water of the state and, therefore, would qualify as \u201c\u2018removal\u2019\u201d activity requiring a permit. <em>See </em>ORS 196.800(12)(b) (defining \u201c\u2018[r]emoval\u2019\u201d to include \u201cmovement by artificial means\u201d of more than 50 cubic yards \u201cof material on or within the bed of such waters [of the state], including channel relocation\u201d). Petitioners assert that, \u201cbecause it effectively reshapes Coos Bay by adding 75 acres of new area, [the upland activity] * * * falls within the definition of channel relocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Petitioners\u2019 argument does not take into account the statutory definition of \u201c\u2018[c]hannel relocation\u2019\u201d as \u201ca change in location of a channel in which a new channel is dug and the flow is diverted from the old channel into a new channel.\u201d ORS 196.800(1), (12)(b). In accordance with the statutory definition\u2019s focus on \u201cflow,\u201d DSL has further defined \u201c \u2018 [c] hannel\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca natural (perennial or intermittent stream) or human made <em>(e.g., </em>drainage ditch) waterway that periodically or continuously contains moving water and has a defined bed and bank that serve to confine the water.\u201d OAR 141-085-0510(11). Coos Bay does not, itself, fit that definition of \u201cchannel,\u201d and petitioners have not identified any flowing waterway that will be diverted by the freshwater-phase activities. Their \u201cchannel relocation\u201d argument presents no basis for reversing the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Petitioners next focus on the \u201cwet excavation\u201d that eventually will occur in the upland area, before the berm is removed. Petitioners point out that, in dredging dirt to create the slip, workers will, at some point, hit the water table and a pool of water will form. Petitioners argue that DSL\u2019s authority therefore extends to the upland site because the wet excavation will result in the type of \u201c[artificially [c]reated *** [p]ond\u201d over which DSL asserts jurisdiction under OAR 141-085-0515(6)(a). However, that rule provides that artificially created ponds <em>\u201care </em>jurisdictional when they <em>are </em>*** [e]qual to or greater than one acre in size[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, for DSL to have jurisdiction, an artificial pond must already exist at the time of permit authorization; that is, the rule does not give DSL authority over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>a pond that has yet to be created. As the director explained in the final order, \u201cthe upland area is not an artificial * * * pond\u201d and, for that reason, \u201cis not subject to [DSL\u2019s] jurisdiction under\u201d OAR 141-085-0515(6). Nor does that rule give the agency authority over ponds <em>as </em>they are being created. As respondents note, \u201c[i]f Petitioners\u2019 proposal were the law, the boundaries of the State\u2019s jurisdiction would shift with every scoop of an excavator if the excavation hit groundwater.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s \u201cartificial pond\u201d argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Finally, petitioners assert that DSL\u2019s fill/removal permit does not include authorization for the Port to remove the berm to connect the bay with the newly constructed upland slip.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, because \u201cthe berm will be removed from the bay side, which is inarguably a water of the state,\u201d petitioners contend that DSL erred when it failed to exercise authority over the berm removal. The Port asserts that berm removal is covered by the permit, arguing that \u201cthe removal of the portion of the berm subject to the DSL\u2019s jurisdiction that will remain standing after the upland excavation is a permitted activity.\u201d We agree with the Port that the fill/removal permit authorizes that portion of the berm removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Port\u2019s permit application itself clearly requested authorization to remove the berm as part of the overall project. The application states that the Port sought a fill/ removal permit to \u201cdredge and maintain the access channel, <em>connect the new slip to the access channel, </em>and maintain the slip.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, the application explained that, \u201c[a]fter construction of the slip and marine facilities, the berm would be removed to connect the new slip with the access channel.\u201d Moreover, the application stated, the \u201cberm would be removed during the approved in-water work period\u201d\u2014that is, as part of the saltwater phase of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Consistent with that application, the approved fill/removal permit described the activity it authorized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cThe removal-fill activity authorized in this permit is excavating the access channel, placing dredge spoil in a small non-tidal wetland and constructing compensatory non-tidal wetland, mudflat and eelgrass mitigation. *** The Port will dredge and maintain the access channel, <em>connect the new slip to the access channel, </em>and maintain the slip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">(Emphasis added.) The action that connects the slip to the access channel is removal of the berm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The director\u2019s final order confirms that the permit authorizes berm removal. In that order, the director described one of the questions posed by petitioners\u2019 challenge to the permit as \u201cwhether removal of the berm after excavation and construction is complete will permanently alter the shoreline of Coos Bay in ways that significantly impact the state\u2019s water resources.\u201d The director explained that \u201c[r]emoving the berm is part of dredging the access channel,\u201d indicating (as did the application) that berm removal is part of the saltwater phase of the project that the permit authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In sum, the permit application, the permit itself, and the final order all establish that the fill/removal activity authorized by the permit includes removal of the berm. Petitioners\u2019 contrary contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">None of petitioners\u2019 challenges to the final order establishes that the director erred in granting summary determination to respondents, in denying petitioners\u2019 motion for summary determination, or in issuing the final order. The director correctly concluded that DSL was not required, under ORS 196.825, to consider the effects of operating the terminal when it evaluated the Port\u2019s application for a fill/ removal permit and issued the requested permit. Nor did the director err in concluding that DSL lacked authority to regulate the freshwater phase of the project. Finally, the final order correctly reflects that the permit authorizes removal of the berm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> The entities challenging DSL\u2019s permit originally included Coos Waterkeeper, Friends of Living Oregon Waters, Greenpeace, and the Sierra Club.

However, after petitioners initiated this judicial-review proceeding, they moved to dismiss Coos Waterkeeper as a party, and the court granted that motion on October 2, 2013. Thus, references to \u201cpetitioners\u201d should be understood to exclude Coos Waterkeeper with respect to events that occurred after that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> The Oregon Legislative Assembly amended ORS chapter 196 in 2011 and 2015.
