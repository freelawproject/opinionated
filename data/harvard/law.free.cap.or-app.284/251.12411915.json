In our judicial review of that order in <em>Walker v. Providence Health System Oregon, </em>254 Or App 676, 298 P3d 38, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013) <em>(Walker III), </em>we disagreed with the board\u2019s reasoning. We held, first, that any penalty that might be due claimant under <em>former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(d) (2009) as a result of employer\u2019s <em>de facto </em>refusal to close claimant\u2019s claim on October 10, 2009 <em>(i.e., </em>within 10 days of claimant\u2019s September 30, 2009, request for closure), must be based on the amount of compensation that claimant would have been entitled to be paid if employer had closed the claim on that date. <em>Walker III, </em>254 Or App at 684. That amount was 35 percent permanent partial disability. <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We further explained, however, that whether employer\u2019s <em>de facto </em>failure to close the claim entitled claimant to any penalty at all also depended on whether employer had a \u201clegitimate doubt\u201d as to its obligation to close the claim. <em>Id. </em>Claimant had argued that employer did not have a legitimate doubt about its duty to close the claim on October 10, 2009, because, by that date, it had \u201csufficient information\u201d on which to base a closure of the claim, as required by ORS 656.268(l)(a) (providing that an employer generally must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>close a claim when the claimant \u201chas become medically stationary and there is sufficient information to determine permanent disability\u201d). The board had not addressed that contention, determining instead that the fact that claimant\u2019s right to payment of compensation had been \u201csuspended\u201d gave employer a legitimate doubt as to its duty to close the claim. We rejected that reasoning, <em>Walker III, </em>254 Or App at 688-89, explaining that <em>former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(b) (2009), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 656.268(5)(d) (2015),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided an \u201cunambiguous mandate\u201d to close a claim within 10 days of a worker\u2019s request for closure (when the claim is otherwise subject to closure under ORS 656.268) and the fact that benefits had been suspended did not alter that obligation. <em>Id. </em>We therefore remanded the case for the hoard to address in the first instance claimant\u2019s contention that employer did not have a legitimate doubt as to its duty to close the claim on October 10, 2009, because it had \u201csufficient information\u201d on which to base claim closure under ORS 656.268(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">On remand, employer contended that, in light of claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the requested independent medical examination, the record lacked sufficient information on October 10, 2009, to determine the extent of claimant\u2019s permanent disability due to the newly accepted conditions of major depression and panic disorder<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, therefore, employer had a legitimate doubt as to its obligation to close the claim. The board disagreed. The board reasoned that, because the medical record on November 5, 2009\u2014the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that employer actually closed the claim\u2014was the same as the medical record on October 10, 2009, employer necessarily had \u201csufficient information\u201d on October 10, 2009, on which to base claim closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On judicial review, employer contends that the board erred. We agree. It is undisputed that the November 5, 2009, closure was an \u201cadministrative\u201d closure (based on the suspension of claimant\u2019s benefits) that had nothing to do with the existence of \u201csufficient information\u201d from which to determine permanent partial disability. <em>See Walker III, </em>254 Or App at 680 (describing November 5, 2009, closure); OAR 436-030-0034 (providing for administrative closure when a claimant does not attend a closing examination or when a suspension order has been issued). Because the November 5, 2009, closure was not based on the board\u2019s consideration of the medical record, the fact that the record on that date happened to be the same as the record that existed on October 10, 2009, has no relevance. Put another way, no inference can be drawn from the November 5 closure that employer had sufficient information from which to determine permanent partial disability on October 10, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that the board erred in basing its assessment of a penalty on that rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We further conclude that, in light of claimant\u2019s continued refusal on October 10, 2009, to attend employer\u2019s lawfully requested independent medical examination (IME), employer did have a legitimate doubt as to its legal obligation to close the claim under ORS 656.268. We addressed this issue in our opinion in <em>Walker IV, </em>decided after the board\u2019s order on remand in this case. In <em>Walker IV, </em>claimant challenged the board\u2019s determination that employer\u2019s refusals to close the claim in response to claimant\u2019s requests for closure on March 25 and March 31, 2009, did not warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>a penalty under <em>former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(d) (2009), because employer\u2019s refusals to close the claim were not unreasonable, in light of claimant\u2019s refusal to attend the requested IME. In <em>Walker IV, </em>we affirmed the board\u2019s order on that issue, holding that employer reasonably requested the IME and that claimant was required to attend. 267 Or App at 103. We said that \u201cemployer was entitled to request the IME in the process of evaluating claimant\u2019s impairment for the purpose of claim closure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 101, and that, in light of claimant\u2019s continued refusal to attend the IME, employer\u2019s failure to respond to requests for closure were not unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 103. The same rationale applies here. Although, as we held in <em>Walker III, </em>the suspension of claimant\u2019s benefits based on her failure to attend the IME did not, itself, provide employer with a legitimate doubt as to its obligation to close the claim under <em>former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(b) (2009), 254 Or App at 689, in light of the fact that employer was statutorily entitled to request an IME before claim closure, we conclude that claimant\u2019s refusal to submit to the IME allowed employer reasonably to conclude that it did not have sufficient information from which to determine claimant\u2019s permanent disability attributable to her compensable injury and provided legitimate doubt as to its obligation to close the claim. We therefore reverse the board\u2019s order assessing a penalty and attorney fees. Our resolution of the petition resolves the issue in claimant\u2019s cross-petition\u2014that she is entitled to an additional attorney fee under ORS 656.382(1)\u2014against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Reversed on petition; affirmed on cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(d) (2009) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cIf an insurer or self-insured employer has closed a claim or refused to close a claim pursuant to this section, if the correctness of that notice of closure or refusal to close is at issue in a hearing on the claim and if a finding is made at the hearing that the notice of closure or refusal to close was not reasonable, a penalty shall be assessed against the insurer or self-insured employer and paid to the worker in amount equal to 25 percent of all compensation determined to be then due the claimant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-5\"> At the relevant time, <em>former </em>ORS 656.268(5)(b) (2009) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cIf the insurer or self-insured employer has not issued a notice of closure, the worker may request closure.
