J.</author>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Defendant pleaded guilty to several charges, including robbery in the first degree, ORS 164.415 (1) (b), and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUV), ORS 164.135(i)(a), arising from an incident in which he acquired the keys to a car after threatening the owner with a knife, and then drove away. He appeals the consequent judgment, asserting that the trial court, in imposing sentence, erred in directing that the sentence for UUV be served consecutively to, rather than concurrently with, the sentence for first-degree robbery. Specifically, defendant contends that the court erred in determining that the UUV was \u201cnot merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious offense but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense[.]\u201d ORS 137.123(5)(a). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court so erred and, consequently, we remand for resentencing but otherwise affirm. ORS 138.222(5)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The circumstances material to our review are simple and undisputed. Defendant approached the victim, Feist, who was putting his laptop into his car, which was parked on a street in Eugene. Defendant first asked Feist for some change, and Feist complied\u2014and then, after a brief interchange, defendant demanded the keys to Feist\u2019s car. Feist initially refused, saying something akin to \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Defendant then pulled out a knife, brandishing it in Feist\u2019s face, and Feist gave defendant his keys. Defendant drove away in Feist\u2019s car, and the following day, while being pursued by a police officer and while under the influence of methamphetamine, defendant \u201cslammed [Feist\u2019s car] into a brick wall outside a Wendy\u2019s\u201d restaurant in Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Defendant was charged by indictment with a variety of crimes, including, as germane to our consideration, first-degree robbery (Count 1) and UUV (Count 2), and subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>pleaded guilty to all charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court imposed the statutorily prescribed presumptive sentence of 90 months\u2019 incarceration and three years\u2019 post-prison supervision on the conviction for first-degree robbery, <em>see </em>ORS 137.700 (2)(a)(Q)\u2014and then, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s objection, imposed a consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentence of 52 months\u2019 incarceration and eight months\u2019 post-prison supervision on the UUV conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, the court determined that, although the first-degree robbery and the UUV both arose from the same \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted course of conduct,\u201d the latter was \u201cnot merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense.\u201d ORS 137.123(5)(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error pertains to the imposition of the consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentence for UUV. In that regard, defendant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cThe facts of this case\u2014in the light most favorable to the court\u2019s finding\u2014were that defendant threatened to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>a knife in order to take a car. Defendant committed the robbery to possess the car and he was able to possess the car only by committing the robbery. Because the robbery and the [UUV] were so intertwined, it cannot be said that one is not incidental to the other or that defendant did not need to commit one crime in order to commit the other. To the contrary, under the facts of this case, defendant could not have committed the [UUV] without committing the robbery; the car owner refused to hand over his keys until defendant threatened to use a knife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">The state remonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">\u201cViewing the charges and the facts from a practical, real world perspective, it is plain that defendant exhibited a willingness to commit more than one offense. Defendant robbed the victim of [his] car keys at knifepoint. He then operated the victim\u2019s vehicle without the victim\u2019s permission. Defendant did not have to commit both offenses. Instead, he demonstrated that he was willing to both rob the victim of his belongings and that he was willing to unlawfully operate the victim\u2019s vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">(Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We agree with defendant. As we once observed, ORS 137.123(5)(a) \u201cis, in many ways, amorphous\u2014and perhaps inscrutable.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>208 Or App 409, 415, 145 P3d 245 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 33 (2007). Nevertheless, if the conditions that statute prescribes for the imposition of consecutive sentences are to have any meaningful practical application, they must, in the absence of explicit evidence of multiple intents, preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences where, as here, the same act (obtaining the victim\u2019s keys through the use of a dangerous weapon), undertaken to achieve the same end (the exercise of control over the victim\u2019s car), concurrently, violated both criminal statutes. In such circumstances, the two criminal offenses are so inextricably intertwined that the consecutively sentenced offense (here, the UUV) is, necessarily, \u201cincidental\u201d to the \u201cmore serious crime\u201d (here, the first-degree robbery) and cannot be deemed \u201can indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense.\u201d ORS 137.123(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Our conclusion derives from the relationship between the uncontroverted facts, with reasonable inferences necessarily viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s findings, see <em>Anderson, </em>208 Or App at 417; see <em>also State v. Traylor, </em>267 Or App 613, 616, 341 P3d 156 (2014), and the predicate criminal statutes. As pertinent here, a person commits first-degree robbery \u201cif the person violates ORS 164.395 and the person * * * [u]ses or attempts to use a dangerous weapon.\u201d ORS 164.415(l)(b). ORS 164.395, in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of robbery in the third degree if in the course of committing or attempting to commit theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle as defined in ORS 164.135 the person uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person with the intent of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201c(a) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to retention thereof immediately after the taking!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">ORS 164.395(l)(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">ORS 164.135 provides that a person commits UUV when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he person takes, operates, exercises control over, rides in or otherwise uses another\u2019s vehicle, boat or aircraft without consent of the owner[.]\u201d ORS 164.135(l)(a). <em>See generally State v. Civil, </em>283 Or App 395, 400-415, 388 P3d 1185 (2017) (comprehensively addressing the statute\u2019s operation). The gravamen of \u201cexercise control over\u201d for purposes of UUV is to \u201cdeprive the rightful possessor of possession or to otherwise interfere with the rightful possessor\u2019s use of the vehicle.\u201d <em>State v. Douthitt, </em>33 Or App 333, 338, 576 P2d 1262 (1978); <em>see also State v. Howell, </em>183 Or App 360, 366-67, 51 P3d 706 (2002) (affirming UUV conviction under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ORS 164.135(l)(a) where the defendant was found sleeping in a car parked in a residential garage with the \u201ctitle to the car in his pocket and spare keys to the car in his lap\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Here, by obtaining the victim\u2019s car keys through the use of a dangerous weapon, defendant concurrently, by a single act, violated both ORS 164.415(l)(b) and ORS 164.135(l)(a). That is, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, defendant (1) in taking the victim\u2019s car keys, \u201cinterferfed] with the rightful possessor\u2019s use of the vehicle,\u201d <em>Douthitt, </em>33 Or App at 338, thus \u201cexercising] control over *** another\u2019s vehicle * * * without consent of the owner,\u201d ORS 164.135(l)(a); and (2) by virtue of his concomitant use of a dangerous weapon to effectuate that taking, concurrently committed first-degree robbery. To be sure, because of defendant\u2019s use of a dangerous weapon, the first-degree robbery was the \u201cmore serious crime,\u201d ORS 137.123(5)(a), but, given that the robbery, which was undertaken to obtain possession of the keys (and, hence, the car), concurrently effectuated the UUV, the violation of ORS 164.135(l)(a) was, on this record, necessarily incidental to the violation of ORS 164.395(l)(a). <em>See State v. Garcia-Mendoza, </em>225 Or App 497, 498, 202 P3d 191 (2009) (consecutive sentences for first-degree assault and attempted aggravated murder imposed under ORS 137.123(5)(a) were improper when both convictions were premised on a single gunshot to a single victim, in the absence of other facts demonstrating that the defendant had a willingness to commit <em>both </em>assault and murder); <em>State v. Warren, </em>168 Or App 1, 6, 5 P3d 1115, <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 412 (2000) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">That conjunction dispositively distinguishes this case from others in which we have sustained the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(5)(a). For example, in <em>State v. Martinez, </em>270 Or App 423, 428, 348 P3d 285, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 640 (2015), where the defendant had been convicted of attempted aggravated murder and first-degree robbery based on conduct arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, we affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>imposition of a consecutive sentence on the robbery conviction, reasoning that, because the defendant had \u201ccommitted robbery <em>before </em>he tried to kill the victim, * * * the actions that constituted the two offenses were distinct both temporally and qualitatively,\u201d rendering the robbery \u201cnot \u2018merely incidental\u2019\u201d to the attempted aggravated murder. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Accord Anderson, </em>208 Or App at 422-23 (affirming imposition of consecutive sentence for second-degree assault committed in the course of a first-degree robbery where, in the totality of the circumstances, the record permitted a reasonable inference that, in assaulting the victim, the defendant consciously elected to do so more severely than necessary to discourage pursuit, evincing the requisite willingness to commit separate offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The state, responding to one of defendant\u2019s propositions, <em>see </em>284 Or App at 404-05, contends that the imposition of a consecutive sentence for UUV was nevertheless permissible because defendant \u201cdid not have to rob the victim of his car keys to be able to use the victim\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Whatever the factual validity of that assertion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it misses the mark legally. That is so not only because the \u201cdid not have to commit\u201d construct is far from categorical, <em>see Anderson, </em>208 Or App at 419,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but also\u2014and far more importantly\u2014 because the ultimate referent for that construct is whether, in committing the \u201cmore serious crime,\u201d the defendant did not have to commit the crime \u201cfor which a consecutive sentence is contemplated.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Traylor, </em>267 Or App at 616 (affirming imposition of consecutive sentence for criminal mischief committed during a burglary: \u201cThe fact that defendant was more destructive of property than he needed to be in the manner in which he conducted the burglary, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>permits the inference that defendant was willing to commit the separate offense of criminal mischief in addition to the offense of burglary.\u201d); <em>Anderson, </em>208 Or App at 422-23 (circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s commission of an assault during a robbery supported reasonable inference that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cevinced a choice, a \u2018willingness,\u2019 to commit second-degree assault in addition to first-degree robbery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Thus, here, the ultimate inquiry is not whether defendant could have committed UUV without committing the robbery\u2014but, instead, whether defendant could have committed the robbery without committing UUV. Given the concurrence of the two crimes committed by the same act, and in the absence of any evidence permitting a reasonable inference of the requisite \u201cmultiple \u2018willingness,\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson, </em>208 Or App at 422, the record is legally insufficient to support a determination that, in these circumstances, defendant was willing to commit UUV in addition to first-degree robbery. <em>See, e.g., Garcia-Mendoza, </em>225 Or App at 498. Accordingly, the trial court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence for UUV (Count 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> ORS 138.222(5)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201cIf the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.
