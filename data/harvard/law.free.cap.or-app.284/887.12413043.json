The relevant facts are procedural and undisputed. After two continuances, one at the request of tenants and one at the request of landlord, the trial was set for March 3 at 9:00 a.m. The court sent written notice of the trial date and time to both parties by mail. The day before trial, the court left telephone messages with the lawyers for both parties reminding them of the upcoming trial. By 9:30 a.m. on the day of trial, neither landlord nor landlord\u2019s lawyer had appeared. The court noted that there was no sign of landlord or landlord\u2019s lawyer, confirmed with tenants that there was nothing in the file indicating a postponement \u201cor anything of that nature,\u201d and entered a judgment dismissing the case and permitting tenants to file for attorney fees. One week later, landlord moved under ORCP 71 B(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to set aside that judgment, arguing that he had missed the trial due to \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d within the meaning of the rule. The evidence in support of that motion consisted entirely of the following paragraphs in a declaration from his lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">\u201c1. I am the attorney representing [landlord] and make this Declaration in support of his Motion to Set Aside Dismissal of Complaint and Judgment and Motion to Reset Trial Date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>[Landlord] was set for a 9:00 am trial on March 3, 2016. [Landlord\u2019s] clerk mistakenly calendared the time at 10:00 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\u201c3. [Landlord] showed up fully prepared for trial at Courtroom 7 at 10:00 am. [Landlord] apologizes to the Court and to [tenants] for this mistake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Based on that evidence, the court granted landlord\u2019s motion and set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Tenants appeal, arguing that landlord\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to demonstrate \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>under ORCP 71 B(1). We agree for the reasons stated in <em>Reeves v. Plett, </em>284 Or App 852, 855-58, 395 P3d 977 (2017), a case also involving landlord. There, we concluded that identical evidence was insufficient to establish that landlord\u2019s failure to appear for a different eviction trial set for the very same date, time, and courtroom as the trial in this case was the product of excusable neglect. Because landlord offered the same evidence to support his motion in this case as he did in <em>Reeves, </em>our conclusion is necessarily the same: \u201cLandlord\u2019s evidence did not suffice to meet his burden of establishing that landlord had a reasonable excuse for failing to appear at trial,\u201d and it was error for the trial court to conclude otherwise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 284 Or App at 858. We therefore reverse and remand for the trial court to reenter the general judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-9\"> ORCP 71 B(1) provides, \u201cOn motion, and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or such party\u2019s legal representative from a judgment for the following reasons: (a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-5\"> Below, it was not entirely clear whether landlord was seeking relief from judgment on the ground of mistake or of excusable neglect, and the court did not specify the basis for its ruling. On appeal, landlord characterizes the court\u2019s ruling as based on excusable neglect. For that reason, we look to the case law discussing excusable neglect, rather than mistake, to analyze the court\u2019s ruling. Regardless, to be entitled relief from judgment on either ground, landlord was required to demonstrate that he had a \u201creasonable excuse for failing * * * to appear or to otherwise defend [his] interests.\u201d <em>Union Lumber Co. v. Miller, </em>360 Or 767, 778, 388 P3d 327 (2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-6\"> In light of our reversal, we do not address tenants\u2019 other assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
