On appeal, claimant raises two assignments of error. First, claimant argues that the EAB erred in concluding that she voluntarily left her employment. Second, claimant argues that the EAB\u2019s order lacked substantial evidence and reason when it concluded that claimant voluntarily left her employment without good cause. We write only to address claimant\u2019s second assignment of error. Claimant argues that the EAB lacked substantial evidence and reason for its conclusion that she lacked good cause for voluntarily leaving her job after the owner of her employer, Salmon River Contractors Inc. (Salmon River), sent her two text messages indicating that the owner believed that claimant and her husband were bad people and stating that he was calling the police on them. We agree that the EAB\u2019s decision lacked substantial reason and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We state the following \u201cfacts from [the] EAB\u2019s findings and the undisputed evidence in the record that is not inconsistent with those findings.\u201d <em>See Campbell v. Employment Dept., </em>245 Or App 573, 575, 263 P3d 1122 (2011) (applying that, standard). Claimant worked for Salmon River from July 22, 2011 to January 20, 2015. In April 2014, Salmon River\u2019s owner discharged claimant\u2019s husband. Around January 13, 2015, claimant learned that the owner of Salmon River had been giving negative references about her husband to her husband\u2019s prospective employers. Specifically, claimant discovered that the owner was telling her husband\u2019s prospective employers that her husband was a drug addict. After claimant learned of the owner\u2019s statements, claimant spoke to a crew leader about those statements, hoping that he could help mediate the conflict between claimant and the owner. The crew leader never resolved the conflict, and, despite the crew leader\u2019s failure, claimant never discussed the owner\u2019s statements with the owner directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Claimant began experiencing additional stress at work as a result of her knowledge of the owner\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>about her husband. That stress caused claimant migraine headaches. Claimant left work early on January 20 because of one of those headaches. Claimant never returned to work after she left on January 20. Before January 21, pursuant to her employer\u2019s policy, claimant always contacted Salmon River\u2019s owner directly when she would be late or absent from work. However, from January 21 through January 24, claimant did not contact the owner despite numerous text and telephone messages that the owner had left her. Instead, claimant spoke every day from January 21 to January 24 with the crew leader who she hoped would mediate the dispute. Claimant did not tell the crew leader or anyone else at Salmon River when she was planning to return to work. Instead, claimant and the crew leader spoke about her dissatisfaction with the owner. After each phone call, the crew leader told the owner that he did not know if claimant would return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">On January 24, Salmon River\u2019s owner sent claimant two text messages. The first text message stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">\u201cYou and me can talk all the shit you want, but I\u2019m still 36 years old with a multi-million dollar company and you\u2019re not. Thanks so much for the sabotage you created when I\u2019ve done nothing but help you [and your husband]. You are bad people, full of jealousy. It\u2019s sad. Thank you both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The second text message stated, \u201cI need these files back in my office, and the rest of my files. I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant was unwilling to return to work after she received those text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">After January 24, 2015, claimant filed for unemployment. On April 27, 2015, the Oregon Employment Department served notice of an administrative decision on claimant that concluded that claimant voluntarily left work without good cause and, as a result, that claimant was denied unemployment benefits. Claimant filed a timely request for a hearing. After failing to appear at the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>hearing, claimant appeared and testified at a second hearing, as did Salmon River\u2019s owner. Following the second hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed the decision of the department, and claimant appealed to the EAB, which affirmed the AL J\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">In the relevant part of its decision, the EAB stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cClaimant quit her job because she was upset about the negative statements the owner made about her husband to prospective employers and about her and her husband in the text messages he sent her on January 24, 2015. Claimant did not show that the statements created a situation of such gravity that she had no reasonable alternative but to leave work when she did. Claimant had the reasonable option of attempting to discuss her concerns with the owner. Before he sent the text messages to claimant on January 24, the owner had left claimant several telephone and text messages. There is no evidence to show the telephone or text messages from the owner before January 24 were hostile in tone. Claimant did not return the messages. In the absence of any attempt by claimant to speak to the owner regarding her concerns, claimant failed to show that doing so was a futile act. Nor did claimant show that the owner\u2019s statements about her husband were false, or that the statements were otherwise so offensive that she had no reasonable alternative but to quit when she did. Nor did claimant show that, despite her migraines, she had to quit work immediately to preserve her health.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">(Internal citation omitted.) Claimant appealed the decision. On appeal, she reasserts to us her argument that Salmon River\u2019s owner\u2019s negative statements about her husband, combined with the owner\u2019s January 24 text messages indicating that the owner believed claimant and her husband were \u201cbad people\u201d and that he was going to call the police, constituted good cause for voluntarily leaving Salmon River. More specifically, claimant asserts that the EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason because, in contrast to the EAB\u2019s finding otherwise, \u201c[a] reasonable and prudent person would think that talking to their employer after receiving messages [like the ones the owner sent her] would be a futile act.\u201d Neither the department nor Salmon River filed a brief on judicial review. For the reasons stated below, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>with claimant that the EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We review the EAB\u2019s decision according to the standard provided in ORS 183.482(8)(c). \u201c\u2018That standard requires that the board\u2019s findings of fact be supported by substantial evidence and that its conclusions be supported by substantial reason, <em>i.e., </em>its conclusions must reasonably follow from the facts found.\u2019\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>245 Or App at 579 (quoting <em>Simpson v. Board of Parole, </em>237 Or App 661, 663, 241 P3d 347 (2010)). When reviewing for substantial evidence and reason, our role is only \u201cto determine whether [the] record, viewed as a whole, is capable of being read as <em>the agency </em>read it.\u201d <em>Pullam v. Employment Dept., </em>238 Or App 60, 64, 243 P3d 71 (2010) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">An individual is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if the individual \u201c[v]oluntarily [leaves] work without good cause.\u201d ORS 657.176(2)(c). Under OAR 471-030-0038(4), \u201c[g]ood cause for voluntarily leaving work under ORS 657.176(2)(c) is such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work.\u201d \u2018\u201c[G]ood cause\u2019 is \u2018an objective standard that asks whether a reasonable and prudent person would consider the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u2019\u201d <em>Early v. Employment Dept., </em>274 Or App 321, 326, 360 P3d 725 (2015) (quoting <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept., </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Here, the EAB concluded that claimant lacked good cause for leaving work because \u201c[c]laimant had the reasonable option of attempting to discuss her concerns with the owner.\u201d The EAB based that conclusion solely on its determination that \u201cclaimant failed to show that [discussing her concerns with the owner] was a futile act\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no evidence to show [that] the telephone or text messages from the owner <em>before </em>January 24 were hostile in tone\u201d and \u201c[c]laimant did not return [those] messages.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason because the EAB failed to consider whether claimant had a \u201creasonable alternative[]\u201d to voluntarily leaving work <em>\u201cat the time </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>she left work.\" Constantine v. Employment Dept., </em>200 Or App 677, 683, 117 P3d 279 (2005) (emphasis added). Had the EAB reached that issue, it would have been obligated to address whether the owner\u2019s January 24 text messages \u201cpresent [ed] the issue of whether a discussion of reasonable alternatives to leaving work\u201d with her employer \u201cwould have been useless.\u201d <em>Westrope v. Employment Dept., </em>144 Or App 163, 170, 925 P2d 587 (1996). The EAB did not consider that question either. Because the EAB failed to address both questions, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">As we have previously held, when determining whether a claimant had a reasonable alternative to leaving work, the EAB must decide whether that reasonable alternative existed <em>\u201cat the time she left work!\u2019 Constantine, </em>200 Or App at 683 (emphasis added). A claimant leaves work on \u201cthe date [that] the employer-employee relationship is severed.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(l)(a). Here, although the EAB never made an explicit finding on the exact date claimant left work, implicit in its determination that claimant quit in part because she was upset about the statements the owner made \u201cabout her and her husband <em>in the text messages he sent her on January 24\u201d </em>is the conclusion that claimant quit on or after January 24. (Emphasis added.) Thus, when considering whether claimant had a reasonable alternative to leaving work, the EAB had to determine that its proposed alternative existed after claimant received the owner\u2019s messages on January 24. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Instead, the EAB\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[claimant had the reasonable option of attempting to discuss her concerns with the owner\u201d was solely based upon claimant\u2019s failure (1) to reach out to the owner to discuss the negative statements that he had made about her husband <em>before </em>January 24 and (2) to respond to the owner\u2019s text and telephone messages before that date. At that time, the owner\u2019s interactions with claimant were not hostile. The hostile nature of the owner\u2019s text messages on January 24, which threatened claimant with police action, marked a substantial change in claimant and the owner\u2019s employee-employer relationship and, as the EAB recognized, precipitated claimant\u2019s decision to quit, at least in part. By basing its conclusion on the owner\u2019s and claimant\u2019s actions before January 24, the EAB ignored the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>severe nature of the January 24 messages and, thus, failed to address whether claimant had a reasonable alternative to quitting <em>\u201cat the time she left work? </em>Consequently, because of that failure, the EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Even had the EAB properly considered whether claimant had a reasonable alternative to quitting \u201cat the time she left work,\u201d the EAB would have been obligated to consider the independent effect of the owner\u2019s January 24 text messages on its conclusion that \u201cclaimant failed to show that [discussing her concerns with the owner] was a futile act.\u201d The EAB also failed to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">When a record \u201cpresent [s] the issue of whether a discussion of reasonable alternatives to leaving work\u201d with the employer \u201cwould have been useless,\u201d the EAB \u201cmust *** address that question.\u201d <em>Westrope, </em>144 Or App at 170. For example, in <em>Nielsen v. Employment Dept., </em>263 Or App 274, 278, 328 P3d 707 (2014), we held that the EAB erred in concluding that the claimant could have complained to her employer about unpaid wages as a reasonable alternative to leaving work where the record indicated that \u201cit would have been useless or even dangerous * * * to do so.\u201d We noted that the \u201cuncontested evidence demonstrate [d] that [the] employer was unwilling to pay overtime to workers who complained about their pay\u201d and that the claimant had witnessed former staff members get into \u201cphysical brawl [s]\u201d with the owner over that issue. <em>Id. </em>As a result, we reversed the EAB\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Similarly, in <em>Strutz v. Employment Dept., </em>247 Or App 439, 443, 270 P3d 357 (2011), we held that the EAB\u2019s conclusion that the claimant \u201ccould have raised his concerns [with his employer\u2019s failure to give its customers\u2019 credit for their expired products] directly with [his supervisor]\u201d lacked substantial reason because the EAB \u201cfail[ed] to explain * * * what difference it would have made for [the] claimant to raise his concerns with his superiors\u201d when his supervisor had \u201caccompanied [the] claimant on his delivery route and reaffirmed [the] employer\u2019s [questionable] policy.\u201d Consequently, because the EAB failed to address whether its \u201creasonable alternative\u201d would have been useless, we reversed and remanded the EAB\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>We recognize that here, unlike in <em>Westrope, Nielsen, </em>and <em>Strutz, </em>the EAB did conclude that \u201cclaimant failed to show that [discussing her concerns with the owner] was a futile act.\u201d However, as we discussed above, the EAB erroneously based that conclusion solely upon the owner\u2019s and claimant\u2019s actions <em>before </em>claimant received the January 24 text messages rather than on their actions \u201cat the time [claimant] left work.\u201d Thus, the EAB\u2019s futility conclusion can only be read as applying <em>before </em>claimant received the owner\u2019s January 24 messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The owner\u2019s statements in the January 24 text messages, like the actions of the employer in <em>Nielsen </em>and the supervisor in <em>Strutz </em>and unlike the owner\u2019s previous messages to claimant, \u201cpresent the issue of whether a discussion of reasonable alternatives to leaving work\u201d with the employer \u201cwould have been useless.\u201d <em>Westrope, </em>144 Or App at 170. As we noted, the January 24 text messages reflect a drastic change in claimant and the owner\u2019s relationship. In contrast to the owner\u2019s previous communications, the owner\u2019s January 24 text messages were \u201chostile in tone.\u201d In them, the owner both called claimant and her husband \u201cbad people\u201d and told claimant that he was calling the police on her. In fact, as the EAB recognized, those final messages, at least in part, brought about claimant\u2019s decision to quit. Due to the severe and threatening nature of those messages and their effect on claimant, the EAB was obligated to discuss the effect of those messages on its conclusion that \u201cclaimant failed to show that [discussing her concerns with the owner] was a futile act.\u201d The EAB did not do that. Therefore, because the EAB failed to address that issue, the EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In sum, the EAB\u2019s decision lacks substantial reason because the EAB both failed to consider whether claimant had a \u201creasonable alternative\u201d to voluntarily leaving work <em>\u201cat the time she left work\u201d </em>and failed to take into consideration the independent effect of the owner\u2019s January 24 text messages on its conclusion that \u201cclaimant failed to show that [discussing her concerns with the owner] was a futile act.\u201d As a result, we must reverse and remand the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> Notably, that text message is the only evidence in the record that claimant had any files. When the ALJ asked claimant if she knew what files the owner was referring to in his text message, she stated, \u201cNo.\u201d The owner testified at the hearing, but he never discussed the files, and neither the ALJ nor claimant asked him about the files.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
