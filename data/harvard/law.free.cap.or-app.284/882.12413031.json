The petition asserted a number of different claims for relief, some of which were alleged through petitioner\u2019s appointed counsel, and others which were alleged <em>pro se. </em>The post-conviction court denied relief on the merits on the claims asserted through counsel, but declined to consider the <em>pro se </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On appeal, petitioner has filed two briefs: one through counsel and one <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief. In the brief submitted through counsel, petitioner assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claims. Petitioner contends that, under <em>Church v. Gladden, </em>244 Or 308, 417 P2d 993 (1966), the post-conviction court was required to consider his <em>pro se </em>claims and make a discretionary decision whether to direct petitioner\u2019s attorney to assert those claims. Petitioner further contends that the post-conviction court did not, in fact, make the required discretionary determination and, for that reason, reversal is required. In response, the state<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argues that <em>Johnson v. Premo, </em>355 Or 866, 333 P3d 288 (2014), demonstrates that petitioner\u2019s argument is predicated on a misreading of <em>Church, </em>and it fails for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">We agree with the state. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that <em>\u201cChurch </em>says no more than this: If a post-conviction petitioner\u2019s attorney fails to assert a ground for relief, the petitioner must bring that fact to the attention of the court to avoid the effect of ORS 138.550(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877. As we understand <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>clarification of <em>Church, Church </em>did not require the post-conviction court to respond to petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claims by making the discretionary determination advocated by petitioner or to consider those claims on their merits. Rather, <em>Church </em>means simply that, to the extent the post-conviction court refused to consider those claims because they were not asserted through counsel, ORS 138.550(3) will not bar petitioner from pursuing them in a subsequent petition because he has followed <em>Church\u2019s </em>directive by bringing those claims to the attention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>post-conviction court below in this proceeding. As a result, the post-conviction court committed no error in its disposition of petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We reject without written discussion the additional claims of error asserted in petitioner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\"> The state is the named defendant on the petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
