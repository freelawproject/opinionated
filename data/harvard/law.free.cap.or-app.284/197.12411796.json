J.</author>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Defendant appeals his judgment of conviction of two counts of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, and four counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427. He raises three assignments of error, all of which concern the trial court\u2019s exclusion of portions of testimony from defendant\u2019s expert witness, a neuropsychologist, who testified about what he believed to be the flaws of the investigatory interview of the five-year-old victim and about the developmental mental functions of young children. As to each of defendant\u2019s challenges, we conclude that the trial court did not reversibly err, either based on the merits or because defendant did not preserve the error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We begin by providing a general background of the relevant facts and procedural history and, to provide context for defendant\u2019s challenges, the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding what it determined to be admissible expert witness testimony. As to the excluded portions of the neuro-psychologist\u2019s testimony, we address in turn each ruling and its procedural posture as we discuss defendant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The five-year-old victim told her father\u2019s fian-c\u00e9e that defendant had touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d The victim was staying with her father in Medford when she reported the abuse but she also lived with her mother in a home in Brookings nearby where defendant lived. When the victim\u2019s father learned what she had reported to his fianc\u00e9e, he questioned the victim about it, and the victim likewise reported that defendant had touched her \u201cprivates\u201d but that she had not touched defendant\u2019s \u201cprivates.\u201d In a later conversation, however, the victim acknowledged that she had touched defendant\u2019s \u201cprivates.\u201d The victim\u2019s father reported those statements by telephone to Lee, an Oregon State Police (OSP) detective, who then scheduled a forensic interview. Two days later, the victim\u2019s father brought her to Grants Pass to be interviewed by Harris, another OSP detective. We need not recount the specific details of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>interview, which was videotaped, but suffice it to say, the victim recounted the abuse which constituted the basis of the charges against defendant and there were some inconsistencies in her account of the abuse. When Lee and Harris later interviewed defendant, he denied the allegations of abuse and sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Before trial on the six charges on which he was ultimately convicted, defendant indicated that he wanted to present as a witness Dr. Stanulis, a neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist. In a letter report, Stanulis wrote that he had reviewed the videotaped interview of the victim and other investigation materials. Stanulis noted that the case lacked physical evidence of abuse or third party witnesses to the abuse and that he believed that \u201c[e]vidence in a case like this is in the form of memory.\u201d Further, he stated that \u201cthe most frequent cause of false allegations is not because of lying, but rather the result of suggestibility which can produce false confabulated * * * \u2018memory\u2019 of abuse\u201d and that he would \u201ctestify to how 5 year old brains are immature and that memory function at this age is unreliable.\u201d In addition to the issue of memory, he wrote, among other things, that \u201c5 year olds are also prone to fantasize and not know the difference between real and make-believe.\u201d In support of his proposition that young children have inaccurate recall, he cited an unnamed study which indicated that \u201cin five year olds the accuracy of their recall for events is poor (about a third of an event is recalled accurately while 2/3 is inaccurately recalled\u201d and \u201ca significant percentage (7/30) \u2018recalled\u2019 abuse that did not occur during a videotaped interaction with a male.\u201d Stanulis also remarked that he would testify to the manner in which the victim had been questioned and \u201cto what extent that methodology is sound or likely to create false memory.\u201d Stanulis specifically noted that his testimony would be \u201cdone without vouching or commenting on credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The state moved for a hearing under OEC 104 to determine the admissibility of Stanulis\u2019s testimony under the standards for scientific evidence established by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(the <em>Brown </em>hearing).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion and, after the close of the state\u2019s presentation of its evidence, it conducted the requested <em>Brown </em>hearing. During the hearing, Stanulis explained much of what he had set out in his report, and the trial court ruled that certain parts of what Stanulis had intended to testify about were not admissible, which we discuss later. The court, however, allowed the following as scientific evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\">\u2022 About the interview, the court ruled that defendant could \u201cinquire [of Stanulis] as to what the guidelines say.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] [Defendant] can inquire as to what [Stanulis] sees was done here, that in his view should have been done differently\u201d and that \u201cin the interview process, as you have, the guidelines require the interviewer to look at other possibilities or [an alternative explanation for why a child alleged abuse].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">\u2022 The court allowed that Stanulis \u201cmay testify that children sometimes might not remember events correctly, that they might confabulate, and that they might fantasize, and that they might tell a story that sounds plausible, even though it is\u2014even though there might be some incorrect information or something along those lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u2022 The court ruled that Stanulis could testify that \u201cfive year olds are prone to fantasize and not know the difference between real and make-believe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u2022 The court allowed this statement from Stanulis\u2019s report\u2014 \u201c[I]n spite of poor accuracy, [five-year-olds] can and do relate plausible events that may appear accurate when, in fact, the recall is very poor.\u201d The court warned, however, that \u201ccare must be taken to not suggest or imply that that\u2019s a reference to this specific case or this specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>witness\u201d and, as a general proposition, \u201c[Stanulis] can testify that there have been instances where children have recalled abuse which did not occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-3\">\u2022 The court permitted Stanulis to opine that there \u201cis an alternative explanation for the child witnesses\u2014or there can be alternative explanations for children who allege sexual abuse. He\u2019s not going to say in this case there\u2019s an alternative explanation, but just that in general there can be, and that\u2019s a legitimate subject for an expert who\u2019s a psychologist to testify about.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">At trial, the state played the video of the victim\u2019s forensic interview and, afterwards, the victim testified. Then six years old, she recalled that she lived in Brookings for a period of time and indicated that she recognized defendant and that he had lived in the Brookings house. Although she remembered being interviewed by Harris, she neither recalled any of the abuse nor remembered making any of the statements she had made in the forensic interview. When asked if she told Harris the truth, she replied that she had. Defendant testified, again denying that he had abused the victim. Stanulis testified, although to much less than he had at the <em>Brown </em>hearing. Several times during his testimony, the trial court ruled that Stanulis\u2019s statements were inadmissible; defendant challenges on appeal some of those rulings and some of the rulings made during the <em>Brown </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Scientific testimony is admissible if it is (1) relevant under OEC 401; (2) of some assistance to the trier of fact under OEC 702; and (3) under OEC 403, its probative value is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or jury confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying those evidentiary rules, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>court determines \u201c\u2018whether scientific evidence is probative under OEC 401\u201d\u2019 and conducts the \u201c\u2018relevancy and prejudice analysis implicated in OEC 702\u215b helpfulness standard!.]\u201d\u2019 <em>Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 302, 14 P3d 596 (2000) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 417); <em>see also Brown, </em>297 Or at 409 (a court must \u201cidentify and evaluate the probative value of the evidence, consider how it might impair rather than help the factfinder, and decide whether truthfinding is better served by exclusion or admission\u201d). The court considers a number of factors as guidelines when determining the relevance or probative value of proffered scientific evidence under OEC 401 and OEC 702.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 303-04; <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 417. The \u201coverarching subject of this multifactor, flexible inquiry is the scientific validity\u2014 and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability\u2014of the principles that underlie a proposed submission!.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 305 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>It is the burden of the party offering the scientific evidence\u2014here, defendant\u2014to establish that the evidence is scientifically valid. <em>State v. Perry, </em>347 Or 110, 122, 218 P3d 95 (2009). \u201cThat is, the party offering the scientific evidence must establish that the evidence \u2018possesses sufficient indicia of scientific validity to be helpful to the jury under OEC 702.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Dulfu, </em>282 Or App 209, 218, 386 P3d 85, 91 (2016) (quoting <em>State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>352 Or 790, 801, 293 P3d 1011 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Also implicated in the trial court\u2019s rulings is the prohibition against commenting on the credibility of a witness. That is, a witness is prohibited from commenting directly on whether another witness is testifying truthfully or whether another witness\u2019s prior statement was truthful. <em>State v. Keller, </em>315 Or 273, 284-85, 844 P2d 195 (1993); <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 437-38, 657 P2d 1215 (1983). However, the \u201cjury\u2019s function is not impinged upon when expert testimony does no more than provide jurors with useful, nonconclusive information from which <em>inferences </em>as to credibility <em>may </em>be drawn.\u201d <em>State v. Remme, </em>173 Or App 546, 562, 23 P3d 374 (2001) (observing that it was permissible to allow a witness to provide the jury with possible reasons for the victim\u2019s behavior) (emphases in original). With that legal framework in mind, we turn to defendant\u2019s claims of error in which he contends that the trial court erred in excluding certain portions of Stanulis\u2019s testimony or proposed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A. <em>\u201cConfusion between fantasy and reality\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error challenges the court\u2019s ruling which sustained the state\u2019s objection to Stanulis\u2019s testimony, italicized as follows, during the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u201c[DEFENDANT]: All right. Doctor, what can you tell us about a five year old\u2019s brain and memory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\">\u201c[STANULIS]: Well, it\u2019s still in the process of maturing, so it still has issues. The memory systems, language systems, still concrete thinking, it\u2019s still a relatively immature brain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Okay. The development of that brain at five years old generally, what\u2014what aspects does it have that adult\u2014what aspects does it not have that an adult might have generally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201c[STATE]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201c[STANULIS]: <em>Okay. A child\u2019s brain, the memory systems are still developing. You see concrete thinking. You see suggestibility. You see confusion between fantasy and reality.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201c[STATE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Stop. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Yes, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">In defendant\u2019s view, it was error for the court to exclude Stanulis\u2019s opinion that a child\u2019s memory systems are still developing and that children exhibit concrete thinking, suggestability, and confusion between fantasy and reality because those opinions are scientifically valid. The state responds by asserting that defendant misreads the court\u2019s ruling. In the state\u2019s view, the ruling is much narrower when viewed in context. That is, the state asserts that Stanulis\u2019s answer was drifting toward being nonresponsive. The state points out that, several times during the <em>Brown </em>hearing, the court admonished Stanulis for making conclusory statements and failing to make sure that his words \u201cmean what [he is] trying to say.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Thus, the state posits that the court was making a ruling regarding the conclusory nature of Stanulis\u2019s statement that, in children, \u201cYou see confusion between fantasy and reality.\u201d We agree with the state for several reasons. First, the state objected immediately after that statement. <em>Cf. State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 138, 970 P2d 215 (1998) (\u201cTimeliness, in this context, as in almost any context in which the admissibility of evidence is at issue, means at or before the time that the evidence is offered to the jury.\u201d). Second, the court had forewarned Stanulis about drifting into absolutes, and Stanulis statement that children exhibit \u201cconfusion between fantasy and reality\u201d can be fairly understood as a conclusory statement of the kind that Stanulis had been admonished to avoid. Third, the trial court previously had permitted Stanulis to testify that \u201cfive year olds are <em>prone </em>to fantasize and not know the difference between real and make-believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In context, we understand the court to have ruled that Stanulis\u2019s statement\u2014stating in a conclusory fashion without qualification that children confuse reality and fantasy\u2014exceeded the scope of permissible opinion testimony. Defendant neither challenged the scope of the court\u2019s ruling at the <em>Brown </em>hearing that Stanulis could testify that children are <em>prone </em>to confusing the difference between real and make-believe nor contested the trial court\u2019s admonitions that Stanulis could not opine in absolute terms. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>defendant did not seek to clarify the court\u2019s ruling by pointing out that the court had ruled previously that Stanulis was allowed to testify to some extent about children\u2019s ability to distinguish reality from fantasy. Accordingly, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">B. \u201cReliable\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, he asserts that the court erred when it excluded Stanulis\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s interview, specifically, about the possible consequences of the manner in which the questioning was conducted, and the failure to develop background information to establish the victim\u2019s developmental level and familiarity with sexual terminology. At the <em>Brown </em>hearing, in response to questions about the deficiencies of the interview, Stanulis testified that, in a typical CARES interview,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in accordance with the <em>Oregon Interview Guidelines, </em>the interviewer asks the child\u2019s parents questions about how the child is doing at school, where the child is developmentally, whether there are psychiatric problems, the child\u2019s understanding of what body parts are called and how the child describes such concepts as \u201cin,\u201d \u201cout,\u201d \u201con top,\u201d or \u201cin between.\u201d In Stanulis\u2019s opinion, those questions are ordinarily asked in order to ensure that the child is at a \u201cgood developmental level\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s not a language problem\u201d that might interfere with the child\u2019s ability to understand the interviewer\u2019s questions. Stanulis also noted that, in the actual interview of the victim, he had concerns about the victim\u2019s ability to understand Harris\u2019s questions, pointing to one point in the interview when the victim answered \u201cBlue\u201d when asked about the color of Harris\u2019s house, even though she had no way of knowing the answer to that question, and another point where there was confusion on the victim\u2019s part about her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">When asked what Harris was attempting to do in asking those questions in the forensic interview of the victim, Stanulis responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cWhat obviously she\u2019s\u2014[Harris] has information in the first three or four pages that this child is not understanding what she\u2019s trying to teach. So you go back to what\u2014the original first part of what you\u2019re doing in the interview is an assessment of the child\u2019s development, so this means you have to do more assessment before you go off and see what is the problem here. Is this a child who\u2019s just too young and there isn\u2019t a fix, or is it how I\u2019m answering the\u2014asking the questions? So it requires further assessment of how come I\u2019m not teaching the child. Is it me asking the questions, that I\u2019m not getting how concrete this child is at this age? Is it that this child\u2014I don\u2019t still have enough handle on it. I haven\u2019t done a good enough job yet of understanding the language development and the developmental level of this child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: All right. Does this then\u2014I think you testified, does it create problems further in the interview then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201c[STANULIS]: Well, yes, because you haven\u2019t established if this child is reliable, okay, is competent, is able to answer your questions, and whether that\u2019s a function of the interviewer or you\u2019re just asking the child to do something beyond their developmental level, that\u2019s what you have to assess before you move on into important stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: And so that assessment needs to be done under the guidelines?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201c[STANULIS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Okay. Go on to the next issue you see about the techniques of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Hold on. While we\u2019re on this subject, let\u2019s make sure that I don\u2019t forget. <em>The doctor just testified that it has not been established that the child is reliable. That crosses the line into a comment on the credibility of the child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Again, <em>the comment from the doctor that it has not been established that the child is reliable crosses the line into a comment on the child\u2019s credibility, and that will not be permitted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In addition to that ruling during the <em>Brown </em>hearing, defendant asserts that that the court \u201cbroadly applied\u201d that ruling when, before the jury, defendant asked Stanulis whether he had any concerns about the interview, specifically, whether the victim \u201cis able to distinguish between\u2014 about truth.\u201d The court sustained the state\u2019s objection, explaining that Stanulis was not allowed to \u201ctestify about the credibility of the child witness. He can\u2019t offer an opinion about whether the child is credible or not or not remember something or not. That\u2019s purely within the province of the jury.\u201d In response, defendant withdrew his question.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Defendant asserts on appeal that Stanulis\u2019s opinion that it is the best practice for an interviewer to assess whether the interviewee can reliably answer questions is not a comment on credibility. Rather, citing <em>Remme </em>and <em>State v. Romero, </em>191 Or App 164, 81 P3d 714 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 248 (2004), defendant argues that Stanulis\u2019s concern about Harris\u2019s failure to establish the reliability of the victim\u2019s answers to Harris\u2019s questions was admissible evidence that the jury could have used to draw inferences about the victim\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In <em>Remme, </em>we considered the admissibility of several witness statements that offered possible explanations for why a child abuse victim gave inconsistent reports of the abuse. 173 Or App at 562. As noted, in view of Supreme Court case law, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cexpert testimony must assist, not supplant, the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility. The jury\u2019s function is not impinged upon when expert testimony does no more than provide jurors with useful, nonconclusive information from which <em>inferences </em>as to credibility <em>may </em>be drawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Middleton, State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, 756 P2d 620 (1988), and Keller) (emphases in original). Likewise, in <em>Romero, </em>the defendant challenged her confession on the basis that the confession was involuntarily made, and sought to introduce evidence from a psychologist that she was more susceptible to suggestion in a police interrogation setting than an average person would be, based on tests that he had administered to her. 191 Or App at 167. The psychologist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was prepared to testify that the defendant was inclined to change her answers when challenged and was influenced by leading questions. We reversed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that evidence, which had rested on the court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence would have impermissibly commented on the truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s testimony. Citing <em>Remme, </em>we concluded that \u201cnothing in [the psychologist\u2019s] testimony * * * comments directly on defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171. \u201cNone of that testimony would have supplanted the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility; rather, it simply would have provided the jury with information or reasons from which it could draw inferences as to credibility regarding defendant\u2019s claims that her confession was false.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Defendant argues that the trial court in this case made the same error that the trial courts did in <em>Remme </em>and <em>Romero </em>when it ruled that Stanulis could not use the term \u201creliable\u201d in reference to the preliminary steps ordinarily taken in a forensic interview concerning alleged child abuse. That argument, however, was never raised below. Although the state does not contend that defendant failed to preserve that argument, we are nonetheless obligated to determine if an argument is preserved. <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 345-47, 15 P3d 22 (2000). \u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 343 (concluding that \u201cdefendant\u2019s <em>arguments </em>and offer of proof here did not identify adequately for the judge the issue\u201d raised on appeal (emphasis added)). Here, defendant failed to either clarify to the trial court that Stanulis\u2019s opinion was directed to the inadequacy of the interview process or argue that it was \u201cuseful, nonconclusory information from which inferences as to credibility may be drawn,\u201d rather than a direct comment on whether the victim was being truthful. Accordingly, defendant failed to preserve that argument and it is not properly before us. Similarly, the trial court\u2019s ruling that Stanulis\u2019s opinion that an interview must establish whether a subject \u201cis able to distinguish between\u2014about truth\u201d was an impermissible comment on the victim\u2019s credibility was not met with an argument asserting otherwise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Further, defendant withdrew that evidence. Under these circumstances, defendant did not preserve the error he now asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">C. <em>Scientific Studies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">As to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, he asserts generally that the trial court erred when it precluded Stanulis from discussing the results of two categories of studies which supported his opinions\u2014that is, statistical evidence and studies that were addressed in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lawson!James </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">1. <em>Statistical evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Stanulis set out in his letter that he intended to testify that \u201c[Research has indicated that in 5 year olds the accuracy of their recall for events is poor (about a third of an event is recalled accurately while 2/3 is inaccurately recalled) and that in that same study a significant percentage (7/30) \u2018recalled\u2019 abuse that did not occur during a videotaped interaction with a male.\u201d At the <em>Brown </em>hearing, Stanulis described this research as coming from the \u201cRawls study,\u201d a copy of which he provided to the state. During his description of the study, the court ruled that it would not allow Stanulis to discuss statistics. The next day, the state challenged the methodology of the study and asserted that it was neither published nor peer reviewed. When the court stated that the study would not be admitted unless defendant could show that it was peer reviewed or published, defendant responded that he could not make that showing and offered to withdraw the study. The trial court then ruled that it would not allow Stanulis to \u201cstart talking about percentages of credibility or rates at which children witnesses are credible or not credible or rates of confabulation based upon certain studies,\u201d and that it was the court\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that the courts have said that that\u2019s generally not permissible, it\u2019s not useful to the jury and, in fact, could be misleading and prejudicial.\u201d Relatedly, referring to the letter in which Stanulis set out his proposed testimony, the court ruled that it would not allow Stanulis to use the term \u201csignificant percentage\u201d with regard to children recalling abuse that did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>On appeal, defendant acknowledges that the Rawls study was \u201cwithdrawn\u201d and does not assign error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that evidence; rather, he challenges the trial court\u2019s \u201ccategorical\u201d ruling precluding Stanulis from mentioning percentages or statistics.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state responds that defendant\u2019s argument is not preserved because he failed to make an offer of proof as to any of the studies on which he would rely to provide percentages or statistics. Indeed, defendant has not pointed to where in the record defendant made an offer of proof as to any other statistical evidence Stanulis would have provided that he now asserts was error to exclude. Nor does defendant on appeal point to any study or literature in the record, apart from the withdrawn Rawls study, providing statistics that Stanulis was prevented from discussing. We agree with the state that defendant did not preserve his challenge because he failed to make an offer of proof as to any other statistical evidence Stanulis would have presented to the court for which now asserts he was incorrectly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">A party \u201cordinarily must make an offer of proof as to the content of the excluded evidence\u201d to preserve a challenge to the exclusion of that evidence. <em>State v. Olmstead, </em>310 Or 455, 459-60, 800 P2d 277 (1990); see OEC 103(1)(b) (a party can assign error to a trial court\u2019s excluding of evidence if \u201cthe substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked\u201d). In the absence of an offer of proof, the error can be preserved \u201cif\u2018[t]he questions asked and the arguments presented to the court on the issue were adequate to inform the trial court of the substance of the evidence and its error in excluding it.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Lasky, </em>259 Or App 307, 315, 314 P3d 304 (2013) (quoting <em>Schacher v. Dunne, </em>109 Or App 607, 610, 820 P2d 865 (1991), <em>rev den, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>313 Or 74 (1992)). \u201cThe purpose of the rule requiring an offer of proof to preserve a claim of error when a trial court excludes testimony is To assure that appellate courts are able to determine whether it was error to exclude the evidence and whether any error was likely to have affected the result of the case.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Morgan, </em>251 Or App 99, 105, 284 P3d 496 (2012) (quoting <em>State v. Affeld, </em>307 Or 125, 128, 764 P2d 220 (1988)). Here, without an offer of proof, any statistical evidence that Stanulis would have testified to in support of his conclusions is merely hypothetical and, thus, there is no way for us to determine whether such statistical evidence or use of percentages is scientifically valid. And, although the trial court\u2019s ruling precluded Stanulis from testifying about statistical evidence from other studies, it did not prohibit defendant from making an offer of proof or describing or identifying other studies to which Stanulis would testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">2. Lawson/James <em>studies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Also included in defendant\u2019s assignment of error is what he characterizes as the trial court\u2019s exclusion of any of the studies cited in <em>State v. Lawson/James, </em>352 Or 724, 291 P3d 673 (2012). In the <em>Brown </em>hearing, Stanulis referenced a study identified in the appendix to <em>Lawson/James </em>to support his proposition that memory is malleable and that eyewitnesses to crimes are susceptible to suggestion depending on the type of question asked. He opined, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201c[A]nother Elizabeth Loftus study is the study of having people look at an automobile crash on video and then asking how fast were the cars going when they hit, how fast were they going [when they were] smashed. The exact [citation] is in <em>Lawson </em>in the [appendix], if you want to look it up. But it\u2019s\u2014And you\u2019ll get reliably higher speed estimates using the word\u2014by changing the word\u2014by changing one word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cThat obviously has implications for (unintelligible) of fact, but if you were speeding or not, and I guess, you know, 10 miles an hour is significant, because I saw you doing 30 in 25,1 think a jury, that has\u2014people might think but 40, that\u2019s a significant difference. And then in that same experiment ask where was the broken glass when, in fact, there was none, a confabulated memory with the word \u2018smashed,\u2019 not, \u2018hit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u00ab\u2021\u215c\u215c\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">\u201cAnd, you know, it\u2019s when we get into the other ones that we can script, like eyewitness identification. How you ask that question is extremely important, and this is all the same research underlying these three areas of eyewitness identification, false confessions, interview tactics with children, okay? And it\u2019s just simply pointing out that memory is quite malleable, and you can change it unwittingly. You don\u2019t have to think, you know, the word \u2018smash,\u2019 for example. I can easily see somebody, \u2018Wow. That\u2019s awful. They smashed into you. How fast were they going?\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">After the trial court questioned Stanulis about whether the study related to confabulation rather than variation in a story, Stanulis moved on to discussing the Rawls study. Later in the hearing, the court ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201c[Stanulis] is not to provide information about other cases which have occurred in other courts, including the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, or other cases that he\u2019s been involved with and the outcome of those cases. Those matters are not relevant to this proceeding, and I don\u2019t want there to be some sort of implication that, because courts have made one decision in some other case, something\u2019s wrong with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201c[STANULIS]: So can I just clarify? You don\u2019t want me to mention any other cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Correct. <em>I don\u2019t want you to talk about, for instance, the recent case that\u2019s come down on identity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201c[STANULIS]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: And particularly, you know, talking about <em>throw-downs and line-ups </em>and that sort of thing. It\u2019s not relevant to this proceeding, but also there\u2019s no reason for this witness to start proyiding any sort of legal analysis to the jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014or to apply the facts in this case or any other case to the law. That is not something that\u2019s appropriate for this expert witness to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We understand the trial court to have prevented Stanulis from discussing appellate decisions, applying legal analysis to the facts of this case or another case, and mentioning eyewitness identification procedures. However, we do not agree with defendant that the court categorically prohibited Stanulis from discussing any of the studies cited in <em>Lawson/ James. </em>Not all of the studies cited in <em>Lawson/ James </em>concerned eyewitness <em>identification. </em>Indeed, the Loftus study referenced by Stanulis was identified by the <em>Lawson/James </em>court in its summary of the scientific research and literature it examined to arrive at what it called \u201csystem variables\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and under the particular subheading \u201cSuggestive Questioning, Cowitness Contamination, and Other Sources of Post-Event Memory Contamination.\u201d 352 Or at 786-88. The referenced studies were cited for the proposition that \u201c[w]itness memory *** can become contaminated by external information or assumptions embedded in questions or otherwise communicated to the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787. That study was not directed to eyewitness identification specifically but, rather, to the more general proposition that the circumstances \u201cin which eyewitnesses are questioned or converse about an event can alter their memory of the event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. Moreover, the study supported the issue that Stanulis indicated concerned him about Harris\u2019s interview of the victim: The manner of Harris\u2019s questioning of the victim could have elicited inaccurate responses. Stanulis could have relied on the study, and the other studies in that subsection of the <em>Lawson I James </em>appendix, without running afoul of the trial court\u2019s ruling. That defendant may have understood at trial, or understands on appeal, the ruling to be broader so as to include a categorical exclusion of any and all studies cited in <em>Lawson! James </em>is of no moment. Our task is to correct any erroneous ruling made by the trial court, and, in this instance, the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\"> OEC 104(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201cPreliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section.
