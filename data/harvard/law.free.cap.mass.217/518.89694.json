Writ dated April 30, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. It appeared that on January 3, 1910, the defendant was the owner in fee of the land described in the lease, and gave to the plaintiff notice of his intention to terminate the lease in accordance with its provisions, tendering to him the sum of $400, which the plaintiff refused. The plaintiff also refused to vacate the leased premises. Thereafter the defendant, alleging the termination of the lease, began proceedings for the recovery of the premises by summary process which resulted in a decision in his favor that is reported in 206 Mass. 434. After compliance with the judgment in that case, the plaintiff made a demand upon the defendant for the $400, called \u201cliquidated damages\u201d in the lease, which the defendant previously had tendered to him and he had refused. This action was for that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">At the close of the evidence, the judge ordered a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $450.80; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-12\"><em>F.

The defendant having given notice of his intention to terminate the lease and tendered the amount stipulated, the leasehold estate expired by limitation, and the right of possession, which he obtained only after resort to summary process under R. L. c. 181, accrued. <em>Gunsenhiser </em>v. <em>Binder, </em>206 Mass. 434. It is plain that an action for breach of covenant cannot be maintained, although, to avail himself of the privilege of termination, the defendant undoubtedly was required to pay the sum designated as \u201cliquidated damages.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>194 Mass. 496. But payment was made conditional upon the plaintiff\u2019s concurrent surrender of the premises within the period, and his refusal to accept the tender and to vacate the premises, with his adverse holding of possession until evicted, prevents any recovery on this ground. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>114 Mass. 1, 3. The defendant\u2019s first request, that on all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, should have been given. Its refusal requires us to sustain the exceptions, and under St. 1909, c. 236, judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A9C\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
