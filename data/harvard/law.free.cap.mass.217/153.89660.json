Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated August 26, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">In the Municipal Court the case was tried before <em>Wentworth, </em>J. The facts found and reported by him are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">\" 1. That the plaintiff before it can recover is required to have Henry E. Wood, [the Mr. Wood mentioned in the opinion] make a proper and legal inspection of the safes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That a legal inspection as called for in the contract between the parties could only be made by an examination of the property by Henry E. Wood, and as no examination was made by him the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">\u201c3. That the right of action in this case was not complete until after there had been a proper inspection of the safes by the said Wood, and that an inspection after suit brought cannot aid the plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">In regard to the first and third rulings, the judge found that Mr. Wood had made a proper and legal inspection of the safes, and therefore ruled that those rulings were not applicable, and refused to give the second ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-10\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the sum claimed in the declaration and at the request of the defendant reported the case to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division ordered that the report be dismissed; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-11\"><em>F. S.

The written proposal of the plaintiff contained the clause, \u201cIt is also agreed and understood that these safes will pass the inspection of Mr. Wood.\u201d In this action for the unpaid balance of the purchase price the only defense alleged is that the safes have not been inspected by Mr. Wood, who was the commissioner of public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">On the facts found and stated in the report, the defendant was not entitled to the rulings requested. The judge expressly found that Mr. Wood did pass and approve the safes. Mr. Wood himself testified that he was sufficiently familiar with the standard kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>of safes described in the letter of proposal to enable him to pass and approve them without a personal inspection of them, and that he did so. This was a compliance with the contract. Further the chairman of the selectmen testified that the safes were in use by the town and were satisfactory; and the defendant himself paid part of the purchase price without demanding an inspection. Plainly it could be found that the defendant waived any right he had to have the safes pass the inspection of Mr. Wood, even assuming that the inspection was a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. On the plaintiff\u2019s motion double costs are awarded from the time when the appeal was taken, and the order dismissing the appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
