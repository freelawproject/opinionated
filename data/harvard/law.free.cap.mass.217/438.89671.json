Grace for ten years and eight months beginning May 1, 1907, a portion of the street floor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>numbered 16, of the Pickman Building, which was numbered 16 to 20 on Summer Street in Boston, Grace agreeing to pay rent at the rate of $7,500 per year by monthly instalments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">By a deed dated January 10, 1910, according to the agreed statement of facts, Grace and his wife conveyed \u201ctheir real estate\u201d to the defendant as trustee of the Grace.Real Estate Trust. The copy of the deed in the record shows it to be a deed from Grace and his wife and one Pierce J. Grace of all their \u201cright, title and interest in and to all land, tenements, hereditaments of every name and nature, with all easements and appurtenances thereto belonging, and with all buildings and other structures standing on said land, now owned and held by us, situated in said Boston; said land and buildings including the following properties,\u201d followed by a list of parcels of real estate in which the property described in the lease of the plaintiffs to Grace is not enumerated. The deed of trust gave to the defendant as trustee \u201cfull power . . <em>.(h) to </em>have the exclusive control and management of said trust estate and property, to pay all sums of money, make a division of money among the shareholders quarter-annually and do all acts and things which in his judgment are necessary and proper for the protection, management, lease and sale of the trust estate and property for the best interest of the shareholders.\u201d The deed provided for the issue of certificates of shares to James J. Grace and to Margaret A. Grace, his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">On March 30,1910, Grace \u201cfound himself in arrears to the plaintiffs, on account of\u201d their lease to him, in the sum of $4,840, and on that day made an agreement in writing with them, whereby their lease to him was cancelled, and Grace agreed to pay to them $2,500 \u201cin full adjustment of the liquidated sum of\u201d $4,840 then owing to them from him, the agreement containing the following: \u201cProvided, and it is expressly understood and agreed that such discharge is to be upon the condition precedent, that the said sum of $2,500 shall be paid in full on or before July 1, 1911, and it is further provided that in the event of failure to perform the condition the said sum of $4,840 shall be immediately due and payable.\u201d Upon the bottom of the instrument the defendant wrote the following: \u201cI hereby guarantee the payment of money specifically set forth in the above instrument. John P. Leahy, as Trustee Grace Real Estate Trust,\u201d and affixed a seal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>James J.

The judge refused so to rule and found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $5,393.37. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-4\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>J.

Packer, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-7\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7m\">The rule upon which the decision of this case depends is well settled. It is stated by Story, J., in <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>2 Wheat. 45, 56, as follows: \u201cA trustee, merely as such, is, in general, only suable in equity. But if he chooses to bind himself by a personal covenant, he is liable at law for a breach thereof in the same manner as any other person, although he describes himself as covenanting as trustee; for, in such case, the covenant binds him personally, and the addition of the words \u2018as Trustee\u2019 is but a matter of description to show the character in which he acts, for his own protection, and in no degree affects the rights or remedies of the other party. The authorities are very elaborate on this subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u201cIf a trustee contracting for the benefit of a trust wants to protect himself from individual liability on the contract, he must stipulate that he is not to be personally responsible, but that the other party is to look solely to the trust estate.\u201d Woods, J., in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>110 U. S. 330, 335. This doctrine has been recognized by this court. <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>185 Mass. 202. <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>207 Mass. 512, 513. In <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>Knowlton, C. J., says (page 203): \u201cOrdinarily, in the absence of special limitations, trustees bind themselves personally by their contracts with third persons. Actions at law upon such contracts must be brought against them, and judgments run against them personally.\u201d See also the remarks of Holmes, J., in <em>Odd Fellows Hall Association </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>153 Mass. 292, at page 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In the present case there is no stipulation express or implied that the trustee shall not be personally liable, and there is therefore nothing to take it out of the general rule. He is personally held.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>It is contended by Mm that even if he is held the liability extends only to the sum of $2,500. But we cannot agree with tMs contention. He guarantees \u201cthe payment of money specifically set forth in\u201d the instrument to wMch the guaranty is annexed. The \u201cmoney specifically set forth\u201d is only one sum depending in amount upon the time of payment, \u2014 $2,500 if paid on or before July 1, 1911, and $4,840 if not so paid. Whenever paid it is only one sum, and there is to be only one payment. For tMs payment of whatever may be due at the time of payment the defendant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
