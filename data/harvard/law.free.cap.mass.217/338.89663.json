Out of the income of my real estate, and out of the receipts and earnings of my farming business, they may make all necessary improvements, subject to the approval of a majority of my executors.

Allen, or the survivor of them so long as they are respectively entitled to the income of the rest and residue of my property under the provisions of said paragraph seven, to be by them held subject to the said terms as other income received by them under the provisions of this will. A majority of said executors shall also have full power and authority to extend any mortgage or mortgages on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>property at the time of my decease, or to substitute for such mortgage or mortgages, mortgage or mortgages of an equivalent total amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">\u201cNinth. The share, interest and portion, which but for the provisions of this ninth paragraph, my son William H.

Allen, Trustees, in trust for the following uses and purposes, and not otherwise, \u2014 to hold, manage, invest and reinvest the same, and pay over to my said son William H. Allen Jr. the net income thereof once every quarter, or oftener if they shall deem it advisable during his natural life. I authorize my trustees, in their discretion, to withhold such income from him in whole or in part, and expend the same in whole or in part, in the same manner as they are hereinafter authorized to pay, or to pay and expend, portions of the principal of the trust fund.

Allen, Jr., I give, devise and bequeath all the trust property and estate held by my trustees under this ninth paragraph of my will, to the issue, if any then living, of my said son William H. Allen, Jr., and in default of issue surviving him, I give, devise and bequeath the same to my heirs at law, who are to be determined as of the day of my said son\u2019s death, whether said estate be real or personal. I authorize and empower my trustees to sell, in their discretion, at public or private sale, any part, parts or whole of the trust property and estate held by them under the trusts of this paragraph, and to exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>cute and deliver good and sufficient deeds and other instruments necessary to transfer and convey the same without any liability or duty on the part of any purchaser or purchasers to see to the application of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">\u201cThe words 'my Trustees\u2019 shall be held and taken to include and mean the trustees for the time being hereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">\u201cI request that the trustees named in this ninth paragraph of my will, be exempt from giving any surety or sureties on their bonds as such trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">\u201cIf under the final distribution of my estate as provided in the seventh paragraph of this my will any one of my children shall then have deceased leaving no issue surviving him or her, I give his or her share to my other surviving children equally, the issue then living of any deceased child to take the same share which such deceased child would have taken if living.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">The bill as amended sought instructions on the following matters:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">. \u201c1.

Under the provisions of the seventh paragraph of the will, the said Abbot Allen and Herbert F. Allen, and the survivor of them, are made trustees of the residue of the testator\u2019s property after the payment by the executors of his ordinary debts, his funeral expenses and last sickness, proper charges for administration and the distribution of legacies; and the period for which the trust shall continue and the objects and terms of the trust are fully set forth in that paragraph. Questions as to whether any particular indebtedness should be paid by the executors or reserved for payment by the trustees are proper subjects for future determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Subject to the rights of the executors as such, and of the said trustees, during the continuance of the trust set forth in said seventh paragraph, the legal title to the testator\u2019s residuary estate in the proportions named in that paragraph is in his children Abbot Allen, Herbert F.

Allen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-11\">\u201c3. In order to settle the estate of the deceased, the said two petitioners with William H.

The three individuals who are named as executors have been given authority, by paragraph eight of the will, to mortgage, sell and convey the residue or any part of the same at any time before the expiration of the ten year trust, and they have further power to pay off incumbrances and to invest and to hold the proceeds dining such period, accounting to the two trustees Abbot and Herbert F. Allen or the survivor of them for any net income. Such authority to sell and make valid conveyances and to mortgage and extend existing mortgages may be exercised from time to time by all of the three persons named as executors or by any two of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">\u201c5. The three sons named as executors, manifestly are given by the eighth paragraph of the will, certain duties and responsibilities to perform beyond their duties as executors, regarding any proceeds which they may receive from the exercise of their power of sale and to mortgage, which duties and responsibilities seem to constitute a further trust; but the exigency has not yet arisen wherein they are entitled to the particular instructions of the court upon question numbered five.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">\u2022 \"6.

Allen, late of Arlington, deceased, and the other on an application for appointment of trustees under said will. William H. Allen died December 12, 1910. His sons, Abbot Allen, William H. Allen and Herbert F. Allen, duly qualified as executors on September 15, 1911, and since have continued to act as such. From the report of the single justice it appears that it now is necessary to pay or renew notes aggregating about $60,000, secured by mortgages on the real estate; that it is expedient that certain property in which the testator had an interest should be sold; and that there is need of extensive repairs and improvements on the greenhouses and other buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Considering first the petition for instructions: The objections assigned by the appellant as his reasons of appeal relate mainly to the seventh and eighth paragraphs of the will. The three sons were named as executors. In addition to the title in the personal property and the powers ordinarily given by law to executors, the will gives special power and authority to these three during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>existence of the ten year trust period hereinafter mentioned. Among other things, it is provided by the eighth paragraph that a majority of them may sell any or all of the residue, and may place mortgages on the property in substitution of existing ones; and that the proceeds of such sales may be used to pay off incumbrances on the property or may be invested by them. The instructions of the Probate Court as to the powers and duties of the executors plainly were correct. And the judge rightly declined to instruct them at this time as to the disposition to be made of any balance that may be left in their hands, as executors, after the ordinary settlement of the estate. If they should have such balance when their accounts are allowed, and any question should arise in connection with its transfer, application then may be made to the court for instructions thereon. <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Muldoon, </em>133 Mass. 111. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>183 Mass. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Under the seventh paragraph of the will, the testator gave to his sons Abbot Allen and Herbert F. Allen the management and control of the residue of his estate for the period of ten years, or until the death of the survivor within that period. The will fully sets forth their powers and duties with reference to the management of the residuary estate, and the application of the income. As all parties in interest agree, a trust is thereby created, even though the word \u201ctrust\u201d is not used. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>188 Mass. 163. The main contention of the appellant is that he should be deemed a co-trustee by construing together the seventh and eighth paragraphs of the will and reading his name into the seventh; but this is untenable. The seventh paragraph deals specifically with the powers of the executors. In the eighth the testator provides that his sons Abbot and Herbert F. shall carry on the farming business upon his estate, and he defines their duties. An annual compensation is expressly provided for them in the sum of $2,500 and $2,000 respectively, and the use, free of rent, of the houses they occupy, while only an allowance of $12 a week is made in favor of the appellant William H. Allen. He has a voice in the approval of necessary improvements made from the income, but only as one of the three executors. Even the two tenths share of the residue which is devised to him at the expiration of the trust period is to be held by his brothers in trust for his benefit, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Accordingly it was proper that Abbot Allen and Herbert Allen should be appointed by the Probate Court as trustees under the seventh paragraph. As all the parties were represented before the court on the petition for instructions and the appointment of trustees necessarily followed from the decree on that petition, no further notice of the petition for their appointment as trustees was necessary or customary. It may be added that no power of sale is given to the trustees; and that the fee is not devised to them, nor to the executors under paragraph eight, but is vested in the children in accordance with the provisions of paragraph seven, and, as to the two tenths share of William H., with those of paragraph nine. In short, the decree of the Probate Court on each petition was correct; and in each case the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
