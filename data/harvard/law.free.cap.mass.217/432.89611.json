L. c. 75, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1910, c. 528, \u00a7 1, declaring an \u2022 article of food to be adulterated if \u201cit contains any added antiseptic or preservative substance,\u201d excepting certain substances, among them cane sugar, and providing that the paragraph should \u201cnot be construed as permitting the use of cane sugar in maple syrup, maple sugar, honey, cocoa, or any other food product in which the presence of cane sugar as a preservative is unnecessary,\u201d the words, \u201cin which the presence of cane sugar as a preservative is unnecessary,\u201d do not apply to any of the preceding words except \u201cany other food product; \u201d and therefore the mixing of cane sugar as a preservative in any of the other articles named is prohibited.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-13\">Complaint, received and sworn to on January <em>2, </em>1912, in the Police Court of Lowell, charging that the defendant sold to one Frank X. Dostaller \u201ca certain article of food, to wit: syrup, said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>syrup so sold as aforesaid being then and there adulterated at the time of said sale within the meaning of\u201d R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-3\">On appeal to the Superior Court, the case was tried before <em>Chase, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts which was substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-4\">On December 18, 1911, Frank X. Dostaller ordered from the defendant and shortly thereafter received three cases of \u201cGolden Tree\u201d syrup of different sizes. The label of each bottle of syrup set forth substantially the name, the legend in a trademark, \"Golden Tree Best Quality,\u201d the words \u201cRegistered under Food &amp; Drugs Act,\u201d and the statement, \u201cMade from Granulated and Maple Sugars,\u201d with pictures of a maple tree and of sugar cane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">The Golden Tree syrup is a blend prepared- by mixing maple sugar with water to produce a syrup, and then adding to it granulated sugar. The ingredients are well known articles of food, wholesome, and not injurious to health, and no artificial coloring is used. The blend itself is not deleterious nor injurious to health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">The color of pure sap syrup or pure maple sugar syrup varies from a very dark brown to an amber, the color of Golden Tree syrup. The taste varies from a sweet, pleasant one like Golden Tree syrup to a strong, displeasing one. Both syrups have the same consistency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">The retail price of the same quantity of pure sap syrup is double that of the Golden Tree syrup. The addition of the granulated cane sugar to the Golden Tree syrup tends to preserve the maple sugar syrup of the compound. The granulated cane sugar constitutes approximately two thirds of the compound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">The judge refused to order a verdict for the defendant and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">At the request of the defendant the judge reported the case for determination by this court, the verdict to stand if the refusal to order a verdict of not guilty was correct; and the verdict to be set aside and a verdict of not guilty to be ordered if the trial judge should have ordered such a verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-10\"><em>H. W. Beal, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-11\"><em>N. P.

L. c. 75, \u00a7 18. There is no question that a syrup was sold, and the only question is whether it was adulterated within the meaning of either the fourth or the eighth clause (as amended by St. 1910, c. 528) of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">1. As to the fourth clause. This clause declares food to be adulterated \u201cIf it is in imitation of or is sold under the name of another article.\u201d It is strongly argued by the Commonwealth that this Golden Tree syrup, consisting of a compound of maple sugar, granulated sugar and water, was \u201cin imitation of\u201d maple sugar syrup. But we think that the agreed statement of facts upon which the case was submitted to the jury fails to support beyond a reasonable doubt this contention. We see nothing in the labels upon the body of the bottle in which the syrup was placed, or upon the cork, calculated to show any attempt at such imitation; and the mere facts that the consistency of the two syrups was the same, and that the color of the compound was the same as one of the various colors of pure maple syrup are not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Nor was the compound \u201csold under the name of another article.\u201d Dostaller did not order pure maple sugar syrup, but \u201cGolden Tree Syrup.\u201d He received what he ordered. No deception seems to have been practised upon him. Plainly the article ordered and delivered was the blend known as \u201cGolden Tree Syrup,\u201d and it does not appear to have been known by any other name. So far as the prosecution rests upon this clause it fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">2. As to the eighth clause (as amended by St. 1910, c. 528). This clause as originally enacted declared an article of food to be adulterated \u201cIf it contains any added antiseptic or preservative substance, except common table salt, saltpetre, cane sugar, alcohol, vinegar, spices, or, in smoked food, the natural products of the smoking process; but the provisions of this definition shall not apply to any such article if it bears a label on which the presence and the percentage of every antiseptic or preservative substance are clearly indicated.\u201d R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 18, cl. 8. This clause was amended by St. 1910, c. 528, by inserting after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>words \"smoking process\u201d these words, to wit: \u201cbut this paragraph shall not be construed as permitting the use of cane sugar in maple syrup, maple sugar, honey, cocoa, or any other food product in which the presence of cane sugar as a preservative is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">In the construction of this amendment the defendant contends that the words \u201cin which the presence of cane sugar as a preservative is unnecessary\u201d apply not only to \u201cany other food product,\u201d but also to the articles of food immediately preceding, namely, \u201cmaple syrup,\u201d etc., and that it being conceded that cane sugar \u201ctends to preserve\u201d the maple sugar syrup of the \u201ccompound,\u201d the syrup sold is not an adulterated food under this section. But we cannot adopt that construction. We are of opinion that the words \u201cin which the presence of cane sugar as a preservative is unnecessary\u201d do not apply to anything except \u201cany other food product,\u201d and that the effect of the amendment is to prohibit the mixture of cane sugar as a preservative with any of the articles immediately preceding. Under this interpretation of the amendment the article sold was.an adulterated syrup and could be sold only in the manner prescribed in the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">It is suggested by the defendant that the Golden Tree syrup, although a blend, was of itself a well known article and unit of food, but this is not made to appear in the agreed statement; and in this respect the case differs from <em>Adams </em>v. <em>New England Maple Syrup Co. </em>210 Mass. 475, where it appeared that the blend was a well known article in the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The defendant\u2019s request for a verdict of not guilty was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Under the terms of the report the conviction stands, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
