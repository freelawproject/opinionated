Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated March 28, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bell, </em>J. Hiere were in evidence plans which showed that the toilet room was eleven feet long and three feet two inches wide, and was partitioned off from the main room of the restaurant. The entrance door opened outward from the toilet room by swinging from hinges at its right. Opening from the wall at one end of the toilet room was a door two feet and four inches wide, which opened toward a person entering it and was hinged at the right, and which led to the stairway down which the plaintiff fell. This door was at right angles to the entrance door to the toilet room and only a few inches from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff with a niece went to the defendant\u2019s restaurant and \u201chad something to eat;\u201d that at the plaintiff\u2019s request the niece inquired of the defendant, \u201cwho was at the counter,\u201d for the toilet; that the defendant pointed to the door of the toilet room; that the niece then went to the plaintiff and, according to the niece\u2019s testimony, \u201cevery one \u2014 Mrs. Simons you know \u2014 heard what I say to my aunt and I saw Mrs. Simons point to the door and say 'You go inside; \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 that the toilet room was dark, that, when the plaintiff went to enter it, the outer door was open, and that she opened the door into the basement and fell down the stairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-9\"><em>E. J. Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-10\"><em>C. F.

If so, the defendant owed to her the duty of exercising reasonable care to see that the room and the approaches by which the plaintiff was to get to it were reasonably safe for her use. <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Paine Furniture Co. </em>179 Mass. 501. It seems also plain that, whatever the weight of the evidence might have been, there was evidence on which it could have been found that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that she was injured by reason of a failure of the defendant to exercise the care which was incumbent upon her for the purpose of keeping her premises safe for one whom she had invited to use them. <em>Marwedel </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>154 Mass. 235. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>151 Mass. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">It follows that the case should have been submitted to the jury, and there must be a new trials</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
