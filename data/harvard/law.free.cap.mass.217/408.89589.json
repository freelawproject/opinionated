First, the shaking up, and second, the nervous shock,\u201d a finding is warranted that, due to the shaking up, the plaintiff received an internal physical injury which, coupled with the nervous shock, caused the miscarriage, and that an actionable tort was committed by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b436-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJo\">The defendant in this case rested on -the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and asked the judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to rule that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The evidence was in substance this. The plaintiff was a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s trains running \u201cexpress\u201d from Bridgewater to Brockton, when \u201cwithout any warning or whistle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>or anything,\u201d it came to a sudden stop, and after a few minutes proceeded on its way. Before the stop the plaintiff had been sitting with her husband at her side. She testified that she \u201cwas just reclining,\u201d that she was \u201csitting way back on my seat with my head on the back.\u201d The sudden stop (so she testified) \u201cgave me a shock and threw me forward, . . . moved me to the edge of my seat.\u201d \u201cTo protect\u201d herself she put her left hand on the seat in front and with her right hand she \u201cgrabbed\u201d her husband\u2019s arm. There was evidence from others that the sudden stop \u201cthrew everybody in the train,\u201d and that some passengers standing in the aisle \u201cwere thrown against the front door;\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that he \u201cwas thrown right against his seat in front of me,\u201d and that the plaintiff was \u201cmoved\u201d by the sudden stop to the \u201cvery edge\u201d of the seat. The plaintiff further testified: \u201cI did not feel any pains until I came pretty near the South Station, and then I felt pains in my abdomen from that time until I arrived home.\u201d Her husband testified that he thought that the plaintiff \u201ccomplained at the time of the occurrence, but the pains were not severe\u201d \u201cuntil five or ten minutes afterwards.\u201d The next day the plaintiff went to see a doctor and at half past ten that night had a miscarriage. The doctor in question testified that in his opinion \u201cthe accident she met with on the train was the cause for the miscarriage. First, the shaking up, and second, the nervous shock. ... I found no marks on her body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">This evidence, if believed, warranted a finding that the shaking up which the plaintiff received was not of the kind incident to ordinary travel on a steam railroad. The case comes within <em>Work </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>207 Mass. 447, where the earlier cases are collected, and <em>Young </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>213 Mass. 267, where the later cases are collected. For the latest case see <em>Rust </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, ante, </em>116.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The defendant contends that in spite of that the plaintiff did not make out a <em>prima fade </em>case, and it relies in this connection on that part of the decision in <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>183 Mass. 193, which is stated in these words, at page 194: \u201cAs to the apparent sudden stopping, there is nothing to show that it was not caused by some obstacle appearing suddenly in front, such as a horse and wagon or a person on foot, attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>cross the track a short distance ahead. See <em>Byron </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>177 Mass. 303, and cases cited.\u201d As we understand the defendant\u2019s contention it is that if this statement is applied in the case at bar the plaintiff failed to make out a case of negligence because she failed to show that the sudden stopping of the train in the case at bar was not caused by some obstacle appearing suddenly in front of it. The plaintiff\u2019s proof that the jolt in the case at bar was an unusual one took this case out of the rule of non-liability stated in <em>Byron </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, ubi supra. </em>Where a jolt is proved to have been an unusual one, a case of negligence is thereby made out and it is not necessary for the plaintiff to go farther (in order to make out a case of negligence) and show that the jolt was not in the ordinary course of the operation of the railroad. There is nothing to the contrary in the statement made in <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>183 Mass. 193, 194, relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">The defendant\u2019s second contention is that the case at bar comes within the doctrine laid down in <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>168 Mass. 285, and affirmed when that case was later before this court. See 172 Mass. 488. It is to be noted that the doctor did not testify (as the defendant has contended) that \"the only history which he received from the plaintiff was her statement to him that she was frightened.\u201d After testifying on his direct testimony that in his opinion the cause of the miscarriage was the accident on the train, the doctor, in answer to a question put by the defendant on cross-examination, said: \u201cShe told me that she was frightened.\u201d On the doctor\u2019s testimony and the facts testified to, the jury were warranted in finding that the shaking up of which the plaintiff complained broke or strained something within her which supported the child, and that that break or strain coupled with the nervous shock, caused the miscarriage. If they did so find, it was not a case of \u201cmere fright, fear or mental distress occasioned by the negligence of\u201d the defendant, although there were no marks on the outside of the plaintiff\u2019s body, \u2014 to state the rule as it was stated when <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>168 Mass. 285, was first before this court. See <em>Steverman </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>205 Mass. 508. Nor does it come within the rule laid down when that case <em>(Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston </em>Railroad) came before the court the second time. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>172 Mass. 488. For all consequences of the trifling battery which the plaintiff there suffered she was allowed to recover. What she was not allowed to recover for at the second trial was the fright arising from the whole incident, not the consequences of the battery. See also <em>Homans </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>180 Mass. 456.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b439-7\"><em>Joseph Wentworth, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b439-8\"><em>W.
