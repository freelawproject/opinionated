He overruled the demurrer and the plea in abatement, and the defendants appealed. There was evidence of the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s beneficiary, Leavitt, recovered judgment for $176.14 damages and $62.23 costs on July 1, 1912, against the defendant Schapero on a declaration for conversion, the answer to which set up justification by virtue of a writ of the Municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Court of the City of Boston issued in favor of the Broadway Extension Poultry Company against one Nemzoff. The judgment so obtained had not been satisfied in whole or in part. Execution issued on the judgment on July 2,1912. On August 7, 1912, the present action was begun, the writ being returnable on the first Monday of September, on which day, September 2, the writ and declaration were entered and the execution in the former action was filed in the clerk\u2019s office. The officer\u2019s return, indorsed thereon, was dated July 19, 1912, and was as follows: \u201cBy virtue of this execution I have this day demanded payment of this execution or any part thereof so I might satisfy the same. I also demanded of the within named defendant goods, chattels, lands belonging to him so I might levy upon to satisfy this execution or any part thereof, but said defendant refused to comply with my request.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-3\">Due demand for the payment of the judgment was made upon the defendant surety before the bringing of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">At the trial, the defendant surety sought to introduce evidence in justification of the taking by the constable, and formally offered to prove \u201cthat the constable was justified in removing the goods under attachment on the writ of Broadway Extension Poultry Company, against Nemzoff, as the alleged mortgage thereon was a fictitious mortgage given by the owner Nemzoff to the plaintiff Leavitt, without consideration, and for the purpose of defrauding creditors of the then defendant owner and covering the aforesaid property from the reach of the said creditors and that said mortgage was void and of no effect and the attachment and removal thereunder, legal and justified.\u201d This evidence was excluded by the judge, who ruled as matter of law that the judgment against the constable was conclusive on the surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">The defendant surety asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">\u201c1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">\u201c2, Upon all the evidence the finding must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">\u201c 3. The surety is entitled to show that the taking by the constable was justifiable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">\u201c4. If the mortgage of Nemzoff to Leavitt was void and fraudulent, the constable was justified in taking the property under attachment and the defendant is not liable on the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201c 5. The question of the validity of the mortgage from Nemzoff to Leavitt is not <em>res adjudicata </em>in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-3\">\u201c6. The plaintiff must show that the conversion was under color of his office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\"><em>\u201c7. </em>The execution in Leavitt v. Schapero was not formally or properly returned to Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">To the fourth request the judge replied: \u201cRecord of judgment against constable conclusive against sureties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">To the sixth request the judge replied: \u201cThe fact is admitted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">To the seventh request the judge replied: \u201cThe fact is admitted but is immaterial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">The judge refused to make any of the- other rulings requested. He found for the plaintiff in the penal sum of the bond, and ordered that execution should issue for the sum of $253.96. At the request of the defendant surety he reported the case for determination by this court, including the questions presented by the appeals from the orders overruling the demurrer and the plea in abatement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-9\"><em>H. Caverly, </em>for the defendant surety.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-10\"><em>L. R. Eyges, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-11\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATH\">The plaintiff, having recovered judgment against the defendant Schapero for the conversion of certain personal property wrongfully attached by him as a constable in the service of civil process, brings this action under the provision of the R. L. c. 25, \u00a7 90, and c. 26, \u00a7 14, for breach of his official bond. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Buttrick, </em>187 Mass. 461. It is admitted, that the judgment remains wholly unsatisfied. But as execution issued and the plaintiff has sued before the time for its return expired, the defendants, relying on <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Cummiskey, </em>4 Cush. 420, contend that the action has been prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">It was said in <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>122 Mass. 64, \u201cThe only conclusion that can be said to have been established by that decision is that an unseasonable and insufficient return will not justify the issue of .a <em>scire facias </em>while the execution is in force and not yet returnable.\u201d The creditor might find property of the principal debtor sufficient to satisfy the execution, and in that event the trustee would not be liable in <em>scire facias, </em>which is merely a continuation of the proceedings by trustee process in the court where they originated. <em>Fay v. Sears, </em>111 Mass. 154,155. But as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>bail, <em>scire facias </em>will lie without waiting for the return day of the execution, where there is a return on the notice issued for an arrest under R. L. c. 168, \u00a7 19, that the judgment debtor cannot be found. <em>Wehrle </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>146 Mass. 331. The condition of the bond was broken, when judgment was obtained against the constable for official misconduct; <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>138 Mass. 336; although suit could not be begun until demand was made upon him to pay the amount of the judgment, unless sufficient reason for a failure to do so was shown. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>103 Mass. 280. <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>138 Mass. 336. The officer\u2019s return, however, shows, that payment was duly demanded and refused, and it is pointed out in <em>Chesebro </em>v. <em>Barme, </em>163 Mass. 79, that under the Pub. Sts. c. 171, \u00a7 22, now R. L. c. 177, \u00a7 23, requiring writs of execution to be returned within sixty days from their date, that the officer\u2019s return of service upon the execution, and the return of the execution into court, are distinct. The indorsement upon the execution regularly made of the officer\u2019s doings was sufficient to permit its introduction in evidence. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Wrighton, </em>184 Mass. 547, 549. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action on the bond having accrued, under the decision in <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>103 Mass. 280, by reason of the default, it is immaterial that the execution had twenty-four days more to run before the return day of the plaintiff\u2019s writ, during which time a levy might have been made upon property of the judgment debtor if any could have been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">But, if this defense fails, it is further urged by the defendant surety company, that it is not concluded by the judgment against the principal, and should be permitted to show that the attachment was justifiable, because the mortgage to the plaintiff was fraudulent and void as to creditors of the mortgagor. The bond, however, is joint as well as several, and, whatever conflict there may be in other jurisdictions as to whether the judgment recovered against the principal is conclusive upon the sureties, it is settled by our decisions that they are bound by the adjudication in an action upon his official bond. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>5 Allen, 409. <em>Dennie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>129 Mass. 143. <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>138 Mass. 336. See 35 Cyc. 1944, 1945, and notes for a collection of cases. The same rule has been adopted and followed as to sureties on bonds given to dissolve an attachment, or a mechanic\u2019s lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>or in summary proceedings for the possession of land where the case is removed to the appellate court, or to the judge of probate by a trustee. <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>115 Mass. 27. <em>Tapley </em>v. <em>Goodsell, </em>122 Mass. 176. <em>Ruggles </em>v. <em>Bernstein, </em>188 Mass. 232. <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>182 Mass. 104, 106. <em>Glover, appellant, </em>167 Mass. 280, 283. <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>215 Mass. 242. It is recognized in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>166 Mass. 37, which was an action upon a bond of indemnity to protect an officer against loss arising from the attachment of certain personal property, even if by the acts of the obligee an equity had been created in favor of the surety which the court did not feel at liberty to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The plea in abatement and demurrer are overruled, and by the terms of the report the plaintiff is to have judgment for the penal sum of the bond, and execution is to issue for the amount stated. <em>R. L. </em>c. 177, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
