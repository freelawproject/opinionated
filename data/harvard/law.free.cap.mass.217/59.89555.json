In this case such an examination was conducted in the presence of the jury and much irrelevant testimony was given as to certain experiments which were made by persons employed by the defendant when the photographs were taken. It appeared, however, that this course of proceeding was not objected to by the plaintiff, and that he did not ask to have the jury excused, and that the jury were instructed without objection to consider the photographs only as representing exact conditions and to disregard them for any other purpose, and it was <em>held, </em>that no error was committed sufficient to warrant a new trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b87-11\">At the trial together of two actions, one by a wife for personal injuries and the other by her husband for consequential damages resulting from a horse which she was driving being frightened by alleged negligence in the operation of an automobile by a servant of the defendant, evidence was admitted, subject to an exception by the plaintiffs, solely as bearing on the husband\u2019s case, of a conversation between the husband and wife in which he had warned her in regard to the horse\u2019s fear of automobiles. It did not appear that anyone else was present at the conversation. The plaintiffs did not object to the evidence on that ground when it was introduced. The jury found for the defendant in both cases, and also found specially that the defendant\u2019s chauffeur was not negligent. <em>Held, </em>that the exceptions must be overruled, because, even if the evidence was incompetent, it was admitted only on the question of the due care of the husband, and, in view of the jury\u2019s findings, the plaintiffs could not have been harmed by it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b87-12\">If a chauffeur, after a horse became frightened by an automobile which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>operating and a woman who was driving the horse was injured, stated to his employer over the telephone that he had \u201chad an accident with\u201d the woman, and inquired whether his employer desired to have his physician see the woman, \u201cor what he should do,\u201d these statements are not admissible in evidence as admissions binding upon the employer in an action for personal injuries by the woman against the employer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b88-5\">The mere fact, that, two days after an accident alleged to have been caused by negligence of a chauffeur, his employer discharged him, is not competent as an implied admission by the employer that the accident was due to the chauffeur\u2019s negligence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">Two actions of tort, the first for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff when a horse that she was driving near Ellicott City in Maryland became frightened by reason of the alleged negligence of a servant of the defendant in the operation of an automobile.

This road runs through a ravine and ha\u00e1 a number of curves. Jessie B. Gillet, hereinafter called the plaintiff, was returning to her home in a top buggy drawn by her family horse, and was seated on the right and driving. She had reached a point on the road about a mile from Ellicott City, and had passed the southerly end of a cottage known as the Ben Williams house, when an automobile driven by the defendant\u2019s chauffeur came into sight around the bend in the road next south of the Williams house. The evidence tended to show that the horse became frightened, and shied; that it dragged the buggy over a bush and against a stump near the side of the road, and that the buggy was thereby upset and Mrs. Gillet was thrown out and injured. There was no collision between the team and the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"ADQ\">The action of the plaintiff was brought to recover damages for the injuries suffered by her, and alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s chauffeur; and the action of her husband, Edward M. Gillet, is brought for the consequential damages sustained by him. The cases were tried together, and the jury returned verdicts for the defendant. Thereupon the presiding judge, addressing the jury, said: \u201cI would like to ask if the jury found that the chauffeur was not negligent?\u201d To which the foreman answered \u201cYes.\u201d The only questions raised by the exceptions relate to the admission or exclusion of evidence by . the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">1. As to the photographs. These were admitted after the defendant had covered the portions showing a horse and an automobile, and for the sole purpose of illustrating the physical features of the location. The jury were expressly told to use them so far as they reproduced the exact conditions, and to disregard both plans and photographs entirely so far as they showed anything else. It would seem from the record that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel withdrew his objection to them after the horse and automobile had been eliminated. However that may be, the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sibility of the photographs rested largely in the discretion of the judge, and we find no error in its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">The depositions of the civil engineer Sutton and the photographer .Groeninger, so far as they described how the photographs were taken and explained certain objects that appeared in them, clearly were competent. Whether the photographs could be used as a graphic illustration of experiments made by these witnesses relating to the range of vision from various points in the road need not be considered, as the judge expressly excluded their use for that purpose. In the preliminary examination some evidence that referred to these experiments was read from the depositions. To much of it no objection was made, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel consented that the photographs might be used <em>de bene </em>and shown to the jury in this connection. The judge expressly allowed this testimony to be read only for the purpose of enabling him properly to pass upon the photographs. Later he excluded the photographs as experiments, limited their use as above stated, and so instructed the jury in his charge. It now seems apparent that it would have been better to conduct this preliminary examination in the absence of the jury; but the plaintiff did not so request, nor did she ask that the jury be further instructed to, disregard what had been said about experiments, nor except to the charge as given. We cannot say that harmful error is shown. <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Casualty Co. of America, </em>208 Mass. 214. <em>Slotofski </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>215 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">2. The testimony of McNeil as to a conversation he had with the plaintiff Edward M. Gillet was admitted solely as bearing on the latter\u2019s own case. The question asked was a proper one. It is now argued that the alleged warning testified to in the answer occurred in a private conversation between husband and wife, although that objection was not raised at the trial. Assuming however that the answer was incompetent, and that the objection is now open to the plaintiff, it cannot avail her, in view of the special answer of the jury, that the chauffeur was not negligent. The evidence could bear only on the plaintiff\u2019s due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">3. The remaining exceptions also are rendered immaterial by the special answer of the jury. It may be added, however, that the statements of the chauffeur after the accident, even if material to the issue, could not bind his employer as an admission of lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>bility. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad </em>v. <em>Ordway, </em>140 Mass. 510. <em>Richstain </em>v. <em>Washington Mills Co. </em>157 Mass. 538. And the evidence in the deposition of the chauffeur Dykeman, that he was discharged two days after the accident, was not competent as an implied admission by the defendant that the chauffeur had been careless. <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Taunton Street Railway, </em>167 Mass. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
