ICresge, a sublessee in occupation of such adjoining land, the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital Corporation, the owner and lessor of such adjoining land, and the F. D. Davis Company, a corporation engaged in business as a general contractor; praying for an injunction to restrain the defendants from further entering and trespassing upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, for an order compelling them to restore the plaintiff\u2019s land to its original condition, for damages, and for further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">The case was heard by <em>Hardy, </em>J., who found, as stated in a memorandum of decision, that the defendant Kresge, through the defendant F. D. Davis Company as contractor, had caused changes to be made in the basement of the building belonging to the defendant hospital corporation and \u201cthat the result of the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>contracted to be done by the said Davis Company is in derogation of the rights of the plaintiff, whereby the land of the plaintiff will be permanently injured in his control thereof in the future.\u201d He found that the plaintiff was entitled as against the defendant Iiresge to a decree ordering him to restore the plaintiff\u2019s land to its original condition, and that, upon his failure to comply with such order, damages should be assessed against the defendant Iiresge in the sum of $500. The judge ordered that the bill be dismissed as against the defendants Rosenbaum, the defendant hospital corporation, and the defendant F. D. Davis Company, and that the defendant hospital corporation should be awarded costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">About one year later a final decree was entered by order of <em>Hardy, </em>J., reciting that the defendant Iiresge had failed within a reasonable time to restore the plaintiff\u2019s land to its original condition, and ordering him to pay to the plaintiff $500 as damages. The decree further ordered that the defendant hospital corporation, the defendants Rosenbaum and the defendant Kresge should execute and deliver to the plaintiff \u201ca written instrument releasing and quit-claiming to said plaintiff any right, title or interest in the plaintiff\u2019s land which said defendants, or any of them, may have by reason of the existence or continuance in existence of the foundation wall or any other work or works placed on said plaintiff\u2019s land by said defendants or by any of them, together with any right, title or interest which said defendants, or any of them, may or might have in said foundation wall or work or works; and expressly waiving and disclaiming any and all rights of or to any easement in or upon the land of said plaintiff which the said defendants, or any of them, may now have or might in future acquire by reason of the existence of said foundation wall or work or works.\u201d The decree further ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should stand dismissed as against the defendant F. D. Davis Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">The defendant Peter Bent Brigham Hospital Corporation appealed from the decree, the evidence being reported by a commissioner appointed under Equity Rule 35.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-7\"><em>W.

By this instrument no provision is made that either estate could be subjected equally to a partition wall erected for their joint benefit, and the disturbance of the soil in placing part of the underpinning stones in the plaintiff\u2019s land to support the wall of the building erected on the defendant\u2019s land was unlawful. The trespass so long as the stones remained, even if no portion of the superstructure projected, having been continuous, the plaintiff, instead of proceeding at law for damages as they accrued, can resort to equity where injunctive relief can be given and accrued damages assessed. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>128 Mass. 361. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>189 Mass. 353, 357. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>203 Mass. 4. <em>Curtis Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Spencer Wire Co. </em>203 Mass. 448. <em>Szathmary </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>214 Mass. 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The bill alleges, and the presiding judge has found, that the defendant had leased the premises to the defendants Louis Rosenbaum and Henry Rosenbaum for a term of years, which has not expired, and the work was done for his own advantage by the defendant Kresge, a sublessee. If the sublessee had the right under the terms of the leases to make alterations, including a partial reconstruction of the wall, the permission is limited of course to the estate demised. The plaintiff even does not contend that the original lease constituted the lessees the defendant\u2019s agents with authority to appoint subordinate agents to encroach upon his land. It is not alleged, nor is it found that the defendant\u2019s officers with knowledge of what was going on, or proposed to be done, participated in, or assented to, the misappropriation, or intend to assert upon the expiration of the lease any right to have the footing stones remain for the benefit of the corporation. The defendant, while the lease is outstanding, cannot under the circumstances without committing a trespass enter upon the demised estate for the purpose of removing the stones, the displacement of which evidently would subject the tenant to' serious annoyance and inconvenience in the enjoyment of the leasehold. <em>Nelson Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>216 Mass. 30. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>plain that the subtenant who was in full occupation and control and acted for himself alone, is responsible, especially as he proceeded after notice that he was violating the plaintiff\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">If the specific prayers are read, the plaintiff asks that the several lessees, and not the defendant, be ordered to restore his land to its former condition, and the judge before whom the merits were tried decreed relief only against the actual transgressor. A general prayer is added, but this does not enlarge the case stated by the bill. <em>Fordyce </em>v. <em>Dillaway, </em>212 Mass. 404, 411. The plaintiff on the findings, which neither party questions, and which as has been said exonerated the corporation, was entitled to a mandatory injunction directing Kresge to remove the stones, and to restore the premises within a time to be stated in the decree with payment of compensatory damages already suffered. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Union Institution for Savings, </em>158 Mass. 394. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>203 Mass. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The wording of the memorandum of decision indicates that the judge was of opinion that an injunction in this form should not issue, for he assessed damages which are to be paid if Kresge, who apparently is given the option, did not effect the restoration within a reasonable time. The plaintiff has not appealed, and if the final decreee, which in this particular only follows the decision, had not gone further, the defendant would not have been aggrieved. The decree however instead of dismissing the bill with costs as the memorandum ordered, required the corporation to execute and deliver a written instrument releasing and quit-claiming any right, title or interest in the plaintiff\u2019s land, and waiving or disclaiming any right to an easement therein. The plaintiff relies upon the familiar doctrine, that a court of equity, having once acquired, will retain jurisdiction and give full relief. But, even if the findings were disregarded, it cannot be presumed in the absence of evidence, or of circumstances from which the inference properly can be drawn, that the defendant will endeavor to avail itself of an advantage founded on an unjustifiable tort. A belief however honest that it might do so, with nothing more, is insufficient ground for affirmative relief. The decree as to the lessees and sublessee could not, and moreover did not, subject the plaintiff\u2019s land to a servitude, which might ripen into an easement appurtenant to the reversion. The defendant as lessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>cannot derive any title under the lease, nor can it enforce any interest acquired by the several lessees under a wrongful appropriation for the use of the leasehold itself. The benefit, if any, is coexistent only with the term. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>127 Mass. 403, 407. <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>178 Mass. 76. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Boston Terminal Co. </em>178 Mass. 172, 185. It did not have by ownership, nor can it acquire by anticipated repossession, any title or dominant interest in the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the decree must be modified by dismissing the bill with costs but without predjudice as to the appellant, and when so modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
