The dealer failed for several months to make the payments and the manufacturer wrote to him asking for an immediate payment of a sum shown to be due by a statement of account, enclosed with the letter, which included as a credit the rebate agreed upon. The dealer did not pay the sum demanded, and an attorney for the manufacturer wrote to the dealer stating that the dealer was not entitled to any rebate because of his failure to make the required payments. The manufacturer thereupon brought an action against the dealer to enforce payment. <em>Held, </em>that the manufacturer had not waived his right to insist upon the payments being made by the dealer before the giving of any rebate, and that he had not made a binding election to waive such right.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">Contract for a balance alleged to be due under an agreement in writing dated February 12, 1907, between the plaintiff and the defendants, doing business under the names and styles of W.

J. It appeared that the contract provided for payments by the defendants \u201con the tenth of each month for all waste shipped to us during the previous month.\u201d On September 24, 1907, an agreement in writing was made between the parties, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\">\"Referring to contract of February 12 for the waste output [of' certain mills, including the plaintiff] . . . regarding which a difference has arisen between these various mills and our company [the defendants], we desire to adjust same and wish to state that it will be agreeable with our company to have this difference adjusted in the following manner:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-9\">\u201cWe agree to accept the entire output of the above mentioned mills in accordance with the contract as originally made, with the further understanding that all waste which has been billed to us by these mills is to be settled for in accordance with the invoices rendered.

These bales the plaintiff held on storage for the defendants at their request and because of their failure to give shipping instructions. Upon issues submitted to the jury respecting these bales it was determined that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-8\">On May 25, 1908, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants a letter, enclosing a statement and memoranda. The letter was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-9\">\u2018We herewith enclose statement showing amount due $10,312.57. This is after crediting your account with $3,269.67, allowance due you in accordance with agreement of Sept. 24, 1907.

You will note considerable of this account is nearly sixty days past due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-10\">On June 15 the defendants paid the balance shown by the statement excepting the $3,255.49. The plaintiff wrote to the defendants, stating that it did not understand the reason for the deduction, and a conference followed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-11\">On July 6,1908, counsel for the plaintiff wrote to the defendants demanding payment of the sum of $3,255.49, above mentioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>and stating that by reason of the fact that the defendants had failed to pay, in accordance with the provisions of the contract of September 24,1907, they were not entitled to the rebate therein mentioned and therefore owed the plaintiff both for the goods sold and delivered against which the defendants were attempting to offset the rebate and for the motes in issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">The plaintiff sought to recover in this action (1) $3,269.67 for goods sold and delivered, about which there was no dispute but against which the defendants claimed the right to set off the rebate of $3,269.67, (2) the $3,255.49 above described and (3) interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">The issue as to the $3,255.49 having been determined by the jury in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the. Chief Justice ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to the further sum of $3,269.67 for goods sold and delivered with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from July 10, 1908, and that the defendants were not entitled to the rebate which they claimed of $3,269.67, and accordingly directed a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $8,320.85, of which $1,794.69 was interest, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 declaration in set-off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">Thereupon the defendants paid the plaintiff the amount of $3,255.49 with interest and costs to date without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s rights as to the balance of the verdict, and the Chief Justice reported the case for determination by this court, judgment to be entered for the defendants if the defendants were entitled to the rebate or allowance of $3,269.67; otherwise, judgment to be entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $3,269.67 and interest and costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-7\"><em>Lee M. Friedman, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\"><em>D. A. Ellis, (P. Rvbenstein &amp; S. M. Whalen </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b227-9\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARl\">We consider that under our decisions there was a sufficient consideration for the modifying agreement of September 24, 1907, and for the plaintiff\u2019s promise made therein to allow to the defendants the rebate therein mentioned. Some of these decisions are collected in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>207 Mass. 226, 234, and <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Kells, </em>207 Mass. 304, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">But by this agreement the defendants\u2019 right to that rebate was made conditional upon the defendants\u2019 payment of the amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>which should have become due and payable under the original agreement. The stipulation of the modifying agreement is that the plaintiff should \"at the expiration\u201d of the original agreement \u201cgive us [the defendants] a rebate and after settlement by us of the waste shipped or billed to us by them at the end of April, 1908, make for us a memorandum of the total quantity of waste shipped during the twelve months ending April 30th, 1908, and on of this total quantity of [or] two months\u2019 output, make cash settlement or rebate [to] us\u201d as therein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">These words can mean only that the defendants are to have this rebate after settlement by them of what had become due from them for waste shipped under the original agreement. And the only mode of settlement provided for in the original agreement was by payment to be made by sending a check \u201con the tenth of each month for all waste shipped to us [the defendants] during the previous month.\u201d No change was made in this provision by the modifying agreement of September 24. We cannot avoid the conclusion that the defendants\u2019 right to the rebate was to accrue only after making their monthly payments and only on condition of their doing so. It was not a discount to be allowed upon settlement, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strauss, </em>188 Mass. 229, and some other cases relied on by the defendants. It was a final rebate or cash payment to be made by the plaintiff to the defendants only after the termination of the period covered by the original agreement and after full settlement thereunder should have been made by the defendants. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>11 Pick. 371, 378. <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>9 Cush. 122, 128. <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Cordis, </em>5 Gray, 341, 353. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schwarzschild, </em>83 Maine, 261, 265. It was not both \" a rebate and a cash payment that the plaintiff was to make, but only one allowance, and what was added in the modifying agreement after the word \"rebate\u201d was added by way of explaining the meaning in which that word was used. There is abundant authority for the view which we take. <em>Tufts </em>v. <em>Kidder, </em>8 Pick. 537. <em>Makepeace </em>v. <em>Harvard College, </em>10 Pick. 298. <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Salomon, </em>38 Vroom, 73. <em>Nassau </em>v. <em>Guttridge, </em>41 Vroom, 191. <em>Perin </em>v. <em>Cathcart, </em>115 Iowa, 553. <em>National Distilling Co. </em>v. <em>Cream City Importing Co. </em>86 Wis. 352. <em>St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway </em>v. <em>Rierson, </em>38 Kans. 359. <em>Missouri Edison Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Bry, </em>88 Mo. App. 135. <em>Missouri Edison Electric Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Steinberg Hat &amp; Fur Co. </em>94 Mo. App. 543. <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Distilling &amp; Cattle-Feeding Co. </em>77 Fed. Rep. 265. <em>Messenger </em>v. <em>Woge, </em>20 Col. App. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We find no evidence of waiver or of a binding election by the plaintiff not to stand upon its right. It might have been willing to allow the rebate if the defendants had merely made some delay in payment; but that affords no evidence that it had bound itself to waive the stipulation that had been made in its favor. <em>Lambeth Rope Co. </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>170 Mass. 518, 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The defendants have argued only the question of their right to the rebate or allowance. Under the terms of the report, judgment must be entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $3,269.67, with interest from July 10, 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
