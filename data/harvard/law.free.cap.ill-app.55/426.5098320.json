At present it is only a source of expense, and that expense is in part for the benefit of appellee, who retains her dower interest in it.</p> <p id=\"b424-11\" pgmap=\"424\">Appellant is compelled to keep at work to earn the alimony, while appellee is enabled to live in idleness.</p> <p id=\"b424-12\" pgmap=\"424\">Following the conclusion arrived at in Umlauf v. Umlauf, 128 Ill. 378, we are of the opinion that $50 per month, is, out of an income of $125 per month, derived only by constant labor, too large an allowance.</p> <p id=\"b424-13\" pgmap=\"424(32) 425(22)\">We think that in this case the allowance of alimony should not exceed the sum of $30 per month. The decree of the Circuit Court will, therefore, be set aside and the cause remanded to that court with directions to so modify its decree as to make the award of alimony $30 per month.</p> <p id=\"b425-5\" pgmap=\"425\">In all other respects the decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">The costs made in this court will be taxed against the parties \u25a0 respectively, by whom such costs were incurred. Decree modified.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
