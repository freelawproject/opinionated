Their rights in such cases do not depend upon the actual title or authority of the party with whom they have directly dealt, but they are derived from the act of the real owner, which precludes him from disputing, as against them, the existence of the title or power he caused or allowed to appear to be vested in the party, upon the faith of whose title or power they dealt. Bigelow on Estoppel, 468; Higgins v. Ferguson et al., 14 Ill. 269; Donaldson et al. v. Holmes, 23 Id. 85; Schwartz et al. v. Saunders, 46 Id. 18; Oglesby Coal Co. v. Pasco, 79 Ill. 170. To have given an itemized statement of the amount paid each laborer, each day he worked, and the charge for each portion of all the materials used in the buildings, when the entire contract was for a specific sum, viz., \u00a71,025, and that amount is expressly set out in the notice for lien, is doing what the law does not require\u2014\u201c a useless act.\u201d Green v.

Jacobson, 145 Ill. 389.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-11\" pgmap=\"361\">The statement affords no information of the amount claimed against each house, nor is there any evidence whatever of the amounts properly chargeable against each. On the contrary, appellant himself testifies that the houses are separate and detached; that he doesn\u2019t know how much material went into each of them, and that he never separated the houses as to the quantity of material and labor for each. He claims one lien upon the entire premises, and asks for one sale for the satisfaction of the entire claim. Our Supreme Court has sufficiently passed upon the regularity of a decree in conformity with such a prayer in Steigelman v. McBride, 17 Ill. 300; James v. Hambleton, 42 Ill. 308; Culver v. Elwell, 73 Ill. 536.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-14\" pgmap=\"361\">And this court has considered the question in Bayard v.

If these five buildings were one block, covered by the same roof, such decree would be proper. James et al. v. Hambleton et al., 42 Ill. 308. We understand these premises to be distinct and separated from each other, and under separate roofs. This being so, the rule in Steigleman v. McBride, 17 Ill. 300, applies, where it is said, if the work done or material furnished are upon distinct premises, the lien must be against each of the several premises, according to the value of the work and material on each.\u201d</p> <opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b362-5\" pgmap=\"362\">Mr. Justice Gary</author> <p id=\"AMS\" pgmap=\"362\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b362-6\" pgmap=\"362\">The mechanic\u2019s lien law, with its multitude of details which must be strictly complied with by those who seek its benefits, is a delusion and a snare.</p> <p id=\"b362-7\" pgmap=\"362\">In this case the appellant made one contract for the plumbing and sewerage of six separate cottages, each upon a lot having a number of its own, and in attempted compliance with section 4, filed his claim, giving the dates of the labor performed\u2014but not of the materials supplied\u2014in performance of the contract, and showing $1,050 due on the whole contract.</p> <p id=\"b362-8\" pgmap=\"362\">As no lien could be had upon any lot except for the work and materials for that lot, such claim was not a compliance with the statute.
