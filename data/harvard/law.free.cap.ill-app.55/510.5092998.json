While the liability is statutory, it is one which arises upon the contract of subscription to the capital stock of the corporation, and an action to enforce the same is transitory and may be brought in any court of general jurisdiction in the State where personal service can be made upon the stockholder.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-10\" pgmap=\"511\">Stockholders can only be sued at law. 35 Fed.

Ellwood, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-12\" pgmap=\"511(39) 512(29)\">Appellees contended that the law of Illinois governs the remedy; that the lex loei eontraoPus fixes and governs the liability, while the lex fori determines the remedy; citing Burchard v. Dunbar, 82 Ill. 450; Mineral Point R. R. Co. v. Barron, 83 Ill. 365; Woodward v. Brooks, 128 Ill. 292; Brown v. Slate Co., 134 Mass. 590; Bank of N. A. v. Rindge, 27 N. E. Rep. 1015.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\" pgmap=\"512\">And that the laws of Kansas create no liability against appellees.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\" pgmap=\"512\">The clause of the constitution set out in the declaration is not self-enforcing, but before its provisions can become operative, it is necessary that the Kansas legislature re-enact them. The statute assumes a liability and then prescribes a remedy. That the constitution is not self-executing, see French v. Teschemaker et al., 24 Cal. 518; Morley v. Thayer, 3 Fed. Rep. 737; Grove v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. (U. S.) 449; Fusz v. Spaunhorst, 67 Mo. 256. And that if there is any liability it can not be enforced in Illinois. New Haven Horse Nail Co. v. Linden Spring Co., 142 Mass. 34, 7 N. E. Rep. 773; Rice v. Hosiery Co., 56 N. H. 114; Andrews v. Bacon, 38 Fed. Rep. 777; Nimick &amp; Co. v. Mingo Iron Works Co., 25 W. Va. 184; May v. Black, 77 Wis. 101, 45 N. W. Rep. 949; Bank of N. A. v. Rindge, 27 N. E. Rep. 1015.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-9\" pgmap=\"512\">It must be constantly borne in mind that the liability claimed, and the remedy contended for, did not exist at common law; but if they exist at all, they are in derogation of the common law, are purely statutory, and the law concerning them is to be strictly construed and applied. Rice v. Hosiery Co., 56 N. H. 114; Chase v. Lord, 77 N. Y. 1; Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. (U. S.) 520; Horse Shoe Nail Co. v. Linden Springs Co., 142 Mass. 349; Howells v. Manglesdorf, 33 Kan. 195; Bank v. Sewing Society, 28 Kan. 423; Cook on Stockholders, Sec. 214.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-10\" pgmap=\"512\">A court of law has not jurisdiction in an action by a creditor of a corporation for a debt incurred since July 1, 1872 (except by garnishment for unpaid subscription money), and it was so expressly decided in Richardson v. Akin et al., 87 Ill. 138.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-11\" pgmap=\"512(51) 513(19)\">Again, if there is a liability, it is to all the creditors as a class, and can only be enforced in equity, and the bill must be by, or on behalf of, all the creditors.

App. 682.</p> <opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b513-5\" pgmap=\"513\">Mr. Justice Boggs</author> <p id=\"AYT\" pgmap=\"513\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b513-6\" pgmap=\"513\">This case was submitted to us at our May term, 1893. We had previously held in the case of Tuttle v. Rational Bank of the Republic, 48 App. 481, that section 2 of the constitution of the State of Kansas recited in the declaration in the case at bar was self-executing, and that it created a liability against a stockholder in the corporations of that State in favor of a creditor of the corporation which was enforceable in an action of assumpsit in the courts of Illinois in the event that the corporation became insolvent or had been dissolved leaving debts unpaid. The Supreme Court of Illinois on the 19th day of June, 1893, and while the case at bar was under advisement in this court, rendered an opinion in the case of Fowler et al. v. Lamson et al., 143 Ill. 472, which counsel for the appellee interpreted as in effect overruling our holding in the Tuttle case.</p> <p id=\"b513-7\" pgmap=\"513\">An appeal which was prosecuted to the Supreme Court from our decision in the Tuttle case was then pending.</p> <p id=\"b513-8\" pgmap=\"513\">We permitted counsel in the present case to file additional briefs and arguments and reserved decision until further advised by the disposition made of the Tuttle case by the Supreme Court.</p> <p id=\"b513-9\" pgmap=\"513\">The opinion of that court in that case has now been filed. Tuttle v. Rational Bank of Republic (not yet reported).</p> <p id=\"b513-10\" pgmap=\"513\">It affirms our ruling and distinguishes the Tuttle case from that of Ford et al. v. Lamson, supra, and distinctly holds that the provision of the constitution of the State of Kansas recited in the declaration in the case at bar is self-executing, and creates a liability against a stockholder in the corporations of that State in favor of a creditor of the corporation which may be enforced in this State by the appropriate common law remedy.</p> <p id=\"b513-11\" pgmap=\"513\">It is not doubted that assumpsit is the appropriate remedy.</p> <p id=\"b513-12\" pgmap=\"513(11) 514(52)\">The motion of the appellee to dismiss the cause upon the ground that the remedy was in equity ought have been overruled by. the Circuit Court. Because of the error in respect of this ruling of the Circuit Court, the judgment of that court must be and is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceeding consistent with the views here expressed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
