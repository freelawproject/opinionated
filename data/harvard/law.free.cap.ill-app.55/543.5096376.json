After the payment of my said debts and funeral expenses, I give, devise and bequeath unto my wife, Nancy C. Kent, one-half of all the personal property, money and effects not hereinbefore otherwise disposed of, which I may own or have a right to at the time of my death. And I also give, devise and bequeath to my said wife the farm upon which we\u2014my wife and myself\u2014-now reside, for and during the term of her natural life, she to have all the rents, issues and profits growing out of or arising from the same, from the time of my death, for and during her natural life, whether such rents, issues and profits arise from a lease now made, or which may hereafter be made by me of said farm.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\" pgmap=\"540\">Fifth.

[Seal.] \u201d</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\" pgmap=\"542\">Said Turner and Grover duly qualified as executors of the will. They also, from the time of Mr. Kent\u2019s death, which occurred August 13, 1879, acted as the agents of his widow, Haney 0. Kent. They ceased to be such agents some time in the year 1891, when Frederick J. White became their successor in such agency. In settling the estate they turned over all moneys coming to Mrs. Kent under the will to themselves as her agents. On September 2, 1879, they turned over to themselves as such agents $153.40, being a part of her widow\u2019s award. They also, with Mrs. Kent\u2019s consent, sold the whole of the personal property and turned over to themselves, as her agents, one-half of the proceeds of said sale, as follows: First, the sum of $120, and then the sum of $1,277.27^-, making in all the sum of $1,397.27 held by them as her half of the proceeds of said sale.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\" pgmap=\"542\">During their agency they also rented for Mrs. Kent the farm in which she had a life estate, for $1,000 a year. Mrs. Kent did not use the whole of the proceeds of this rent, and whatever sum was not expended by lier they retained as her agents. In 1891, Frederick J. White succeeded them as agent of Mrs. Kent. At that time Turner and Grover had in their possession moneys belonging to Mrs. Kent amounting to $4,208.38, which they paid to White. White acted as her agent until the time of her death, renting the farm for the same rent of $1,000 a year. At the time of her death, which occurred May 6, 1893, he had in his hands, as her agent, the sum of $3,573.12.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-9\" pgmap=\"542(39) 543(213)\">This sum he paid to Grover after Mrs. Kent\u2019s death, the latter receiving it in his capacity as executor of Henry Kent, deceased. George H. Wilson, the appellee, was appointed administrator of the estate of Mrs. Kent, and brought this, an action in assumpsit against Turner and Grover as executors of the estate of Heney Kent to recover the moneys paid Grover by White. The executors contended that Mrs. Kent, under the will of her husband, took a life estate only in the real and personal property devised and bequeathed to her with power of disposal, and that as the fund in question was not disposed of bv her during her lifetime, by will or otherwise, it passed under the 7th clause to them as executors, and that it was their duty and right as executors to retain the money received from White, and distribute it to nephews and nieces of the testator entitled under the will to take it. The appellee contended that the sum of $153.40 paid Mrs. Kent on her widow\u2019s award was her absolute property, independent of the will, and that the will vested in her absolutely the proceeds of the sale of one-half of the personal property, and the rents, issues and profits of the farm. The cause was submitted to the court without a jury. The court found the issues for the appellee and rendered judgment in his favor as administrator for $1,430.67\u00a3. The executors prosecute this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-4\" pgmap=\"543\">Appellants\u2019 Brief, J. F.

The real controversy presented by this record is as to the true construction of the will of Henry Kent, deceased.</p> <p id=\"b546-7\" pgmap=\"546(183) 547(425) 548(386)\">The contention of the appellee is that the fourth clause of the will gives to the wife, Haney C., as her absolute and sole property, one-half of the property of the testator, and all the rents, issues and profits accruing from the farm during the lifetime of the wife, and that a limitation of either personal or real property, after an absolute gift, is repugnant to the first gift and void. Hence, the argument is that the subsequent provisions of the will, directing the dispositions of such portions of the subject-matter of the gift as the wife should not dispose of during her life, are to be deemed inoperative and of no force or effect. We concede that numerous authorities supporting that view are to be found, in fact, many are cited by counsel for appellee, but we think that the trend of more modern adjudications is not in harmony with it. The question now of first importance in the. construction of a will is, what was the intention of the testator. All mere rules of construction are/egarded as having been, devised for the sole purpose of aiding the court to ar rive at a correct solution of that question. This intention is to be ascertained from the whole will and all of its parts taken together, from a full view and consideration of everything within the \u201c four corners \u201d of the instrument. Every clause and provision is, if possible, to be given effect and operation according to the wish of the testator. The tendency of American decisions is to reconcile every apparent repugnancy, so much so, that Mr. Redfield, in his work on Wills (p. 453), was moved to declare \u201c that it is now becoming very uncommon with us to hear a court declare a will, or any of its provisions, wholly inoperative by reason of repugnancy or uncertainty.\u201d The rejection of a clause in a will was denominated in Jenks v. Jackson, 127 Ill. 341, \u201cA desperate remedy to be resorted to only in case of necessity.\u201d The primary consideration, it was said in Walker v. Pritchard, 121 Ill. 221, \u201cis the ascertainment of the intention of the testator, and it is wholly immaterial in what part of the will the words are found which indicate such intention.\u201d While the appellee may well insist that the 4th clause of the will, if considered independently of all others, vested absolute property and ownership in the wife, still a careful consideration of the whole will and of each provision, discloses very unmistakably that such was not the intention of the testator, but that he had in view a different disposition of so much of the property given to the wife as she might not use, consume or dispose of during her lifetime. . This purpose he attempted to carry out by the different provisions of his will, and we think there is no inflexible rule which operates to render his effort nugatory. The rule, as we think it ought to be, and believe it now to be, is, that though a will in its first clause may by its express terms so devise or bequeath real or personal property that the devisee or donee would be vested with the fee or absolute ownership if the clause alone be considered, yet if it appears from subsequent clauses of the will that the unmistakable intention of the testator was to vest such donee or devisee with an estate for life only, with power to dispose of or convey the property, and with remainder over to specific legatees, the latter clauses are not to be declared inoperative, but are to be considered as modifying the former, and as qualifying and reducing the fee that is apparently donated to an estate for life, with power of disposal. This view is supported, as we think, by Hamlin v. U. S. Express Co., 107 Ill. 443; Walker v. Pritchard, 141 Ill. 221; Siddons v. Cockrell, 131 Ill. 653. Therefore it is our opinion that Haney Kent, by the will in question, took only a life estate in the personal property bequeathed to her, and in the rents collected from the farm with power of disposal. Hor do we think the- sale made of the personal property by the executors with the consent of Mrs. Kent is to be deemed a disposition of the property by her. Personal property could not well be held and enjoyed in common by the widow and the executors. The sale was made, no doubt, out of convenience or from the necessities of the case, and not with the view upon the part of Mrs. Kent of disposing of the property in the sense in which she had the right to dispose of it under the will. It is clear that she did not so regard the sale, for she made no distinction between the funds procured by the sale and funds accruing from rents of the farm, but suffered them to be mingled together, and all must, we think; be regarded as alike remaining undisposed of within the meaning of the will. Mrs. Kent received from the executors the sum of $153.40, balance of her awardas wido wunder the statute. She was entitled to this independent of the will, and it became her sole, separate and absolute property. She, however, made no distinction between it and the other moneys, in which she had but a qualified interest. All, with her knowledge and acquiescence, was mingled together and became indistinguishable. She drew from the intermingled fund indiscriminately, and evidently had no intent to preserve intact that which she owned absolutely. It is beyond the power of a court now to separate it, or to say that she did not use it during her lifetime, as she used a much greater amount from the fund.</p> <p id=\"b548-5\" pgmap=\"548\">It follows from what has been said that in our opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court can not be maintained. .It is therefore reversed, and the cause will not be remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
