Insurance\u2014Ownership of Property\u2014Conditions.\u2014A condition that if the insured is not the sole owner of the property, the policy shall be void, is reasonable and valid, and a violation of it will defeat a recovery.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b271-8\" pgmap=\"271\">2. Same\u2014Failure to Disclose the State of the Title.\u2014A failure by the applicant for insurance to disclose the true state of his title, if he is not the sole owner, will be fatal, although he was not questioned as to that matter.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b271-9\" pgmap=\"271\">8. Same\u2014A Half Owner May Insure the Whole.\u2014The owner of a one-half interest in property and in the possession and management of the same, may, under instructions from the other owners, effect insurance to its entire value upon it in his own name, and recover the total amount of loss.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b271-10\" pgmap=\"271\">4.

Same\u2014Insured Need Not be the Owner of the Property.\u2014It is not necessary to the existence of an insurable interest that the insured should be the owner of any part of the property. Generally the persons charged either specially, by law, custom or contract, with the duty of caring for and protecting property in behalf of others, or having a right to protect such property, though not bound thereto by law, or who will receive benefit from the continued existence of the property, whether they have or have not, any title to, estate in, lien upon, or possession of it, have an insurable interest.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-12\" pgmap=\"271\">Memor\u00e1ndum.\u2014Action on a policy of insurance.

Each policy contained the following provision:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\" pgmap=\"272\">\u201c This entire policy, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed hereon or added hereto, shall be void if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole ownership, or if the subject of the insurance be a building on ground not owned by the insured in fee simple.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\" pgmap=\"272\">The boat while moored at a wharf took fire, to extinguish which she was pumped full of water and sunk.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\" pgmap=\"272\">Appellant notified the companies, and they, still in ignorance of the fact that he was only a part owner, raised the boat at an expense to them of over $2,000. Proofs of loss were furnished, and the companies having learned of the extent of appellant\u2019s ownership, an appraisement of the loss was made under a stipulation that thereby appellees waived none of their rights.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\" pgmap=\"272\">The total insurance amounted to $9,500; the total loss was appraised at $9,857.10.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-11\" pgmap=\"272\">The parties being unable to agree, these actions were brought by appellant in the Circuit Court of Cook County.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-12\" pgmap=\"272\">By stipulation a jury was waived and the causes submitted to the court for trial, one hearing being applicable to the three causes.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-13\" pgmap=\"272(43) 273(75)\">In the opening of the case before the court, the attorneys for the defendants stated that the defendants were each content to pay the plaintiff, as one-half owner of the vessel, one-half the amount of the loss, less the expense of raising the vessel and putting her in good condition, provided that the judgment of the court for that amount should not be appealed from, or any writ of error sued out on the same; but this offer was made upon the express condition that the judgment of the trial court should be final and binding upon all the parties, and that this proposition would not stand if the judgment of the court below was appealed from.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-4\" pgmap=\"273\">The total loss being fixed at $9,857.10, the half of which is $4,928.55, and the companies having paid for raising the boat $2,331.40, the amount which, under the offer of appellees would be paid to appellant, was $2,597.15.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">The court found the issues for the plaintiff and rendered judgments against appellees, being against each for its proportionate part of the total sum of $2,601.12.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273\">From these judgments the plaintiff prosecutes these appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-7\" pgmap=\"273\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, Egbert Eae, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\" pgmap=\"273\">An averment of ownership is sustained by proof of his insurable interest only.

Co., 1 Metc. 16; 1 Phil. on Ins., 219, Sec. 391; 1 Arnould on Ins., 146 and note.</p> <opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b274-8\" pgmap=\"274\">Mr. Presiding Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A0q\" pgmap=\"274\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b274-9\" pgmap=\"274\">In May on Insurance, Sec. 287 A, the following rule is announced :</p> <blockquote id=\"b274-10\" pgmap=\"274\">\u201c A condition that if the insured is not the sole, entire and unconditional owner, the policy shall be void, is reasonable and valid, and violation of it will prevent recovery. And failure to disclose the real state of the title, if not sole, etc., will be fatal, although the insured was not questioned as to that fact.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b274-11\" pgmap=\"274(11) 275(64)\">It is insisted by the plaintiff that all the authorities tending to maintain the rule laid down by May, are where the clause in the policy was that if the insured is not the sole, entire and unconditional owner of the property the policy shall be void; and that as the words \u201c of the property \u201d are not found in the policies issued to the plaintiff, the rule is not applicable to them.</p> <p id=\"b275-4\" pgmap=\"275\">That the plaintiff had an insurable interest to the extent of the entire value of the property is not disputed. That is, while the owner of but one-half the property, his relation to all of it was such that he could have effected insurance to its entire value upon it in his own name and recovered the total amount of loss. May on Insurance, Sec. 76.</p> <p id=\"b275-5\" pgmap=\"275\">It is, strictly speaking, always the insurable interest which the insured has in the property, either because of his ownership or because of his relation to the real owners and his right to insure for their benefit, that is insured; that is, it is the loss to such interest in the property, that, to the extent of the insurance, is paid by the insurer. May on Insurance, Sec. 72.</p> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275\">It is not necessary to the existence of an insurable interest that the insured should be the owner of any part of the property. \u201c Generally, persons charged either specially, by law, custom or contract, with the duty of caring for and protecting property in behalf of others, or having a right so to protect such property, though not bound thereto by law, or who will receive benefit from the continued existence of the property whether they have or have not any title to, estate in, lien upon; or possession of it, have an insurable interest.\u201d May on Insurance, Sec. 80; Lewin, Trusts and Trustees, 383; Pope v. Western Ins Co., 19 La. 49.</p> <p id=\"b275-7\" pgmap=\"275\">Such being the nature of a mere insurable interest, to say that the language of these policies, \u201c if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole ownership,\u201d means unconditional and sole ownership of the insurable interest of the insured, and does not mean sole and unconditional ownership of the property in which the insurable interest exists, is to rob the words of all significance\u2014to make of them a meaningless jangle.</p> <p id=\"b276-3\" pgmap=\"276\">We have not been referred to any case in which the words \u201c unconditional and sole ownership \u201d or \u201c unconditional and sol\u00e9 owner \u201d have been held to refer to anything other than ownership in or of the property, an interest in which is insured.</p> <p id=\"b276-4\" pgmap=\"276\">It is argued that the case against the Sun Insurance Company differs from the others. We have examined the very imperfect records and are unable to find therefrom that the policy issued by that company is materially variant from the others.</p> <p id=\"b276-5\" pgmap=\"276\">Other matters are argued, but the conclusion at which we have arrived renders a discussion of them unnecessary. The judgment of the Circuit Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b276-6\" pgmap=\"276\">Mb. Justice Gaby. I am not satisfied with the reason for, but concur in, the result.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
