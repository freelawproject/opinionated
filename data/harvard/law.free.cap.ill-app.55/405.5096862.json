Chattel Mortgages\u2014Rights of the Parties After Possession Taken.\u2014After default and possession taken by a mortgagee of personal property, the legal title is vested in him and he can maintain an action at law for a seizure or an injury done to such property. But the mortgagor retains an interest in the goods until divested thereof by sale under the provisions of the mortgage, or by lapse of time his right of redemption is lost.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-9\" pgmap=\"401\">2. Same\u2014Rights of the Parties at Common Law.\u2014By the old common law, a mortgage of personal property gave an absolute title to the mortgagee on breach of condition. No process of foreclosure was necessary, and there was no right of redemption.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-10\" pgmap=\"401\">3. Mortgages of Real Property\u2014Regret! Estates Vested in Mortgagee.\u2014In respect to mortgages of real property at common law, the legal estate vested in the mortgagee and was forfeited upon default; equity established the right of redemption after default.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-11\" pgmap=\"401\">4. Same\u2014At Law and in Equity\u2014Injury to Reversion.\u2014A mortgage of land is one thing at law and another in equity; at law it is an estate, in equity it is but a security. Notwithstanding this, a mortgagor of lands may maintain an action at law for an injury to his reversion.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b401-12\" pgmap=\"401(30) 402(17)\">5. Mortgages\u2014Mere Securities. \u2014The law courts now recognize mortgages of all kinds as mere securities. The title may be differently regarded and treated in different forums, but until foreclosure themortgagor has an interest in the property which is recognized at law as well as in equity.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402\">6. Same\u2014The Modem Doctrine.\u2014While courts frequently speak of the title of the mortgagee being absolute after default, it is not to be understood that the ownership is absolute. Nowhere is it now held that upon forfeiture the mortgagee may dispose of the property without reference to the interests of the mortgagor.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-6\" pgmap=\"402\">7. Reversion\u2014Injury to the, etc.\u2014The action of case is a proper proceeding for an injury to property when the interest in it is in reversion.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-7\" pgmap=\"402\">8. Reversion\u2014In a Descriptive Sense and Otherwise.\u2014The term reversion is often used in such a sense that it is descriptive, only, of an interest in land. It is also used when speaking of the right to a return of such personal property as does not perish with a short term of \u201c using,\u201d the possession of which property the general owner has temporarily parted with.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-8\" pgmap=\"402\">9. Mortgagor of Chattels\u2014Rights Extinguished upon Default and Possession Taken.\u2014A mortgagor of chattels has, after default and possession taken by the mortgagee, no legal estate in the mortgaged property; his interest is equitable only. The property can not be taken upon execution against him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-9\" pgmap=\"402\">10. Same\u2014No Rights at Law after Default.\u2014Having, after default and possession taken by the mortgagee, no legal estate in or legal claim to the mortgaged property, his relation to the same being that of a cestui que trust, it would seem that a mortgagor can not maintain at law an action based upon his equitable interest.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-10\" pgmap=\"402\">11. Same\u2014A cestui que trust, or other person having only an equitable interest, can not, in general, bring an action in the courts of common law against his trustee, or even a third person, unless in cases where the action is against a mere wrongdoer, and for an injury to the actual possession of the cestui que trust.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-11\" pgmap=\"402\">13.

And also for that, whereas, said plaintiffs heretofore, to wit, on October 21, 1893, in said county, were the owners of certain goods, wares and merchandise, consisting of a large stock of gentlemen\u2019s furnishing goods and similar articles, and also divers counters, shelves, safes, furniture and store fixtures all of the value of, to wit, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000), and also the leasehold of the store and premises known as numbers 240 and 242 Monroe street, in the city of Chicago, in said county, upon which said goods and chattels and said leasehold said plaintiffs had on the day aforesaid there executed and delivered to one Emanuel Frankenthal a chattel mortgage to secure an indebtedness then there owing him by them, amounting to one hundred and elexrnn thousand three hundred and eighty-two and ninety-seven one hundredths dollars, and said Emanuel Frankenthal had then there taken possession of said property under said mortgage, and of the premises xvherein the same was situated, and xvas holding the same for sale, and preparing to sell the same under said mortgage for the purpose of applying the proceeds derived from such sale to the payment of the indebtedness due him from said plaintiffs, which was secured by said mortgage.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\" pgmap=\"405\">And thereupon, and after the execution of said mortgage, and while said Emanuel Frankenthal was in possession of said prop'erty thereunder as aforesaid, said defendants, contriving and intending to injure said plaintiffs in that behalf on November 2,1893, and on divers days thereafter, to wit, up to and including the 21st day of November, 1893, in the county aforesaid, wrongfully broke and entered said premises, with a great mob of people, and there seized upon said goods, and took violent possession thereof and of said premises, and excluded said.Emanuel Frankenthal and these plaintiffs therefrom, scattered said goods about, and greatly marred, spoiled and injured the same, and also hindered and prevented the sale thereof under said mortgage for a long space of time, to wit, until the 21st day of November, 1893, and also broke open the safe of said plaintiffs and seized and destroyed their private books and papers, and other wrongs to said plaintiffs then and there did, to their great damage.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\" pgmap=\"405\">And said plaintiffs further aver that said stock of merchandise consisted principally of goods designed and purchased by said plaintiffs for sale during the fall of the year, and which are usually sold during that season, to wit, during October and November, and for which goods there is no ready market nor can advantageous sales thereof be made except during those months; and that by reason of the wrongful acts of said defendants and their agents as aforesaid, the sale of said goods was hindered and prevented during the time at which an advantageous sale thereof could be made, to wit, to November 21,1893; Avhereby said goods were greatly injured, depreciated in value and great loss and damage resulted to said plaintiffs, to wit, twenty-five thousand dollars (\u00a725,000).</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\" pgmap=\"405\">Wherefore said plaintiffs say that they are injured and have sustained damage to the amount of fifty thousand dollars (\u00a750,000), and therefore they bring suit, etc.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-3\" pgmap=\"406\">Brief of Plaintiffs in Error, Tenney, Church &amp; Coffeen, Attorneys.</attorneys><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\" pgmap=\"406\">Where the mortgagee on breach of any of the conditions of the mortgage has lawfully taken possession of the property thereunder, the legal title passes to him; but we have always understood that the term \u201c legal title \u201d was used in this connection in distinction from the equitable title, just as it is said that the legal title to land is in a trustee although the real beneficial ownership may be in another. The right to hold and the power to convey are in the trustee. Just so the right to hold and the power to convey are in the mortgagee under the circumstances stated; but this does not mean that he has become the unqualified owner of the property. On the contrary, it seems to be clear that the equitable title, the beneficial ownership, still remains in the mortgagor. Durfee v. Grinnell, 69 Ill. 371.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\" pgmap=\"406\">Certain propositions seem to be well established, viz.:</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\" pgmap=\"406\">1. That although the legal title passes to the mortgagee, and in some cases is said to become absolute, yet this is only for the purpose of enabling the mortgagee to collect his mortgage debt.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\" pgmap=\"406\">2. That the mortgagee is responsible to the mortgagor for the due care and honest disposal of the property, and is accountable to him for any surplus.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-9\" pgmap=\"406\">These propositions are certainly inconsistent with any theory of absolute, unqualified ownership in the mortgagee, and show that the real equitable owner is still the mortgagor. We believe they are entirely sound.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-10\" pgmap=\"406\">A leading case on the subject is that of Charter v. Stevens, 3 Den. 33, in which the Supreme Court of blew York held :</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-12\" pgmap=\"406\">1. The execution of the mortgage transferred to the mortgagee a defeasible title, which became absolute at law by failure to pay at the stipulated time.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-13\" pgmap=\"406\">2. The mortgagor, however, was not thereby divested of all interest in the property, for he still had an equity of redemption which a court of equity would protect and enforce.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-14\" pgmap=\"406(19) 407(106)\">3. When the mortgagee sold part of the property for sufficient to pay the mortgage debt, this was equivalent to absolute payment, just as though the mortgagor had tendered and the mortgagee had accepted the amount due, and the mortgagee\u2019s title in the property remaining unsold was thereby extinguished, and a subsequent sale thereof by the mortgagee was a conversion for which he was liable to the mortgagor in trover.

Grinnell, 69 Ill. 371, the court, by Mr. Justice Walker, says:</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-12\" pgmap=\"407\">\u201c There can be no question that a chattel mortgage is but a conditional sale, and when the mortgagor fails to perform the condition, the title, so far as it is held by the mortgagor, vests in the mortgagee. In this case the condition upon which the property was to vest, was that the mortgagees should feel themselves unsafe or insecure. They reserve the right in the mortgage to exercise the power, and when they did so, the title to the property vested in the mortgagees. But according to the stipulation contained in the mortgage, when they took the property they became liable to pay the mortgagor for any surplus that might remain after the mortgage debt, interest and proper charges were paid. But this liability in no wise prevented the title from vesting in them as joint purchasers.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-13\" pgmap=\"407(91) 408(33)\">\u201cHntil a breach of the condition in the mortgage, the mortgagor holds a contingent interest in the property that is liable to levy and sale on execution or attachment; but where the condition of the mortgage becomes forfeited, the title to the property becomes absolute in the mortgagee, and he is then vested with the legal title and may proceed under the mortgage. After the maturity of the debt or the failure of the condition upon which the mortgagor may retain possession, the mortgagee has the legal right to reduce the property to possession, and, having done so, he has the legal right to retain it and an execution or attachment can not deprive him of it.\u201d Pike v. Colvin, 67 Ill. 227.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-4\" pgmap=\"408\">\u201c It is well settled that upon failure of the mortgagor to perform the condition of the mortgage, the legal title to the chattel mortgage becomes vested absolutely in the mort- \u25a0 gagee.\u201d Simmons v. Jenkins, 70 Ill. 479. See, also, Whittemore v. Fischer, 132 Ill. 243, 256; Dupee v. Gibson, 36 Ill. 197; Rhimes v. Phelps, 3 Gilm. 455; Larmon v. Carpenter, 70 Ill. 549; McConnell v. People, 84 Ill. 583.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-5\" pgmap=\"408\">It is needless to cite authorities that after condition broken or after the mortgagee has taken possession under the mortgage, the mortgagor has no interest in the chattels Avhich is subject to legal process or cognizable at law. Pike v. Colvin, 67 Ill. 227; 2 Wait\u2019s Actions &amp; Defenses, 217; Gifford v. Hilson, 18 Brad. 214; Glass v. Doane, 15 Brad. 66.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\" pgmap=\"408\">Here the appellee has only an equitable title, and that never confers the right to sue at law.

The property in goods can only belong to and be vested in one person at one time. Lands may be so conveyed that several persons may possess in them at the sam\u00e9 time several distinct vested estates of freehold, one of them being in possession, others in remainder, or the last, perhaps, in reversion, but the law knows no such thing as the remainder or reversion of a chattel. It recognizes only the simple property in goods, coupled, or not, Avith the right of immediate possession.\u201d Williams on Personal Property, 7th Ed., Chap. 2, * page 22; Dicey on Parties to an Action, 344; Broom on Parties to Actions, * page 198 (contained in Vol. 56, Law Library, Phila. reprint).</p> <footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b402-15\" pgmap=\"402\">This case was, upon the hearing, reversed, and is so reported in Vol. 54 Ill.

Bradford, 122 Mass. 127.</p> <p id=\"b409-8\" pgmap=\"409\">In respect to mortgages of real property, also, the legal estate vested in the mortgagee and was forfeited upon default; equity established the right of redemption after default. Jones on Mortgages, Vol. 2, Sec. 11.</p> <p id=\"b409-9\" pgmap=\"409\">A mortgage of land is one thing at law and another in equity; at law it is an estate, in a court of chancery it is but a security.</p> <p id=\"b409-10\" pgmap=\"409\">notwithstanding this, a mortgagor of lands may maintain an action at law for an injury to his reversion. Jones on Mortgages, Sec. 664.</p> <p id=\"b410-4\" pgmap=\"410\">The law courts, following the rule first set up in equity, have come to recognize mortgages of all kinds to be exactly w ha': th sy are\u2014mere securities. Th e title may be differently regarded and treated in different forums, but the actual fact that, until foreclosure has in some way been had, the mortgagor has an interest in the property, is recognized at law as well as in equity.</p> <p id=\"b410-5\" pgmap=\"410\">While courts have, and do frequently, speak of the title of the mortgagee being, after forfeiture, that is after default, absolute, they do not mean that the ownership of the mortgagee is absolute. Ho where is it now held that upon forfeiture the mortgagee may sell the property, give it away or destroy it without reference to or consideration for any right or interest of the mortgagor. Waite v.

Durfee v. Grinnell, supra; Simmons v.

Ed., is that \u201c a cestui que trust or other person having only an equitable interest can not, in general, sue in the courts of common law against his trustee, or even a third person, unless in cases where the action is against a mere wrongdoer, and for an injury to the actual possession of the cestui que trust?</p> <p id=\"b411-10\" pgmap=\"411\">That it would be well if, in such a case as this, where the mortgagor seeks merely a judgment for money, and the value of his interest in the property is easily ascertainable, being its worth, less the claim of the mortgagee thereon, the mortgagor might bring suit at law in his own name, we are disposed to think.</p> <p id=\"b411-12\" pgmap=\"411\">We do not regard the mortgagor as remediless in such a case as this.</p> <p id=\"b411-13\" pgmap=\"411\">The mortgagee has a right of action against appellees for their invasion of his lawful possession, and in such action he can recover not only the damage he has suffered but also the damage done to the mortgagor.

Moore, 82 Ill. 240; Sutherland on Damages, Vol. 1, 210, Vol. 3, 474.</p> <p id=\"b411-17\" pgmap=\"411\">It does not appear in this case that the mortgagee refuses to bring such action, but if he does, or if he fails to vigorously prosecute the same, we do not think appellee remediless.</p> <p id=\"b412-3\" pgmap=\"412\">We clo not regard the allegation as to ownership of books and papers as sufficient to warrant a recovery for the taking of such articles.</p> <p id=\"b412-4\" pgmap=\"412\">Upon further consideration we are satisfied that in this State there is no authority for the maintenance of such a suit as this.</p> <p id=\"b412-5\" pgmap=\"412\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <author id=\"b412-6\" pgmap=\"412\">Gary, J.</author> <p id=\"AfP\" pgmap=\"412\">In Yates v. Joyce, 11 Johns. 136, the plaintiff had only an equity, being but an assignee (which was no' title at law) of a judgment which was a lien upon premises wasted by the defendant; yet he had his action. In the eighty years which have since elapsed, courts of law have advanced in noticing equities.</p> <p id=\"b412-7\" pgmap=\"412\">A chattel mortgage is not a conditional sale. If it were, the debt, the consideration of the transfer of such title as passes, would be satisfied by the transfer. But not being satisfied, the mortgagee may sue, and it is a defense fro tanto to the mortgagor and his surety, that the mortgagee has not dealt fairly with the mortgaged chattels.</p> <p id=\"b412-8\" pgmap=\"412\">\u25a0 Courts of law will inquire into the matter. Phares v. Barbour, 49 Ill. 270; Waite v. Dennison, 51 Ill. 319.</p> <p id=\"b412-9\" pgmap=\"412\">. I think the judgment should be reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
