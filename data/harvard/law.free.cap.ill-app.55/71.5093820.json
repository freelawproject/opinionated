The declaration contained only the common counts, and the only plea was the general issue. In answer to a rule entered against him the plaintiff below filed the following bill of particulars, viz.: \u201c This action was brought to recover the sum of $2,000 due from the defendant to the plaintiff upon the following item of account: \u201c 1892, May 1, to amount of reward offered by defendant, Jesse Foval, to plaintiff, Herman Boehmer, for accumulation of evidence regarding the embezzlement from said Foval of certain amounts of money, to wit, $5,000, and for producing said evidence in the Circuit Court of Calhoun County, Illinois, at the October term, A. D. 1890; said offer of reward having been made by said Foval on or about, to wit, April 17, 1890.\u201d The defense was that the agreement to pay the reward was upon condition that the money which had been embezzled should be recovered. The defendant below contended also that if the evidence in behalf of the plaintiff showed a contract other than as claimed by the defendant, that it was illegal and void because the consideration thereof was that the plaintiff would testify and procure others to testify in behalf of the defendant in a suit pending or to be brought by him against one Isaac Foval for the recovery of the money that he had lost by embezzlement. The cause was submitted to a jury and a verdict returned for the defendant below. This is a writ of error sued out to reverse the judgment rendered upon the verdict.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\" pgmap=\"68\">Brief of Plaintiff in Error, Jas.

The consideration was entire and, if part of it was illegal, the promise founded upon it was void. 3 Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, page 887. It is complained that the court, by instruction No. 2, given for the defendant below, left the question of the legality of the contract to the determination of the jury. Whether it was a part of the agreement that Boehmer should testify as a witness for Foval was a question of fact for the jury to settle. The legal effect of such a contract, if made, was a point in law to be determined by the court. Instruction No. 2 in substance advised the jury that before the plaintiff could recover, it must appear from the evidence that the contract was one that the law would enforce. It was followed by instruction No. 3, to wit: \u201c The law will not enforce an illegal contract, that is, a contract made against the law, public policy or good morals, and if the jury believe from the evidence that plaintiff, Boehmer, had a contract with the defendant by the terms of which said Boehmer should testify as a witness for said Foval, and induce others to testify for said Foval, then the plaintiff, Boehmer, can not recover in this case, because such a contract is illegal.\u201d Though given separate numbers, the instructions constituted one complete charge to the jury, and considered as Such, it seems entirely clear that the court decided the point in law and submitted to the jury the issue of fact. We have examined the evidence and find it supports the verdict. The judgment is, it seems to us, right upon the merits. It is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
