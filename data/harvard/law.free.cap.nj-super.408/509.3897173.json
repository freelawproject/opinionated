On October 21, 2005 at 12:26 a.m., Officer Ted Wittke of the Hazlet Township Police Department was on routine patrol in uniform and in a marked patrol car. While stopped at a red traffic light on Holmdel Road, at its intersection with Route 35, the officer saw a small Acura sports car also stopped at the light facing him in the opposite direction. At some point, Wittke also saw two rounded objects hanging from the Acura\u2019s rearview mirror.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Wittke testified that he will stop a vehicle on a case-by-case basis for items hanging from a rearview mirror based on the size of the items, how far they hang down from the rearview mirror, and whether he believed they obstructed the driver\u2019s view. In this ease, he decided to stop the Acura because the items hanging from the rearview mirror were larger than a Christmas tree air freshener, and were swaying and hanging approximately seven inches from the rearview mirror at the driver\u2019s eye level. The officer said that he \u201cobserved [the Acura] had items hanging from the [rearview] mirror, which [he] believe[d] obstructed the view of the driver.\u201d It was later discovered that the hanging items were boxing gloves measuring 31/2 inches high and 31/2 inches wide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Wittke continued that when the light turned green, both vehicles turned onto Route 35 north, with the Acura in front of his patrol ear. He activated his overhead lights, but the Acura did not immediately stop. Instead, it coasted to the shoulder, traveled approximately two hundred feet, and entered a parking lot. Wittke became uncomfortable with the time it took the driver to stop. He illuminated the inside of the Acura with a spotlight and saw the passenger, later identified as defendant, leaning forward with his shoulders moving. At this point, the officer suspected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>defendant may be either reaching for a weapon or destroying narcotics. He was afraid for his safety, so he radioed for back-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">After the Acura stopped, Wittke exited his patrol car and cautiously approached the driver\u2019s side. When he looked inside the vehicle, he saw defendant sit straight back and stop moving. He then advised the driver that he stopped him because of the items hanging from the rearview mirror. While the driver was taking the items down, the officer saw that defendant moved around and placed his left hand in his left pant pocket. Wittke immediately instructed defendant to remove his hand from the pocket and place his hands where the officer could see them. Defendant complied and told the officer not to worry about him.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Wittke also testified that as a result of defendant\u2019s actions, he became increasingly apprehensive and anxious and radioed for additional backup. Officer Michael Duncan and Canine Officer Kevin Geoghan arrived at the scene. Wittke then had defendant exit the vehicle, at which time the officer observed that defendant was \u201cvery, very nervous ... his hands were shaking ... [and][h]is speech wasn\u2019t very clear.\u201d Based on Wittke\u2019s experience in prior narcotics arrests, he believed that defendant was concealing narcotics. Thus, he asked Officer Geoghan to conduct a canine \u201csniff of the vehicle.\u201d The dog indicated the presence of narcotics on the passenger side door; however, a search of the passenger area revealed no narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Wittke then advised defendant \u201cthat the dog did alert positively for the smell of narcotics on [defendant\u2019s] side of the vehicle.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t do drugs. You go ahead and search me.\u201d Defendant then began pulling items from his pocket, including a pack of cigarettes. Wittke\u2019s search of the cigarette pack revealed a glassine plastic bag containing a white substance, which based on his training and experience, he believed was cocaine. Wittke advised defendant of his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights and placed him under arrest. A further search of defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>dant\u2019s person revealed another glycine bag containing \u201csix yellowish pills[,]\u201d which defendant admitted were Ecstasy (methamphetamine).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Wittke also issued the driver a summons for violating <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74, based on the items hanging from the rearview mirror. The driver pled guilty and paid a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress, contending that the stop was unlawful because <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74 does not prohibit items hanging from a rearview mirror, and because the boxing gloves did not unduly interfere with the driver\u2019s vision. Finding Wittke\u2019s testimony credible, the motion judge denied the motion, concluding that the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver had committed a motor vehicle violation. The judge reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">I think that it arguably falls within the definition of this statute. I think that the purpose that windshields be unobstructed that if there is something that is swinging back and forth, it could obstruct or interfere with a driver\u2019s vision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Did it unduly, I mean, that would be a question for the Court trying that traffic offense. But it was enough to bring it to the officer\u2019s attention and I find that it was a reasonable decision on his part and it falls within the broad parameters of Paragraph 3 [of <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">It\u2019s true that there is no case in New Jersey that says that this is acceptable and that it\u2014it\u2019s also true it doesn\u2019t outright specify that items can\u2019t hang from the rearview mirror. But as I indicated, it can be construed as unduly interfering in the larger, the obstruction that would go toward whether the motorist would be convicted of the offense, whether it would unduly interfere. And as I said, that\u2019s not before me. It\u2019s whether the officer acted reasonably in stopping the car for that infraction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Our review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is \u201cexceedingly narrow.\u201d <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 470, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146,161-62, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). We give great deference to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings and will not \u201cengage in an independent assessment of the evidence as if [we] were the court of first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471, 724 A.2d 234. We also give deference to the trial judge\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 724 A.2d 234; <em>Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 161, 199 A.2d 809. However, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>not entitled to any special deference!,]\u201d and is subject to de novo review. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (citations omitted); <em>see also Finderne Mgt. Co. v. Barrett, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 573, 955 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In reviewing a motion to suppress, we \u201cmust uphold the factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s decision so long as those findings are \u2018supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007) (quoting <em>Locurto, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 724 A.2d 234); <em>see also State v. Alvarez, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 562-64, 570 A.2d 459 (App. Div.1990). We will reverse only if we are convinced that the trial judge\u2019s factual findings are \u201cso clearly mistaken \u2018that the interests of justice demand intervention and correction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 927 A.2d 1250 (quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809.) \u201cIn those circumstances solely [we] \u2018appraise the record as if [we] were deciding the matter at inception and make [our] own findings and conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809). Applying these standards, we continue our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Law enforcement officers \u201cmay stop motor vehicles where they have a reasonable or articulable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation has occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 553, 570 A.2d 451 (App.Div.1990). \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d means that \u201cthe police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906 (1968). \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is \u201cless than proof ... by a preponderance of evidence,\u201d and \u201cless demanding than that for probable cause,\u201d but must be something greater \u201cthan an \u2018inchoate or unparticularized suspicion or\u2019 \u2018hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>1, 7, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1, 10 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cThe fact that the officer does not have the state of mind hypothesized by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the search and seizure [or investigatory stop] does not invalidate the action taken, so long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, support the police conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 28, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991) (citing <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 220, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>695 (1984)); <em>see also Whren v. United States, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>806, 813, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1769, 1774, 135 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 89, 97 (1996) (citing <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>218, 236, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 477, 38 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>427, 441 (1973)). A Fourth Amendment violation is assessed based upon an objective viewing of the officer\u2019s actions considering the circumstances confronting him at that time, not his actual state of mind. <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>463, 470-71,105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2778, 2783, 86 L.Ed.2d 370, 378 (1985) (citing <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>128, 136, 138, 139 n. 13, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1717, 1722-24,1724 n. 13, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>168, 177-79, 178 n. 13 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Ultimately, \u201ccourts will not inquire into the motivation of a police officer whose stop of an automobile is based upon a traffic violation committed in his presence.\u201d <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 588 A.2d 834. \u201cThe fact that the justification for the stop was pretextual ... [is] irrelevant,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 588 A.2d 834. The State need not prove that the suspected motor vehicle violation has in fact occurred, only that the officer had a reasonable, articulable and objective basis for justifying the stop. <em>Locurto, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 724 A.2d 234 (citing <em>State v. Williamson, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>302, 304, 650 A.2d 348 (1994)). Investigatory stops are valid in situations where the objective basis for the stop was a minor traffic infraction. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 724 A.2d 234 (finding the stop justified based upon the officer\u2019s observations that the defendant was driving \u201cat \u2018a high rate of speed\u2019 \u201d in a zone where \u201c[t]he posted speed limit was thirty-five miles per hour[]\u201d); <em>see also State v. Cohen, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 380-81, 790 A.2d 202 (App.Div. 2002) (holding that an officer who subjectively believed a vehicle\u2019s tinted windows were darkened beyond the acceptable limit had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>reasonable and articulable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation had occurred, thereby justifying the stop); <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 380, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997) (finding the stop justified based upon the officer\u2019s observations of the defendant weaving in and out of lanes); <em>Murphy, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548-49, 570 A.2d 451 (finding the stop justified where the vehicle\u2019s license plate was in a diagonal position, which the officer believed violated <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-33); <em>State v. Carter, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 237, 561 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989) (finding the vehicle stop justified based upon the officer\u2019s observations that defendant was tailgating another vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Here, in denying the motion to suppress, the judge found Wittke\u2019s testimony credible, and concluded the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant committed a motor vehicle violation justifying the stop. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">Every motor vehicle having a windshield shall be equipped with at least one device in good working order for cleaning rain, snow or other moisture from the windshield so as to provide clear vision for the driver, and all such devices shall be so constructed and installed as to be operated or controlled by the driver. No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any sign, poster, sticker or other nontransparent material upon the front windshield, wings, deflectors, side shields, corner lights adjoining windshield or front side windows of such vehicle other than a certificate or other article required to be so displayed by statute or by regulations of the commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">No person shall drive any vehicle so constructed, equipped or loaded as to unduly interfere with the driver\u2019s vision to the front and to the sides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The State concedes that the first two paragraphs of the statute do not apply to items hanging from a rearview mirror. Accordingly, we need not address defendant\u2019s contentions regarding those paragraphs and the cases he cites interpreting paragraph two. However, the State posits that Wittke had a reasonable basis for the stop because the third paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 applies to the boxing gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Defendant responds that the third paragraph only applies to a vehicle that is \u201cconstructed, equipped or loaded\u201d with an offending item. Thus, because the boxing gloves are not part of the vehicle\u2019s construction, and do not represent the vehicle\u2019s equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ment or load, defendant concludes that Wittke lacked a reasonable articulable basis to believe that they violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument lacks merit. The third paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 applies to vehicles that are \u201cconstructed, equipped <em>or </em>loaded as <em>to </em>unduly interfere with the driver\u2019s vision to the front and to the sides.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Among other definitions, \u201cloaded\u201d is defined as \u201csomething carried or to be carried at one time or in one trip; burden; eargo[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, </em>792 (3d ed. 1988). Accordingly, \u201cloaded\u201d applies to objects that are carried and placed in a vehicle, including items hung from a rearview mirror, such as the boxing gloves. It is unreasonable to conclude that a statute regulating a driver\u2019s vision, such as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74, would not include such an object if, in fact, the object unduly interfered with the driver\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The question then is whether Wittke had a reasonable, articulable belief that the boxing gloves \u201cunduly interfered\u201d with the driver\u2019s vision. Defendant contends that the officer never articulated how the boxing gloves actually unduly interfered with the driver\u2019s vision and, thus, the statute was not satisfied. Defendant is wrong. Wittke testified that he believed the swaying boxing gloves \u201cobstructed\u201d the driver\u2019s view. Although <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74 does not define \u201cunduly interfere,\u201d \u201cunduly\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201cexcessively\u201d and \u201cinterfere\u201d is defined, in part as \u201cinterposed in a way that hinders or impedes.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>1178, 2492 (1981). \u201cObstruct\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201cto cut off from sight: shut out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1559.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Other states with statutes such as <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-74 follow one of three distinct approaches to construing obstruction violations which directly refer to the driver\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d or \u201cview.\u201d These are: (1) statutes that criminalizes the placement of objects that \u201cmaterially obstruct\u201d the driver\u2019s vision (the \u201cmaterially obstruct\u201d approach);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) statutes that criminalize the placement of objects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that \u201cobstruct\u201d or \u201cobstruct or impair the driver\u2019s vision\u201d (the \u201cmajority approach\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) statutes that criminalize the placement of any object between the driver and the windshield (the \u201cminority approach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The minority approach, followed primarily in Minnesota, <em>Minn. Stat. </em>\u00a7 169.71 (2006), and South Dakota, <em>S.D. Codified Laws </em>\u00a7 32-15-6 (Michie 2004), criminalizes any object placed between the driver and the windshield, regardless of its effect on the driver\u2019s vision. <em>See also Gerding v. Commissioner of Public Safety, </em>628 N.W.2d 197 (MinnApp.) (holding that officers have an objective basis for stopping any vehicle with \u201cany objects suspended between the driver and the windshield, other than sun visors and rear vision mirrors\u201d under <em>Minn.Stat. </em>\u00a7 169.71, subdivision 1), <em>rev. denied, </em>2001 Minn. LEXIS 510 (2001). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 does not flatly prohibit all objects, but only those that unduly interfere with the driver\u2019s vision. Thus, the minority approach does not apply here. Only the first two approaches are relevant to our review, and both support the officer\u2019s reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the motor vehicle stop in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The majority approach, followed in Colorado, <em>Colo.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 42-4-201(4), and California, Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 26708, criminalizes placement of an object that \u201cobstructs,\u201d \u201cimpairs,\u201d or \u201creduces\u201d the driver\u2019s vision. Obstruction statutes with this language establish a low threshold for stopping motor vehicles, although they do require that the officer credibly testify that he believed the object was in the driver\u2019s line of vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">For example, the Colorado statute states that: \u201cNo vehicle shall be operated upon any highway unless the driver\u2019s vision through any required glass equipment is normal and unobstructed.\u201d <em>Colo. Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 42-4-201(4) (2006) (emphasis added). In <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Arias, </em>159 P.3d 134, 138 (Colo.2007), the court found unjustified a stop of a vehicle with an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror because the stopping officer did not testify as to how the object obstructed the driver\u2019s view, including how the object was displayed or the angle of vision that was obstructed. <em>Id. </em>at 137-38. Thus, the court applied a reasonable, articulable suspicion test in evaluating whether the stop was lawful. Although the State did not meet its burden of proof in <em>Arias, </em>this approach leaves open the possibility that such a stop can be justified with appropriate evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The California statute states: \u201cA person shall not drive any motor vehicle with any object or material placed, displayed, installed, affixed, or applied in or upon the vehicle which <em>obstructs </em>or <em>reduces </em>the driver\u2019s view through the windshield or side windows.\u201d <em>Cal. VehCode </em>\u00a7 26708(a)(2) (emphasis added). In <em>People v. White, </em>107 <em>Cal.App.4th. </em>636, 132 Cal.Rptr.2d 371 (2003), a police officer stopped a vehicle for an air freshener hanging from the rear-view mirror. <em>Id. </em>at 373. Because the officer never testified that he believed the air freshener obstructed the driver\u2019s view, or to alternative facts that would suggest the driver\u2019s view was impeded, the court held that there was no objectively reasonable basis to stop the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 375. Again, a reasonable and articulable standard was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The materially obstruct approach, followed in Illinois, 625 <em>ILCS </em>5/12-503(c), Oklahoma, <em>Okla. Stat. </em>Title 47 \u00a7 12-404, and Pennsylvania, 75 <em>Pa. Cons.Stat. </em>\u00a7 4524(c), criminalizes objects that \u201cmaterially obstruct\u201d the driver\u2019s vision and utilizes the reasonable and articulable test as well. In <em>United States v. Delfin-Colina, </em>464 F.3d 392, 400 (3d Cir.2006), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals broadly interpreted the \u201cmaterially obstruct\u201d phrase in the Pennsylvania statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">No person shall drive any motor vehicle with any object or material hung from the inside rearview mirror or otherwise hung, placed or attached in such a position as to materially obstruct, obscure or impair the driver\u2019s vision through the front windshield or any manner as to constitute a safety hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">[75 <em>Pa. Cons-Stat. </em>\u00a7 4524(e).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The <em>Delfwr-Colina </em>court found justified a trooper\u2019s stop of a vehicle for a pendant hanging low from the rear-view mirror because the officer provided specific, articulable facts that showed he reasonably believed the driver\u2019s vision was obstructed. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 400. Although the officer mistakenly believed that all objects hung from the rear-view mirror violated the Pennsylvania statute, his testimony articulated objective reasons within the scope of the statute, such as the length the pendant hung from the mirror, its relationship to the driver\u2019s view, and its ability to swing back and forth, thereby justifying the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In comparison, the court in <em>People v. Cole, </em>369 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>960, 314 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>171, 874 N.E.2d 81 (2007), found a motor vehicle stop unjustified because the arresting officer did not testify as to how a hanging object materially obstructed the view of the driver. <em>Id. </em>314 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>171, 874 N.E.2d at 88. The officer testified that the object could hinder the driver\u2019s vision, but presented no specific articulable facts. <em>Id. </em>314 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>171, 874 N.E.2d at 88-90. When asked whether an object could obstruct without materially obstructing, the officer failed to answer the question. <em>Id. </em>314 <em>IlLDec. </em>171, 874 N.E.2d at 89. Thus, a fine line existed in determining whether the officer stated reasonable and articulable facts as to how an object materially obstructs the driver\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The \u201cunduly interfere\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 falls within both the materially obstructs approach and the majority approach, both of which require the stopping officer to provide articulable facts showing that he or she reasonably believed that an object hanging from a rearview mirror obstructed the driver\u2019s view, thus violating the statute. Here, we are satisfied that Wittke\u2019s testimony about his observation of the hanging, swaying objects, and his testimony that the objects obstructed the driver\u2019s view, passes the reasonable and articulable test to provide the officer ample grounds to perceive that the \u201cunduly interfere\u201d requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-74 was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We do not address whether sufficient proof beyond a reasonable doubt existed that the statute was, in fact, violated. That issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>not before us, given the driver\u2019s guilty plea. Our holding is confined to the constitutionality of the stop of the automobile in which defendant was a passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> Counsel indicated at oral argument that the boxing gloves also had a small Italian flag attached to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\"> <em>Miranda v.
