After merging one bribery count with the other, the judge sentenced defendant, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2), to terms appropriate to a crime one degree lower than those of which he was convicted. The judge imposed concurrent three-year terms of imprisonment for official misconduct and the merged bribery counts. He also entered an order directing that defendant forfeit his public office and be forever disqualified from holding any such office. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 2C:51-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Within ten days of the imposition sentence, the State filed an appeal pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2), contending that the court erred in imposing a sentence appropriate for a crime one degree lower. Defendant\u2019s sentence has been stayed pending appeal. <em>See State v. Sanders, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>609, 617 n. 7, 527 A.2d 442 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Defendant filed a cross-appeal. His sole argument is that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of second-degree offenses, and he should have been convicted only of third-degree official misconduct and bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">We agree with the State and reverse on its appeal. We reject defendant\u2019s argument and affirm on his cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">We set forth in some detail the factual background because it is necessary to our analysis of the issues raised on both the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Defendant was the mayor of the Township of Carneys Point. That municipality operates under a form of government in which the voters elect five township committee members who exercise legislative authority and appoint a mayor from amongst themselves. The mayor\u2019s appointment authority is subject to approval of the Township Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Defendant\u2019s term of office was scheduled to end in 2006. He was running as a Republican candidate for reelection in the November 2006 general election. Defendant was also a member of the Township\u2019s Sewerage Authority and served as the emergency management coordinator for Salem County. Defendant had a long history in local politics at both the municipal and county levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In 2006, the makeup of the Township Committee was three Republicans and two Democrats. Because defendant was up for reelection, if his seat was won by a Democrat, control of the local governing body would change parties. Anthony Rullo was the Democratic candidate opposing defendant. Rullo had previously served a term on the Township Committee as a Republican. After losing his seat in the prior election, he switched his party affiliation. Rullo was also a member of the Township Sewerage Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Prior to July 4, 2006, defendant approached Rullo and proposed that if Rullo would withdraw as a candidate, he would be guaranteed reappointment to the Sewerage Authority when his term expired. On July 4, 2006, defendant went to Rullo\u2019s home and again discussed Rullo\u2019s Sewerage Authority reappointment. Defendant also proposed that he could arrange for Rullo to obtain part-time mechanical work for the Authority, which would enable him to earn some extra money. This was the type of work Rullo had done when employed by DuPont, before his retirement. Expanding upon the proposal, defendant told Rullo he wanted him to wait until less than sixty days before the election to drop out so the ballots would already be printed and his party could not offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a replacement candidate. Thus, defendant would be able to run unopposed and would likely be assured reelection.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Rullo and his wife were raising three grandchildren due to personal difficulties of their daughter (the children\u2019s mother). Rullo informed his campaign manager about defendant\u2019s overtures, and his campaign manager reported the information to the Salem County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On July 25, 2006, defendant again went to Rullo\u2019s home. Defendant told Rullo he could not have the part-time job at the Sewerage Authority because to be eligible he would have to cease being a member of the Authority for at least one year. Defendant offered an alternative proposal. He said he could arrange for Rullo to be hired as the Township\u2019s zoning and housing inspector. The person presently holding that position was out on extended medical leave. The Township was in the process of advertising to fill the position until the end of the year. Defendant again conditioned his offer on Rullo dropping out of the election race.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On August 1, 2006, Detective Sergeant Gary Sandes, then with the Official Corruption Unit of the New Jersey State Police, was assigned to investigate the allegations concerning defendant. He contacted Rullo, who described the conditional offers made by defendant. Rullo agreed to cooperate by tape recording his future conversations with defendant. Rullo made clear that he had no intention of dropping out of the election, and he agreed to report all contacts with defendant to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">As instructed by the police, Rullo filed an application for the zoning and housing inspector job. On August 9, 2006, Rullo recorded a conversation he had with defendant at Rullo\u2019s home. Defendant explained that Rullo would be coached on how to conduct himself in the interview for the zoning and building inspector job and would be provided in advance with five prepared questions that would be asked at the interview. Rullo feigned concern that he had not served as a housing inspector for thirty years and had lost his familiarity with the applicable codes. Defendant assured him that he would have no problem, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>although another application had been submitted by a better qualified candidate, he assured Rullo that the other Township Committee members would go along with appointing him. Defendant also assured Rullo that he would be appointed to a full term as the zoning and housing inspector the following year as long as he performed the job reasonably for the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In exchange for these assurances, defendant again asked Rullo to withdraw from the election less than sixty days before election day. In these discussions, defendant commented that his party would then continue in power for the next three years. Defendant also told Rullo that if he dropped out more than sixty days prior to the election and the Democrats were able to place a replacement candidate on the ballot, the deal would be off.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">On August 30, 2006, Rullo recorded another conversation with defendant at Rullo\u2019s home. Defendant again offered Rullo the zoning and housing inspector job for the remainder of 2006, and reappointment for the 2007 term, in exchange for his dropping out of the upcoming election sometime in mid-September. Defendant offered advice to Rullo about how he should present the withdrawal of his candidacy to other members of his party who supported him and expended party funds for his campaign. Defendant suggested, for example, that Rullo explain that he was in financial difficulty, being retired and unexpectedly raising his grandchildren, as a result of which he needed to accept employment with the Township to earn some money. Defendant also suggested that Rullo tell his party members he felt bad running against defendant. Defendant reiterated that Rullo would be coached through the interview process for the zoning and housing inspector job, and he again assured him he would be reappointed for the 2007 term as long as he did a decent job for the remainder of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Rullo told defendant that on his application, when asked what salary he expected, he simply \u201cwrote down there whatever the, the base salary is now.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201c[Y]ou ain\u2019t gonna get rich, but it\u2019s not bad for part-time work.\u201d He continued: \u201cAnd let\u2019s say in January I would, ah, my preference is I would, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>look to [be]cause John [the current office holder out on medical leave] won\u2019t be there is to move you into his job title and work offa that salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">After the August 30, 2006 meeting, defendant and Rullo saw each other only once, at a Sewerage Authority meeting. They did not discuss anything related to defendant\u2019s proposal. Rullo, who had never intended to drop out of the election, withdrew his application for the zoning and housing inspector job. He stayed in the election race and defeated defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">At trial, Rullo and Sandes were the only witnesses for the State. The recordings and corresponding transcripts of the August 9 and 30, 2006 meetings were admitted in evidence. The transcripts are part of the appellate record. Defendant did not testify and did not present any fact witnesses. He presented ten character witnesses, who attested to his upstanding character, excellent reputation in the community, and years of service in local politics.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We first address defendant\u2019s argument that, because the State produced no evidence that the value of the benefits sought to be conferred on Rullo exceeded $200, he should have been convicted of only third-degree offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The official misconduct statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">A public servant is guilty of official misconduct when, with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another ...:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">a. He commits an act relating to his office but constituting an unauthorized exercise of his official functions, knowing that such act is unauthorized or he is committing such act in an unauthorized manner; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\"><em>Official misconduct is a crime of the second degree. If the benefit obtained or sought to be obtained </em>... <em>is of a value of $200.00 or less, the offense of official misconduct is a crime of the third degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The bribery statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">A person is guilty of bribery if he directly or indirectly offers, confers or agrees to confer upon another, or solicits, accepts or agrees to accept from another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>a. Any benefit as consideration for a decision, opinion, recommendation, vote or exercise of discretion of a public servant, party official or voter on any public issue or in any public election; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">c. Any benefit as consideration for a violation of an official duty of a public servant or party official; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">d. Any benefit as consideration for the performance of official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">For the purposes of this section \u201cbenefit as consideration\u201d shall be deemed to mean any benefit not authorized by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">\n<em>Any offense proscribed by this section is a crime of the second degree. If the benefit offered, conferred, agreed to be conferred, solicited, accepted or agreed to be accepted is of the value of $200.00 or less, any offense proscribed by this section is a crime of the third degree.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Under the official misconduct statute, the benefit may be <em>either </em>that which defendant sought to obtain for himself <em>or </em>that which he sought to obtain for another. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2a. Likewise, under the bribery statute, the benefit may be <em>either </em>that which defendant \u201csolicits, accepts or agrees to accept\u201d from another <em>or </em>that which he \u201coffers, confers or agrees to confer\u201d upon another. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-2a. In this case, the \u201cbenefits\u201d for each of the crimes are <em>both </em>the value of the positions defendant offered to secure for Rullo <em>and </em>the benefit defendant sought to secure for himself in winning the election unopposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The definitional section applicable to both statutes defines \u201cbenefit\u201d to mean \u201cgain or advantage, or anything regarded by the beneficiary as gain or advantage, including a pecuniary benefit----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-la. A \u201cpecuniary benefit\u201d means a \u201cbenefit in the form of money, property, commercial interests or anything else the primary significance of which is economic gain.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:27-lf. The benefit need not be pecuniary. <em>State v. Phelps, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 375, 454 A.2d 908 (App.Div.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>500, 476 A.2d 1199 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">In <em>Phelps, </em>we held that official misconduct is a crime of the second degree and that, rather than forming a substantive element of the offense, the above-emphasized language from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2 \u201ccarves out an exception\u201d where the benefit obtained or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>sought to be obtained is of a value of $200 or less. <em>Id. </em>at 373-74, <em>454 </em>A.2d 908. We concluded that the Legislature intended <em>for </em>courts construing the official misconduct statute to \u201cstart from the premise that the offense is of the second degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 454 A.2d 908. We held that the carved out exception \u201cis clearly pecuniary in nature\u201d and did not apply to \u201ca benefit not subject to pecuniary measurement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The reasoning in <em>Phelps, </em>which dealt with the official misconduct statute, leads <em>to the </em>same conclusion with respect to the bribery statute. Applying this reasoning, we recently affirmed a conviction for second-degree official misconduct of a volunteer firefighter who repeatedly called in false fire alarms in order to experience the joy of responding to them and possibly to give the volunteer fire department enough work to justify its existence, holding that \u201c[bjecause there was no pecuniary benefit, the misconduct was second degree.\u201d <em>State v. Quezada, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 286, 953 A.2d 1206 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Relying on <em>Phelps, </em>the trial judge found that the State\u2019s failure to produce \u201cdirect proofs[ ] as to the value of any benefit that was involved in this case\u201d did not defeat the second degree gradation of the offenses because of the distinction between benefits that are pecuniary in nature and those that are not. With respect to the latter, the presumed second-degree grade applies. Alternatively, the judge found that, if it was necessary to place a pecuniary value on the benefits intended to be conferred on Rullo, he would find as a matter of fact that the value exceeded $200 and that \u201cno reasonable mind to the contrary could maintain a credible ... argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We agree with the judge\u2019s analysis. Both pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits are involved in this case. Defendant sought to obtain for himself the benefit of winning an unopposed election. Because that benefit is not subject to pecuniary measurement, the State was not required to provide evidence as to any pecuniary value with respect to it. Defendant also offered Rullo municipal jobs, both of which had the \u201cprimary significance of ... economic gain\u201d for Rullo. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 2C:27-lf. The benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>resulting from those jobs constituted pecuniary benefit to Rullo. The trial judge recognized that, although the State offered no direct evidence to prove their monetary worth, the jobs would obviously bring Rullo a benefit of more than $200 in wages. The record contains sufficient credible evidence to support this inferential finding. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). The finding is similar to the observation we made in <em>Phelps </em>that, because of the scope of the gambling operation involved, even if the State had the burden of proving that the benefit was of a value of over $200, the jury \u201ccould hardly have found the value to be $200 or less ... [because] the gambling operation was quite large ... [and][t]he value of the benefit that defendant conferred on the operations by his inaction in permitting the operation to continue surely exceeded $200.\u201d <em>Phelps, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 376 n. 5, 454 A.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Therefore, under either alternative, the judge correctly found defendant guilty of second-degree official misconduct and bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We now address the sentencing issue raised by the State. The State argues that the trial court erred in imposing a sentence appropriate for a crime one degree lower than that of the second-degree crimes of which defendant was convicted. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">We first note the aspects of the sentence that are not in dispute. Second-degree crimes carry a presumption of imprisonment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld. The judge found that the presumption was not overcome, as a result of which the sentence must be one of imprisonment. Defendant does not dispute this. Although the State argued in the trial court against merger of the two bribery convictions, it does not raise that issue before us, and thus acquiesces in the merger. The State acknowledged in the trial court that concurrent sentencing on all of defendant\u2019s convictions would be appropriate, and it does not now argue otherwise. Therefore, the only issue before us is whether the judge erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>imposing a three-year sentence, within the third-degree range of three to five years, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(3), rather than within the five to ten year range provided for second-degree crimes, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(2). To justify the three-year sentence, the judge invoked the authority of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44\u2014lf(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">In cases of convictions for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for which he was convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The judge recognized the two-step process required by the statute. The first required an analysis of aggravating and mitigating factors. He found two aggravating factors: (4) a lesser sentence will deprecate the seriousness of the offense because it involved a breach of the public trust under chapters 27 and 30; and (9) the need for deterrence. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(4) and (9). The judge found the presence of the following mitigating factors: (1) defendant\u2019s conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm; (5) the victim (Rullo) of defendant\u2019s conduct induced or facilitated its commission; (7) defendant has no prior criminal history; (8) defendant\u2019s conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur; and (9) the character and attitude of defendant indicate he is unlikely to commit another offense. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(1), (5), (7), (8) and (9). The judge acknowledged that mitigating factor (5) was of dubious application because the true victim here is the public. The judge found that, even without mitigating factor (5), he was clearly convinced that, upon qualitative analysis, the mitigating factors substantially preponderated over the aggravating factors. Therefore, the first component of the two-step test prescribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2) was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Based upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that the judge\u2019s findings as to the presence of aggravating and mitigating factors and the weight to be attributed to each of them (except as to mitigating factor (5)), are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. Likewise, the judge\u2019s finding of a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tial preponderance of the mitigating over the aggravating factors is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As to the second component of the two-part test, that \u201cthe interest of justice demands\u201d sentencing one degree lower, the judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">He\u2019s obviously led an exemplary public life, excluding, of course, these salient events. He\u2019s given the public\u2014it\u2019s so obvious, he\u2019s given the public far more than he took____[H]is private life has been equally one of charity and warmth towards his family. But not only his family . . but also to others who perhaps, as I\u2019ve read, are persons who he didn\u2019t even know or didn\u2019t know well. He served in public office with\u2014again, excluding these events\u2014with distinction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">The whole person concept, which is one that we\u2019re invited to look at, does cry out for a third degree range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">The evils that were afoot in this matter did not occur. And that\u2019s something that\u2014I know I stated that before, but citing it as a reason now to sentence in a one degree lower needs repeating. Mr. Rullo did not get a job. He did not withdraw. The forfeiture of office is a significant penalty in and of itself, which has deterrent effect as well. Seven years, as the State suggests, is simply over the top. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. It\u2019s just over the top for a first offender with these facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">... It\u2019s more than necessary. It\u2019s more than the public demands. It\u2019s permitted for the Court to make that adjustment. There is\u2014there is a case, <em>[State v. Evers, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>355, 815 A.2d 432 (2003) ], which suggests\u2014perhaps holds, but certainly suggests that the whole person concept, the things that I\u2019ve mentioned and the exemplary life that he has led throughout his public and private are factors which the Court can consider, not in overcoming the presumption of incarceration but in sentencing one degree lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">No citizen of Salem County is going to be shocked or have a shocked conscience. I\u2019m not going to read this tomorrow morning in one of our newspapers and say, look at this, what happened, three years, is that all?____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">There will be an abundance of deterrence that goes forward. Discretion in sentencing, when allowed by our law, ought to be exercised where appropriate, and this is one of those cases where I feel it is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">Accordingly, I would sentence Mr. Lake to three years New Jersey State Prison on the official misconduct; three years concurrent on the merged bribery charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">In the seminal case interpreting the term \u201cinterest of justice\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2), our Supreme Court cautioned that a downgrade decision under this provision should be limited to cases in which a defendant can provide \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for the downgrade. <em>State v. Megargel, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>484, 501-02, 673 A.2d 259 (1996). The reasons supporting the interest of justice prong must be \u201cin addition to, and separate from\u201d the mitigating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>which substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and thus satisfy the first prong. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Although the surrounding circumstances and the need for deterrence may be taken into account, the severity of the crime remains the single most important factor in considering whether the interest of justice demands a downgrade. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 678 A.2d 259 (citing <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 379, 471 A.2d 389 (1984)). Recognizing that the principles underlying the Criminal Code favor deterrence and protection of the public over rehabilitation and are designed to foster uniformity in sentencing, the Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he focus on the offense rather than the offender is inexorable in formulating a sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Court held that, in evaluating the severity of the crime, trial courts must consider the nature of the circumstances pertaining to the offense. <em>Ibid. </em>If the surrounding circumstances of an offense make it very similar to a lower degree offense, a downgraded sentence may be appropriate. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court cited the following illustrative examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">For example, a defendant who simulates having a gun by placing his hand in his pocket can be convicted of firstdegree robbery. Such a crime, however, is very similar to second-degree robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">Although the degree of the crime is the focus of the sentence, facts personal to the defendant may be considered in the sentencing process. Courts should consider a defendant\u2019s role in the incident to determine the need to deter him from further crimes and the corresponding need to protect the public from him. Was the defendant the mastermind, a loyal follower, an accomplice whose shared intent is problematic, or an individual who is mentally incapable of forming the necessary criminal intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 500-01, 673 A.2d 259 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Thus, the Court made it clear that, because the focus remains on the offense and not the offender, the surrounding circumstances used as compelling reasons for a downgrade should arise from within the context of the offense itself. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court instructed trial courts to \u201cstate why sentencing the defendant to the lowest range of sentencing for the particular offense for which he was convicted, is not a more appropriate sentence than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>downgraded sentence under section 44-1f(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Court also held that the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d standard of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2) is not the same as the \u201cserious injustice\u201d standard for overcoming the presumption of imprisonment applicable to first and second-degree convictions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 673 A.2d 259. The statutory presumption of imprisonment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree ... by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, <em>having regard to tile character and condition of the defendant, </em>it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In <em>Megargel, </em>the Court recognized that the two statutes address \u201cqualitatively different situations,\u201d with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld being geared toward the initial determination of whether a defendant will be \u201cin or out\u201d of prison rather than the length of term scenario confronted by the downgrade provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2). <em>Supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 673 A.2d 259. Thus, the Court held that the compelling reasons required to satisfy the interest of justice for a downgrade under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2) present a \u201csomewhat lower standard\u201d than the \u201ctruly extraordinary and unanticipated circumstances\u201d required before a \u201cserious injustice\u201d may be found under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-ld. <em>Id. </em>at 501-02, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In <em>Evers, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[i]n permitting consideration of \u2018the character and condition of the defendant\u2019 in determining whether imprisonment would be a \u2018serious injustice,\u2019 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld] left \u2018a residuum of power in the sentencing court not to imprison in those few cases where it would be entirely inappropriate to do so.\u2019\u201d <em>Evers, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 389, 815 A.2d 432 (quoting <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 358, 471 A.2d 370 (1984)). Yet, in <em>Evers, </em>the Court considered only the serious injustice standard of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld and was not confronted with a downgrade issue under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2). <em>Id. </em>at 397, 815 A.2d 432. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>Megargel, </em>before offering guidance on what types of circumstances justify a downgrade in the interest of justice, the Court specifically noted that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2) contains \u201cno reference to the defendant\u2019s character or condition.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 673 A.2d 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Our reading of these cases leads us to conclude that circumstances such as a defendant\u2019s overall character or contributions to the community should not be considered under the interest of justice prong in the determination of whether or not to downgrade a sentence pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1f(2). This is an offense-oriented provision. Characteristics or behavior of the offender are applicable only as they relate to the offense itself and give fuller context to the offense circumstances. <em>See, e.g., State v. Read, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 613-14, 938 A.2d 953 (App.Div.) (holding that a downgrade for a juvenile who pled guilty to first-degree robbery was not warranted because, although the defendant acted as the look-out while his confederate committed the robbery, \u201cwe see no basis for characterizing defendant\u2019s role as only secondary ____ [and no] evidence of the kind of psychological impairment that would be relevant to this determination\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>85, 951 A.2d 1038 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Applying these principles, we agree with the State that the trial judge did not correctly apply the interest of justice prong of the downgrade provision as interpreted by <em>Megargel. </em>One aspect of the judge\u2019s error was in relying on <em>Evers </em>to evaluate \u201cthe whole person.\u201d In <em>Evers, </em>\u201cthe propriety of downgrading the child pornography distribution charge from a second-degree to a third-degree offense for the purpose of sentencing [was] not raised in [the] appeal.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 397, 815 A.2d 432. <em>Evers </em>dealt with the \u201cserious injustice\u201d standard for overcoming the presumption of imprisonment, which includes the statutory criteria of giving \u201cregard to the character and condition of the defendant.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld. Both in <em>Evers </em>and <em>Megargel, </em>the Court made clear that these are two different tests for two different purposes and, because of the differing statutory language and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>differing purposes, the tests are not the same. Consideration of the whole person is appropriate as part of the evaluation of the \u201ccharacter and condition of the defendant\u201d for purposes of determining whether the presumption of imprisonment has been overcome. However, it is not appropriate in the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d analysis of the downgrade provision. Thus, the judge erred in considering defendant\u2019s many years of public service, his first offender status, his acts of kindness over the years to his family and members of the public, and the like. While appropriate for consideration as mitigating factors, and therefore applicable to the first prong, they have no application to the second prong. In essence, much of the judge\u2019s rationale supporting the second prong was a restatement of the reasons underlying the various mitigating factors. This is contrary to <em>Megargel\u2019s </em>directive that the basis for the second prong must be separate and distinct from the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The judge\u2019s only finding under the interest of justice prong dealing with the offense itself was that \u201c[t]he evils that were afoot in this matter did not occur.\u201d This fact supported the judge\u2019s finding of mitigating factor (1), that defendant\u2019s conduct did not cause or threaten serious harm. Aside from not being separate and distinct from the facts underlying the mitigating factors, we fail to see how it is relevant that defendant failed in his attempt to subvert the election process through official misconduct and bribery. He did not \u201csee the light\u201d and call off the arrangement. His plan was thwarted only because the person with whom he thought he had a deal was never complicit in the arrangement and refused to go through with it. This \u201cfact\u201d was not properly considered in minimizing the seriousness of defendant\u2019s crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We also find no significance in the fact that defendant was required to forfeit his public office and be forever barred from holding public office. This is a statutory consequence of his criminal conduct that was imposed upon him. Besides not being related to the offense, it was not something of his doing that should reduce the penal consequences of his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>An analysis of the offense circumstances at once makes clear that this is not one of those rare cases that satisfies the interest of justice standard for a downgrade. Defendant\u2019s conduct spanned several months. He was the sole and direct architect of the scheme. It could not be said that this was an isolated act of aberrant behavior in which an otherwise law-abiding person exercised poor judgment on one occasion. Defendant persisted in his conduct, geared to stealing the election and subverting the electoral process that is at the foundation of our democracy. He met repeatedly with Rullo, attempting to persuade him to participate in the scheme, and offering him public employment, for which he may not have even been qualified, at public expense, as the <em>quid pro quo </em>for allowing defendant to run unopposed for public office. Defendant\u2019s conduct was deliberate, persistent over several months, and flagrant. His conduct presented no compelling circumstances to remove it from the heartland of offenses of this type, to place it in a less egregious light, and to warrant a downgraded sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We therefore reverse the sentence of three years imprisonment for second-degree official misconduct and the merged second-degree bribery offenses. Ordinarily, we would remand for resentencing in the second-degree range. However, as in <em>Megargel, </em>the sentencing judge is no longer on the bench. <em>See Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 673 A.2d 259. As we have stated, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the judge\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that the mitigating factors substantially predominate over the aggravating factors is well-founded. Accordingly, as did the Court in <em>Megargel, see ibid., </em>we deem this an appropriate circumstance in which to exercise original jurisdiction. <em>See R. </em>2:10-5. Based upon the substantial preponderance of mitigating factors, we sentence defendant at the bottom of the second-degree range to five years imprisonment for official misconduct and to a concurrent term of five years imprisonment for the merged bribery convictions. The trial court shall enter an amended judgment of conviction to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Reversed on the State\u2019s appeal; affirmed on defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. The stay of sentence is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\"> The State makes a further argument that we should consider the Court's admonition in <em>Megargel </em>that courts exercise special caution before downgrading a sentence for an offense for which the Legislature has provided for enhanced punishment. <em>See supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 503-04, 673 A.2d 259. That was the case in <em>Megargel, </em>where the offense was first-degree kidnapping, which carried a sentence greater than first-degree crimes generally cany. <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, at the time defendant committed the offenses, no enhanced punishment was provided. However, effective April 14, 2007, legislation was enacted providing for a minimum mandatory term of five years imprisonment without parole for certain second-degree offenses, including bribery and official misconduct. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.5, <em>L. </em>2007, c. 49, \u00a7 6. We decline to consider this argument, as it may have <em>ex post facto </em>implications.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
