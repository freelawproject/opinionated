The trial court granted a stay pending appeal. We reverse and remand for trial holding that, pursuant to both the federal and New Jersey Constitutions, a person who has asserted the right to counsel during a police custodial interrogation and is subsequently released may be interrogated again if the break in custody afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">These are the salient facts. On September 2, 2006, Sandy Bellush, Eric Jackson, and Brielle Simpkins were shot to death in Newark. Two others were also shot, but survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">As a result of police investigation, co-defendant Raheem Clay, nicknamed \u201cRah,\u201d was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. The following day, September 3, 2006, shortly before 9:00 a.m., Newark Homicide Detective Murad Muhammad and Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Detective Marquise Carter went to defendant\u2019s home and arrested him on a traffic warrant. He was taken to police headquarters. Defendant was orally advised of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and provided with a written <em>Miranda </em>form. Defendant read and signed the form, waiving his rights. According to Muhammad, defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent or request a lawyer at the September 3, 2006 interview. The detectives questioned defendant about an August 24, 2006 incident, in which defendant was the victim of an assault. Muhammad also had information that defendant had quarreled about money with Sandy Bellush. The interview concerning the August 24 incident was not recorded because defendant declined to give a formal taped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Muhammad asked defendant if he had any information related to the September 2, 2006 triple homicide. Defendant denied any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>knowledge of the shootings, stating he only knew of the incident through newspaper accounts. However, he admitted that on August 24, 2006, he quarreled with Bellush over a car or money. Bellush\u2019s friends assaulted defendant. According to Muhammad, the interrogation was terminated. According to defendant, he requested a lawyer before continuing to answer any more questions, then the interrogation terminated. Defendant was released once he posted bail on the traffic warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The police investigation continued. On September 11, 2006, one of the surviving victims identified defendant as a participant in the shootings. The following day, defendant was taken into custody in connection with the homicides and attempted murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">On September 12, 2006, in a recorded statement, after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given again, defendant waived his rights and agreed to give a statement. Defendant admitted his presence at the scene of the homicide, but denied responsibility for the shootings. He stated that \u201cNut\u201d and \u201cRah-Rah,\u201d his codefendants, were also present. Defendant acknowledged that he was having a \u201clittle money situation\u201d with Bellush. He reiterated that on August 24, 2006, he was \u201cjumped\u201d in a fight over money owed to Bellush.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Defendant was arrested and charged with: first-degree conspiracy to commit murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:5-2 <em>&amp; </em>11-3(a); purposeful or knowing murder by use of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 11\u20143(a)(l)(2); third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5(b); second-degree possession of a handgun for unlawful purposes, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(a); first-degree attempted murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 &amp; ll-3(a); second-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b); conspiracy to commit aggravated arson, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2 &amp; 17-l(a); and second-degree aggravated arson, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:17-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Defendant moved to suppress the September 12, 2006 statement. The judge held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. Defendant testified that on September 3, 2006, he was brought to police headquarters on a traffic warrant and asked about a homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>cide. He identified his signature on the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form but did not recall that the form made reference to the homicide of Sandy Bellush. He stated the form was blank when he signed it. Defendant acknowledged each of the rights with his initials, including the one pertaining to a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">According to defendant, he told the detectives that he did not know anything about a homicide and asked for a lawyer, at which point all questioning ceased. He did, however, provide the detectives with some information. He identified a telephone contact named \u201cRah,\u201d who had lived with one of the homicide victims in July 2006. He was asked about \u201cbeing a victim\u201d in an assault, but he refused to answer and requested a lawyer. Defendant then made bail on the warrant and was released the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The judge suppressed the September 12, 2006 statement, but denied a motion to suppress the September 3, 2006 statement. The State moved for leave to appeal. We granted the motion. AM-136-08T4 (App.Div. November 21, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">On appeal, the State contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING DOCUMENTARY AND TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE OF A WAIVER OF COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6U\">THE TRIAL COURT INCORRECTLY APPLIED THE LAW WHEN [IT] FOUND THAT A REQUEST FOR COUNSEL INVALIDATED A CONFESSION NINE DAYS LATER, AFTER A BREAK IN CUSTODY AND NEW <em>MIRANDA </em>WARNINGS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">We agree with the State\u2019s second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">For the purpose of our analysis, we assume that defendant was in custody during the September 3 interrogation and that he asserted the right to speak to an attorney at that time. Nonetheless, we conclude that the judge should not have granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the September 12 statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201can accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 484-85, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386 (1981). This holding, known as the <em>\u201cEdwards </em>rule,\u201d is intended to prevent police from badgering a suspect in custody. The bright-line rule of <em>Edwards </em>was \u201cdesigned to protect an accused in police custody from being badgered by police officers\u201d in an effort to wear the suspect down and persuade him to incriminate himself notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel\u2019s assistance. <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>1039, 1044, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2830, 2834, 77 L.Ed.2d 405, 411 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Following a request for counsel, the <em>Edwards </em>rule applies to any interrogation, whether it pertains to the crime that prompted the initial interrogation or to a different crime. <em>Arizona v. Roberson, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>675, 683-84, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2093, 2099, 100 L.Ed.2d 704, 715 (1988). Moreover, \u201cto a suspect who has indicated his inability to cope with the pressures of custodial interrogation by requesting counsel, any further interrogation without counsel having been provided will surely exacerbate whatever compulsion to speak the suspect may be feeling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2100, 100 L.Ed.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Edwards </em>does not address whether this rule survives a break in custody. However, in a 1991 case, the Supreme Court suggested that <em>Edwards </em>would not apply where a break in custody occurred. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">In <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 68 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>378 (1981), we established a second layer of prophylaxis for the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel: Once a suspect asserts the right, not only must the current interrogation cease, but he may not be approached for further interrogation \u201cuntil counsel has been made available to him,\u201d 451 <em>U.S. </em>at 484-485,101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981)\u2014which means, we have most recently held, that counsel must be present, <em>Minnick v. Mississippi, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>146, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>486, 112 L.Ed.2d 489 (1990). If the police do subsequently initiate an encounter in the absence of counsel <em>(assuming there has been no break in custody), </em>the suspect\u2019s statements are presumed involuntary and therefore inadmissible as substantive evidence at trial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\"><em>[McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>171, 176-77, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2204, 2208,115 L.Ed.2d 158, 167-68 (1991) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Even before <em>McNeil, </em>the federal circuit courts had held that a break in custody vitiates the need for <em>Edwards </em>protection, provided that a defendant has an adequate opportunity to obtain counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In <em>Dunkins v. Thigpen, </em>854 F.2d 394, 397 (11th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1059, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1329, 103 L.Ed.2d 597 (1989), the Eleventh Circuit held that a one-day break in custody, following an assertion of the right to the assistance of counsel, was sufficient to overcome the <em>Edwards </em>rule prohibiting subsequent custodial interrogation. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">If the police release the defendant, and if the defendant has a reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney, then we see no reason why <em>Edwards </em>should bar the admission of any subsequent statements. A break in custody after the invocation of fifth amendment rights ends the need for the <em>Edwards </em>rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Thus, subsequent confessions obtained from a police-initiated interrogation are admissible if there has been an intervening break in custody, assuming compliance with <em>Miranda. Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Other circuit courts had agreed, prior to the holding in <em>McNeil, </em>that it made little sense to establish a bright-line application of the <em>Edwards </em>rule without consideration of intervening factors such as a break in custody. In <em>United States v. Skinner, </em>667 <em>F.2d </em>1306, 1309 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1229, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3569, 77 L.Ed.2d 1410 (1983), it was held that <em>Edwards </em>protection does not apply where the suspect was not in continuous custody. This was followed by <em>McFadden v. Garraghty, </em>820 F.2d 654, 661 (4th Cir.1987), which held that two breaks in custody severed any causal link between the initial unlawful interrogation and appellant\u2019s voluntary confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">After <em>McNeil, </em>several courts have relied on the highlighted provision of that opinion, \u201c(assuming there has been no break in custody),\u201d to hold that a break in custody defeated <em>Edwards </em>protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The Eighth Circuit held that a three-hour break in custody was sufficient because defendant \u201chad ample opportunity to consult his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>family, friends, or a lawyer.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>221 F.3d 1048, 1053 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>145 <em>F.</em>3d 1140, 1150 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>911, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>255, 142 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\"><em>Edwards </em>is premised on the inherently coercive nature of custodial interrogation and is designed to prevent the authorities from badgering a suspect in custody after the suspect has invoked his <em>Miranda </em>right to have an attorney present during questioning. Therefore, ... in order for <em>Edwards </em>to apply, the suspect must be in custody from the time he invokes his right to the time when the subsequent interrogation is initiated. If custody is broken, especially for a lengthy period of time, the inherently coercive nature of custody itself is diminished and there is little to no risk of badgering by the authorities. This is not to say that the police can circumvent <em>Edwards </em>by temporarily releasing a suspect for a short period of time and then reacquiring him. Whether a break in custody is sufficient to remove a suspect\u2019s request for counsel from the ambit of <em>Edwards </em>must be evaluated under the totality of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>See also Kyger v. Carlton, </em>146 F.3d 374, 380-81 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>1028, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>565, 142 L.Ed.2d 471 (1998); <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>41 F.3d 935, 945-46 (5th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1389, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>241 (1995); <em>United States v. Hines, </em>963 <em>F.2d </em>255, 257 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Numerous state courts have articulated a similar approach. <em>See People v. Storm, </em>28 <em>Cal.4th </em>1007, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 110, 121-23, 52 P.3d 52 (2002), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Storm v.

Norris, </em>244 <em>Kan. </em>326, 768 P.2d 296, 302 (1989) (holding that defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to counsel terminates when he is released from custody); <em>State v.

See, e.g., State v. Bymes, </em>258 <em>Ga. </em>813, 375 S.E.2d 41, 42 (1989) (noting that <em>Edwards </em>protection is defeated where there was \u201cno indication appellee\u2019s release from custody was a mere ploy in order to seek another waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Our inquiry, however, does not end at this point. The New Jersey Supreme Court has held that the application of safeguards in the federal and New Jersey Constitutions are not always coterminous, despite the congruity of the language. <em>State v. Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>338, 344, 450 A.2d 952 (1982) (citing <em>State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 225-26, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353, 346 A.2d 66 (1975); <em>cf. State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 557, 423 A.2d 615 (1980) (holding that there are broader concepts of individual rights pursuant to the New Jersey Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tion)). Therefore, we must consider whether, in light of New Jersey\u2019s broader concept of individual rights, a break in custodial status results in a relaxation of the <em>Edwards </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Here, we are strongly persuaded by the soundness of the reasoning at the core of these federal and state decisions, which has been summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cOnce released, the suspect is no longer under the \u2018inherently compelling pressures\u2019 of continuous custody where there is a reasonable possibility of wearing the suspect down by badgering police tactics to the point the suspect would waive the previously invoked right to counsel. A break in custody between the first and second interrogations also provides the suspect the opportunity to speak with an attorney, family member or any person the suspect cares to consult without police constraints.\u201d We therefore adopt the premise that \u201ca ... break in custody where the defendant has a reasonable opportunity to contact his attorney [while free of custodial pressures] dissolves an <em>Edwards ... </em>claim.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\"><em>[People v. Storm, supra, </em>124 Cal.Rptr.2d at 122, 52 P.3d 52 (quoting from <em>In re Bonnie H., </em>56 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>563, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 513, 525-26 (1997)) (internal citations and footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Thus, in New Jersey, a person who has asserted the right to counsel during a police custodial interrogation and is subsequently released may be interrogated again if the break in custody afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney. Moreover, in order to determine whether the break in custody is sufficient to defeat <em>Edwards </em>protection, we adopt a totality-of-the-circumstances test, similar to the one in <em>Bautista, supra, </em>145 E.3d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Applying this standard pursuant to both the federal and New Jersey Constitutions, we hold that defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights on September 12, 2006 was valid and not precluded by the invocation of his right to counsel on September 3, 2006. Accordingly, the order suppressing the September 12, 2006 statement is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division, Essex County for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
