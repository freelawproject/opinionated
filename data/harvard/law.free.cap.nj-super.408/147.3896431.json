The Chevy Venture was insured under a Personal Auto Policy (PAP) issued to Soussou by State Farm Insurance Company. Plaintiffs subsequent negligence claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Soussou was resolved for the $100,000 State Farm policy limits of coverage. In an amended complaint, plaintiffs sought \u201cexcess\u201d coverage under the PAP issued by defendant Selective Insurance Company of America (Selective) to Soussou\u2019s son Rog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>er, which plaintiffs claimed also covered Soussou and the Chevy Venture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion judge disagreed and granted Selective summary judgment dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the grounds that the Selective policy unambiguously excluded Sous-sou\u2019s Chevy Venture from coverage and that Soussou could not have reasonably expected otherwise. Plaintiffs\u2019 later motion for reconsideration was denied for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs\u2019 argument relies principally on a claimed ambiguity in the declaration page of the Selective policy and an apparent contradiction in the policy language between the stated liability coverage and an exclusion, both of which led Soussou to reasonably expect that he: (1) was the named insured, (2) was insured for \u201cany auto,\u201d whether he owned it or not, and (3) was not subject to the relevant exclusion, which denies coverage to a \u201cnamed insured\u201d when driving a non-covered vehicle owned by him. We disagree. Soussou was not a named insured under the Selective policy nor was his Chevy Venture a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d placing him squarely within the exclusionary language of the Selective policy. Even assuming some ambiguity over his status as a named insured, he cannot be both a \u201cfamily member\u201d and \u201cnamed insured,\u201d and therefore, in any event, falls outside the exception to the exclusion. Given this explicit bar, any expectation of coverage was simply not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">By way of background, at the time of the accident, Soussou resided in the same household with his wife, Sylvia, and his two adult children, Priscilla and Roger. At his father\u2019s urging, Roger, who was a part-time college student, purchased automobile liability coverage for himself and members of his family from Selective. Sylvia and Priscilla contributed to the cost of the premium. The policy in effect at the time of the accident had a coverage period from March 7, 2005 to March 7, 2006, and had been mailed to Roger at the family\u2019s Wayne address. The policy\u2019s declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>sheet lists Roger\u2019s name and address in the upper left hand comer and identifies him as a \u201cstudent.\u201d Further down, the document lists three vehicles \u201cprincipally garaged at [Roger\u2019s] address\u201d that are covered by the policy: a 2000 Ford Mustang, a 1992 Saab 900, and a 1996 Chevy Lumina. In the box designated \u201cOperator Section,\u201d the names of the family members who operate these three vehicles are listed: Roger, Priscilla, Sylvia, and George Soussou. All three vehicles are registered in Roger\u2019s name, although his sister and mother use two of them. On occasion, about once a week, Soussou drives the Ford Mustang, which is the vehicle his wife uses. Soussou\u2019s Chevy Venture is not listed in the declaration page\u2019s \u201cDescription of Owned Autos.\u201d Correspondingly, no other family members drive the Chevy Venture, which Soussou uses for his business and, as noted, is separately insured. The declaration page also does not specifically identify any member of the family as a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Selective\u2019s PAP contains a clause stating that \u201cfamily members\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are covered when using \u201cany auto.\u201d However, the PAP also contains an \u201cExclusion\u201d section, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">B. We do not provide Liability Coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">2. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour covered auto\u201d, which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">a. Owned by you; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">b. Furnished or available for your regular use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">3. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour covered auto\u201d, which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">a. Owned by any \u201cfamily member\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">b. Furnished or available for the regular use of any \u201cfamily member\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">A \u201ccovered auto\u201d is further defined as \u201cany vehicle shown in the declaration [page],\u201d which, as noted, does not list Soussou\u2019s Chevy Venture. Moreover, the exclusionary clause has an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>rendering it inapplicable to the named insured when using a non-covered vehicle owned by another family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The motion judge, in granting Selective summary judgment, relied principally on the clear, plain language of the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause. He explained, firstly, that the relevant language of exclusion unambiguously bars from coverage any vehicle that is not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d; secondly, that the \u201creasonable expectations doctrine is not applicable ... because there is no ambiguity in the language of the exclusion provisions discussed\u201d; and thirdly, that the \u201csubject vehicle was covered under another policy in [Soussou\u2019s] name,\u201d and for that reason \u201c[i]t is not reasonable for [Soussou] to also claim coverage under [the Selective] policy where he is not the named insured and the subject vehicle is not covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Certain well-settled principles govern insurance contract interpretation. \u201cFirst, in enforcing an insurance policy, courts will depart from the literal text and interpret it in accordance with the insured\u2019s understanding, even when that understanding contradicts the insurer\u2019s intent, if the text appears overly technical or contains hidden pitfalls, cannot be understood without employing subtle or legalistic distinctions, is obscured by fine print, or requires strenuous study to comprehend.\u201d <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 601, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001) (internal citations omitted). On this score, under the longstanding \u201cdoctrine of reasonable expectations,\u201d courts should give effect to \u201cthe objectively reasonable expectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the terms of insurance contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 775 A.2d 1262. Indeed, in <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 347, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we held that a policy holder\u2019s \u201creasonable expectations of coverage raised by the declaration page cannot be contradicted by the policy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>boilerplate,\u201d whether or not in plain language, \u201cunless the declaration page itself clearly so warns the insured.\u201d Thus, the average policyholder does not have a duty to \u201cchart his own way through the shoals and reefs of exclusions,\u201d and may rely solely on his or her reasonable expectations flowing from the representations on the declaration page to determine the extent of his or her coverage. <em>Ibid. </em>Of course, for a policyholder\u2019s expectations to govern over the plain language of an insurance contract, his or her expectations must be objectively reasonable. <em>Clients\u2019 Sec. Fund of the Bar of N.J. v. Sec. Title &amp; Guar. Co., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>358, 372, 634 A.2d 90 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Second, courts will construe ambiguous language in favor of coverage for the insured. <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 556, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995). An ambiguity exists in an insurance contract \u201c[w]hen an insurance policy\u2019s language fairly supports two meanings, one that favors the insurer, and the other that favors the insured____\u201d <em>President v. Jenkins, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>550, 563, 853 A.2d 247 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">By the same token, \u201cthe presumption in favor of the insured when there is an ambiguity should not be employed to create an ambiguity which does not exist.\u201d <em>Webb v. AAA Mid-Atlantic Ins. Group, </em>348 F.Supp.2d 324, 328 (D.N.J.2004). \u201cA liberal construction of an insurance policy is not warranted when the policy is clear on its face.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the absence of ambiguity, therefore, a court must enforce the policy as written. <em>Priest v. Roncone, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>537, 544, 851 A.2d 751 (App.Div.2004). In other words, \u201cthe words of an insurance policy are to be given their plain, ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Zacarias, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 595, 775 A.2d 1262. The plain terms of the contract will be enforced if the \u201centangled and professional interpretation of an insurance underwriter is [not] pitted against that of an average purchaser of insurance,\u201d or the provision is not so \u201cconfusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 775 A.2d 1262 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>We assess plaintiffs\u2019 contentions against these governing principles. Plaintiffs mainly argue that because there is no \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the declaration page of the Selective policy, a reasonable person in Soussou\u2019s circumstances would expect that individuals named in the \u201cOperator Section\u201d are the \u201cnamed insureds.\u201d We disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument overlooks the real distinction between \u201cnamed insureds\u201d and \u201cinsureds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We have previously distinguished the two classes of covered individuals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">[T]he term \u201cnamed insured\u201d is self-defining. The term refers only to the names so appearing in the declaration. On the other hand, an insured is any one who is entitled to coverage. This coverage may result by virtue of a person\u2019s status as an operator or occupier of a covered auto. In addition, a \u201cfamily member\u201d of a \u201cnamed insured\u201d may be an insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\"><em>[Botti v. CNA Ins. Co., </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 226, 824 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.2003) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In other words, those listed as \u201cnamed insureds\u201d are not necessarily the only individuals covered under the policy. <em>Ibid.; see also Webb, supra, </em>348 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 328. Other individuals not listed as \u201cnamed insureds\u201d may be entitled to liability coverage under certain circumstances enumerated by the policy. Thus, being an \u201cinsured\u201d under a policy \u201cis a combination of status and circumstance.\u201d <em>Webb, supra, </em>348 F.Supp.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">While there is no question that as a \u201cfamily member\u201d residing in the same household as his son Roger, defendant Soussou was a <em>potential </em>\u201cinsured\u201d under the Selective policy, nowhere in that policy is he designated a \u201cnamed insured.\u201d And although its declaration page failed to specify a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d under the circumstances, Soussou could not have entertained a reasonably objective expectation that he qualified as such. At the time of the accident, Soussou did not own any of the vehicles listed on the policy; did not pay any premiums on the policy; used only one vehicle on the policy once a week; and his primary vehicle, the Chevy Venture minivan which only he drove, was insured through a different insurance company. The name of his son, Roger, appears in the top left corner of the declaration page, in a space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>separate and apart from the \u201cOperator Section,\u201d and the coverage information includes only the vehicles Roger owns, which, in our view, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the purchaser, Roger, was in fact the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d especially given that Roger pays part of the premium and Soussou does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that all of the operators live in the same household and are related, which, when \u201c[a]ll that really appears on [the declaration page] is identity of coverages and identity of drivers,\u201d leads a reasonable person to infer, as in <em>Lehrhojf, </em>\u201cthat by listing the drivers using the vehicle, ... the purchaser of the policy is protecting all of them equally and, presumably, protecting them equally in respect of all the stated coverages without qualification and without limitation.\u201d 271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">This inference, however, is not warranted here. If Soussou actually considered himself a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under this policy, it is reasonable to expect that his primary vehicle\u2014one that he drove six days per week\u2014would be included as a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d so as not to be doubly paying for coverage from two different policies. A reasonable person faced with a declaration page listing none of the vehicles that he or she owns or drives on a daily basis, and insured under a policy he or she neither solicited nor paid for, would assume they are not the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Generally speaking, \u201c[t]he significance of the \u2018named insured\u2019 designation is that it describes the principal insureds under the policy and excludes any individual not so listed.\u201d <em>Webb, supra, </em>348 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 328. The policy usually also specifies \u201ccovered autos\u201d for which the named insureds pay their premiums. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>case, Roger, his mother and sister paid premiums to receive liability coverage for the Ford Mustang, Saab and Chevy Lumina vehicles. In addition to the named insured, the Selective policy provides coverage for any \u201cfamily member\u201d who owns, maintains, or uses <em>any </em>auto. A \u201cfamily member\u201d is a resident of the household related by blood, marriage or adoption. Thus, the coverage provision of the Selective policy generally designates as an \u201cinsured\u201d any family member using any car.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Clearly, then, Soussou qualifies as an \u201cinsured\u201d and would be entitled to liability coverage for damages incurred while driving any auto <em>but for </em>the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause. Exclusion B.3, <em>supra, </em>narrows the situations to which the broad language of B.l\u2019s liability coverage provision applies, by excluding coverage for \u201c[a]ny vehicle, other than your \u2018covered auto,\u2019\u201d which is either owned by any family member or furnished for the regular use of any family member.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cYour\u201d refers, of course, to the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d Thus, under the Selective policy, coverage will not be provided when use of a family member-owned vehicle other than the named insured\u2019s \u201ccovered autos\u201d is involved, except when it is the named insureds themselves who are using the family member-owned vehicle. To interpret these provisions to provide coverage to Soussou under the circumstances of this case would render the exclusion ineffective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Such a restriction is readily understandable. Indeed, it is entirely reasonable to afford a family member lesser coverage when he uses his own vehicle, which is not covered under the insuring agreement. Presumably that family member has his own liability insurance that covers his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Excluding coverage for a family member\u2019s use of car that he or she or another family member owns and is separately insured \u201cis not uncommon,\u201d is \u201clegally sound and supported by policy.\u201d <em>Webb, supra, </em>348 F.Supp.2d at 330. Provided the insuring agreement is clear about the exclusion, courts will enforce its terms. <em>Ibid.; see also DiOrio v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>597, 613-14, 311 A.2d 378 (1973); <em>Green v. Dawson, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 54-55, 397 A.2d 727 (App.Div.1979). Here, the policy\u2019s exclusionary language is express, plain and unambiguous in its exemption from coverage, and clearly applies to Soussou. Moreover, the B.3 exclusion is not contradicted by the \u201cany auto\u201d language in B.l\u2019s coverage provision. Providing that an individual will be insured for the use of \u201cany auto\u201d is simply not inconsistent with excluding coverage for any vehicle other than a \u201ccovered auto\u201d that is \u201cowned by a family member\u201d and presumably separately insured, as the two provide for mutually exclusive principles of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Because Soussou\u2019s Chevy Venture was not a \u201ccovered auto\u201d and he was not designated a named insured, we are satisfied his circumstances and status fall squarely within the exclusionary language of the Selective policy. But even assuming some ambiguity over his status as a named insured, we are equally satisfied that he falls outside the exception to the policy\u2019s exclusion and that, in any event, had no objectively reasonable expectation of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-15\"> Plaintiff Denise Cassilli sued per quod.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\"> Plaintiffs executed a release and took an assignment of Soussou\u2019s claim for additional liability coverage against Selective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-14\"> Under the PAP, \u201cfamily member\" means \"a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.
