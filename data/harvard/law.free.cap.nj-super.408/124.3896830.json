Plaintiff was seriously injured as a result. Steininger\u2019s car was insured under a commercial automobile policy issued by defendant Philadelphia Insurance Company that provided uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage in the amount of $1 million. Named \u201cinsureds\u201d on the declarations page of the policy included Steininger, SCBS Supportive Housing I, Inc., and Guidance Center of Camden County, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy further provided that \u201c[i]f the [njamed [ijnsured\u201d was \u201c[a] partnership, limited liability company, corporation or any other form of organization,\u201d then additional \u201cinsureds\u201d under the policy included \u201c[ajnyone \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019----\u201d The policy included a step-down provision that expressly limited the amount of UM/UIM coverage if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">(1) An insured [wa]s not the individual named insured under th[e] policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">(2) That \u201cinsured\u201d [wa]s an individual named insured under one or more other policies providing similar coverage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">(3) All such other policies ha[d] a limit of insurance for similar coverage which [wa]s less than the [l]imit of [\u00a1Insurance for th[e] eoverage[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">Under these circumstances, \u201cthe most [defendant] wfould] pay for all damages resulting from any [ ] \u2018accident\u2019 with an \u2018uninsured\u2019 ... or \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 \u201d would be limited to \u201cthe highest applicable limit of insurance under any coverage form or policy providing coverage to that \u2018insured\u2019 as an individual named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">Gorman\u2019s insurance limit was $100,000. After receiving notification from plaintiff pursuant to <em>Longworth v. Van Houten, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 538 A.2d 414 (App.Div.1988), defendant authorized settlement with Gorman for the full policy amount. Plaintiff then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>made a claim for UIM benefits under Steininger\u2019s policy and demanded arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Defendant denied plaintiffs claim, contending that because plaintiffs personal automobile insurance policy, issued by third-party defendant <em>AAA </em>Mid-Atlantic Insurance Company (AAA), contained a UM/UIM limit of $100,000, the step-down provision in Steininger\u2019s policy became operational.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, the available UIM limit under the policy was $100,000, thus, Gorman\u2019s vehicle was not underinsured, and plaintiff had no claim for UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On April 2, 2007, plaintiff filed her complaint seeking to compel arbitration. On April 27, 2007, defendant filed its answer asserting the step-down provision as a defense. Thereafter, on September 10, 2007, the Governor signed S-1666, the so-called \u201cScutari Amendment\u201d (the Amendment), ultimately codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28\u20141.1(f), which we discuss in greater detail below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Defendant and plaintiff both filed motions for summary judgment^' returnable November 2, 2007. Defendant argued that <em>Pinto v. N.J. Manuf. Ins. Co., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>405, 874 A.2d 520 (2005), upholding the validity of step-down provisions in commercial automobile policies, was applicable to plaintiffs claim because the Amendment did not expressly provide for its retroactive application. Defendant further contended that retroactivity would result in \u201cunconstitutional interference with a vested right\u201d and violated due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In response, plaintiff argued that the Legislature unambiguously expressed its intent to apply the Amendment retroactively. Alternatively, plaintiff contended that even if the Amendment were ambiguous in this regard, extrinsic sources routinely utilized in statutory interpretation compelled the same result. In particular, plaintiff argued the Amendment was \u201ceurative[,]\u201d i.e., a legislative response to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pinto </em>intended to correct the Court\u2019s misapplication of the UIM statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In an oral opinion placed on the record, the motion judge concluded the Amendment should be applied retroactively, and accordingly, granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s decision was memorialized in an order dated the same day, and defendant\u2019s appeal ensued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that the Amendment should be given only prospective application because it does not \u201cpass the first prong of the inquiry set forth in <em>Twiss v. State, Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>[124 <em>N.J. </em>461, 591 A.2d 913 (1991)].\u201d Specifically, defendant contends the Legislature did not \u201cclearly express its intent\u201d regarding retroactivity, \u201cthe reasonable expectations of insurers and insureds do not warrant retroactive application[,]\u201d and the amendment was not \u201ccurative[.]\u201d Defendant further argues that retroactive application \u201cwould result in a manifest injustice to insurers[.]\u201d Lastly, defendant notes that since the appeal was filed and briefed, a panel of our colleagues decided <em>Olkusz v. Brown, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>496, 951 A.2d 1069 (App.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>2008), detennining the Amendment lacked express, unambiguous language evidencing retroactivity, was not \u201ccurative\u201d and, thus, did not apply retroactively. Defendant contends we should reach the same result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In urging us to affirm the motion judge\u2019s ruling, plaintiff asserts similar arguments to those she raised below. Both amicus curiae filed briefs supporting the motion judge\u2019s decision to apply the statute retroactively. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we employ the same standards used by the motion judge. <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside Bottling Co., Inc., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230, 903 A.2d 513 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006). We first determine whether the moving party has demonstrated there were no genuine disputes as to material facts; we then decide \u201cwhether the motion judge\u2019s application of the law was correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 903 A.2d 513. We owe no deference to the motion judge\u2019s conclusions on issues of law. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 903 A.2d 513 (citing <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)). Here, the essential facts were not disputed, and the judge\u2019s decision was purely a legal one to which we apply de novo review. <em>Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Kafil, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 601, 930 A.2d 457 (App.Div.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We have considered the parties\u2019 arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We hold that the Legislature implicitly intended that the Amendment have retroactive effect. However, for the reasons that follow, we also conclude that applying the Amendment retroactively to the facts of this case would be unfair and work a manifest injustice to the contractual rights of defendant. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We begin by briefly reviewing the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pinto. </em>There, the facts were similar to the case at hand, and the employer\u2019s UIM policy language was identical to that contained in defendant\u2019s policy with Steininger. <em>See Pinto, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 407-10, 874 A.2d 520. The Court found \u201cthe language of the step-down clause [was] enforceable\u201d as written, <em>id. </em>at 412, 874 A.2d 520, and affirmed our denial of the plaintifflemployee\u2019s claim for UIM benefits under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 874 A.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\"><em>Pinto </em>was decided June 6, 2005. The Amendment was legislatively filed on March 13, 2006 and ultimately enacted on September 10, 2007. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, <em>a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, ... </em>issued in this State to a corporate or business entity ... shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. <em>A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>17:28\u20141.1(f) (emphasis added).!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">By its terms, the Amendment was to be effective \u201cimmediately.\u201d <em>L. </em>2007, c. 163 \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">A legislative statement that accompanied the bill provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">This bill prohibits the use of \u201cstep-down\u201d provisions in motor vehicle liability policies issued to corporate or business entities to lower uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for employees to the limits of coverage available to the employees under their personal policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">This bill is in response to the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pinto v. New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>405, 874 A.2d 520 (2005)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">\n<em>This bill reverses the effect of the Pinto decision by prohibiting step-down provisions in these polities. Further, the bill expressly provides that a policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named, insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under that particular policy to any individual employed, by the corporate or </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\n<em>business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy, or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">[Statement accompanying <em>L. </em>2007, c. 163 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Defendant concedes that if the Steininger policy was issued after the effective date of the Amendment, its step-down provision would violate <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1(f), and the policy would be \u201cdeemed to provide\u201d any of Steininger\u2019s \u201cinsuredf]\u201d employees with the same $1 million of UIM insurance available to the policy\u2019s named corporate insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In <em>Olkusz, </em>under slightly different facts, the panel confronted the same issue before us\u2014\u201cwhether [the] amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1, adopted by the Legislature on September 10, 2007, reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pinto, </em>and prohibiting the use of step-down clauses, should be applied retroactively.\u201d <em>Olkusz, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, 951 A.2d 1069. There, plaintiff was injured while riding on her employer\u2019s shuttle bus that stopped suddenly to avoid colliding with an unidentified vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Although her employer\u2019s policy, issued by Federal Insurance Company (Federal), contained a UM limit of $1 million, it also contained provisions that \u201ccontractually den[ied] plaintiff access to her employer\u2019s UM coverage by limiting the maximum amount of UM benefits to the coverage limit contained in her personal auto policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 951 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On March 12, 2007, the trial judge granted Federal partial summary judgment \u201cholding that [the] plaintiff was bound by the step-down provision in her employer\u2019s business auto policy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After the Amendment was enacted, in September 2007, the plaintiffs personal insurer moved for reconsideration. The trial judge granted the motion, concluding the Amendment \u201capplied retroactively to any case pending or \u2018in the pipeline,\u2019 at the time of [its] passage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 951 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">In reversing the trial judge, our colleagues determined that [a]bsent a clear indication from the Legislature as to the effect of this statute, we hold that well-established principles of statutory interpretation require that we construe the statute\u2019s restriction on the common law right of freedom to contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>prospectively. The statutory prohibition at issue cannot be viewed as \u201ccurative,\u201d because the holding in <em>Pinto </em>was not predicated on a misapprehension of established legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 499, 951 A.2d 1069.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">As a result, they held that \u201c[a]ny UM/UIM claim predicated upon an accident which predates the adoption of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.1(f) must be governed by the legal principles articulated by the Supreme Court in Pmfo[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 951 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">As did our colleagues in <em>Olkusz, </em>we analyze the issue presented using well-recognized canons of statutory interpretation. \u201c\u2018When considering whether a statute should be applied prospectively or retroactively, our quest is to ascertain the intention of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Twiss, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 466, 591 A.2d 913 (quoting <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl.

If the intention to apply the statute retroactively is expressed, then \u201cthe statute should be so applied.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature may express its intent \u201ceither explicitly or implicitly[.'J\u201d <em>Twiss, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 467, 591 A.2d 913. \u201cCourts have found that the Legislature <em>implicitly </em>intended retroactive application when such an application was \u2018necessary to make the statute workable or <em>to give it the most sensible interpre</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>tation. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 522, 432 A.2d 80) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Our colleagues on the <em>Olkusz </em>panel concluded that the Legislature failed to evidence any intent, either explicitly or implicitly, regarding retroactivity. Finding \u201c[n]either the statute nor the accompanying legislative statement addresse[d] the question[,]\u201d the panel determined a retroactive construction of the Amendment was \u201cinapplicable on its face.\u201d <em>Olkusz, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 503, 951 A.2d 1069. We part company with our colleagues as to this initial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We concede that the Amendment does not explicitly state the Legislature\u2019s intention. However, we conclude that the very language of the Amendment implies that the Legislature intended it apply retroactively. We reach this conclusion applying canons of statutory construction as time-honored as those already referenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u201cOur analysis ... begins with the plain language of the statute[,]\u201d <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 493, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), which \u201cis ordinarily the \u2018surest indicator\u2019 of [the Legislature\u2019s] intent.\u201d <em>Frugis v.

Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 231, 708 A.2d 401 (1998)). \u201cIt is not the function of [a] [c]ourt to \u2018rewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature []or presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (quoting <em>O\u2019Connell v. State, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>484, 488, 795 A.2d 857 (2002)). \u201cThroughout, our analysis is informed by the injunction that \u201cwords and phrases shall be read and construed with their context, and shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or unless another or different meaning is expressly indicated, be given their generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage of the language.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins.

Thus, a court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>look beyond the plain language of the statute and resort to extrinsic sources to divine legislative intent when \u201cthe statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and susceptible to only one interpretation....\u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">One more maxim of statutory interpretation bears particular relevance to our inquiry. \u201cWhen interpreting a statute ... we endeavor to give meaning to all words\u201d used by the Legislature. <em>DKM Residential Props. Corp. v. Twp. of Montgomery, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>296, 307, 865 A.2d 649 (2005) (citing <em>Franklin Tower One v. N.M., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>602, 613, 725 A.2d 1104 (1999)). As the Supreme Court has recently said, \u201c[[Interpretations that render the Legislature\u2019s words mere surplusage are disfavored.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of J.M.B., </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 573, 964 A.2d 752 (2009); <em>Clendaniel v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>361, 367, 476 A.2d 263 (1984) (construing the statutory language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-10, noting any \u201cconstruction that will render any part of a statute inoperative, superfluous or meaningless, is to be avoided\u201d) (quoting <em>Abbotts Dairies, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>319, 328, 102 A.2d 372 (1954)). We turn, then, to the language of the Amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In its first sentence, the Amendment provides that all commercial automobile policies <em>\u201cor [the] renewal of such policies]\u201d </em>\u201cshall not provide less ... underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy.\u201d (Emphasis added). Defendant concedes that this makes the Amendment applicable to all policies issued after the statute\u2019s effective date. However, if that was all the Legislature intended, the language regarding the renewal of such policies would be unnecessary. In other words, if the Legislature only intended to affect an insurance policy issued after September 10, 2007, having once declared that any policy \u201cshall not provide\u201d less UIM coverage than that provided to the business entity, expressing the same intention as to subsequent renewals of such a policy would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>superfluous. By making the prohibition applicable to renewals of automobile insurance policies, it would seem the Legislature clearly intended to affect policies in existence as of the effective date of the act, whose renewals, absent amendatory riders for example, might not remove the prohibited language of the step-down clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The second sentence of the Amendment would likewise be unnecessary if indeed we accepted defendant\u2019s interpretation. It provides that <em>\u201c[a] policy </em>that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured <em>shall be deemed </em>to provide the maximum ... underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Presumably, new policies-those issued after September 10, 2007-would not contain the prohibited step-down clause because the first sentence of the Amendment prohibits them from being issued in that form. Thus, those insurance contracts would not need reformation, i.e., \u201cbe deemed\u201d to provide the same levels of UIM insurance to employees as it did to the business entity. It follows that by including this second sentence, the Legislature intended to reform those policies already in effect on September 10, 2007. <em>See Watkins v. Davis, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 212-13, 633 A.2d 112 (App.Div.1993) (where we characterized the effect of the \u201cdeemer\u201d statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4, to be the \u201cautomatic reformation of out-of-state policies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">At oral argument before us, and indeed before the motion judge, defendant offered no independent interpretation of the Amendment\u2019s second sentence. Instead, it argued that the sentence was intended to affect \u201crenewals moving forward,\u201d we assume meaning that by including the language, the Legislature intended only to supply a remedy in the event any policy renewed after September 10, 2007 continued to contain the offending step-down provision. However, that is accomplished by the Amendment\u2019s first sentence, and, by its very language, the \u201cdeeming\u201d provision applies to a \u201cpolicy\u201d and not a renewal. We assume that the Legislature, which used the disjunctive \u201cpolicies or renewals\u201d in the first sentence, could have chosen to include \u201crenewals\u201d in the second sentence of the Amendment, if that is what was intended. <em>See GE </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>Solid State, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>298, 308, 625 A.2d 468 (1993) (noting that when \u201cthe Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded\u201d). In short, defendant\u2019s contention that the \u201cdeeming\u201d provision applies only to prospective policy renewals finds no support in the language of the Amendment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We therefore conclude that the Legislature impliedly intended to reform all commercial vehicle insurance policies in existence on the effective date of the Amendment, and to provide an immediate remedy to those making a claim for coverage under their employer\u2019s UM/UIM policy provisions as of that date. Because those are the facts presented in this case, we conclude that the Legislature intended to provide plaintiff with a claim for UIM benefits under Steininger\u2019s policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Our conclusion in this regard, however, only answers the first part of what is a two-prong inquiry. As the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">Two questions inhere in the determination whether a court should apply a statute retroactively. The first question is whether the Legislature intended to give the statute retroactive application. If so, the second question is whether retroactive application is an unconstitutional interference with \u201cvested rights\u201d or will result in a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\"><em>[Twiss, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 467, 591 A.2d 913 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">We therefore must continue with our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">\u201cRetroactive legislation that impairs or destroys a \u2018vested right\u2019 may violate the due process clauses of the federal ... or state ... constitutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 591 A.2d 913 (internal citations omitted). \u201cRetroactive civil legislation, however, generally does not violate due process unless it results in \u2018particularly harsh and oppressive\u2019 consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469-470, 591 A.2d 913 (quoting <em>Ventron, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 468 A.2d 150). A \u201c \u2018vested right\u2019 encompasses a fixed interest entitled to protection from state aetion[.]\u201d <em>Twiss, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 591 A.2d 913. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>However, our Court has held \u201c \u2018[t]here can be no vested right in the continued existence of a statute ... which precludes its change or repeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 620, 608 A.2d 895 (1992) (quoting <em>Savarese v. New Jersey Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 309, 562 A.2d 239 (App.Div. 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Defendant claims the retroactive application of the Amendment violates its vested contractual rights. However, not every modification of existing contractual rights through retroactive application of a statutory change is unconstitutional. As the Court has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">It is well-established that legislation that has as its rational public purpose the necessary protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public, and is within the police power of the state ... may be applied retroactively to alter or abrogate existing contractual rights without affecting its validity under the contract clause of the United States or New Jersey Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[So. <em>Hamilton </em>Assocs. <em>v. Mayor &amp; Council of Morristown, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>437, 444, 493 A.2d 523 (1985); <em>see also Edgewater Inv. </em>Assocs. v. <em>Edgewater, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>227, 510 A.2d 1178 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The analysis requires consideration of three issues. \u201cTo be an unconstitutional impairment of contracts, legislation (1) must substantially impair a contractual relationship; (2) must lack a significant and legitimate public purpose; and (3) must be based upon unreasonable conditions and be unrelated to appropriate governmental objectives.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. State, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>32, 64, 590 A.2d 191 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We have no doubt that the retroactive application of the Amendment \u201csubstantially impair[s]\u201d defendant\u2019s contractual rights because it results in an \u201cunbargained-for expansion of coverage, gratis, resulting in [defendant\u2019s] exposure to a risk substantially broader than that expressly insured against in the policy.\u201d <em>Gazis v. Miller, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>224, 229, 892 A.2d 1277 (2006) (quotations and citations omitted). However, we are equally convinced that defendant cannot meet the other two prongs of the test. Clearly the retroactive application of the Amendment serves a legitimate public purpose and does so in a specific and targeted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>manner. Our courts have repeatedly recognized the public policy concerns that undergird the automobile insurance industry in this state, and the ability on the part of the Legislative and Executive branches to retroactively amend the statutory or regulatory scheme to achieve a desired result without violating the insurer\u2019s due process rights. <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>at 64-65, 590 A.2d 191; <em>Affiliated FM Ins. Co. v. State, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 561-62, 770 A.2d 741 (App.Div.2001); <em>In re American Reliance Ins. Co., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 557, 598 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>556, 606 A.2d 369 (1992). Thus, we do not believe the retroactive application of the Amendment presents an unconstitutional interference with defendant\u2019s \u201cvested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We do conclude, however, that retroactive application to the Amendment to the facts of this case would work a manifest injustice to defendant. Manifest injustice is found where the \u201caffected party relied, to his or her prejudice, on the law that is now to be changed as a result of the retroactive application of the statute,\u201d and where \u201cthe consequences of this reliance are so deleterious and irrevocable that it would be unfair to apply the statute retroactively.\u201d <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 523-24, 432 A.2d 80. \u201cThis test does not flow from constitutional requirements, but instead is based on equitable concerns.\u201d <em>Edgewater Inv. Assocs., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 239, 510 A.2d 1178 (citing <em>Ventron, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 468 A.2d 150). \u201c[T]he manifest injustice standard involves a weighing process similar to that espoused in <em>Rothman[.]\" Edgewater Inv. Assocs., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 240, 510 A.2d 1178 (citations omitted). Succinctly stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">A state may, in the exercise of the police power, enact a statute to promote the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. Such a statute, because of retroactive application or otherwise, may diminish in value or totally destroy an individual\u2019s right, whether in property as such or arising out of contract, provided that the public interest to be promoted sufficiently outweighs in importance the private right which is impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\"><em>[Rothman, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 320 A.2d 496.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">To be considered in this weighing process is \u201cthe extent to which [defendant] changed [its] position in reliance on the existing law [ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>or had [its] reasonable expectations defeated.\u201d <em>Phillips, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 625, 608 A.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As our colleagues noted, defendant\u2019s reliance in this context \u201cmust be gauged by the legal principles governing the common law right of freedom to contract prevailing during the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Olkusz, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505, 951 A.2d 1069. In <em>Pinto, </em>the Court explicitly noted that the then-prevailing case law \u201crecognize[d] the legitimacy of step-down provisions even though they may result in differential treatment of similar plaintiffs based on the existence of other available insurance.\u201d <em>Pinto, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 874 A.2d 520 (citing <em>Magnifico v. Rutgers Cos. Ins. Co., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>406, 418, 710 A.2d 412 (1998)). Thus, the then-prevailing state of the law gave defendant \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that its contractual provisions were proper and enforeeable[.]\u201d <em>Olkusz, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 506, 951 A.2d 1069. Retroactive application of the Amendment would clearly defeat both that reliance and reasonable expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Plaintiff can raise no similar argument as to reliance or reasonable expectation if the Amendment is not applied retroactively. Plaintiff and amici attempt to paint a picture of unsettled legal precedent that pre-dated <em>Pinto. </em>As noted above, however, the Court explicitly rejected such a claim. We decline what is essentially an invitation to re-visit the historical antecedents of <em>Pinto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Nor do we accept plaintiffs and amici\u2019s arguments that her reasonable expectations of coverage under Steininger\u2019s policy are unfairly thwarted unless the Amendment is applied retroactively. NJSBA cites <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Casualty, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 346-47, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994), where we held that a reasonable policy-holder would not look beyond the declarations page of their personal insurance for the essentials of insurance coverage. <em>Lehrhoff </em>is inapplicable, however, because the policy here is not plaintiffs personal auto policy. In <em>Skeete v. Dorvius, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 845 A.2d 1265 (App.Div.2004), <em>aff'd by </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>5, 875 A.2d 859 (2005), we noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>[I]n enforcing an insurance policy, courts will depart from the literal text and interpret it in accordance with the insured\u2019s understanding, even when that understanding contradicts the insurer\u2019s intent, if the text appears overly technical or contains hidden pitfalls, cannot be understood without employing subtle or legalistic distinctions, is obscured by fine print, or requires strenuous study to comprehend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 319-320, 845 A.2d 1265 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In this case, plaintiff was not the policy holder and there is nothing in the record to indicate she was even aware of its provisions. The language of the policy is clear. Moreover, the Court in <em>Pinto </em>implicitly rejected the argument regarding unfair ambiguity in the contract language, noting with approval our decision in that case which found \u201cnothing unclear, ambiguous or unfair about th[e] [step-down] provisions.\u201d <em>Pinto, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 416, 874 A.2d 520. We hasten to add that defendant provided UIM insurance under the policy at issue in full accordance with the enabling statute. This coverage was not illusory because it provided benefits to those employees of Steininger that did not maintain their own personal insurance policies. <em>Pinto, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 416, 874 A.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Prospective application of the Amendment clearly provides a substantial benefit to the public by providing broader UIM coverage to those occupying their employer\u2019s vehicles at the time of an accident. However, in light of the fact that this was something plaintiff neither relied upon nor reasonably expected at the time of the accident, we believe any public interest served is outweighed by the \u201cdeleterious and irrevocable\u201d effects upon not only this defendant, but other insurers, if the Amendment was applied retroactively under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">That the retroactive application of the Amendment raises serious concerns of fairness is highlighted by the uncertain reach such a holding would have. In this case, the policy expired years before the Amendment was enacted. Retroactive application of the Amendment in these circumstances would enable a plaintiff to seek benefits under any policy of insurance, whenever it was issued, as long as the statute of limitations, six years, had not expired. That universe of potential claimants might be further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>extended to a small degree by permitting minor plaintiffs, named-insureds on their own policies, to now present a claim for an earlier accident occurring even beyond the six-year limit. No one can, or has, legitimately estimated what the universe of potential claimants could in fact be.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The extent of any retroactive application of the Amendment must also be considered. In other words, should the Amendment apply to effectively \u201creform\u201d policies covering accidents for which no claim for UIM benefits was ever made, but for which the statute of limitations has not expired? Should it be applicable to cases in which a final determination had already been reached, but where reconsideration motions are now brought, as was the case in <em>Olkusz? </em>Or, should it be limited to all cases \u201cin the pipeline,\u201d i.e., pending at the time the Amendment was enacted, or on direct appeal at the time? Because the Legislature spoke only in terms of policies and renewals, not causes of action, resolution of these questions remains uncertain, and would undoubtedly spawn further litigation. We raise these issues without deciding them, because they evidence further support for our conclusion that retroactive application of the Amendment under the facts of this case would be manifestly unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We therefore reverse the order under review. Since the motion judge viewed the other aspect of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, in which it sought a declaration that plaintiff was covered by the AAA personal insurance policy, as moot, we remand the matter for further proceedings to resolve that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-16\"> What relationship, if any, existed between Steininger and these two other entities is not disclosed by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> Plaintiff denied that the AAA policy was in effect on the day of the accident; however, in its answer to the third-party complaint, AAA admitted its policy with plaintiff was effective on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> The bill was sponsored by State Senator Nicholas Scutari (D-Union).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> During oral argument before the trial judge, defendant also noted that the Steininger policy expired in October 2005, well before enactment of the Amendment.
