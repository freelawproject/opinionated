On May 13, 2008, the trial court entered an order denying the ECPO\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Z.W. is a fourteen-year-old boy accused of sexually molesting his four-year-old nephew. The incident was witnessed by the victim\u2019s six-year-old sister, K.W., who reported it to her mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>who, in turn, contacted the police. We have been advised that DYFS conducted an investigation of this incident and found that the allegations were not substantiated. As part of its investigation, DYFS ordered a psychological evaluation of K.W., and released a copy of that report to the ECPO. Defense counsel demanded a copy of the report in discovery; the ECPO requested the trial court to conduct a preliminary <em>in camera </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In support of its order of May 6, 2008, the trial court held that, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(a), DYFS is authorized to disclose information it obtains in investigating child abuse reports to specific entities identified in the statute, and the ECPO is identified therein as an approved recipient of such reports. The court further found that \u201cthe ECPO is \u2018authorized by law\u2019 to disclose [the information] by virtue of sources including Federal and State constitutions and the New Jersey Rules of Court....\u201d Therefore, the court concluded, \u201cwhenever the ECPO is ... \u2018authorized by law to disclose DYFS investigatory information!,]\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(b), \u201cthe disclosure statute <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(a) ] does not prohibit the ECPO from disclosing such information directly to counsel for the accused juvenile[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The order also stated that \u201cthe present record clearly establishes that the ECPO is aware of the existence of additional DYFS investigatory information relevant to th[is] ... matter, namely a DYFS incident report expressly referenced in [the psychological evaluation.]\u201d The order concluded that the ECPO \u201chas been advised of its obligation to obtain, and if appropriate, disclose to defense counsel information contained in such additional DYFS investigatory information, pursuant to sources including <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>419, 437-38, [115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1555, 1567-68, 131 <em>L.Ed.2 </em>d 490, 508] (1995)....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In support Of its request for an <em>in camera </em>review, the ECPO relied upon <em>Pa. v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 40 (1987), and <em>State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 530 A.2d 806 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>54, 532 A.2d 1118 (1987). In its order, the court deemed those cases \u201cdistinguishable on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>grounds that [they] addressed records sought directly from DYFS, as opposed to the case <em>sub judice </em>wherein DYFS had already disclosed the records to an authorized recipient, namely the ECPO[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On appeal, the ECPO raises the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY DENIED THE STATE\u2019S REQUEST FOR AN IN CAMERA REVIEW OF CONFIDENTIAL DYFS RECORDS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">A. The State is Entitled To An <em>In Camera </em>Review of K.W.\u2019s Psychosocial Evaluation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">1. The United States Supreme Court Holding In <em>Kyles u Whitley </em>Does Not Require The Disclosure of K.W.\u2019s Psychosocial Evaluation Without An <em>In Camera </em>Review</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">2. The Psychosocial Evaluation of K.W. Is Also Protected Under The Victim-Counselor Privilege</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">B. The State Is Not Required To Obtain A DYFS Incident Report Or Other Investigatory Reports, Not Currently Within Its Possession, For Disclosure To Defense Counsel</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">It is undisputed that the psychological evaluation and the \u201cadditional DYFS investigatory information\u201d referenced in the May 6, 2008 order are \u201cconfidential\u201d documents pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.10a(a), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">All records ... made pursuant to [this statute], [and] all information obtained by [DYFS] in investigating such reports ... shall be kept confidential and may be disclosed only under the circumstances expressly authorized ... herein. [DYFS] shall disclose information only as authorized under ... this section that is relevant to the purpose for which the information is required____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-14\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.10a(b)(2) authorizes DYFS \u201cupon written request, [to] release the records and reports referred to [herein] ... to ... [a] police or other law enforcement agency investigating a report of child abuse or neglect.\u201d In addition, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.10a(b)(6) authorizes DYFS to release such information to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\">[a] court ..., upon its finding that access to such records may be necessary for determination of an issue before it, and <em>smh records may be disclosed by the court </em>... in whole or in part to the ... attorney or other appropriate person <em>upon a finding that such further disclosure is necessary for determination of an issue before the </em>court____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-17\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Thus, while DYFS is permitted to release such reports to authorized recipients such as the ECPO, further release to third parties not identified as such by the statute should not occur until and unless the court finds that the subject information is necessary to determine an issue before it. In order to make the determination required by the statute, the court must undertake an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Kyles v. Whitley, supra, </em>as authorizing the disclosure ordered. <em>Kyles </em>indicates that relevant information in the possession of law enforcement agents need only be produced if there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d it would be necessary to ensure a criminal defendant a fair trial. <em>Kyles, supra, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>at 434, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1565-66, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 506. Here, the trial court made no finding that the DYFS records met this standard. Moreover, any such finding would require in camera review of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In further consideration of the confidential nature of these DYFS records, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s rejection of the ECPO\u2019s reliance upon <em>Pa. v. Ritchie </em>and <em>State v. Cusick, </em>both <em>supra. </em>We concur with the position espoused by DYFS, which appears as amicus curiae in this matter, that the relevancy of the challenged records is not the proper inquiry. As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Ritchie, </em>courts must weigh the conflicting constitutional rights of criminal defendants to a fair trial and the confrontation of witnesses, against the State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting child abuse information and records. <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>at 59-61, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1002-03, 94 L.Ed.2d. at 58-60. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">[the defendant's] interest (as well as that of the [State]) in ensuring a fair trial can be protected fully by requiring that the [child protection agency\u2019s] files be submitted only to the trial court for in camera review____[T]he court would be obligated to release information material to the fairness of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFX\">[480 <em>U.S. </em>at 60, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1002-03, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 59.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">In <em>Cusick, </em>we held that trial courts must look to whether disclosure of DYFS records is essential to the resolution of any issue before the court, as well as whether the information contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>those records is available from any other source through diligent investigation on the part of the defendant. <em>Cusick, supra, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457-59, 530 A.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Based upon the foregoing, we conclude the trial court erred in ordering the ECPO to release KWs psychological evaluation to defense counsel without first conducting an <em>in camera </em>review of that document pursuant to the dictates of <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Cusick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Regarding the \u201cadditional DYFS investigatory information,\u201d which the May 6, 2008 order required that DYFS \u201creview ... and evaluate whether [it] ... should be disclosed to counsel for Z.W.[,]\u201d we conclude this requirement runs afoul of the presumption of confidentiality and limitations on disclosure of such records as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10a(a). Defense counsel may seek disclosure of this additional information through subpoena which, in turn, will require the trial court to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review to determine whether such additional information should be disclosed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-10a(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
