The trial court sentenced the juvenile to a one-year term of probation and imposed the statutorily mandated penalties. On appeal, the juvenile\u2019s only argument is that the stop and search that revealed the stolen property, a wallet, violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment and Article I, paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitution. We reject this argument and therefore affirm the denial of the juvenile\u2019s motion to suppress and the adjudication of an act of delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The stop and search that revealed the stolen wallet in the juvenile\u2019s possession occurred in Hazlet around 2 a.m. on November 10, 2006, which was three hours after an 11 p.m. curfew for juveniles established by municipal ordinance. Patrolman Kevin Geoghan was driving a marked police car when he observed R.M. and another juvenile run across the street in front of a car, which caused the driver to brake. Officer Geoghan stopped his car and approached the two juveniles. Because they appeared to be young, he asked them how old they were, and they responded sixteen. Geoghan asked the juveniles whether they had any identification on them, and they said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">While Geoghan was questioning the juveniles, he noticed that R.M. was carrying a backpack with an outer mesh pocket. When Geoghan first asked R.M. about the backpack, he said it belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Geoghan then noticed that there was a brown wallet visible through the mesh in the outer pocket of the backpack. Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>juveniles had said that they did not have any identification and most persons carry some form of identification in their wallet, Geoghan told the juveniles he needed to examine the wallet to determine whether it contained any identification. At this point, R.M. said the backpack did not belong to him but rather to his brother, and that he did not know who the wallet belonged to. Geoghan told R.M. that he needed to examine the wallet and removed it from the backpack. Geoghan\u2019s examination of the contents of the wallet disclosed that it contained the identification of a person named Mazza. When Geoghan questioned the juveniles about this identification, they both stated that they did not know Mazza.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Geoghan next examined the inside of the backpack, which contained a cell phone, sweatshirt and a zip-lock bag containing photographs. R.M. told Geoghan those items all belonged to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">After discovering Mazza\u2019s wallet inside the backpack, Geoghan brought both juveniles to police headquarters \u201cto be processed for the curfew violation, and so that [he] could further investigate the wallet and its contents.\u201d Geoghan conducted a computer check at headquarters, which disclosed that Mazza had reported two days before that his wallet had been stolen. Geoghan then arrested R.M. for a violation of the municipal curfew ordinance and receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The trial court concluded that Officer Geoghan\u2019s observations of the juveniles\u2019 jaywalking, their admission when he first approached them that they were under the age that subjected them to the 11 p.m. municipal curfew, and R.M.\u2019s conflicting answers regarding ownership of the backpack, gave Officer Geoghan the reasonable and articulable suspicion that the juveniles were engaged in unlawful conduct required for a <em>Terry </em>investigative stop. The court also concluded that the seizure of the wallet in the backpack was valid because the juveniles relinquished any \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d with respect to the wallet when they both disclaimed any property interest in it. In addition, the court concluded that the juveniles\u2019 actions and responses to Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Geoghan\u2019s questions provided probable cause to arrest them for the curfew violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On appeal, defendant does not present any argument regarding Officer Geoghan\u2019s investigative stop of the juveniles. In any event, we are satisfied, substantially for the reasons stated by the trial court, that the stop was valid. We therefore turn to defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the validity of the seizure of Mazza\u2019s wallet from the mesh pocket of R.M.\u2019s backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s rationale for upholding the validity of the seizure of Mazza\u2019s wallet\u2014that the juveniles relinquished any reasonable expectation of privacy in the wallet by disclaiming ownership or other proprietary interest\u2014is inconsistent with <em>State v. Johnson, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>528, 551-52, 940 A.2d 1185 (2008), which held that a disclaimer of ownership of property in response to police questioning does not constitute an abandonment that allows the police to seize the property without probable cause. The State argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Johnson, </em>and in any event, <em>Johnson </em>should not be applied retroactively. We have no need to consider the State\u2019s arguments regarding the applicability of <em>Johnson </em>because we conclude that Officer Geoghan\u2019s seizure and subsequent search of Mazza\u2019s wallet was valid as a search incident to R.M.\u2019s arrest pending his identification and return to his parents\u2019 custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">One exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution is for a search incident to an arrest. <em>State v. Dangerfield, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>446, 455-56, 795 A.2d 250 (2002). \u201cThe purpose of such a search is (1) to protect the arresting officer from any danger and (2) to prevent the destruction or concealment of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 795 A.2d 250. Consequently, \u201c[t]he scope of [such a] search is restricted to the person of the arrestee and the area within his or her immediate control.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Before a search incident to arrest may be conducted, there must be probable cause to arrest the person, which requires a showing of a \u201cwell grounded suspicion\u201d that an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 795 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A.2d 250 (quoting <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>204, 211, 777 A.2d 60 (2001)),</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Both R.M. and his companion admitted to Officer Geoghan when he first approached them that they were under the age that subjects a juvenile to the municipal curfew.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, Officer Geoghan had probable cause to believe that R.M. had violated the curfew ordinance, and the officer\u2019s questioning of the juveniles indicated that their presence on the street at 2 a.m. did not fall within any of the exceptions to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">R.M. argues, relying upon <em>State v. Hurtado, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>1, 549 A.2d 428 (1988), <em>rev\u2019g on dissent </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 23-25, 529 A.2d 1000 (App.Div.1987), that the police had no authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-152 to arrest him for a violation of the curfew ordinance because his conduct did not involve a \u201cbreach of the peace.\u201d However, R.M. is a juvenile. Thus, he could be taken into custody under the authority of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-31(b)(2), which authorizes a law enforcement officer to take a juvenile into \u201cshort-term custody\u201d if he \u201chas reasonable grounds to believe the juvenile has left the home and care of his parents or guardian without the consent of such persons.\u201d Since Officer Geoghan found R.M. and his companion wandering the streets three horn\u2019s after the curfew, and the curfew ordinance makes it unlawful for a parent or guardian to permit a juvenile to violate the curfew, Officer Geoghan had reasonable grounds to conclude that R.M. had left home without his parents\u2019 consent. Therefore, he was authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-31(b)(2) to take R.M. into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Moreover, both juveniles told Officer Geoghan that they did not have any identification in their possession. Consequently, even if the juveniles\u2019 violation of the curfew ordinance did not provide grounds for their arrest, they could be temporarily detained for the purpose of obtaining verification of their identities, <em>see State v. Lark, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>294, 296-97, 748 A.2d 1103 (2000); <em>Manon v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Borough of Manasquan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 330-31, <em>555 </em>A.2d 699 (App.Div.1989); <em>Hurtado, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>1, 549 A.2d 428, <em>rev\u2019g on dissent </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 23, 529 A.2d 1000, and if they failed to produce identification, they could be arrested and detained at police headquarters until adequate evidence of their identities was obtained. <em>See Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>640, 646-47, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2605, 2610, 77 L.Ed.2d 65, 71 (1983); see <em>also R. </em>3:3-1(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Whenever the police arrest a person, they may conduct a search incident to the arrest of the person and the area within his immediate control. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 487-91, 924 A.2d 582 (App.Div.2007). One purpose of such a search is protection of the arresting officer in transporting the arrestee to police headquarters. <em>Id. </em>at 487-91, 924 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Furthermore, the arrest is not required to precede the search. <em>State v. O\u2019Neal, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>601, 614-15, 921 A.2d 1079 (2007). \u201cIt is the \u2018right to arrest\u2019 rather than the actual arrest that \u2018must pre-exist the search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 921 A.2d 1079 (quoting <em>State v. Doyle, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>334, 342, 200 A.2d 606 (1964)). \u201cAs long as the right to arrest pre-existed the search, and the \u2018arrest is valid independently of, and is not made to depend on, the search or its result,\u2019 the search will not be invalidated \u2018simply because in precise point of time the arrest does not precede the search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614-15 (quoting <em>Doyle, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 200 A.2d 606).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Before Officer Geoghan seized Mazza\u2019s wallet from inside the mesh pocket of R.M.\u2019s backpack, he had a right to detain R.M. and bring him to police headquarters in order to verify his identification, issue him a summons for the violation of the curfew ordinance, and return him to his parents\u2019 custody. Moreover, it is evident Officer Geoghan intended to detain R.M. for these purposes; there is no basis for concluding that he was simply going to leave R.M. on the streets, in violation of the curfew, without verifying his identity. R.M.\u2019s violation of the curfew ordinance constituted a continuing violation, which Officer Geoghan had a responsibility to terminate by taking him into custody. It is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>clear that the wallet was in the area within R.M.\u2019s immediate control because it was contained in a backpack he was carrying on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Furthermore, the seizure of the wallet from R.M.\u2019s backpack and search of its contents was directly related to R.M.\u2019s violation of the curfew ordinance, which was the reason for his arrest, and to Officer Geoghan\u2019s discharge of his responsibilities for enforcement of that ordinance. Before Officer Geoghan observed the wallet in plain view in R.M.\u2019s backpack, R.M. and his companion had both asserted that they did not have any identification in their possession. Without reliable evidence of R.M.\u2019s identity, Officer Geoghan was not in a position either to issue him a summons or to return him to his parents\u2019 custody. It was reasonable for Officer Geoghan to believe that the wallet in R.M.\u2019s backpack would contain evidence of his identity and address, which would enable Officer Geoghan to complete the performance of his official responsibilities regarding R.M.\u2019s violation of the curfew ordinance. <em>Cf. State v. Pena-Flores, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>6, 31-32, 965 A.2d 114 (2009) (holding that where operator of motor vehicle who has committed traffic violation is unable to produce registration for car, police officer may conduct search of glove compartment and other areas where registration is ordinarily kept). Such identification also could provide corroborative evidence that R.M. was under the age of eighteen and consequently subject to the curfew ordinance. Therefore, the seizure and subsequent search of the wallet constituted a valid search incident to R.M.\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> We note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.52(b)(l) specifically authorizes municipalities to adopt curfew ordinances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
