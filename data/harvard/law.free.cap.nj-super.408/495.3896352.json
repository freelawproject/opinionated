Our courts have addressed this issue in criminal and punitive damage cases. Here we consider the issue in a civil trial where the sole issue in dispute is whether plaintiff met the verbal threshold and if so, the quantum of compensatory damages. At trial, the use of the argument combined with other inappropriate comments caused the trial judge to set aside a damage award verdict in favor of plaintiff and order a new trial. The new trial, devoid of the offending comments, resulted in a \u201cno cause\u201d verdict. We conclude that the use of \u201csend a message\u201d when the sole issue is compensatory damages is inappropriate. Counsel\u2019s assertions in this case, both on opening and summation, were replete with improper commentary and as such support our affirming the trial judge\u2019s discretionary decision to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">This is a verbal threshold case involving a three-ear collision wherein plaintiff Freddi Jackowitz\u2019s vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by defendant Stephanie Lang.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also involved was a vehicle driven by another defendant Katherine DeBaker<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Defendant apparently \u201cran a red light\u201d causing the accident. At the time of the accident, plaintiff was stopped at the light.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">As a result of the collision, both plaintiff and DeBaker suffered injuries. Just prior to jury selection, defendant stipulated as to liability. Consequently, plaintiffs complaint against DeBaker was dismissed, and both plaintiffs and DeBaker\u2019s claims were tried on the issue of damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">During the four days of trial, the sole witnesses, with the exception of a character witness called on behalf of plaintiff, were plaintiff, DeBaker and five medical experts. As liability had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>stipulated, aside from plaintiffs and DeBaker\u2019s description of the accident, no other testimony was produced regarding defendant\u2019s negligence or the circumstances of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The testimony of the witnesses was secondary, however, to comments made by counsel during the course of opening and summation. During plaintiffs opening, counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">The main reason you\u2019re here is because Ms. Clericuzio\u2019s client Stephanie Lang caused a car accident. And as a result of that car accident Ms. Jaekowitz has permanent injuries that she\u2019s going to have for the rest of her life. That\u2019s it in a nutshell. This is a tort case. <em>Ms. Jaekowitz has asked the Court to basically send a message to the defendant and to other drivers through your decision that the type of behavior from Mrs. Lang and her abuse of the privilege of driving an automobile cannot be commenced [sic], (phonetic) that when people suffer injuries there must be a consequence. Ml right1 </em>[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">And let me ask you this question; is there a larger reason that you\u2019re here that we\u2019ve taken six hours to get to this point? Are you here simply for Ms. Jaekowitz and Ms. DeBaker? Or is there a larger reason that you\u2019re here? Certainly, as I said, you\u2019re here for Ms. Jaekowitz. You\u2019re here to decide how to make her whole, how to even out those scales. <em>But there\u2019s </em>a <em>larger reason you\u2019re here and that\u2019s to send a message that when somebody abuses the privilege of driving, when somebody cannot wait another 10 seconds for a light to change that there has to be consequences. </em>And in this case Ms. Lang\u2019s refusal or inability to wait another 40 seconds for a light to change has had consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\"><em>Ms. Jackomtz and I have been basically waiting for four years for you to send a message to Ms. Lang and to the other people that use the roads in New Jersey that there need to be consequences </em>when people do the types of things like running lights at that intersection that causes people impairment, loss of enjoyment of life. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">During a colloquy before trial, even though defense counsel did not specifically object, the trial judge raised the issue of the \u201csend a message\u201d comments. He neither provided a cautionary instruction to the jury nor did he declare a mistrial, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">At the conclusion of the proofs and before summation, the judge belatedly instructed the jury with regards to counsel\u2019s opening statement. The judge reminded the jury that opening and closing statements are not evidence and attorneys are not witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Specifically in reference to counsel\u2019s \u201csend a message\u201d theme, the judge stated that the purpose of the trial was \u201cto determine whether or not the plaintiffs [were] entitled to compensation for damages that were proximately caused by the accident,\u201d and accordingly, the jury \u201cshould disregard that comment and that comment should not be a subject of [the jury\u2019s] in [their] deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Defense counsel began her summation by repeating that \u201cthis [was] a typical accident, a typical case. There\u2019s an accident and, unfortunately many of us have had them. They happen.\u201d The remainder of the summation focused on questioning the credibility and motive of plaintiffs and their expert witnesses, including tracking Jackowitz\u2019s timeframe in seeking treatment and her choice of medical professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Plaintiffs counsel started his summation by suggesting that in cases such as this, sometimes the focus shifts from defendant\u2019s conduct to what plaintiff \u201cdid do, didn\u2019t do, whether [sic] doctor did do, didn\u2019t do or something like that,\u201d and whether plaintiff should \u201chave gone to the doctor sooner\u201d or whether the doctor \u201c[did] something wrong.\u201d Counsel then added the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">I want to put it to you this way, neither Freddi Jackowitz nor Kathy DeBaker caused this accident. Neither Freddi nor Kathy cause this accident. Neither Freddi nor Kathy caused this accident. Stephanie Lang did. And <em>that\u2019s what this trial is about. What Stephanie. Lang did and the harm she caused by abusing her driving privileges on the day of the accident. </em>That\u2019s what the trial is about. And if when you go back and deliberate, and you\u2019re going to start talking about the things that were talked about at the trial, what the doctors discussed and that type of thing, so you\u2019re going to end up discussing all those other details, at some point in time I would just ask you to say to yourself or even out loud, <em>let\u2019s not forget what or why you\u2019re really here which is to concentrate on what Stephanie Lang did wrong by her attorney\u2019s own admission.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">And the idea is in a tort case somebody has to have a duty in order to be negligent and to do something wrong they have to have a duty to do something right to begin with. <em>And the duty is to drive properly. </em>When the State of New Jersey gives you your license they test you first to make sure you know how to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>drive and you know what street signs mean. <em>And you know, when you accept that license and have your picture taken you\u2019re saying, yes, I\u2019m going to obey the traffic laws, you know, I\u2019m not going to run through red lights, et cetera. I am going to be a careful, prudent driver and not injure other people.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Breach, somebody\u2014somebody doesn\u2019t do what they promised they will do. [ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The judge interjected at that point and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, this is a trial on damages only. [Plaintiffs counsel] is going into the area of really negligente] and while the defendant has admitted-has acknowledged that she was negligent this trial is only about damages, whether there were damages that were caused as a result of the motor vehicle accident, what those damages are and whether those damages were proximately caused by the happening of the accident. So it\u2019s not appropriate for us to go into the duty and to the breach issues, that is really for a negligence trial. Again, that\u2019s not before you today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Counsel then focused his summation on plaintiffs injuries and relevant legal concepts and stated that plaintiff was simply asking \u201cfor fair compensation.\u201d There were no objections by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">After the judge\u2019s jury charge, the jury deliberated and rendered a verdict of $50,000 in favor of plaintiff and $75,000 in favor of DeBaker. Defendant then filed a motion for new trial. In support of her motion, defendant argued that \u201c[ejounsel for plaintiff Jackowitz made a highly improper appeal to the jury, in opening statements, asking them to \u2018send a message\u2019 to defendant Lang who \u2018ran a red light.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The judge granted the motion for a new trial as to plaintiff, and denied the motion as to DeBaker. In granting the motion, the trial judge recognized that \u201cthe law for [sic] permits some mention of how the accident happened, some context for the jury to understand the happening of the accident and how the injuries were incurred.\u201d He found, however, that counsel for plaintiff, in his opening and in his closing, \u201cwent far beyond the permissible standards for talking about the case.\u201d The trial court found that plaintiff \u201cthrough her attorney ..., exceeded the propriety of\u2014 and the bounds of proper argument in\u201d both the opening statements and closing arguments because he appealed to punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>aspects and that is how plaintiff \u201cgot over the verbal threshold,\u201d rather than by proper evidence. He found that despite the judge\u2019s curative instructions, the jury \u201cwas so inflamed and so incensed by the comments by [plaintiffs counsel] that it did affect the\u2014the verdict in the Jackowitz case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The judge acknowledged that he \u201cprobably should have declared a mistrial at that point or given further cautionary instructions.\u201d He found that such an opening statement was improper and \u201can appeal to what\u2019s referred to as the Golden Rule.\u201d <em>See Geler v. Akawie, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 464, 818 A.2d 402 (App.Div.) (stating that \u201c[t]he Old Testament\u2019s \u2018golden rule\u2019 that you should do unto others as you would wish them to do unto you may not be applied in this context\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>223, 827 A.2d 290 (2003); <em>Henker v.

Specifically, the judge found that \u201c[plaintiffs counsel was] really asking the jury to consider ... what the impact would be on themselves and to, you know, how they should somehow punish the defendant ... for her actions,\u201d and that it was \u201can improper argument that appealed to the golden rule and to punitive sentiments directed at defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Plaintiffs case was retried and resulted in a verdict of no cause for action in favor of defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201c[A] civil plaintiff has a constitutional right to have a jury decide the merits and worth of her case.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Scaccetti, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>256, 279, 927 A.2d 1269 (2007). \u201cDetermining just compensation for an accident victim, particularly when the damages are not susceptible to scientific precision, as in the case of pain and suffering damages, necessarily requires a high degree of discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, our jury system \u201cplaces trust in ordinary men and women of varying experiences and backgrounds, who serve as jurors\u201d and gives them \u201cwide latitude in which to operate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 927 A.2d 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cBecause a jury is given wide latitude in determining pain and suffering damages, the standard for granting a new trial or remittitur is necessarily high. The \u2018judge may not substitute his judgment for that of the jury merely because he would have reached the opposite <em>conclusion____Id. </em>at 281, 927 A.2d 1269 (quoting <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 598, 379 A.2d 225 (1977) (quoting <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. 2, </em>6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969))). Consequently, \u201c[a] trial court should not order a new trial ... unless it is so clearly disproportionate to the injury and its sequela ... that it may be said to shock the judicial conscience. The verdict must be \u201cwide of the mark\u2019 and pervaded by a sense of \u201cwrongness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 927 A.2d 1269 (quoting <em>Baxter, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 598-99, 379 A.2d 225 (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)) (internal citation omitted)). \u201cIn other words, the trial court -must be \u2018clearly and convincingly\u2019 persuaded that it would be manifestly unjust to sustain the award.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>R. </em>4:49-l(a); <em>Baxter, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 604, 379 A.2d 225).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">When such finding is made and supported by the record, we will defer to the trial judge\u2019s discretion in granting a new trial and will intervene only if we are satisfied \u201c \u2018that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Geler v. Akawie, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 464, 818 A.2d 402 (App.Div.)

However, \u201c[t]he \u2018feel of the case\u2019 factor, while entitled to deference, is the only element distinguishing the standard governing appellate review from that controlling trial court reaction to a jury verdict.\u201d <em>Ibid</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\"><em>[Scaccetti, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 282, 927 A.2d 1269.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Ultimately, we must determine whether the judge abused his discretion in granting the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">In addressing the issue here, we consider the limits of advocacy as the trial and jury system achieves resolution of disputes. Counsel\u2019s arguments are expected to be passionate, \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>indeed it is the duty of a trial attorney to advocate.\u201d <em>Geler, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 463, 818 A.2d 402. At the same time, however, arguments should be fair and courteous, grounded in the evidence and free from any \u201cpotential to cause injustice,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>such as \u201c[ujnfair and prejudicial appeals to emotion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 468, 818 A.2d 402, and \u201cinsinuations of bad faith on the part of defendants who sought to resolve by trial validly contested claims against them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 818 A.2d 402 (citing <em>Henker, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 524 A.2d 455); <em>Accord Rodd v. Raritan Radiologic Assocs., P.A., </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 171-72, 860 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Fleeting comments, even if improper, may not warrant a new trial, particularly when the verdict is fair. <em>See, e.g., Dolan v. Sea Transfer Corp., </em>398 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 332, 942 A.2d 29 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>520, 950 A.2d 907 (2008). Moreover, the \u201c[fjailure to make a timely objection indicates that defense counsel did not believe the remarks were prejudicial at the time they were made,\u201d and it \u201calso deprives the court of the opportunity to take curative action.\u201d <em>State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 576, 737 A.2d 55 (1999). Where defense counsel has not objected, we generally will not reverse unless plain error is shown. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Against these parameters, we consider the specific comments at issue. The cases in New Jersey addressing the propriety of the \u201csending a message\u201d argument have focused on criminal verdicts or punitive damage awards. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 521, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988) (concluding that that type of argument is \u201cimproper and prejudiced defendant\u2019s penalty-phase proceeding,\u201d where the prosecutor \u201curg[ed] the jury to sentence defendant to death in order to deter him from future acts of violence and to \u2018send a message\u2019 to society that conduct such as defendant\u2019s will result in the death penalty\u201d); <em>State v. Hawk, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 283, 743 A.2d 325 (App.Div.2000) (noting that \u201c[p]roseeutors may sum up graphically and forcefully, but they may not make comments that a jury must \u2018send a message\u2019 to the community and to the defendant\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Both <em>Rose </em>and <em>Hawk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>required reversals based on the prosecutor\u2019s comments combined with other misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Most recently, in <em>Tarr v. Bob Ciasulli\u2019s Mack Auto Mall, Inc., </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557, 569 n. 3, 916 A.2d 484 (App.Div.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>212, 943 A.2d 866 (2008), we alluded to <em>Rose, supra, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>at 520-21, 548 A.2d 1058 and recognized that ,\u201c[u]sually exhorting the jury to send a message is an improper argument.\u201d However, in <em>Tarr, supra, </em>we declined to decide \u201cwhether such an argument would be proper when setting the amount of a punitive damage award.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, we held that the New Jersey Punitive Damages Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.9 to -5.17, \u201cdoes not permit counsel to urge the jury to increase a punitive damage award in order to enhance the general deterrence of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 916 A.2d 484. In <em>Tarr, </em>\u201cplaintiff argued to the jury that the amount of the punitive damage award present[ed] an \u2018opportunity to send a message to deter [that] particular defendant and others, whether they be other non-automotive businesses or automotive businesses from this type of conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the trial court similarly instructed the jury \u201cthat its award was \u2018to punish the defendant and to deter the defendant and others from similar future wrongful conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 916 A.2d 484. We concluded that counsel\u2019s \u201cargument constituted plain error under the Act, and to the extent the argument was condoned by the jury instructions the charge was also contrary to the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 916 A.2d 484. <em>See also Jadlowski v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 211-13, 661 A.2d 814 (App.Div.1995) (requiring a new trial where plaintiffs summation during the punitive damages phase of the case, aimed at punishing the defendant for its conduct, resulted in an award, which demonstrated prejudice, partiality or passion, by the jury, <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>326, 670 A.2d 1066 (1996)). <em>But see Snyder v. Bazargani, </em>241 <em>FedAppx. </em>20, 23 (3d Cir.) (concluding that plaintiffs counsel\u2019s remarks referencing \u201csending a message\u201d were not inappropriate in a [Fair Housing Act] case seeking punitive damages), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>661, 169 L.Ed.2d 511 (2007); <em>Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 352, 364 (3d Cir.1999) (finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>that the lower court judge did not abuse his discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial where plaintiff, among other things, suggested to the jury that a verdict for plaintiffs would \u201c \u2018send a message to the folks at [defendant company]\u2019 \u201d). Other courts have found the \u201csend a message\u201d comment to be inappropriate but because of a prompt curative instruction, found no error. <em>See, e.g., Dixon v. Int'l Harvester Co., </em>754 F.2d 573, 585-86 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Kukla v. Syfus Leasing Corp., </em>928 <em>F.Supp. </em>1328, 1338 n. 5 (S.D.N.Y.1996); <em>Griffith v. Mt. Carmel Med. Ctr., </em>842 <em>F.Supp. </em>1359,1362-63 (D.Kan.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">One jurisdiction has recognized the impropriety of the \u201csend a message\u201d argument but has left the impact of the statements to the discretion of trial judge. In <em>Pierce v. Platter-Clay Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>769 S.W.2d 769, 778-79 (Mo.1989), the Missouri Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">Toward the end of his closing, Pierce\u2019s counsel remarked \u201cwhen you\u2019re done you can send a message to the utility world.\u201d This statement properly drew an immediate objection. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the remark; however, the court refused to sustain appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">The decision to grant a mistrial lies in the sound discretion of the trial court. Absent a manifest abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not interfere with the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Hoene v. Associated Dry Goods Corporation, </em>487 S.W.2d 479, 486 (Mo.1972); <em>Smith v. Courter, </em>531 S.W.2d 743, 746 (Mo.1976). However, Missouri courts have long shown displeasure with \u201csend a message\u201d arguments in cases where punitive damage[s] are not sought. <em>Accord, Smith, [supra,] </em>531 S.W.2d at 747; <em>Fisher v. McIlroy, </em>739 S.W.2d 577, 581 (Mo.App.1987). When the message argument becomes the theme of the entire closing, it constitutes reversible error. <em>See Smith, [supra,</em>] 531 S.W.2d at 748; <em>Fisher, [supra,] </em>739 S.W.2d at 582.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">Wisdom gathered from long experience tells us that trial courts are better positioned to assess the amount of prejudice injected by admittedly improper arguments. <em>Graves v. May Department Stores Co., </em>153 S.W.2d 778, 785 (Mo.App. 1941). Given the cold record on appeal, appellate courts of this state uniformly uphold trial courts\u2019 determinations of the prejudice injected by \u201csend a message\u201d arguments. <em>See, e.g., Smith, [supra,] </em>531 S.W.2d at 747 (trial court affirmed in granting new trial); <em>Graves, [supra,] </em>153 S.W.2d at 785 (trial court upheld in refusing mistrial); <em>Dickerson v. St. Louis Southwestern. Ry. Co., </em>674 S.W.2d 165, 173 (Mo.App.1984) (trial court upheld in refusing mistrial); <em>Fisher, [supra,] </em>739 <em>S.</em>W.2d at 582 (trial court\u2019s order granting new trial affirmed).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Here, Pierce\u2019s counsel danced dangerously close to reversible error. However, the quick objection by appellant\u2019s able counsel and the trial court\u2019s firm instruction to the jury prevented prejudice. The trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Hoene, </em>[supra,] 487 S.W.2d at 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The caselaw informs us that the use of a \u201csend a message\u201d argument is clearly inappropriate in criminal cases, may be inappropriate in punitive damage eases and is clearly inappropriate in civil compensatory damage cases. The fault line is the remedy afforded the offended party when the inappropriate argument is made. Again, to summarize, the authorities suggest that a prompt objection or a prompt curative instruction ordinarily precludes a mistrial. Here, at the close of the evidence, the judge did give a curative instruction regarding \u201csending a message.\u201d The proscriptive conduct did not end; it took on another form.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">While counsel thereafter did not overtly implore the jury to \u201csend a message,\u201d thematic overtones of his summation advanced the same message. We acknowledge that even when liability is stipulated, there can be appropriate references to the happening of the accident as such information may be relevant to the nature of the injuries sustained and damages. Yet a careful review of the summation reveals that the focus was not on the happening of the accident but on punishing defendant for the accident. References to \u201crunning a red light,\u201d concentrating on \u201cwhat [defendant] did wrong\u201d and allusions to defendant \u201cabusing the privilege\u201d of a driver\u2019s license were not relevant to the mechanics of the accident. They were calculated arguments designed to exact punishment against defendant and crossed the line of appropriate advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The trial judge, recognizing the issues created by the opening and summation, determined that the appropriate action was to grant a new trial. In so doing, he did not deprive plaintiff of her day in court. He provided the opportunity for a sanitized trial free of the arguments that he found had impacted on the jury\u2019s original verdict. While we have not been provided with transcripts of the new trial, defendant has represented that neither the opening nor summation contained the offending comments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The jury rendered a verdict of no cause for action against plaintiff. While we recognize that trials are dynamic processes and no trial truly replicates another, we are satisfied that plaintiff has had an opportunity to fairly and justly present her cause to a trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In sum, we conclude that the use of the \u201csending a message\u201d argument is inappropriate in a civil case where the only issue is compensatory damages. We further conclude that under the circumstances presented here, the judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\"> <em>All </em>references to defendant refer to Lang.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\"> Although named as a defendant in this action, DeBaker filed her own personal injury action, which was consolidated for trial with plaintiff's action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
