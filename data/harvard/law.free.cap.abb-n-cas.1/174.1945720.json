There was nothing left to be judicially determined. The amount of the plaintiff \u2019 s claim was ascertained, judgment was rendered that the assignment be set aside, that the assignee deliver over the assigned property to a receiver, and that the plaintiff be paid out of the proceeds the amount of his claim and costs. This was a final disposition of the whole controversy, and no further judgment was to be rendered. The machinery of a reference and receivership was for the sole purpose of carrying the judgment into execution,- and not the foundation of any further judicial action in the case. ........</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Judgment was entered July 21, 1875, and the sum directed to be paid plaintiff for principal and interest amounted to only $491.20. That judgment is all the appellant has at stake. A new trial has been ordered, and the object of this appeal is, by the reversal of that order, to restore the judgment. We think, in such a case, the amount of the judgment when entered must govern the question of appealability, and that interest accruing after its rendition cannot be added for the purpose of bringing it up to the requisite amount. According to our construction of the act of 1874, it prohibits an appeal from an order granting a new trial where the amount of the judgment or subject-matter in controversy does not exceed $500. In appeals from orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>granting or refusing a new trial where judgment has been rendered for a specific amount, that must be the test. Where there is no judgment, or it is not for a specific sum, the value of the subject-matter in controversy must be ascertained. The appeal should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> Will probably be reported in 63 or 64 N. <em>Y.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\"> The clause relied on is the amendment of 1867: \u201cWhere the decision filed under \u00a7 367, does not authorize final judgment, but directs further proceedings before a' referee or otherwise either party may move for a new trial at general term,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
