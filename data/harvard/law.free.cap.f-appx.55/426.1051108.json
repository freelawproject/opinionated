An Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture, but granted petitioner voluntary departure. The IJ emphasized that Mr. Hernandez-Perez \u201cwas not harmed [and] was not even threatened while he was [in Guatemala],\u201d but noted that if a well-founded fear of persecution had been established, \u201cI would have granted his application as a matter of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">The BIA affirmed the IJ in all respects. As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusions on Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s past persecution claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(1). Petitioner has not shown that he was persecuted. Unlike his murdered brother and missing father, Mr. Hernandez-Perez was not in the Guatemalan civil patrol and was never harmed. He testified that he never \u201cpersonally\u201d was threatened by the military. In these circumstances, we find no past persecution, defined as \u201cthe infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ (in race, religion or political opinion) in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">1. The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>standard. <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 937 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000). We find no substantial evidence to uphold the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the record does not \u201csupport[] the assertion that the respondent\u2019s father and brother\u2019s political opinion, or membership in the civil patrol, was, or will be, imputed to the respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Excepting petitioner\u2019s claim on his asylum application that the military was pursuing him when he fled Guatemala, the IJ found his \u201centire testimony ... credible.\u201d The IJ\u2019s credibility finding explicitly encompassed the reliability of the information contained in Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s asylum application, except for the one statement just noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We consider as true, therefore, petitioner\u2019s specific statements in the application that he (not only his family) was accused by the Guatemalan government of being \u201cagainst\u201d it. Corroboration for this accusation was provided in written form by a neighbor, credited by the IJ as \u201ca percipient witness to the events that the respondent claimed happened.\u201d The neighbor\u2019s letter states that Mr. Hernandez-Perez was \u201caccused of ... being against the government.\u201d Combined with petitioner\u2019s asylum application, the neighbor\u2019s letter makes it \u201clikely that the persecutors ... attribute^] the political views of others to [Mr. Hernandez-Perez].\u201d <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1489 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also id. </em>(\u2018We have ... found imputed political opinion where the applicant is a member of a large, politically active family many of whom have already been persecuted for their political beliefs. <em>Ramirez Rivas v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 864, 865-66 (9th Cir.1990)). The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Hernandez-Perez did not prove that the government had imputed to petitioner political beliefs adverse to the government is simply inconsistent with the record, as credited by the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">2. Mr. Hernandez-Perez may, in addition, meet the other statutory requirements for showing a well-founded fear of persecution. An asylum applicant\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable to qualify for asylum. <em>See Korablina v. INS, </em>158 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.1998). It appears that Mr. Hernandez-Perez satisfied the subjective component through credited testimony; the INS does not claim otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">As to the objective component, we have held that \u201can individual applicant may be eligible for asylum, even in the absence of direct persecution against her personally, if she is able to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on acts of violence against her friends or family members.\u201d <em>Mgoian v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1029, 1036 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also Arria-ga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cacts of violence against a petitioner\u2019s friends or family members may establish a well-founded fear, notwithstanding an utter lack of persecution against the petitioner herself\u2019); <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 870-71 (9th Cir.1987) (finding a well-founded fear of future persecution where six of the petitioner\u2019s family members were killed by \u201cthe Salvadoran guerrillas in retaliation against her family\u2019s association with the government-supported rural militia\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Here, as the petitioner did in <em>Mgoian, </em>184 F.3d at 1036, Mr. Hernandez-Perez \u201chas shown much more than mere isolated violence\u201d against his family. In 1990, Mr. Hernandez-Perez witnessed the annihilation of his immediate relatives on account of their political choices. His only sibling was a member of the government\u2019s civil patrol who was threatened by guerrillas and thus stopped his patrol duties. The military promptly took Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s brother away to be tortured and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>killed. Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s father then ceased his own obligations to the civil patrol. The military took petitioner\u2019s father in retaliation. The night his father was detained, Mr. Hernandez-Perez was at his uncle\u2019s nearby residence and went into hiding after his uncle observed what happened. His neighbor\u2019s subsequent letter states that after petitioner\u2019s father was detained, \u201cthe soldiers were looking all over for [Mr. Hernandez-Perez].\u201d Three days later Mr. Hernandez-Perez left Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In these circumstances, we find that the physical proximity of Mr. Hernandez-Perez to these politically-motivated events affecting his close family members brings this case within the bounds of our \u201cfear of persecution\u201d jurisprudence. <em>Compare Ar-riaga-Barrientos, </em>937 F.2d at 415 (\u201cThe abduction of two geographically distant brothers by unknown gunmen for unknown reasons does not establish a well-founded fear.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The IJ and the BIA failed to take the neighbor\u2019s letter into account as to reasons for a well-founded fear that Mr. Hernandez-Perez might be singled out for future persecution. They also did not accord legal significance to the harms suffered by Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s family. The question whether petitioner\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded must therefore be reevaluated on remand. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 123 S.Ct. 353, 356, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">We express no opinion, however, as to whether Mr. Hernandez-Perez has established asylum eligibility under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). Along with the objectively-based fear of persecution on an enumerated ground that we hold he has shown, two other requirements are necessary to establish a <em>well-founded </em>fear of persecution: first, \u201ca reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he ... were to return to [Gutatemala]\u201d and, second, that he be \u201cunable or unwilling to return to or avail himself ... of the protection of that country because of such fear.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">As to these questions, changes in country conditions will be relevant. The IJ did take changed country conditions into account. He recognized that some persecution was still taking place, yet he failed properly to consider the other evidence supporting Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution on an enumerated ground. The pertinence of the changed country conditions must be considered anew, in light of the relevant evidence as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition, VACATE the BIA\u2019s decision, and REMAND the case to the BIA to reconsider in light of this disposition Mr. Hernandez-Perez\u2019s asylum claim, as well as its decisions on his application for withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
