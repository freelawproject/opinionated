On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Estrada-Gatica has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Upon careful review of the record, we reject seriatim the multiple arguments for reversal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">As to the <em>Anders </em>brief arguments, Estrada-Gatica\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>see United States v. Kempis-Bonola, </em>287 F.3d 699, 701-02 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 295, 154 L.Ed.2d 196 (2002); there is no indication that a deportation order was entered in this case and thus, we need not address counsel\u2019s argument about time limits on detention after entry of a deportation order; an illegal-reentry conviction does not require proof of specific intent, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>122 F.3d 15, 17-18 (8th Cir. 1997); and the government offered evidence in support of each of the elements of the offense, <em>see United States v. Moyer, </em>313 F.3d 1082, 1086 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-25\">The pro se arguments also fail. The district court did not clearly err in finding Estrada-Gatica competent to stand trial, <em>see United States v. Hinton, </em>218 F.3d 910, 912 (8th Cir.2000); he waived his rights under the Speedy Trial Act by failing to file a motion to dismiss below, <em>see United States v. White Horse, </em>316 F.3d 769, 773-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>74 (8th Cir.2003); we see no plain error with regard to Estrada-Gatiea\u2019s constitutional speedy-trial rights, <em>see id.; Kempis-Bonola, </em>287 F.3d at 701; he failed to move for departure based on diminished mental capacity and in fact, he received the sentence he requested, <em>see United States v. Murphy, </em>248 F.3d 777, 780 (8th Cir.2001); his claim to United States citizenship is contradicted by the jury\u2019s verdict, and further, Estrada-Gatica himself testified at trial that he was not a United States citizen; and his ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us in this direct criminal appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Finally, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we affirm Estrada-Gatica\u2019s conviction and sentence, and we deny his pending motions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-17\">.
