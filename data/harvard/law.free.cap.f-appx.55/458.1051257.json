We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Singh filed his petition for review over 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final decision on his asylum and withholding of deportation claims. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review those claims. <em>See Narayan v. INS, </em>105 F.3d 1335, 1335 (9th Cir.1997) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">We have jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s decision denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen, and review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Mejia v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 873, 876 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the BIA satisfied its statutory notice requirements by mailing notice of its decision to the address of record for petitioner\u2019s attorney. <em>See Dobrota v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir.2002). Furthermore, principles of equitable tolling cannot be considered in Singh\u2019s case because they were not argued to the BIA, discussed by the BIA, or argued to this court. <em>See Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b500-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
