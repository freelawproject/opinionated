Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and views the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Providence Square </em>Assocs., <em>L.L.C. v. G.D.F., Inc., </em>211 F.3d 846, 850 (4th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Summary judgment will be granted unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the evidence presented. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">A federal employee is required to timely exhaust his administrative remedies by initiating contact with an EEO counselor within forty-five days of the date of the matter alleged <em>to be </em>discriminatory, <em>or of </em>the effective date of the alleged discriminatory personnel action. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1) (2001); <em>Jakubiak v. Perry, </em>101 F.3d 23, 26-27 (4th Cir.1996) (federal employee must notify EEO counselor within 45 days of discriminatory incident). The time limit may be extended if the complainant shows that he was <em>not </em>notified or aware of the time limits. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.214(a)(4) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Courts strictly adhere to time limits and rarely allow equitable tolling of limitations periods. <em>See Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453,</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990). After a review of the record, we conclude that Chattopa-dhyay had constructive notice of the EEO filing requirements. <em>See Nealon v. Stone, </em>958 F.2d 584, 589-90 (4th Cir.1992); <em>Zo-grafov v. V.A. Medical Ctr., </em>779 F.2d 967, 968-70 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">We therefore affirm the judgment order and order denying the motion for reconsideration. We deny Appellant\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
