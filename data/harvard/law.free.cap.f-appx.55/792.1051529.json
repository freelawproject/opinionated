D\u2019Amario sought relief from the district court\u2019s underlying judgment, which he did not timely appeal, denying his third 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as abusive, and denying his motion for sanctions against the government attorney. In support of Rule 60(b) relief, D\u2019Amario argued he had been unable to obtain a transcript that he needed to support his petition until after judgment was entered. However, we agree with the district court that the transcript would have made no difference in the disposition of D\u2019Amario\u2019s claims and therefore was not newly discovered evidence that warranted Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the denial of Rule 60(b) relief. <em>See Sanders v. Clemco Indus., </em>862 F.2d 161, 169 (8th Cir.1988). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We deny as moot D\u2019Amario\u2019s motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-14\">. The Honorable Ann D.
