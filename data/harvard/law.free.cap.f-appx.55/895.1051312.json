R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Defendant Jesus Antonio Ruiz-Dominguez (\u201cRuiz-Dominguez\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Ruiz-Dominguez pleaded guilty to unlawful reentry of a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2). On October 30, 2001, the district court sentenced Ruiz-Dominguez to 80 months in prison in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, which mandated a sixteen-level increase in the base offense level if the defendant had previously been deported after an aggravated felony conviction. The United States Sentencing Commission amended \u00a7 2L1.2 on November 1, 2001 by adopting Amendment 632. The amended version of \u00a7 2L1.2 provides for graduated increases in a defendant\u2019s base offense level of four, eight, twelve, or sixteen levels depending on the type of misdemeanor or felony for which the defendant had previously been convicted. Ruiz-Dominguez argues that his sentence should be modified according to the amended version of \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">A defendant is not entitled to a retroactive modification in his term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on an amendment to the sentencing guidelines unless the amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Avila, </em>997 F.2d 767, 768 (10th Cir.1993). Amendment 632 is not fisted in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Ruiz-Dominguez also argues, however, that he is entitled to a retroactive modification in his sentence because Amendment 632 was merely a clarification of \u00a7 2L1.2 and was not a substantive amendment. <em>See United States v. Kissick, </em>69 F.3d 1048, 1052 (10th Cir.1995) (holding that \u201ceven if an amendment is not fisted in USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, sentencing and reviewing courts may still give retroactive effect to amendments that are clarifying as opposed to substantive\u201d (quotation omitted)). Amendment 632 altered the entire text of \u00a7 2L1.2 providing for a new graduated sentencing scheme. Further, Amendment 632 altered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s pre-amendment interpretation of \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, Amendment 632 is a substantive amendment. <em>See Kissick, </em>69 F.3d at 1052-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Because Amendment 632 is not fisted in \u00a7 1B1.10 and is a substantive amendment, Ruiz-Dominguez is not entitled to a reduction in his sentence. The district court\u2019s denial of Ruiz-Dominguez\u2019s motion to modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
