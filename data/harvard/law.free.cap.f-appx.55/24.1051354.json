The McGoverns\u2019 adjuster, Apicella Adjusters (\u201cApicella\u201d), brought suit against St. Paul Fire (\u201cSt.Paul\u201d) for money it claims St. Paul owed it as a result of the various agreements between the parties. St. Paul then named the McGoverns as third-party defendants, claiming that the McGoverns agreed to indemnify St. Paul against any claims by third-parties relating to the loss from the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-23\">The McGoverns failed to properly answer the Third-Party Complaint, and, throughout the course of the proceedings, both Apicella and St. Paul filed various default motions against them. The Mc-Governs attempted to excuse their default by claiming that they each suffered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>severe medical problems that prevented them from complying with various court orders, but ignored repeated orders of the District Court requiring them to provide documentation of their conditions. On October 4, 2000, the District Court issued its final order requiring the McGoverns each to provide evidence of their alleged health problems, in the form of affidavits from treating physicians. The Court stated that failure to comply with this order by October 31, 2000, would result in the entry of default judgment against the non-compliant party. On January 9, 2001, a default judgment issued against both third-party defendants for failing to provide the requested evidence of their medical conditions and, therefore, failing to \u201cplead or otherwise defend\u201d as required by Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(a). In an order dated April 19, 2002, judgment was entered against them, jointly and severally, in the amount of $ 75,950.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We review a district court\u2019s entry of default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Bambu Sales, Inc. v. Ozak Trading, Inc., </em>58 F.3d 849, 852 (2d Cir.1995). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a) provides for the entry of default judgment whenever the party against whom a judgment of affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead. For the reasons set forth by the District Court in its January 9, 2001 Ruling, the McGoverns failed to plead, and default judgement was properly entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We have considered the McGoverns remaining claims on appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Accordingly, the judgment District Court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
