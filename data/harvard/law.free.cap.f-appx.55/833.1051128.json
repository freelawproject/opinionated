Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 847 (9th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). However, a deportation order may be challenged only if the alien demonstrates that available administrative remedies have been exhausted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">Barraza was deported twice, once in 1994, a second time in 1997. In the 1997 deportation proceedings he could have challenged the 1994 deportation order, since the 1997 deportation depended on the validity of the 1994 deportation. Bar-raza also had a right to appeal the 1997 deportation and did not. Had he done so, he could have argued that the 1994 appeal was timely and that the 1994 deportation was invalid. <em>See United States v. Hinojo-sar-Perez, </em>206 F.3d 832, 836 (9th Cir.2000). His failure to do so defeats his ability to challenge either deportation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">Barraza claims he was never free from official restraint from the time he crossed the border so that he never technically entered the United States. We disagree. A reasonable juror could have concluded that Barraza was not under constant observation by governmental authorities from the moment he set foot in this country until the moment of his arrest. <em>See United States v. Hemandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1219 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>We have considered Barraza\u2019s other assignments of error and find none persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b875-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
