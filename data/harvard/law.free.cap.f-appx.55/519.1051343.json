R.App. P. <em>34(f); </em>10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">We review the decision of the Commissioner, expressed as the decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ), to determine if the correct legal standards were applied and if the decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See White v. Barnhart, </em>287 F.3d 903, 905 (10th Cir.2001). The claimant, Ms. Jones, raises three issues: (1) whether the ALJ failed to properly consider the medical source opinions; (2) whether the ALJ\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s credibility was supported by substantial evidence; and (3) whether the ALJ\u2019s finding regarding claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity was supported by substantial evidence. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments and the record on appeal, we conclude that Ms. Jones has not pointed to any reversible legal error and that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s order of February 28, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
