We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-24\">Jackson\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal following his sentencing was rejected by the district court upon a finding that Jackson failed to show prejudice. This finding was erroneous, however, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). In <em>Peak, </em>we held that counsel\u2019s failure to pursue an appeal requested by a defendant constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel regardless of the likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if counsel promises to note an appeal and then fails to do so, petitioner is entitled to relief in the form of a belated appeal. <em>Id.; see also Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-25\">Accordingly, we grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>order and remand for compliance with this opinion and <em>Peak. </em>We decline to address any other claims on appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
