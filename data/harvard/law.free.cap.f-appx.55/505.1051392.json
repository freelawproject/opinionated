RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">Plaintiff, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed an action against his former employer and a vice-president of the company alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>seq. </em>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging that Plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Our review of the record and the briefs reveals that Plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative remedies. Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that he complained to the EEOC regarding his termination or any other acts of retaliation that form the basis for this lawsuit as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l). Therefore, after a thorough review of the briefs and the record, we affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned July 22, 2002, Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
