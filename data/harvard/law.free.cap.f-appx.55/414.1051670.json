Scott (\u201cScott\u201d) appeals pro se the district court\u2019s order denying his Motion to Dismiss Stipulation and granting Borg Warner Protective Services\u2019 (\u201cBorg Warner\u201d) motion to confirm an arbitration award. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitration award de novo. <em>Grammer v. Artists Agency, </em>287 F.3d 886, 890 (9th Cir.2002). We reverse the district court\u2019s order, vacate the arbitration award and remand for further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-17\">Scott was not obligated to arbitrate his dispute because he was not bound by the Pre-Dispute Resolution Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>(\u201cPDRA\u201d) or the Stipulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, </em>279 F.3d 889, 892 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that the Ninth Circuit looks to state contract law to determine whether an arbitration award is valid). Under Hawaii law, an arbitration agreement is not typically a contract of adhesion because it \u201cbears equally\u201d on the contracting parties and \u201cmerely substitutes one forum for another.\u201d <em>Brown v. KFC Nat\u2019l Mgmt. Co., </em>82 Hawaii 226, 921 P.2d 146, 167 (Haw.1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Such an agreement is unenforceable, however, if (1) \u201cthe contract is the result of coercive bargaining between parties of unequal bargaining strength\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe contract unfairly limits the obligations and liabilities of, or otherwise unfairly advantages, the stronger party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Scott was given the PDRA to sign on a \u201ctake this or nothing basis\u201d and thus it was the result of coercive bargaining between parties of unequal bargaining strength. <em>See id. </em>The PDRA also unfairly advantaged Borg Warner through its provisions that (1) \u201conly the company has standing to enforce this agreement to avoid piecemeal litigation\u201d; (2) Scott must submit his claims to binding arbitration within 60 days of Borg Warner\u2019s request and \u201cfailure to do so will forever bar any claim that was or could have been asserted in any forum whatsoever\u201d; and (3) all costs and fees will be shared equally between Scott and Borg Warner. The PDRA is therefore unenforceable under Hawaii law. Scott also was not bound by the Stipulation to arbitrate. The Stipulation was entered into at a time when all counsel assumed that the PDRA was valid as a matter of law and hence the Stipulation was not entered into with knowledge of the legal rights that were being forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Although we review the confirmation of an arbitration award de novo, the award must be confirmed if the arbitrator even arguably construed or applied the law and acted within the scope of his authority. <em>See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union v. Foster Poultry Farms, </em>74 F.3d 169, 173 (9th Cir.1995); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4) (court may vacate an arbitration award \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers\u201d). Because the PDRA and Stipulation were not valid, the arbitrator lacked the authority to resolve Scott\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal order, VACATE the arbitration award and REMAND for further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">REVERSED, VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. Because we conclude that under Hawaii contract law Scott was not bound by the PDRA, we need not reach Scott's argument that the PDRA is unenforceable under <em>Duf-field, v. Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., </em>144 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir.1998), <em>implied overruling recognized by EEOC v. Luce, </em>303 F.3d 994, 1002-04 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
