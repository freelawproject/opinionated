We review such a dismissal de novo. <em>Weaver v. United States, </em>98 F.3d 518, 519 (10th Cir.1996). Although the district court lacked jurisdiction over most of Scherer\u2019s claims, the district court did have jurisdiction over Scherer\u2019s constitutional challenge to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(d), and this claim should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-21\">Scherer\u2019s complaint seeks damages and other relief in connection with the processing of his applications for various benefits from the Veteran\u2019s Administration (\u201cVA\u201d). Citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a), the district court dismissed the claims in their entirety. Section 511(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-22\">The Secretary [of Veterans\u2019 Affairs] shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans .... [T]he decision of the Secretary as to any such question shall be final and conclusive and may not be reviewed by any other official or by any court, whether by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">Accordingly, that portion of Scherer\u2019s complaint challenging the VA\u2019s handling of his applications for benefits cannot be reviewed in the federal courts. <em>Weaver, 98 </em>F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In addition to challenging directly the actions of the VA in relation to his claims for benefits, Scherer also alleges various violations of the Freedom of Information Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause. \u201cWe examine the substance of these allegations, rather than the plaintiffs labels, to determine their true nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520. Because these claims are all, in reality, challenges to the underlying processes of the VA and its benefit decisions, they are similarly outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">While the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the majority of Scherer\u2019s claims, Scherer also alleged in fact twelve of his complaint that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(d) is unconstitutional. Section 511(a) does not divest the district court of jurisdiction to hear this claim. <em>See Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 373, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) (rejecting a construction of the predecessor of \u00a7 511(a) that would have extended the jurisdictional bar of that section to \u201cactions challenging the constitutionality of laws providing benefits for veterans\u201d); <em>see also Sugrue v. Derwinski, </em>26 F.3d 8, 11 (2d Cir.1994) (noting that courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the constitutionality of statutes underlying veterans\u2019 programs). It was thus error to dismiss this claim on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part for further proceedings. Plaintiffs motion for oral argument in this court is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-17\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
