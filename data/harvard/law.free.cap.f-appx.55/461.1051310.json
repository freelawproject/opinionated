New Jersey, </em>530 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">O\u2019Neal contends that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi </em>because the quantity of drugs in his possession was not presented to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. While the district court erred in not submitting the quantity issue to the jury, we conclude that error was harmless because the sentence imposed is authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 942 (9th Cir.) (stating that a defendant is not entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi </em>when his sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1009, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">O\u2019Neal\u2019s attempt to distinguish his case as an <em>Apprendi </em>violation on the basis that a mandatory minimum sentence was imposed as a result of the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination has been foreclosed by <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2419-20, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (stating that mandatory m\u00ednimums do not implicate Apprendi).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
