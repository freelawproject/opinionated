R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">Defendant Bonni Jo Leyden appeals her conviction for embezzlement of mail by a postal employee, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">On September 7, 2001, Leyden, an employee at the Grand Junction, Colorado, postal facilities, was arrested by postal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>inspectors as she left her place of work in her personal vehicle. At the time of her arrest, she was found in possession of a \u201ctest mailing\u201d that postal inspectors had put into circulation at the Grand Junction postal facilities. The \u201ctest mailing\u201d was a small package addressed to a fictitious person at a nonexistent address on Ley-den\u2019s postal route. The return address listed a nonexistent coin exchange business, suggesting the package might contain coins or other valuables. Such \u201ctest mailings\u201d are used by postal inspectors to determine whether postal employees are properly handling the mail. Leyden was convicted of embezzling mail and was sentenced to a five-year term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Defense counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), indicating his belief that the record contains no meritorious issues for appeal. Defense counsel has also filed a motion to withdraw, stating his belief that the issues raised on appeal are frivolous. As required, copies of the <em>Anders </em>brief and the motion to withdraw were provided to Ley-den. <em>See id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of the record, and we agree with defense counsel\u2019s conclusion that the appeal is without merit. The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support Leyden\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Vallo, </em>238 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir.2001) (outlining standard for determining whether evidence is sufficient to support criminal conviction). The district court properly admitted the government\u2019s Rule 404(b) evidence \u2014 a letter addressed to a customer on Leyden\u2019s postal route and found in Leyden\u2019s purse at the time of her arrest\u2014 for the purpose of showing Leyden\u2019s knowledge, intent, or absence of mistake regarding the conduct in question. <em>See Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 691-92, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (setting forth test for admissibility of evidence pursuant to 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw and to waive oral argument are GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
