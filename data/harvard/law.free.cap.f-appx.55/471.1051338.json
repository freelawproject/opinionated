He contends that the district court erred by determining that the offense which triggered the revocation of his supervised release was a Grade B rather than a Grade C violation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">We reject the government\u2019s contention that this appeal is moot. Although Mulliken has completed his term of imprisonment, he is currently on supervised release. <em>See United States v. Verdin, </em>243 F.3d 1174, 1178 (9th Cir.2001). On the merits, we reject Mulliken\u2019s argument that his underlying offense should have been scored as a Grade C violation. That argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Jolibois, </em>294 F.3d 1110, 1113 (9th Cir.2002). We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
