His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">Garza was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine for intended delivery or distribution. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) <em>and </em>846. In 1992, he was sentenced as a career offender to 360 months of imprisonment, and that sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">In 2002, Garza moved to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), alleging that his offense level as a career offender should be revised under Amendments 506 and 567 to the sentencing guidelines. The district court denied the motion on October 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>2001. It is from this judgment that Garza now appeals, moving for pauper status and the appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The court may reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if it was based on a guideline range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Ursery, </em>109 F.3d 1129, 1137 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The offense level of a career offender is generally determined by a reference to his Offense Statutory Maximum. When Garza was sentenced, the phrase \u201cOffense Statutory Maximum\u201d was defined as \u201cthe maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, comment, (n.2) (1991). Amendment 506 changed this definition so that it included only the basic statutory maximum, rather than a maximum that had been increased by virtue of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, comment, (n.2) (1994); USSG App. C, Amendment 506 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Garza alleged that the retroactive application of Amendment 506 required a reduction in his offense level under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. This claim is unavailing in light of controlling authority, which holds that Amendment 506 was invalid because it conflicted with a congressional mandate to designate recidivist sentences at or near the maximum term authorized. <em>See United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 757-62, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997); <em>United States v. Branham, </em>97 F.3d 835, 845-49 (6th Cir.1996). Moreover, the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.1 was amended again, and it now clearly indicates that the Offense Statutory Maximum includes enhancements to the basic statutory maximum. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, comment, (n.2) (1998); USSG App. C, Amendment 567 (effective Nov. 1,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Garza argues that Amendment 567 is merely a revision of Amendment 506. This argument is unpersuasive because Amendment 506 was not in effect when he was convicted and because it was invalidated several years before he filed his current action under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. at 762, 117 S.Ct. 1673; <em>Branham, </em>97 F.3d at 849. In addition, the district court properly determined that the application of Amendment 567 would not have affected Garza\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Garza primarily argues that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender because the government did not comply with the notice requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. However, the alleged failure to comply with \u00a7 851 does not provide a viable ground for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, Garza has already raised this claim in an untimely motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We note, nonetheless, that the record indicates that the government did file an adequate notice under \u00a7 851. <em>See United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 576 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.
