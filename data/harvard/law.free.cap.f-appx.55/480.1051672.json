We have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing the decision of the district court de novo, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s denial of disability benefits. <em>See Bustamante v. Massanari, </em>262 F.3d 949, 953 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-25\">With respect to Hernandez\u2019s back and knee problems and epilepsy, his treating and examining physicians consistently recommended that he seek new employment and noted limited restrictions that did not preclude him from engaging in certain types of hght and sedentary work. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Hernandez\u2019s depression was not severe enough during the insured period to entitle him to disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, including the clinical findings of an examining psychologist and the hearing testimony of the medical expert. Although Hernandez argues that other evidence in the record supports the opposite result, \u201c[i]f the evidence can support either outcome, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
