ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Domingo Barraza-Rios appeals pro se from an order denying a motion to modify his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Mr. Barraza-Rios pled guilty to reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony for which he was sentenced to a term of 78 months. In his subsequently filed \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Mr. Barraza-Rios argued that the sentencing range applicable to his conviction had been lowered retroactively by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court concluded that the amendment, Amendment 632, did not apply retroactively and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a term of imprisonment when the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The Commission has promulgated USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 which lists specific amendments that sentencing courts may apply retroactively to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. Amendment 632 is not a listed amendment. However, even if an amendment is not listed, sentencing courts may still give retroactive effect to amendments which are \u201cclarifying\u201d as opposed to \u201csubstantive.\u201d <em>United States v. Kissick, </em>69 F.3d 1048, 1052 (10th Cir.1995). The factors to be reviewed include \u201cthe Commission\u2019s characterization of the amendment, whether the amendment changes the text of the guidelines or merely the accompanying commentary, and whether the amendment alters the controlling pre-amendment interpretation of the guideline at issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">A review of these factors indicates that the amendment is not merely clarifying. The amendment completely rewrote \u00a7 2L1.2. The accompanying commentary states that the change was made in response to concerns by judges, probation officers, and defense attorneys that the former guideline resulted in disproportionate penalties. USSG App. C. This certainly may not be considered merely clarifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Moreover, even if the amendment were to be applied retroactively, Mr. Barraza-Rios would not benefit. Under the new \u00a7 2L1.2 he would receive the same 16-level increase because his prior aggravated felony was a drug trafficking offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>which he received a sentence of more than 13 months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-15\">. The government argues that Mr. Barraza Rios waived his right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement. However, the record before this court is not sufficient to determine the validity of the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
