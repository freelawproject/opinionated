R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">Defendant Jesus Guerrero-Lopez seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because he has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-22\">Defendant pled guilty to illegal re-entry of a deported alien pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Based on a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI, the guideline range of imprisonment for defendant was 77 to 96 months. The district court sentenced him to 96 months. Defendant did not file a direct appeal. He filed his pro se motion to correct sentence, stating he \u201cwas never informed of the specifics [by] his previous court appointed counsel ... prior to his pleading guilty,\u201d Motion at 1, and specifically asserting the district court incorrectly sentenced him in comparison to similarly-situated prisoners. Defendant also requested appointment of counsel. The district court denied defendant\u2019s request for appointment of counsel, found that defendant\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range, and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">In his application for a COA, defendant claims his counsel was ineffective for failing to translate the presentence report or provide a copy of the report to defendant in Spanish. He also claims his guilty plea was unlawful because counsel only briefly explained the nature of the plea, did not provide a copy of the plea agreement in Spanish, and led him to believe the government would recommend the low end of the guideline range and that his state and federal sentences would run concurrently. These issues are raised for the first time on appeal and will not be considered. <em>In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir. 1992) (stating \u201ca federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-24\">If we liberally construe defendant\u2019s assertion that counsel failed to adequately inform him of the sentence ramifications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Ms plea as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, tMs claim fails. To show ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show, among other things, prejudice flowing from deficient representation, that is, that \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s professional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court determined that defendant failed to show a disparate sentence. When we apply the <em>Strickland </em>criteria in assessing the merits of the claim raised in conjunction with any meffective assistance of counsel claim, we cannot conclude defendant was prejudiced as regards any explanation counsel could provide defendant concerning disparate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The request for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-26\">. Defendant attaches a \u00a7 2255 form motion to his application for a COA. This motion is dated August 12, 2002. However, this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>the motion that was filed in and considered by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
