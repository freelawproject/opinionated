Downey pled guilty to bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000) . He contests the 96 month sentence imposed by the district court, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level by three levels for brandishing or possessing a firearm during the offense when that fact was not alleged in the indictment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) (2001) . We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">Downey contends that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), facts that increase the sentencing guideline range must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the sentencing court makes factual findings that increase the sentencing guideline range but the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). The statutory maximum for Downey\u2019s offense is 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-25\">Because the issue raised by Downey lacks merit, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
