As to the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granting partial summary judgment in favor of FedEx, Badgett failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The timely filing of objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have, as here, been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-26\">As to Badgett\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s grant of FedEx\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, we note the record does not contain a trial transcript. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Badgett has raised a number of claims on appeal, all but two of which require a trial transcript in order for this court to afford meaningful review. The first claim relates to the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment, which claim has been waived, as set forth above. The second claim which is not dependent upon a trial transcript for meaningful review is Bad-gett\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a trial transcript at government expense. The record reveals the district court carefully reviewed Bad-gett\u2019s financial affidavits and other records reflecting her employment and resource status before denying the motion, and we find no abuse of discretion in that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Badgett\u2019s failure to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, as required by Fed. R.App. P. 10(b), and 4th Cir. R. 10(c), precludes meaningful review of her remaining claims on appeal. <em>Woods v. Thieret, 5 </em>F.3d 244, 245-6 (7th Cir.1993); <em>Deines v. Vermeer Mfg. Co., </em>969 F.2d 977, 979 (10th Cir.1992). Her pro se status does not excuse her failure to file a transcript. <em>See generally Schmid v. United Bhd. of Carpenters, </em>827 F.2d 384, 386 (8th Cir.1987). As no error appears on the record before us, we affirm in its entirety the district court\u2019s order granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Accordingly, we affirm both district court orders on appeal. We deny FedEx\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal based upon Badgett\u2019s failure to file a trial transcript. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
