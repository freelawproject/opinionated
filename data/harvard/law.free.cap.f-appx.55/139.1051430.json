The Board and immigration judge\u2019s determination that Juan is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (2000). We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the Board and immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Juan failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). Accordingly, we deny Juan\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
