Goble appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his motor home. He also appeals his sentence. We conclude that the district court correctly denied Go-ble\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the issue is a close one, the facts that Deputy O\u2019Toole asked, and did not order, Goble to answer questions, and that law enforcement did not pull Goble over but simply summoned him from his already-parked mobile home, weigh sufficiently in favor of a voluntary encounter to allow us to affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-19\">The Government conceded that it failed to offer sufficient proof to justify the two-point enhancement to Goble\u2019s sentence under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5) (2000). Accordingly, we vacate Goble\u2019s sentence and remand for plenary re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-20\">THE CONVICTION IS AFFIRMED; THE SENTENCE IS VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-21\">THOMAS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-22\">Given the government\u2019s proper concession that it failed to offer sufficient proof to justify a sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5), I agree that the sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-23\">But I respectfully dissent from the conclusion that the initial interaction between Goble and the law enforcement officers was a purely voluntary encounter rather than an investigatory stop. The government has conceded that it had no legal basis to stop Goble. Thus, the determinative question is whether Goble\u2019s first interaction with the officer was a voluntary encounter or an impermissible investigatory stop. I believe that the encounter constituted an impermissible investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\">\u201cQuestioning by law enforcement officers constitutes an investigatory stop only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>if in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States v. Kim, 25 </em>F.3d 1426, 1430 (9th Cir.1994) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The facts of Goble\u2019s first encounter with the policy do not suggest that a \u201creasonable person would have believed that he was [ ] free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Goble had been followed by an officer for several miles when he pulled into a convenience store. Soon after entering the store\u2019s parking lot, Go-ble\u2019s mobile home was surrounded by four marked police cruisers, which impeded and probably blocked his egress, and by four uniformed officers, one of whom positioned himself behind Goble\u2019s vehicle. Under these facts, I do not believe that a reasonable person would have felt \u201cfree to leave.\u201d Because Goble had \u201cno reasonable alternative except an encounter with the police,\u201d the interaction must be characterized as an investigatory stop. <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>817 F.2d 1384, 1386 (1987). As such, the encounter was involuntary, and the subsequent search of the motor home violated the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b865-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-17\">.
