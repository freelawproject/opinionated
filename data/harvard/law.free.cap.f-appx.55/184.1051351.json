Martin\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Neither Martin nor the United States filed a brief. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have considered counsel\u2019s brief and have examined the entire record for meritorious issues. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On appeal, Martin\u2019s counsel argues that \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional under the holding in <em>Apprendi. </em>We have reviewed the record and find this appeal foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and by our decision in <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 792 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Martin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
