Finney, Jr., is a 55-year-old former railroad employee. In January 1999, Finney applied for a disability annuity under \u00a7 2(a)(l)(iv) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(iv), claiming that back and elbow problems had made it impossible for him to perform his prior work as service center representative. His application was denied, as were his appeals to the Railroad Retirement Board. Finney now petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Finney worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s Soo Line in Milwaukee for nearly thirty years, most recently as a service center representative. In this last position, he would regularly sit for seven hours out of an eight-hour workday and would occasionally have to lift boxes of computer paper weighing between twenty-five and thirty pounds. In 1996, Finney\u2019s company relocated to Minneapolis. The company offered him a non-sedentary job at the new location, but because that job\u2019s physical requirements exceeded his capacities, he opted instead for a structured buy-out under which he would acquire the thirty years of service necessary to be eligible for a retirement annuity at the age of 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">On January 15,1999, near the end of the buy-out period, Finney applied for a disability annuity. To establish his eligibility, he needed to show that he had a permanent physical or mental condition that prevented him from performing his regular railroad occupation. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(a)(l)(iv). According to his medical records, Finney had suffered from back pain since the mid-1980s, and from tendinitis since 1994. He reported on his application that these conditions had affected his ability to work since March 1994, and had made it impossible for him to work since December 22, 1996-the date on which his job was eliminated. He stated in particular that \u201ctyping gives me tendonitis [sic] in both elbows\u201d and that \u201csitting causes extreme back pain all the time,\u201d and indicated that sitting, standing, and walking were all difficult to do for long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Finney\u2019s application was denied on April 19,1999. After his request for reconsideration was refused, Finney appealed to the Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, and was granted a hearing on November 22, 1999. At the hearing, Finney testified concerning his back and elbow problems and his discomfort when standing or sitting for extended periods. Finney also provided the hearings officer with medical records chronicling his history of back pain and other ailments, and a \u201cresidual functional capacity questionnaire\u201d from Finney\u2019s regular physician, Dr. Lam. The questionnaire stated, among other things, that Finney was capable of performing only low stress jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">The hearings officer denied Finney\u2019s appeal on January 10, 2000. In his decision, he addressed Finney\u2019s testimony concerning back pain, tendinitis, and difficulty dealing with stressful work, and reviewed the supporting medical evidence. He found that the clinical and laboratory evidence did not support Finney\u2019s claim that pain would interfere with attention and concentration so as to prevent him from performing stressful jobs. He also found unsubstantiated the claim that tendinitis prevented Finney from performing repetitive grasping or fine manipulation more than thirty percent of the time. In the end, the hearings officer concluded that the medical reports established that Fin-ney could perform his work as a service center representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Finney then took his appeal to the Railroad Retirement Board. The Board remanded the case, with instructions that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>hearing officer \u201capplfy] ... the sequential evaluation for determination of disability for regular railroad occupation set forth by regulations of the Board at 20 CFR 220.13.\u201d Also, given a degree of uncertainty as to which of Finney\u2019s prior jobs was relevant to the analysis, the Board directed the hearings officer \u201cto make a finding as to Mr. Finney\u2019s regular occupation and to explain the basis for that finding.\u201d On remand, the hearings officer documented his conclusion that \u201cservice center representative\u201d was indeed Finney\u2019s regular railroad occupation. Then, reciting the relevant parts of the Board\u2019s regulations, the hearings officer explained how his earlier findings demonstrated that Finney had the capacity to return to his regular railroad occupation of service center representative. Finney again appealed to the Board, which denied his appeal on April 17, 2001, upon which Finney appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We will uphold the Board\u2019s denial of a disability annuity if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and has a reasonable basis in law. <em>Holman v. United States R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>253 F.3d 975, 978 (7th Cir.2001). We do not supplant the judgment of the Board with our own judgment, nor do we re-weigh the evidence in order to decide whether a petitioner is disabled. <em>Dray v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>10 F.3d 1306, 1310 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Reviewing the evidence relied upon by the hearings officer, we consider it to be substantial. His report analyzed the reports from Finney\u2019s regular physician and from the consultant physician-along with Finney\u2019s own testimony-concerning Finney\u2019s symptoms, conditions and capabilities. He acknowledged the evidence that Finney had cited in support of his claims, but found them to be unsubstantiated by the clinical evidence. We therefore believe that the hearings officer\u2019s reports were based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Finney argues, however, that the hearings officer failed to follow the evaluative procedure outlined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.13, most importantly the requirement that he explicitly determine the applicant\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC). This is true. In fact, it appears from the revised decision\u2019s extended quotation of \u00a7 220.13 that the hearings officer carried out his evaluation according to an outdated version of the regulation-Part 220 having been amended in early 1998. <em>See </em>Determining Disability, 63 Fed.Reg. 7538, 7541-42 (Feb. 13,1998) (amending 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.13). This amendment was applicable to all applications for disability annuity filed (like Finney\u2019s) on or after January 1, 1998, 63 Fed.Reg. at 7538, and introduced, among other things, the RFC requirement that Finney claims the hearings officer ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We cannot say that we are impressed with the hearings officer\u2019s lack of currency with respect to his own governing regulations, nor with the Board for failing to notice this error. But as we stated in <em>Dray v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>10 F.3d at 1313, \u201cour doubts about the reasoning of the hearing officer need not compel the court to modify or reverse the denial of benefits.\u201d Comparing the two versions of the regulation, we do not discern a substantive change in the relevant criterion: whether the applicant is still able to perform in his old job. As the discussion preceding the amendment explains, the new version of \u00a7 220.13 provides essentially nothing more than \u201ca more detailed description of the process [of evaluation], which is described in \u00a7 220.13(b)(3) of the present regulation.\u201d 63 Fed.Reg. at 7538. We believe that the hearings officer\u2019s error did not produce a different result than would have been reached by a similar analysis under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the amended regulation, and that it was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Finally, we note that although Finney claimed in his initial application that his disabilities had prevented him from working since December 22, 1996, it appears that his immediate reason for ceasing to work on that date was his inability to perform the non-sedentary job he was offered in Minneapolis, rather than his inability to perform his then-current job of service center representative. It is not clear that, had that job not been eliminated, Finney\u2019s physical difficulties would have prevented him from continuing to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We therefore DENY Finney\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
