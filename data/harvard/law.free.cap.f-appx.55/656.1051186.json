Lambert II, appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his supervised release and imposing an eleven-month prison sentence to be followed by thirty-seven months of supervised release. Lambert\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that the district court abused its discretion in revoking Lambert\u2019s supervised release and imposing sentence. Lambert was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-24\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record on appeal, including the nature and extent of Lambert\u2019s supervised release violations, the probation officer\u2019s petition for violation of supervised release, and the transcript of the revocation hearing. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Lambert\u2019s supervised release based upon Lambert\u2019s admissions at the revocation hearing that he violated the conditions of release. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard of review); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000) (providing that district court need only find violation of supervised release condition by preponderance of evidence). In addition, we have reviewed Lambert\u2019s sentence for plain error and find none. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 428-29 (4th Cir.) (discussing standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>-, 123 S.Ct. 614, 154 L.Ed.2d 552 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
