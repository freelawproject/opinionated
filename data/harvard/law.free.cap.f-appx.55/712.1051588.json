McEvily asserts that the statute is ambiguous and therefore unconstitutional. We decline to exercise jurisdiction over McEvily\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">The All Writs Act vests all statutorily created federal courts, including this court, with authority to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (2000) . Injunctive relief under the All Writs Act, however, is available \u201conly in the most critical and exigent circumstances ... if the legal rights at issue are indisputably clear.\u201d <em>Brown v. Gilmore, </em>533 U.S. 1301, 1303, 122 S.Ct. 1, 150 L.Ed.2d 782 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We conclude that McEvily\u2019s petition does not satisfy this standard. Moreover, McEvily asserts that he has challenged the constitutionality of the statute in question in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) that is pending in the district court. Initial review of the statute in question and development of the record are appropriately conducted by the district court. If McEvily fails to obtain the relief he seeks in the district court, he may assert his claim on appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-20\">Accordingly, although we grant McEvily\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we dismiss his petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal issues are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
