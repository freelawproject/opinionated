On appeal, Lara\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the denial of Lara\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the drug-quantity finding, and an aggravatmg-role adjustment. In addition, Lara filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>First, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lara\u2019s plea-withdrawal motion, which was rooted in Lara\u2019s dissatisfaction with his prior counsel\u2019s alleged promise of a shorter sentence than Lara anticipated after seeing the presentence report. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim.P. 32(e) (when defendant makes presentencing plea-withdrawal motion, district court \u201cmay permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason\u201d); <em>United States v. Bahena, </em>223 F.3d 797, 806-07 (8th Cir.2000) (abuse-of-discretion standard of review; defendant\u2019s allegation in plea-withdrawal motion of poor assistance by counsel was rebutted by defendant\u2019s declaration under oath at change-of-plea hearing that he understood proceedings, was satisfied with his lawyer, and had committed crimes charged), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1181, 121 S. Ct. 1163, 148 L.Ed.2d 1023 (2001); <em>United States v. Newson, </em>46 F.3d 730, 733 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant\u2019s failure to assert any objections to counsel\u2019s performance at change-of-plea hearing refutes claim of ineffective assistance as basis for withdrawing plea). During his plea colloquy Lara affirmed that he was freely and voluntarily pleading, pursuant to a plea agreement he understood, to the conspiracy charged in the indictment. <em>See Nguyen v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 699, 703 (8th Cir.1997) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s representations during the plea-taking carry a strong presumption of verity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In addition, after acknowledging in a written plea agreement that, for purposes of applying the Sentencing Guidelines, a base offense level of at least 32 applied in light of his involvement with over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, Lara cannot challenge the resulting sentence. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal). We further conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a two-level enhancement for Lara\u2019s role in the offense was not clearly erroneous, particularly where Lara did not object to the underlying facts in the presentence report that he contacted a codefendant and arranged for delivery of marijuana from Mexico. <em>See United States v. Encee, </em>256 F.3d 852, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Lara\u2019s pro se argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him because the indictment overstated the quantity of marijuana he conspired to distribute is meritless and foreclosed by his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201cdefects in an indictment do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case\u201d); <em>O\u2019Leary v. United States, </em>856 F.2d 1142, 1143 (8th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (in pleading guilty, defendant admits all factual allegations made in indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (defendant who allows Rule 11 error to pass without objection in trial court must satisfy plain-error rule, i.e., that claimed plain error affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Accordingly, we affirm, and grant counsel\u2019s pending motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-24\">.
