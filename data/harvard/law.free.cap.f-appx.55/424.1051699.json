Saldana appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and raises an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Because we conclude that Officer Carrera lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Salda-na on the basis of lane straddling or driving under the influence, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Saldana\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, we hold that Saldana has waived his <em>Apprendi </em>argument by failing to preserve it as a ground for appeal in his conditional plea agreement, and that, in any event, the argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We believe this case is controlled by our analysis and decision in <em>United States v. Colin &amp; Estrada-Nava (\u201cEstrada-</em>Nava\u201d,), Nos. 01-50140 and 01-50152, also filed today. In <em>Estrada-Nava, </em>as here, Estrada-Nava\u2019s and Colin\u2019s car slightly weaved within its lane and <em>touched, </em>but did not cross, the dividing lines on a highway. Like Saldana, Estrada-Nava and Colin were stopped for possible violations of California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 21658(a) (lane straddling) and 23152(a) (driving under the influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We held in <em>Estrada-Nava </em>that Officer Carmichael lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Estrada-Nava and Colin for both lane straddling and driving under the influence. We reasoned that <em>touching </em>a lane line does not constitute lane straddling because it does not violate section 21658(a)\u2019s requirement that drivers drive \u201cas nearly as practical\u201d within a single lane. Moreover, we concluded that Estrada-Nava and Colin did not engage in \u201cpronounced weaving\u201d for a \u201csubstantial distance\u201d sufficient for Officer Carmichael to harbor a reasonable suspicion that they were under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">On the basis of our decision in <em>Estrada-Nava </em>and the fact that Saldana weaved <em>within </em>his lane and caused the vehicle\u2019s tires to <em>touch </em>the lane line without crossing into an adjacent lane, we conclude that Officer Carrera lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Saldana for lane straddling. Similarly, there was no other evidence, such as erratic driving or pronounced weaving over a substantial distance, to suggest that Saldana was driving under the influence. Officer Carrera therefore did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him for this reason. As a result, the district court should have granted the motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b466-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-24\">. Saldana\u2019s co-defendant Jaime M. Hara joined in the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. Because we reversed the district court's ruling on the motion to suppress, we need not address Saldana\u2019s challenge under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We note, however, that not only did he waive this argument, but his challenge is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (holding that \u00a7 841 is not facially unconstitutional).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
