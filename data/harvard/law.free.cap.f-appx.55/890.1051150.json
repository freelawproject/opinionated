RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The ease is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-18\">Glen Wayt, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for correction or reduction of sentence brought pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying the motion, the district court concluded that Wayt had not advanced any lawful basis for a sentence reduction pursuant to Rule 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">This court has closely reviewed Wayt\u2019s appellate filings and reviewed <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal. That review demonstrates that the district court\u2019s resolution of Wayt\u2019s motion is correct. In particular, it is clear that; (1) Wayt is not entitled to relief under Rule 35(a) because the case was not before the district court on remand from this court; (2) Wayt is was not entitled to relief under Rule 35(b) because, <em>inter alia, </em>the government has not moved for a sentence reduction; and (3) Wayt is not entitled to relief under Rule 35(c) both because the motion was not filed within seven days of the imposition of sentence and because the motion failed to identify any arithmetical or technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>error in the sentence. In fact, it is clear that the proper vehicle for seeking the type of relief sought by Wayt is a motion to correct or vacate illegal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, this court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s denial of Wayt\u2019s Rule 35 motion. <em>See United States v. McMillan, </em>106 F.3d 322, 324 n. 4 (10th Cir.1997) (holding that jurisdiction to hear appeal from resolution of a Rule 35 motion arises under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b933-15\">. The district court did not err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>construe Wayt\u2019s Rule 35 motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (10th Cir.2002) (\"We have ... held that district courts should only recharacterize a motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition where (1) the petitioner, having been made aware of the risks associated with recharac-terization, assents, or (2) the district court concludes that the petitioner\u2019s motion can only be considered under \u00a7 2255 and offers the movant the opportunity to withdraw the motion rather than have it so recharacter-ized.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-20\">. We note that effective December 1, 2002, Rule 35 was amended. Although substantially redrafted, the amended version of Rule 35 does not alter the outcome of this case in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
