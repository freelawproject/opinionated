Berry claims his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged references to Berry\u2019s post-arrest silence during closing argument. Having carefully reviewed the record, we believe the district court correctly agreed with the state court\u2019s decision that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not violate Berry\u2019s right to silence. Three of the prosecutor\u2019s statements were permissible references to Berry\u2019s pre-arrest silence. <em>Vick v. Lockhart, </em>952 F.2d 999, 1003 (8th Cir.1991). The prosecutor\u2019s fourth statement, that Berry had \u201ceighty-eight days ... in jail ... to concoct his story and make it look good when he gets up and testifies,\u201d was not an impermissible reference to Berry\u2019s post-arrest silence. <em>Catches v. United States, </em>582 F.2d 453, 458 (8th Cir.1978). Because the state court reasonably concluded that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments was not ineffective assistance, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\">The Honorable Ronald E.
