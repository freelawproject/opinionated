An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Bristow has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Bristow v. Braxton, </em>No. CA-02-1194-AM (E.D. Va., filed Oct. 22, 2002 <em>&amp; </em>entered Oct. 23, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny Bristow\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment of conviction, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
