NADCA filed counterclaims under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq., </em>seeking injunctive relief and damages. We previously affirmed in an interlocutory appeal the district court\u2019s grant of injunctive relief and summary judgment to NADCA, and we now affirm the remaining pretrial orders that Bar-Meir challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in any of its discovery rulings. <em>See SDI Operating P\u2019ship v. Neuwirth, </em>973 F.2d 652, 655 (8th Cir.1992) (standard of review). We also hold the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to impose the costs of personal service on NADCA, given that Bar-Meir did not show compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(2)(D); or in refusing to continue a hearing on the summary judgment motion, <em>see Wisland v. Admiral Beverage Corp., </em>119 F.3d 733, 737 (8th Cir. 1997) (district court is given wide authority and discretion to manage its caseload), <em>cert, denied, </em>522 U.S. 1112, 118 S.Ct. 1043, 140 L.Ed.2d 108 (1998). We further hold the district court did not err in denying Bar-Meir\u2019s motion to vacate the reference to the magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">We reverse, however, the district court\u2019s award of $125,000 in damages against Bar-Meir. Bar-Meir made a timely demand for a jury trial, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 38(b), and he did nothing to waive that demand, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(a) (when jury trial has been demanded, parties must stipulate in writing or in open court to have trial by court). We thus hold that Bar-Meir is entitled to have a jury determine the amount of damages. <em>See Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Tel., Inc., </em>523 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>340, 353-54, 118 S.Ct. 1279, 140 L.Ed.2d 438 (1998) (Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in action for statutory damages under Copyright Act extends to having jury determine amount of damages); <em>Cass County Music Co. v. C.H.L.R., Inc., </em>88 F.3d 635, 641-42 (8th Cir.1996) (patent and copyright infringement actions are treated same).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part, vacate the award of damages, and remand for further proceedings in which Bar-Meir may exercise his right to have a jury determine the damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
