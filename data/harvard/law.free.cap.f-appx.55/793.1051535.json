At sentencing, the district court sustained Douglas\u2019s objections to the presen-tence report, reducing the drug quantity attributable to him and applying a role-in-the-offense reduction. Thereafter, the court sentenced Douglas to concurrent prison terms of 168 months on each count, and concurrent 5-year supervised release terms. On appeal, Douglas\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred by not departing downward to eliminate the disparity between the sentences of Douglas and his coconspirators. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We first note that the district court sustained Douglas\u2019s objections and sentenced him at the bottom of the resulting Guidelines range, and it does not appear Douglas moved for a downward departure from that range. <em>See United States v. Carras-co, </em>271 F.3d 765, 768 (8th Cir.2001) (failure to request down ward departure subjects appeal to, at best, plain-error review). In any event, disparity between codefendants\u2019 sentences is not a proper basis for departure. <em>See United States v. Wong, </em>127 F.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir.1997) (disparity between sentences imposed on codefendants is not proper basis for departure; some disparity will inevitably exist because of unique facts of each individual defendant\u2019s case); <em>United States v. Granados, </em>962 F.2d 767, 774 (8th Cir.1992) (defendant cannot rely upon codefendant\u2019s sentence as \u201ca yardstick\u201d for his own; sentence is not disproportionate just because it exceeds codefendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">. The Honorable Donald J.
