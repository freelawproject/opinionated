R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">Stanley Brown-Bey filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in federal district court challenging his Colorado state conviction. The district court recognized that the claim raised in Brown-Bey\u2019s petition had been raised in a previous \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and in a previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>application to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) to file a second or successive petition. Because the claim had been previously raised, the district court denied the petition and dismissed the action. The matter is now before this court on Brown-Bey\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Successive habeas petitions cannot be filed in district court until the petitioner \u201cmove[s] in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Because Brown-Bey failed to obtain authorization from this court before filing his successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must vacate the district court\u2019s order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">This court would ordinarily construe Brown-Bey\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief as an application requesting authorization to file a second or successive habeas petition. <em>See Pease v. Klinger, </em>115 F.3d 763, 764 (10th Cir.1997). As noted by the district court, however, Brown-Bey has already applied for and been denied permission by this court to file a second or successive petition relating to Colorado\u2019s alleged violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. Accordingly, Brown-Bey\u2019s filings are more akin to a petition for rehearing of this court\u2019s previous denial of permission to file a successive \u00a7 2254 petition. Such petitions for rehearing are prohibited by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E). In these circumstances, the appropriate course is to strike Brown-Bey\u2019s filings pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E). Accordingly, this court VACATES the order of the district court denying Brown-Bey\u2019s petition and STRIKES the materials filed before this court. Brown-Bey\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is DENIED as moot. Brown-Bey is specifically reminded that this order is not \u201cap-pealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. When the motion was filed without the required appellate court authorization, it should have been transferred to this court. <em>See Coleman v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 339, 341 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201c[W]hen a second or successive petition for habeas corpus relief under \u00a7 2254 ... is filed in the district court without the required authorization by this court, the district court should transfer the petition or motion to this court in the interest of justice pursuant to [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1631.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
