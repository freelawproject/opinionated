(\u201cFDCPA\u201d). Their complaint was dismissed under Fed. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to properly plead a claim. We will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">In 1997, plaintiffs Theophilus R. Nix, Sr., and Lulu Mae Nix borrowed a total of $77,000 through two consumer credit transactions with the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (\u201cWSFS\u201d). Two years later, on September 22, 1999, WSFS\u2019s counsel, Jeffrey Welch of Welch &amp; White, P.A., the defendants in this action, sent plaintiffs two debt collection letters to recover the outstanding balances on these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-25\">In 1999, plaintiffs also entered consumer credit transactions with Joseph B. Dietz, Jr., DDS, for dental treatment that Dr. Dietz provided to them. Seeking to collect debts owed on these credit transactions, defendants, acting as legal counsel for Dr. Dietz, filed a complaint against plaintiffs on October 24, 2000 and sent plaintiffs a debt collection letter on October 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-26\">Believing the September 22, 1999 collection letters violated the FDCPA, plaintiffs sued defendants on July 20, 2000, and filed an amended complaint on November 17, 2000, adding defendants\u2019 collection efforts on behalf of Dr. Dietz. In that complaint, plaintiffs alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>10. The September 22, 1999 letters embodied violations of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">11. On information and belief, defendants violated the Act in other ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">16. The October 24 process embodied violations of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">17. The October 25 letter embodied violations of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to file a second amended complaint without leave of court. Plaintiffs then engaged in discovery and subsequently filed additional motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">On July 18, 2001, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Without seeking reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s dismissal order, plaintiffs appealed on August 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Plaintiffs assert two arguments on appeal: first, that their amended complaint was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); and second, that the District Court abused its discretion by dismissing their complaint without granting leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">A. Whether the District Court Erred in Dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"Azy\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is plenary. <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>232 F.3d 173, 183-184 (3d Cir.2000). While we accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, \u201cwe need not accept as true \u2018unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a), a complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A complaint satisfies the Rule 8(a) pleading requirements if it gives notice and the grounds upon which a plaintiffs claim rests. <em>See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). While a complaint generally need not allege every element of a plaintiffs claim, it must plead facts sufficient to provide the defendant with \u201cfair notice of the transaction\u201d and \u201cset[ ] forth the material points necessary to sustain recovery.\u201d <em>Menkowitz v. Pottsdown Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>154 F.3d 113, 124 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">Citing <em>Swierkiewicz, </em>plaintiffs contend their complaint was sufficient to withstand a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) challenge. In <em>Swierkiewicz, </em>the Court held <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), did not govern the pleading standard because \u201cthe precise requirements of a prima facie case can vary depending on the context and were \u2018never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 122 S.Ct. 992. The Court believed the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework imposed a heightened standard on pleadings that would conflict with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). <em>Id. </em>at 512, 122 S.Ct. 992. The Court found the complaint satisfied Rule 8(a) because it \u201cdetailed the events leading to [plaintiffs] termination, provided relevant dates, and included the ages and nationalities of at least some of the relevant persons involved with his termination. These allegations g[a]ve respondent fair notice of what petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>claims [were] and the grounds upon which they rest[ed].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 122 S.Ct. 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In contrast, the complaint here fails to satisfy the minimal pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) because it merely alleges defendants\u2019 actions \u201cembodied violations of the Act\u201d and \u201cviolated the Act in other ways.\u201d These are conclusory allegations. The complaint fails to provide the \u201cgrounds upon which they rest.\u201d Furthermore, the remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. As the District Court noted, plaintiffs \u201cfail to allege, however, any facts to support these allegations and provide no notice to defendants as to how the letters allegedly violated the FDCPA.\u201d As a result, plaintiffs did not provide notice to defendants as to how their actions allegedly violated the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">B. \u201cWhether the District Court Abused its Discretion by Not Granting Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">We review a district court\u2019s failure to grant leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>See Darr v. Wolfe, </em>767 F.2d 79, 81 (3d Cir.1985). Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff may amend a complaint once as a matter of right and afterward by leave of court or by written consent of the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). In this case, plaintiffs made no motion for leave to amend. In his brief on appeal, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said he \u201cdid not think it a useful expenditure of [plaintiffs\u2019] resources to file a motion to amend, where it was to be expected that if the Court were to dismiss on the grounds of insufficient factual allegations, it would at the same time grant leave to amend.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. At 21). Seven months elapsed between the date the motion to dismiss was filed (December 4, 2000) and the date the District Court granted the motion (July 18, 2001). Instead of curing the complaint\u2019s defects adverted to in the motion to dismiss by requesting leave to amend, plaintiffs chose to stand on their amended complaint and pursue discovery and other motions. Furthermore, plaintiffs appealed without first seeking reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. Plaintiffs should have amended their complaint after receiving the motion to dismiss. Nonetheless, absent futility, our case law grants them the opportunity to amend after the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Athough the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not address the precise situation here, that is, where leave to amend is not sought, it must be granted if the deficiency could be cured by amendment. <em>Shane v. Fauver, </em>213 F.3d 113, 116 (3d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950 (3d Cir.1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">As explained in <em>Borelli, </em>532 F.2d at 951 n. 1, and recently confirmed in <em>Shane, </em>213 F.3d at 116, district courts should, before dismissing a claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">[E]xpressly state, where appropriate, that the plaintiff has leave to amend within a specified period of time, and that application for dismissal of the action may be made if a timely amendment is not forthcoming within that time. If the plaintiff does not desire to amend, he may file an appropriate notice with the district court asserting his intent to stand on the complaint, at which time an order to dismiss the action would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">In <em>Darr, </em>767 F.2d at 81, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\">[T]his court has consistently held that when an individual has filed a complaint under \u00a7 1983 which is dismissible for lack of factual specificity, he should be given a reasonable opportunity to cure the defect, if he can, by amendment of the complaint and that denial of an application for leave to amend under these circumstances is an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Although the District Court properly-found that plaintiffs failed to plead a FDCPA claim, it should have allowed plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Of course, we express no opinion on the merits of the claim. We will reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692i(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
