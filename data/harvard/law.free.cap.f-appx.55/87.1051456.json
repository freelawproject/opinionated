Upon consent of the parties, the case was tried to a jury before a Magistrate Judge in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. After trial, the jury delivered a verdict against the Sampsons, and specifically found that Oaks had neither entered into the oral contract alleged, nor had he been unjustly enriched. Judgment was entered in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict on January 25, 2002 and the Sampsons timely filed a notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In their complaint, Dennis and Louise Sampson alleged that Jerrell Oaks orally agreed to purchase their Pennsylvania fire equipment business, appellant Sampson Fire Sales Inc., in exchange for assuming the debts of Sampson Fire Sales and 25% of the profits that Oaks\u2019s company, NAFE-CO, derived from Sampson Fire Sales Inc.\u2019s territory. In response, Oaks contended that although he did orally agree to enter into certain business arrangements with the Sampsons to supply equipment and to hire Dennis Sampson as a NAFE-CO employee, he never agreed to purchase Sampson Fire Sales, to assume its liabilities, or to pay the Sampsons 25% of the profits NAFECO derived from the Samp-sons\u2019 territory or customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The Sampsons\u2019 attorney failed to attend the originally scheduled final pretrial conference. NAFECO\u2019s attorney thus moved to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute. As an exhibit to his motion, the attorney attached a faxed letter from the Sampsons\u2019 attorney addressed to the Sampsons which had incorrectly been faxed to NAFECO. Once he learned of NAFECO\u2019s receipt of his misdirected fax, the Sampsons\u2019 attorney cross-moved to sanction NAFECO for intentionally violating the Sampsons\u2019 attorney-client privilege by dismissing NAFECO\u2019s answer to the Sampsons\u2019 complaint. In a Memorandum and Order dated July 5, 2001, the Magistrate Judge denied NAFECO\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, and granted the Sampsons\u2019 motion to have the misdirected fax sealed and the original returned to the Sampsons. The Magistrate Judge declined, however, to sanction NA-FECO for using the misdirected fax or to dismiss its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Trial on the merits of the Sampsons\u2019 claims was held in January of 2002. After trial, the jury found against them and in favor of NAFECO. In its answers to the special verdict interrogatories, the jury specifically found that Oaks made certain representations at his meeting with Dennis Sampson in October of 1997. The jury went on to find, however, that the representations did not relate to \u201cmaterial facts,\u201d that there was not \u201can offer, acceptance and consideration to sell Sampson Fire Sales, Inc.,\u201d and that no \u201cbenefit was conferred on the defendant NAFECO by the plaintiffs.\u201d After the jury returned the verdict, the Sampsons moved for reconsideration of their motion for sanctions against NAFECO, arguing that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s denial of sanctions was inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. The Sampsons also moved to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict as what they describe as \u201cirreconcilably inconsistent\u201d and against the weight of the evidence. The Magistrate Judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The Sampsons argue on appeal that the Magistrate Judge made three errors warranting reversal: (1) denying the Samp-sons\u2019 motion to strike NAFECO\u2019s answer as a sanction for NAFECO\u2019s attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>breach of the Sampsons\u2019 attorney-client privilege and by denying their post-trial motion for reconsideration of that motion; (2) incorrectly submitting the question of whether the parties entered into an oral contract to the jury; and (3) denying the Sampsons\u2019 motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict as irreconcilably inconsistent and as against the weight of the evidence. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">As an initial matter, we are unable to discern any error in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s denial of the Sampsons\u2019 motion for sanctions against NAFECO\u2019s attorney for intentionally violating their attorney-client privilege, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Saldana v. Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 236 (3d Cir.2001). The Samp-sons\u2019 argue that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling was primarily based upon a factual finding that NAFECO had actually purchased Sampson Fire Sales, and thus was rightfully receiving faxes at the Sampson Fire Sales fax number. They argue that absent this factual finding \u2014 inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict that Oaks did not agree to purchase Sampson Fire Sales Inc. \u2014 the Magistrate Judge could not have concluded that NAFECO received the fax from their attorney only by accident. Thus, the argument goes, NAFECO\u2019s attorney could not have concluded in good faith that the Sampsons had waived their attorney-client privilege as to that document, and committed an ethics violation by not returning it to their attorney and instead using it as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Although the actions of NAFECO\u2019s attorney in relation to the misdirected fax are questionable, the Sampsons\u2019 argument mischaracterizes the reasoning behind the Magistrate Judge\u2019s thoughtful refusal to impose the draconian sanctions they requested. In his Memorandum and Opinion, the Magistrate Judge found that the Pennsylvania law of inadvertent disclosure was insufficiently developed to allow the certain conclusion that NAFECO\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of the document was knowingly unethical. Moreover, and most importantly, the Court found that the \u201cdrastic sanction\u201d of dismissal of NAFECO\u2019s answer was not an appropriate sanction. Instead, the Court ruled that the appropriate remedy was to require the defendant to return the original document to the plaintiffs, destroy all copies of the document, and order the copy of the document used as an exhibit to be filed under seal. While we do not condone NAFECO\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of a misdirected document that was clearly a direct communication between the Samp-sons and their attorney, we find that the Magistrate Judge did not rely on erroneous conclusions of fact or law and that the remedy imposed was appropriate. Thus, the refusal to impose sanctions was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Oddi v. Ford Motor Co., </em>234 F.3d 136, 146 (3d Cir.2000). Moreover, because the Magistrate Judge\u2019s resolution of the sanctions issue did not hinge upon a factual finding inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict, his denial of the Sampsons\u2019 post-trial motion for reconsideration was likewise not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The Sampsons\u2019 second argument on appeal \u2014 that the jury\u2019s answers to the special verdict interrogatories were irreconcilably inconsistent and against the weight of the evidence \u2014 is not supported by the record. The Sampsons contend that the jury\u2019s affirmative answer to the first interrogatory, which asked if \u201cthe defendants made representations at the October 1997 meeting,\u201d is logically inconsistent with their negative answer to the second interrogatory, which asked whether \u201cthe representations related to material facts.\u201d Given the deference accorded to jury verdicts, however, \u201cit is well established that a verdict must be molded consistently with a jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories when there is any view of the case which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>reconciles the various answers.\u201d <em>Bradford-White Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Whinney, </em>872 F.2d 1153, 1159 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Reviewing the record in this light, it is apparent that the Sampsons\u2019 argument depends on the false premise that Jerrell Oaks must have either agreed to purchase Sampson Fire Sales, or made no oral representations at all. Instead, Oaks expressly testified on cross-examination that he made various representations to Dennis Sampson 742 (Pa.Super.Ct.1987). Whether or not a valid oral contract existed between Dennis Sampson and Jerrell Oaks was precisely the question directed to the jury in the special verdict interrogatories and it was well within the jury\u2019s role as factfinder to determine that no such contract existed. Accordingly, we can find no error in the interrogatories submitted on the special verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s refusal to impose draconian sanctions on NAFECO was well within his discretion, that the interrogatories submitted to the jury were consistent with Pennsylvania law, and that the jury\u2019s answers to those questions were both internally consistent and consistent with the evidence adduced at trial. Accordingly, we will affirm the order of January 23, 2002 and judgment of January 25, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
