Maitland had sued Pitney Bowes, his employer, alleging that the company discriminated and retaliated against him on the basis of his race (African American) and disability (depression), in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et. seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (the \u201cADA\u201d), and New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296 <em>et seq. A </em>jury trial began and, at the close of Maitland\u2019s case, Pitney Bowes made a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">After hearing extensive oral argument, the court granted Pitney Bowes\u2019s motion. The court concluded (1) that Maitland \u201cdoes not suffer from a disability as that term is defined under the ADA or the New York Executive Law\u201d; (2) that \u201cPitney Bowes reasonably accommodated all of [Maitland\u2019s] requests related to his depression\u201d; (3) that Maitland \u201csuffered no adverse employment action because of his alleged disability; (4) that Maitland\u2019s claim of race discrimination failed as a matter of law because it was based solely on comments that were either made by a coworker or were isolated remarks, and because there was \u201cno causal connection between the alleged remarks and any discriminatory actions\u201d; and (5) that Maitland\u2019s retaliation claim failed because \u201che did not suffer any adverse employment action,\u201d and that even assuming arguendo that he had, Maitland failed to show any causal relation between that action and the alleged racist remarks. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u201cIn examining a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to [Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1) ], the district court \u2018must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmovant and grant that party every reasonable inference that the jury might have drawn in its favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stagl v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Purgess v. Sharrock, </em>33 F.3d 134, 140 (2d Cir.1994). \u201cA district court may grant a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to this rule only if no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Stagl, </em>117 F.3d at 79 (citing <em>Samuels v. Air Transp. Local 504, </em>992 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.1993)). We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law, <em>Harris v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>252 F.3d 592, 597 (2d Cir.2001), applying the same standard that the district court was required to apply. <em>LeBlanc-Stemberg v. Fletcher, </em>67 F.3d 412, 429 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The ADA prohibits discrimination against any \u201cqualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). \u201cTo make out a prima facie case under the ADA, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) his employer is subject to the ADA; (2) he was disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (3) he was otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (4) he suffered adverse employment action because of his disability.\u201d <em>Giordano v. City of New York, </em>274 F.3d 740, 747 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The Act defines a disability as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>(B) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Based on a de novo review of the record, we agree that Appellant\u2019s ADA claim fails as a matter of law for substantially the reasons given by the district court. We find that Appellant\u2019s Title VII claims fail as a matter of law as well. As the district court correctly noted, the two racist comments alleged by the Appellant cannot, in this case, establish a claim of race discrimination because, \u201cassuming they were made, they were either made by a coworker or were isolated remarks.\u201d Moreover, Appellant has presented no evidence to establish a causal connection between the alleged remarks and any adverse employment action. Indeed, the record lacks evidence of any adverse employment action causally related to the remarks or, as would be necessary to support Appellant\u2019s retaliation claim, to his complaints about the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s other claims and find them meritless. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-14\"><em>.
