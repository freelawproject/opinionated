The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, therefore they are not recited here. The district court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision and the decision comports with the relevant law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\"><em>First, </em>we reject Giese\u2019s Equal Protection and Due Process challenges. Indigence is not a suspect classification for purposes of equal protection. <em>See Maher v. Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 470-471, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977); <em>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 27-28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). Disparate impact based on wealth only requires rational basis review. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. at 37-38. Although the requirement of \u201cacceptable medical sources,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a), may mean wealthier disabled people have an easier time qualifying for benefits, this inequality is rationally related to further-anee of the government\u2019s legitimate interest in preventing fraud and helping only those with genuine disabilities. Accordingly, Giese\u2019s equal protection rights have not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Giese\u2019s Due Process challenge is also unavailing. Giese cites cases that show Social Security insurance benefits implicate Due Process property interests; those cases, however, merely stand for the proposition that termination of <em>already conferred </em>Social Security benefits must come with some procedural safeguards. Here, there was no termination of benefits because Giese never qualified in the first place; there was simply no deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\"><em>Second, </em>we hold that ALJ did not err by mis-weighing the medical opinions. Giese asserts that \u201c[tjhere are four treating physicians who have diagnosed fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue syndrome.\u201d This is simply not true. Dr. Mosley\u2019s Internal Medicine evaluation found she had a chronic anxiety reaction rather than CFS; he noted <em>no physical impairment. </em>Dr. Critser found normal results from laboratory and diagnostic tests he performed to check on Giese\u2019s fibromyalgia complaint. Dr. Gallagher noted she probably suffered \u201cdepression versus chronic fatigue syndrome\u201d even though Giese \u201cstrongly\u201d denied depression; moreover, the laboratory tests were unremarkable, and the CT scan was negative. Dr. Blatt rejected a diagnosis of CFS or fibromyalgia, and diagnosed somatization disorder instead. He noted that she could deal with the public, maintain concentration and attention, and relate to co-workers and supervisors. All four of these doctors are \u201cacceptable medical sources\u201d under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Delaney, the licensed clinical social worker, is not an \u201cacceptable medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>source.\u201d We reject Giese\u2019s argument that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)\u2019s \u201cother sources\u201d provision warrants affording Delaney\u2019s testimony equal weight. That is, rather than expanding 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a)\u2019s definition of \u201cacceptable medical sources,\u201d this provision simply allows non-acceptable medical sources to opine as to the \u201cseverity\u201d of the diagnosed disability, <em>once established </em>by \u201cacceptable medical sources.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d). We also reject Giese\u2019s contention that since Delaney worked under the supervision of a licensed psychiatrist, her status should be elevated to that of her supervisor. Delaney\u2019s supervisor never treated Giese or signed off on Delaney\u2019s findings. <em>See Gomez v. Cha-ter, </em>74 F.3d 967, 970-971 (9th Cir.1996) (non-medical source must be integral to team, and the acceptable medical source must undersign her findings). Accordingly, Delaney\u2019s testimony, to the extent it conflicts with the four physicians, was correctly discounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The ALJ likewise did not erroneously discount Giese\u2019s statements in weighing the evidence. An ALJ is free to discount a claimant\u2019s complaints of disabling symptoms if he points to specific contrary findings in the record. <em>See Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir.1996) <em>(citing Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Giese did not suffer a physical disability as defined under the Act. A reasonable person could conclude that the record does not support a disability of \u201c12 months\u201d duration, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), with \u201csuch severity that [s]he is not only unable to do h[er] previous work [waitress, gas station attendant, and inventory clerk] but cannot, considering h[er] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A); <em>see also Edlund v. Massa-nari </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001) (affirm if reasonable fact-finder could find that the record supports the ALJ\u2019s finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">With respect to the fifth physician, Dr. Pretorius, who Giese contends should trump the others under the treating physician rule, <em>see, e.g., Edlund, </em>253 F.3d at 1157, the fatal fact for Giese is that Dr. Pretorius did not diagnose her until June 29, 1998, well after the ALJ\u2019s decision in 1996. \u201cThe new evidence indicates, at most, [physical] deterioration ... which would be material to a <em>new application, </em>but <em>not </em>probative of h[er] condition at the hearing.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>812 F.2d 509, 512 (9th Cir.1987) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\"><em>Third, </em>we hold that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Giese\u2019s mental impairment did not rise to the requisite severity level under the listed impairments at C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. A mere diagnosis of a listed condition, here somatization, does not establish that claimant meets the listing requirements. <em>See Moncada v. Chater, </em>60 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1995). Giese contends that, even if diagnosis alone is insufficient, she met the Listings\u2019 test because (1) she was diagnosed with depression (satisfying Part A), and (2) that she had at least two of the Part B items. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.04. Giese\u2019s argument fails at the second prong because it hinges on affording Delaney\u2019s opinion equal weight to that of the physicians. The fact is that the \u201cacceptable medical sources\u201d did <em>not </em>find \u201cat least two\u201d of the four Part B conditions. Both Dr. Blatt and Dr. Mosley found she was not markedly restricted. Moreover, Giese reported in several doctor visits that she found Prozac was effective at making her feel better. Giese testified that she has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>suffered from depressive symptoms all her life, and despite these symptoms, she has held down jobs; also, she quit her last job in 1991 because she was pregnant, not because of an impairment. Giese also reported that she enjoys visiting friends, camping, and going to different parks. Given the evidence, the ALJ did not err in concluding that she had the \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d to perform work consistent with her past types of work as a gas station attendant, waitress or department store clerk. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (must be \u201cunable to do h[er] previous work\u201d). Accordingly, looking at the entirety of the record, the evidence is such that a reasonable person could conclude, as the ALJ did, that Giese\u2019s mental impairments did not qualify under the Listings.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b842-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
