Gooding filed a motion to correct sentence, and the district court denied the motion. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court based Gooding\u2019s sentence on an improperly calculated amount of value under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2S1.1 (2000) but stating that in his view, there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Advised of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Gooding has not done so. We have reviewed the Appellant\u2019s brief and record, and assuming without deciding that Gooding\u2019s motion to correct sentence was properly before the court, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his. client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
