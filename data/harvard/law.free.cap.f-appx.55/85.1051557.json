They appeal the district court\u2019s order granting National Grange\u2019s motion for discovery sanctions by dismissing Sharp\u2019s and Blanck\u2019s breach of contract and bad faith actions. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Inasmuch as the district court has already set forth the factual and procedural history of this case, it is unnecessary to repeat that history here. <em>See Sharp Equipment v. National Grange, </em>Nos. 01-0628 and 01-1184, 2002 WL 442823 (E.D.Pa. Mar.1, 2001). It is sufficient to note for our purposes that the record fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that there have \u201cbeen repeated, prejudicial, and wilful delays in document discovery, answering interrogatories and Mr. Blanck\u2019s depositions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1. Moreover, the district court has fully and completely analyzed each of the relevant six factors we established in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>747 F.2d 863 (3d Cir.1984), for determining whether dismissal is an appropriate discovery sanction. We can add nothing to district court\u2019s thoughtful and searching analysis. The district court clearly did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the actions. Therefore, we will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
