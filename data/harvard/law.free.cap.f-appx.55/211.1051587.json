Insofar as Moseley seeks to appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion, the notice of appeal was untimely. We therefore dismiss the appeal as to that order for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-23\">The time periods for filing notices of appeal are governed by Fed. RApp. P. 4. These periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). In civil cases in which the United States is a party, parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). The only exception to the appeal period is when the district court extends the time to appeal under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The filing of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration does not change the applicable appeal period, unless the motion is filed within ten days of the entry of the district court\u2019s order. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-24\">The district court entered its order dismissing Moseley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely on June 7, 2002; Moseley\u2019s motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>for reconsideration of that order were filed on July 30, 2002, and his notice of appeal was filed on October 14, 2002.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Moseley\u2019s failure to timely file his notice of appeal or to obtain an extension within the prescribed time frame leaves this court without jurisdiction to consider the merits of Moseley\u2019s appeal as it pertains to his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">With regard to the denial of Moseley\u2019s motions for reconsideration, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-16\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
