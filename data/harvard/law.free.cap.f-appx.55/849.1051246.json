We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Singh v. Reno, </em>113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">Cohen contends that the reinstatement procedures set forth in section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5), violate his procedural due process rights because they do not provide him with a full and fair hearing. We reject this contention because Cohen already received one full and fair hearing, including the right to judicial review of that hearing. <em>See Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, </em>271 F.3d 1169, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that the reinstatement regulation does not offend due process because the alien has already received a full hearing at his initial deportation proceeding).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b891-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-26\">. To the extent Cohen raises other claims on appeal, we decline to address them because we lack jurisdiction. <em>See United States v.
