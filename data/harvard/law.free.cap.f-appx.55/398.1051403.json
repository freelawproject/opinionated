On appeal, he argues that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> clearly erred in attributing to him the entire 5 pounds of methamphetamine obtained by his coconspirators during the course of the conspiracy, rather than merely the quantity he personally sold or arranged to have sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-34\">The district court was presented with evidence that Dominguez had agreed with two of his coconspirators that the two should travel to California to purchase 10 pounds of methamphetamine, he arranged for a car for the two coconspirators to use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>they notified him upon their return to Omaha that they had been able to purchase 5 pounds of methamphetamine, and he assisted them in breaking down the 5 pounds into smaller quantities for resale. Thus, the district court did not clearly err in attributing the entire amount to him. <em>See United States v.
