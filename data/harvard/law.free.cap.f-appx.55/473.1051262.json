The delay in Appellant\u2019s sentencing did not violate his speedy trial rights un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>der the Speedy Trial Act or the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Parks, </em>285 F.3d 1133, 1143 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Martinez, </em>837 F.2d 861, 866-67 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">2. Because Gomez was sufficiently familiar with Appellant\u2019s voice, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted Gomez\u2019 testimony identifying Appellant\u2019s voice on the surveillance tapes. <em>See United States v. Plunk, </em>153 F.3d 1011, 1023, <em>amended by </em>161 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">3. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial on the basis of extrinsic evidence in the jury room. Even assuming the jury was exposed to extrinsic evidence, Appellant was not prejudiced. <em>See United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 937 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">4. There was also no abuse of discretion in denying a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct. The government\u2019s providing of information to <em>Time </em>magazine did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. <em>See Mancuso v. Olivarez, </em>292 F.3d 939, 957 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">5. As is our usual practice, we decline to address Appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>206 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-42\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
