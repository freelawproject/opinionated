P. app. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">We reverse and find that the ALJ did not have substantial evidence to find that Jennifer\u2019s impairment did not functionally equal a listed impairment. The evidence shows that Jennifer has a marked limitation in her social functioning, and there is not substantial evidence to suggest otherwise. We hereby remand this cause to the ALJ for award proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Jennifer Dishman was born on December 24,1990. She has had difficulty speaking throughout her life. Specifically, she has been diagnosed with a speech delay. Her problem has severely diminished her intelligibility and has caused her to be an outcast among her peers, shunned by other children. She is unable to interact well, and almost completely unable to express her basic wants and needs, or even to say her name. She cannot read, and routinely exhibits fits of rage when she becomes frustrated that she is not understood. Because of her condition, Jennifer was granted SSI benefits in October 1994, under the Social Security Act that was in place at the time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, Pub.L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (\u201cWelfare Act\u201d), amended the definitions in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c and changed the criteria for determining SSI benefits. In addition to affecting the award of benefits to future recipients, the Welfare Act required the Social Security Commission to redetermine benefits for all children who were receiving SSI benefits at the time of enactment (August 22, 1996). <em>See </em>Pub L. No. 104-193, \u00a7 211(d)(2)(A), 110 Stat. 2105, 2190.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">Pursuant to the Welfare Act, the Social Security Commission mandated a hearing to redetermine Jennifer\u2019s eligibility. On May 28, 1997, the Commission determined that Jennifer was no longer eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>SSI benefits because her condition did not meet the amended requirements for benefits, in that her speech impairment did not \u201cmedically or functionally equal\u201d an impairment listed in the regulations to the Welfare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Jennifer\u2019s mother appealed, on behalf of her daughter, to the ALJ\u2019s office. The ALJ made an independent determination and, on July 31, 1998, likewise concluded that Jennifer was ineligible for benefits under the Welfare Act because her condition was not medically or functionally equal to an impairment listed in the regulations to the Act, namely 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 2.09, which references organic speech impediments. Specifically, the ALJ found that Jennifer\u2019s condition was not medically equal because a report by a speech pathologist, Susan Commons, concluded that her limitation of speech was only \u201cmoderate to severe;\u201d and the ALJ found her condition was not functionally equal because of a report of Jennifer\u2019s former teacher, as well as an isolated portion of Lowery\u2019s testimony, indicating that Jennifer was able to function socially since she allegedly had the ability to interact age-appropriately with adults, make friends, and play with other children on some level.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Lowery attempted to appeal the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Social Security Appeals Council, but, on April 22, 2000, the Council issued an order refusing to hear the case. Having exhausted her administrative remedies. Lowery appealed to the district court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on June 7, 2001, expressing the opinion that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion based on the reports of Commons and another reviewing physician, Jeffrey Bryant. Accordingly, the magistrate found no basis for reversal. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and issued a final order to that effect on June 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Jennifer\u2019s mother filed a notice of appeal on July 30, 2001, and this matter is timely before this Court, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">Our review of an ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to an examination of whether the ALJ had substantial evidence for his ruling. <em>See Crum v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 642, 644 (6th Cir.1990). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>See Cutlip v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., 25 </em>F.3d 284, 286 (6th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Moreover, reversal is not warranted because substantial evidence also supports an opposite conclusion, but only if substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>Crum, </em>921 F.2d at 644. Accordingly, contrary evidence shall have no bearing on our decision except to the extent it demonstrates that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Hephner v. Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 362 (6th Cir.1978) (intimating that question of whether evidence is substantial is determined by its place among all the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">III. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Under the regulations to the Welfare Act, a claim for SSI benefits undergoes a three-step process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924. The first two steps - an examination of whether Jennifer is unable to participate in substantial gainful activity, and whether she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments - are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">In the third step, Lowery is required to show that Jennifer\u2019s impairments meet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>medically equal, or functionally equal any impairment listed in the regulations to the Act. 20 C.F.R \u00a7 416.924. The relevant list of impairments is provided in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P, app. 1. Section 2.09 of that subpart lists the speech impairment that Jennifer\u2019s mother is seeking to equate to her daughter\u2019s impairment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><em>Organic loss of speech </em>due to any cause with inability to produce by any means speech which can be heard, understood, and sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 2.09.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">An impairment, or combination of impairments, is medically equal to a listed condition if the claimant has physical limitations, supported by medical findings, which are at least equal in severity and duration to limitations associated with the listed impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926. An impairment is functionally equal to a listed impairment if the claimant\u2019s condition creates a limitation in her everyday functioning, such as her ability to perform routine tasks or interact socially, in a way similar to the way that a listed impairment would affect her. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">A. Medical Equality</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The Social Security Commission has promulgated SSR 98-lp to specify when an impairment will be medically equal to the speech impairment listed in \u00a7 2.09. Under that ruling, medical equality will be found if the claimant has a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in both speech and cognitive function, or if she has an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in either. The Commissioner concedes that Jennifer has a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in speech but challenges whether she has an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in speech or even a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in cognitive function.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">An agency\u2019s ruling on its own regulations is given a great deal of deference. <em>Garcia v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Seros., </em>46 F.3d 552, 559 (6th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994)) (giving an agency\u2019s interpretation \u201ccontrolling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\u201d); <em>see also Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. 144, 150-51, 111 S:Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991); <em>Lyng v. Payne, </em>476 U.S. 926, 939, 106 S.Ct. 2333, 90 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986) (stating that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference\u201d); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965) (stating that deference should be given to an agency\u2019s decision if it is reasonable). SSR 98-lp provides definitions for \u201cmarked\u201d and \u201cextreme\u201d limitations in speech, and, given the deference due this ruling, Jennifer\u2019s mother insists that the ALJ and the district court erred in not applying these definitions to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">For a child over five, SSR 98-lp defines a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in speech as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">1) Sounds, omissions, distortions, or phonological patters, or fluency (rate, rhythm of speech) not typical for this group; or significant aberrations in vocal pitch, quality, or intensity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>2) Conversation is intelligible 1/2 to 2/3 of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">3) Intelligibility improves with repetition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">SSR 98-lp further offers that a child has an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in speech if the child can show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">1) Sounds, omissions, distortions, or phonological patters, or fluency (rate, rhythm of speech) not typical for this group, or significant aberrations in vocal pitch, quality, or intensity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">2) Conversation is intelligible no more than half of the time despite repetitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">SSR 98-lp (Table 1) (1998). Moreover, the evidence of such limitation must come in the form of medical evidence alone. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926(b); <em>see also Dorton v. Heckler, </em>789 F.2d 363, 366 (6th Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In his opinion, the ALJ failed to analyze whether Jennifer\u2019s speech was intelligible, as required by SSR 98-lp. Instead, the ALJ relied solely on the report of Susan Commons, a speech pathologist. Commons saw Jennifer when she was six years, four months old; and performed several tests. Commons found that Jennifer exhibited a vocabulary recognition age of four years, six months; and fell within the moderately low range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In April 1997, Commons reexamined Jennifer and found that she exhibited \u201cmoderate to severe developmental articulation and language delays.\u201d The ALJ relied on this finding to conclude that Jennifer had a marked, but not an extreme speech limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Based on this evidence, the ALJ, without discussion, and without utilizing the intelligibility test set forth in SSR 98-lp, concluded that Jennifer\u2019s impairment did not medically equal any listed impairment, because her speech limitation was only marked, not extreme.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">On appeal, the Commissioner concedes that the ALJ failed to analyze Lowery\u2019s claim under SSR 98-lp. but nonetheless asserts that substantial evidence is present because of Commons\u2019s finding that Jennifer\u2019s problem was only \u201cmoderate to severe.\u201d Moreover, the Commissioner contends that even had the ALJ used the definitions in SSR 98-lp, Lowery would fail anyway because she has not provided medical evidence to show that her daughter is unintelligible more than half the time in spite of repetitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">In order to determine whether substantial evidence exists, we look at all supporting evidence, not just that mentioned in the ALJ\u2019s report. Dr. Jeffrey Bryant also reviewed Jennifer\u2019s records and concluded that Jennifer did not suffer from an extreme limitation in her speech. Moreover, unlike Commons\u2019s report, Bryant tracked the language of the regulation, expressing specifically that Jennifer\u2019s speech limitation was not extreme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, although the ALJ did not analyze this cause under SSR 98-lp. the burden of proof rests with Jennifer\u2019s mother, so the test used by the ALJ is irrelevant here in light of the fact that Lowery had not presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>any medical evidence to support her position. We find that because Lowery did not offer any medical evidence to suggest that she would have met her burden under SSR 98-lp, if it were utilized, her claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Accordingly, because the reports of Commons and Bryant indicate that Jennifer\u2019s speech limitation is not extreme, and given the absence of any medical evidence from Jennifer\u2019s mother,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we find that there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s impairment does not medically equal an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, subpt. p, app. 1, \u00a7 2.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">B. Functional Equality</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">However, even though Jennifer\u2019s condition does not <em>medically </em>equal a listed impairment, she is nonetheless entitled to benefits under the Welfare Act if her condition <em>functionally </em>equals a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Functional equality is determined in light of four factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">1) limitations in specific functions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">2) limitations resulting from chronic/ frequent illnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">3) limitations resulting from the effects of medication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">4) broad functional limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b). If the claimant can show limitation under any of these four factors, her impairment functionally equals a listed impairment. Here, Lowery does not contend that Jennifer is chronically sick or has suffered from any side effects of medication, but focuses only on the first and fourth factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">As for the first factor, Jennifer\u2019s mother claims that her daughter is limited only in her ability to speak. However, an examination of limitation in speech in general is included in the fourth factor as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because there is substantial overlap between the first and fourth factors in regard to children with speech problems, we will analyze Jennifer\u2019s claim only under the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">In order to prove the fourth factor, Jennifer\u2019s mother must demonstrate that her daughter suffers from broad functional limitations. Under the regulations to the Welfare Act, this factor will be satisfied and Jennifer\u2019s impairment will be found functionally equal to a listed impairment if there is limitation among the following areas: cognition/ communication; motor skills; social functioning; personal functioning; and concentration, persistence, and pace. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(c)(5)(2002). To show functional equality via limitation in broad areas, the claimant must demonstrate \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one area, or a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in two areas. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(2002). As stated above, the Commissioner concedes that Jennifer suffers from a marked limitation in cognition/ communication. Since Jennifer\u2019s mother does not contend that Jennifer is limited in either her motor, personal, or concentration skills, we will address only her social functioning, and whether it is also at least marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">The ALJ found that Jennifer did not suffer from any kind of social hmitation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>He based his decision solely on the partial testimony of Jennifer\u2019s mother and a check-off form<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> filled out by Jennifer\u2019s pre-school/ kindergarten teacher. Carrie Kanipe, and found that Jennifer acts similarly to other children her age. However, we find the ALJ\u2019s reliance on each of these sources was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">1. Testimony of Jennifer\u2019s Mother</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The ALJ characterized Lowery\u2019s testimony as supporting the proposition that Jennifer was able to function socially as any other child her age. Specifically, the ALJ relied on Lowery\u2019s statements that Jennifer had one girlfriend who would come over to her house to play, and that Jennifer has the ability to make friends with children, if those children are around her for a long time.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Although this information, viewed narrowly, tends to indicate that Jennifer has some degree of social functioning, it represents a mischaracterization of Lowery\u2019s testimony as a whole. The ALJ may not take part of a witness\u2019s testimony and disregard the rest. <em>Cf. United States v. Epley, </em>52 F.3d 571, 579 (6th Cir.1995) (intimating that a trier of fact cannot consider isolated testimony out of context); <em>cf. United States v. Cresta, </em>825 F.2d 538, 548 (1st Cir.1987) (indicating that a witness\u2019s testimony is viewed as a whole and isolated or contradictory statements are considered as compared to the entire testimony); <em>Olgin v. Darnell, </em>664 F.2d 107, 108 (5th Cir.1981) (stating that part of a witness\u2019s testimony cannot be considered alone); <em>United States v. Reicin, </em>497 F.2d 563, 567 (7th Cir.1974) (indicating that isolated testimony cannot be considered in a vacuum); <em>Angelina Casualty Co. v. Bluitt, </em>235 F.2d 764, 767 (5th Cir.1956) (stating that \u201c[t]es-timony as a whole and not isolated portions of it must be considered\u201d); <em>Meyers v. United States, </em>171 F.2d 800, 806 (D.C.Cir. 1948) (holding that a witness\u2019s statement cannot be isolated and considered apart from the testimony as a whole). To the contrary, substantial evidence is determined from the record as a whole. <em>See Garner v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 383, 388 (6th Cir.1984); <em>see also Hephner, </em>574 F.2d at 362 (stating that \u201cthe Court may not base its decision on a single piece of evidence and disregard other pertinent evidence in evaluating whether substantial evidence exists.\u201d); <em>cf. Trudell v. Apfel, </em>130 Supp.2d 891, 894 (E.D.Mich.2001) (proposing that the substantial evidence standard does not permit a selective reading of the record) Moreover, an \u201cALJ may not select and discuss only that evidence that favors his ultimate conclusion, but must articulate, at some minimum level, his analysis of the evidence to allow the appellate court to trace the path of his reasoning.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 300, 306 (7th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Herron v. Shalala, </em>19 F.3d 329, 333 (7th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">Lowery testified that Jennifer\u2019s only friend no longer plays with her, and instead has abandoned her daughter for the company of Jennifer\u2019s older sister. Lowery testified that she believes this was because the little girl became increasingly frustrated by the fact that she can understand little, if any, of what Jennifer says. Lowery further testified that, notwithstanding this one little girl, Jennifer is ostracized by the majority of children, Jennifer has trouble in school because she cannot participate in group activities, and Jennifer can no longer go to the Boys and Girls Club because all the children make fun of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>We find that Jennifer\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony, when read as a whole, supports the contention that Jennifer has a marked limitation in social functioning. We find that Lowery\u2019s testimony reveals that Jennifer is a lonely little girl who struggles to make friends. We do not believe that the test of \u201cmarked social functioning\u201d requires that Jennifer completely lack companionship, or that she be a virtual recluse, locked-up with no contact with other children. Rather, the regulations define \u201cmarked\u201d as something \u201cmore than moderate\u201d and \u201cless than extreme.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.92a(c)(3)(i)(C). Under this definition, we believe the test requires only that Jennifer\u2019s mother demonstrate that her daughter\u2019s ability to function socially is sufficiently hindered and far below average. We find that Lowery\u2019s testimony does not evidence that Jennifer\u2019s social skills are anywhere near normal, and therefore her testimony in no way constitutes substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s social functioning is not marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">2. Report of Carrie Kanipe</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Having found that Jennifer\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony supports the very opposite conclusion that the ALJ purports it does, the only remaining evidence he relied on in support of his position is the report of Carrie Kanipe. However, the report that Kanipe filled out was merely a check-off form, where she could only answer either affirmatively or negatively to pre-printed questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The form was composed of several sections, each referencing one of the broad areas of limitation considered under the functional equality test. The section of the form pertaining to social functioning consisted of only two questions. In answering these two questions, Kanipe checked \u201cyes\u201d twice, indicating that she believed Jennifer related age-appropriately to adults, and is able to develop friendships and relate to peers age-appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">However, the form Kanipe used gave her little room to provide adequate explanations; and in fact, she chose not to expound when answering the questions pertaining to social functioning. Hence, the ALJ had only conclusions from Kanipe, with no analysis and no mention of the factual bases from which she drew her answers. Moreover, her affirmative checkmark, in answer to the question asking whether Jennifer relates age-appropriately to adults, directly contradicts her earlier checkmark in the communication/ cognition section of the same form, which indicated that she believed Jennifer was unable to carry on age-appropriate conversations with adults. We find this contradiction negates any value her report would have otherwise had as evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Furthermore, Jennifer was a seven-year old kindergartner when Kanipe taught her, and it is unclear whether Kanipe was answering the questions related to age-appropriateness based on Jennifer\u2019s grade or age.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In sum, we find that two perfunctory checkmarks do not constitute substantial evidence. Kanipe\u2019s answers completely lacked analysis, were unsupported, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>were contradictory. Accordingly, we find that the ALJ lacked substantial evidence for his conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s social limitations were not at least marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">IV. Lowery\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">However, even though the ALJ\u2019s position lacked substantial evidence, the burden of proof remains with Jennifer\u2019s mother to prove that her daughter suffers from a marked limitation in her social functioning.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Jennifer\u2019s mother offers the report of Kathy Thomas, a psychologist at the Overlook Mental Health Center, who had met with Jennifer from October 7, 1997 to May 15, 1998, to counter Kanipe\u2019s form and the ALJ\u2019s position that her daughter\u2019s limitation in social functioning was not marked. Thomas comes to the opposite conclusion of the ALJ, and concludes that Jennifer is indeed marked in her cognitive/communicative functioning and her social functioning. Moreover. Thomas provided analysis for her conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s limitation in social functioning was at least marked. She notes that Jennifer \u201chas [a] severe speech impediment, [and] possible hearing disabilities. She has extreme difficulty dealing [with] social situations, peers, [and] school due to low self esteem, [and an] inability to communicate.\u201d Thomas further notes that Jennifer \u201c[i]solates herself from others - has no friends.\u201d Because Thomas\u2019s supported findings reinforce Jennifer\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony, we find that she had presented enough evidence to meet her burden of proof. Accordingly, we find that Jennifer is entitled to benefits under the Welfare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the decision of the district court, and find that the ALJ lacked substantial evidence to support his conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s impairment did not functionally equal one listed in the regulations. Moreover, we find that Lowery met her burden of proof in showing that her daughter\u2019s communication/cognition limitations and social limitations are each marked. Therefore, we hereby REMAND this cause to the ALJ for award proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">. Jennifer received benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381a, utilizing the definitions in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A), which was later amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\">. Incidentally, the Act does not require that Jennifer\u2019s impairment equal a specific listed impairment, but if her impairment subjects her to the same limitations that any listed impairment involves, her impairment will be deemed equal, even though it may pertain to a different body system. For instance, if Jennifer had a leg ailment that prevented her from walking, this might be equal to a listed back ailment that referenced the inability to walk. However, Jennifer\u2019s only limitation is that she cannot speak. Section 2.09 of the regulation is the only listed impairment that involves the inability to speak.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\">. Commons performed several tests on Jennifer. She utilized the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Form L. which revealed a vocabulary recognition age of four years, six months, which equates to a 76 standard score equivalent. This score is in the moderately low range. Commons also utilized the Utah Test of Language Development. This test revealed that Jennifer\u2019s general language functioning was at three years, ten months. Commons also gave Jennifer a phoneme test. On the Screening Subtest of the Templin Darley Articulation Test, Jennifer correctly produced only thirteen of fifty phonemes, whereas the mean for a female her age was 45.3, and 32.5 was the cut-off for adequacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b379-17\">. Bryant's report reveals that he relied on Commons's report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b380-13\">. Lowery does not present any medical evidence to support her claim that Jennifer suffers from a marked limitation in her cognitive functioning, so that argument fails here also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b380-14\">. Here, there is a great deal of overlap among the factors for functional equality. This is because communication is a broad category by which the functional equality of all claims for benefits are judged, and it also happens to be Jennifer\u2019s specific problem here. Hence, independent examination of each of the factors is not necessary here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. By \"check-off form,\u201d we mean that Kanipe filled out a form with pre-printed questions followed by a space where the respondent could either check \"yes\u201d or \"no.\u201d In the space following each question, there was room for the respondent to expound on her answer if she so chose. Kanipe provided very little explanation for any of her answers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. In the communication/cognition section of the form, Kanipe was asked. \u201cCan this student carry out age-appropriate conversation with adults and other students?\u201d Kanipe checked \u201cno,\u201d and supplemented her answer by writing, \u201cHas disability in speech: She is doing much better speaking but has to be reminded to slow down [and] speak clearly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b382-13\">. This is demonstrated in one of Kanipe\u2019s answers in the cognitive function part of the form, where, in response to the question, \"Is this student able to apply skills involved in reading, writing, math, reasoning, and problem solving at an age-appropriate level?,\u201d Ka-nipe answered, \u201cYes - Kindergarten appropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b383-7\">. Ultimately, the ALJ misanalyzed this case. He wrote his opinion as if the Commissioner were the party with the burden of proof. His analysis should not have involved whether the Commissioner had shown that Jennifer's social limitations <em>were not </em>marked, but whether Jennifer's mother showed that her daughter\u2019s social limitations <em>were </em>marked. Accordingly, even though we find that substantial evidence does not support the conclusion that Jennifer\u2019s limitation in social skills were not marked, this is irrelevant unless there exists contrary evidence to indicate that Jennifer\u2019s mother can meet her burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
