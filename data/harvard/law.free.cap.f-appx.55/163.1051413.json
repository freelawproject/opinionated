Conard received a life sentence for Count 1, a five-year consecutive sentence for Count 2, and a fifteen-year concurrent sentence for Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-23\">On appeal, Conard\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues, whether the district court: (1) erred by denying Conard\u2019s motion to suppress evidence found in the car; (2) erred by denying Conard\u2019s motion for acquittal on the grounds of insufficient evidence; and (3) erred by finding that Conard was subject to a mandatory life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1) (2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-25\">First, the district court properly denied Conard\u2019s motion to suppress the search of the vehicle because as a mere passenger, he lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in the areas of the vehicle that were searched. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 148-49, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). Second, there was ample evidence to support Conard\u2019s convictions. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Finally, the district court properly determined that Co-nard was subject to a mandatory life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), which is not affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We have examined the entire record in this case, in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>including the claims raised in Conard\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
