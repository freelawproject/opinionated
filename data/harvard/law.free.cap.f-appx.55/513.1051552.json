R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">This case is before the court on John Daniel\u2019s <em>pro se </em>requests for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and for permission to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Daniel seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court\u201d unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). We grant Daniel\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Because Daniel has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d however, this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The district court dismissed Daniel\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition without prejudice because Daniel had not yet exhausted his state court remedies. <em>See generally Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). In so doing, the district court recognized that the exhaustion requirement may be excused where a state court appeals process is not effective. <em>See Harris v. Champion, </em>15 F.3d 1538, 1546 (10th Cir.1994). Although Daniel\u2019s direct appeal had been pending for several years, the district court concluded that much of the delay was occasioned by Daniel\u2019s own counsel. Furthermore, the district court noted that the appellate record was now complete, a briefing schedule had been set, and the Wyoming Supreme Court had clearly not abandoned the appeal. In these circumstances, the district court concluded that all parties would benefit from requiring the compete exhaustion of Daniel\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u2018When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has closely reviewed Daniel\u2019s brief on appeal and application for COA, the respondent\u2019s brief in opposition to the grant of a COA, the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, and the entire record on appeal. Our review demonstrates the district court\u2019s resolution of Daniel\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is not reasonably debatable. Accordingly, Daniel has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). This court GRANTS Daniel\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>DENIES his request for a COA for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal dated July 23, 2002 and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
