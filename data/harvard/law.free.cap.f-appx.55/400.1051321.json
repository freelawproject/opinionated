Clark, a federal inmate, appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order of involuntary commitment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Mr. Clark suffers from a mental disease or defect for which he requires care and treatment in a suitable facility. The report of the government\u2019s expert \u2014 which was uncontradicted by any evidence submitted on Mr. Clark\u2019s behalf \u2014 satisfied the government\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See United States v. Steil, </em>916 F.2d 485, 487 (8th Cir.1990) (standard of review); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (burden of proof). Mr. Clark\u2019s Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance argument is misplaced in this section 4245 proceeding, <em>see United States v. Veltman, </em>9 F.3d 718, 720-21 (8th Cir.1993) (right to counsel in \u00a7 4245 proceedings is statutory), <em>cert. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1044, 114 S.Ct. 1572, 128 L.Ed.2d 216 (1994); and in any event, Mr. Clark has not shown that counsel performed deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We also deny Mr. Clark\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-23\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-17\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable James C. England, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
