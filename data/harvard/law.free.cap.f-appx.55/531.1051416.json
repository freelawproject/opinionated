R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Marvin Reddish, the <em>pro se </em>petitioner in this case, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Reddish is not entitled to a COA unless he can make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Reddish can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">This court has read Reddish\u2019s request for a COA and accompanying brief and has conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal. That <em>de novo </em>review clearly demonstrates the district court\u2019s dismissal of Reddish\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is not deserving of further proceedings or subject to a different resolution on appeal. Accordingly, this court denies Reddish\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
