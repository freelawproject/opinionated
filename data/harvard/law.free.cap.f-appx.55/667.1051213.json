Objective, Inc., </em>180 F.3d 583, 590-91 (4th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment and declaratory relief for the reason stated in its comprehensive opinion and orders and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Maynard v. Westport Ins. Corp., </em>No. CA-01-232-DKC (D.Md. July 3 and Aug. 15, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
