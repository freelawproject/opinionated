Chalupa appeals the judgment of conviction and his 35-month sentence following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). His attorney has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a brief stating that counsel cannot identify any nonfrivolous issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">We have conducted an independent review of the record and the briefs on appeal pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), which disclosed that Chalupa knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his conviction and he was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement. Accordingly, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v.
