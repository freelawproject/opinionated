Valencia seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 5, 2002. Giving Valencia the benefit of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c), the notice of appeal was executed on September 4, 2002, one day beyond the expiration of the appeal period. Because Valencia failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
