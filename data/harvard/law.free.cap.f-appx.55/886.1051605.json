RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">Appellant, Juan Antonio Arrieta-Duran is a non-citizen who was deported in 2000 after his felony conviction for attempted robbery. On November 29, 2001, Duran pleaded guilty to one count of illegally reentering the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). A presentence investigation report was prepared and, prior to sentencing, Duran filed a motion requesting a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines range. The district court denied the motion and sentenced Duran to the low end of the guidelines range. Duran then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-20\">The only issue raised by Duran on appeal is whether the district court erred by failing to grant him a downward departure. \u201cIt is well settled that an appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines when the sentencing court was aware that it had the authority to depart but declined to exercise that authority and grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Fagan, </em>162 F.3d 1280, 1282 (10th Cir.1998). Duran, however, argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>that the district court refused to grant the downward departure because it believed it had no discretion to depart on the grounds he advanced. Under those circumstances, this court does have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s legal conclusion \u201cthat it does not have any authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range for the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir.1998). However, the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s statement that it lacks authority to grant the requested downward departure must be unambiguous.\u201d <em>United States v. Browning, </em>252 F.3d 1153, 1161 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We reject Duran\u2019s argument. At the sentencing hearing, the district court did not make an unambiguous legal determination that it lacked discretion to grant the downward departure requested by Duran. To the contrary, the court considered Duran\u2019s arguments but concluded that the factors upon which the motion for downward departure was based \u201cwere factors obviously taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission when they determined the guidelines.\u201d The court further stated, \u201cthe Court denies the request for downward departure, as I feel it does not fall out of the heartland of cases.\u201d It is clear that the district court's refusal to grant Duran a downward departure was based on its belief that it had the discretionary authority to grant the departure but that the circumstances asserted by Duran did not justify the departure. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Duran\u2019s departure motion and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
