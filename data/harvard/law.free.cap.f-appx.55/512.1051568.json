RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-20\">This ease is before the court on Kelvin Reynolds\u2019 request for a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Reynolds seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habe-as petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court\u201d unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Reynolds has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-21\">The district court dismissed Reynolds\u2019 petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In particular, the district court noted that Reynolds\u2019 Oklahoma state first degree murder conviction became final on September 25, 1995, when the ninety-day period for seeking a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court expired. Reynolds did not file the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, however, until November 29, 2000. The district court noted that counting the start date of the one-year limitations period from April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and excluding the time Reynolds had pending a properly filed application for state post-conviction relief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reynolds\u2019 federal habeas petition was filed almost one-year after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>expiration of the limitations period set out in \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The district court also rejected Reynolds\u2019 request that the limitations period be equitably tolled. In so doing, the district court noted that Reynolds\u2019 attorney\u2019s incorrect advice regarding when the limitations period began to run was not the type of extraordinary circumstance entitling Reynolds to equitable tolling. <em>CF. Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (10th Cir.2000); <em>see also Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000). The district court rejected Reynolds\u2019 claim of actual innocence because he had completely failed to support his allegations of innocence with \u201cnew reliable evidence\u2014 whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence \u2014 that was not presented at trial.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has closely reviewed Reynolds\u2019 brief on appeal/application for COA, the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, and the entire record on appeal. Our review demonstrates the district court\u2019s conclusions that Reynolds\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition is time-barred and that Reynolds is not entitled to equitable tolling are not reasonably debatable. Accordingly, Reynolds has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). This court DENIES Reynolds\u2019 request for a COA for substantially those reasons set out by the district court in its order of dismissal dated February 6, 2002 and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
