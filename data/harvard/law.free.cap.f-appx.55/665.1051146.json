Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), when the United States is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, unless: (1) under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4), the district court, upon the defendant\u2019s showing of good cause or excusable neglect, grants the defendant a thirty day extension; (2) under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), the district court extends the appeal period; or (3) under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), the district court reopens the appeal period. This appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Deft of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 267, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 26, 2000. Newman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>notice of appeal was filed on June 6, 2001. Newman failed to file a timely notice of appeal, and he did not seek an extension or reopening of the appeal period. We therefore deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Newman\u2019s appeal as to this order. <em>See United States v. Newman, </em>No. CR-99-22-A (E.D. Va. filed July 25, 2000, entered July 26, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">As to Newman\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s April 3, 2001, order denying his motion for reconsideration, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Newman, </em>No. CR-99-22-A (E.D. Va. filed Apr. 2, 2001, entered Apr. 3, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
