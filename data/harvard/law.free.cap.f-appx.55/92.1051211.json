Davis filed a complaint on August 9, 1999 against her employer, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of General Services (\u201cDGS\u201d), and several individual supervisors, alleging discrimination on the basis of race. Appellant raised her non-selection for a position in the Department, as well as various disciplinary suspensions she says she received on the basis of her race and one or more suspensions in retaliation for her having engaged in protected activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq., </em>and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381, 1343, and 1367. Appellate jurisdiction is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants substantially for the reasons set forth in the lengthy and comprehensive opinion of the District Court. We agree with the District Court that, among other reasons, appellant\u2019s allegations are too conclusory and generalized to engender a material issue of fact as to whether or not discriminatory animus and not legitimate rationales un-dergirded defendant\u2019s employment decisions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
