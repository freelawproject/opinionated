R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">This case is before the court on Joseph A. Ellsworth\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and motion to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Ellsworth seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that no appeal may be taken from \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant first obtains a COA). In denying Ellsworth\u2019s motion, the district court concluded that all but three of Ellsworth\u2019s claims were procedurally barred by his failure to raise them on appeal or waived by his guilty plea. As to the three claims that it addressed on the merits, the district court concluded that Ellsworth had failed to show that his attorney provided ineffective assistance at sentencing, had failed to demonstrate that his guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary, and had failed to show that the government had breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-23\">To be entitled to a COA, Ellsworth must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). Ellsworth can make the requisite showing by demonstrating that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Upon consideration of Ells-worth\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, and <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and the entire record on appeal, this court concludes that Ellsworth has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated May 2, 2002. Considerations of judicial economy counsel against repeating the thorough and comprehensive analysis of Ellsworth\u2019s petition set out in the district court order. Accordingly, this court GRANTS Ellsworth permission to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>DENIES his application for a COA, and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
