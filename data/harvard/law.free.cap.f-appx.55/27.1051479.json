Fallon, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s (Casey <em>J.) </em>confirmation of a New York Stock Exchange arbitral panel\u2019s ruling, which denied Fallon\u2019s challenge to the forfeiture condition on certain deferred-compensation \u201cbonus\u201d awards paid by his former employer, Salomon Smith Barney. The district court found the awards not to be \u201cwages\u201d within the meaning of New York labor law (which prohibits the forfeiture of earned wages), and accordingly refused to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 decision. We need not reach the question of whether the awards are wages, however, because where, as here, an arbi-tral panel declines to explain its ruling, the courts must confirm the arbitration award \u201c[i]f there is even a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.\u201d <em>Willem-ijn Houdstermaatschappij, BV v. Standard Microsystems Corp., </em>103 F.3d 9, 13 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having carefully studied the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that, in light of <em>Truelove v. Northeast Capital &amp; Advisory, Inc., </em>95 N.Y.2d 220, 715 N.Y.S.2d 366, 738 N.E.2d 770 (2000), there is a colorable argument for excluding Fal-lon\u2019s deferred compensation from the category of \u201cwages\u201d under New York labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-20\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
