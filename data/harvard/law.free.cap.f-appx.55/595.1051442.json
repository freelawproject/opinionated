Pena was convicted of importing MDMA into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a), and of possessing with intent to distribute MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Pena was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 27 months, followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Pena argues that (1) the government deprived him of due process by offering a pre-trial plea that was available for only one day, and (2) his lawyer rendered ineffective assistance by failing to review the pre-trial plea offer with him on a timely basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">(1) A criminal defendant has no enforceable rights in an unexecuted plea agreement. <em>See Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 507-08, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984) (\u201cA plea bargain standing alone is without constitutional significance.... It is the ensuing guilty plea that implicates the Constitution.\u201d); <em>see also, United States v. Carbone, </em>739 F.2d 45, 46 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201c[A] defendant has no constitutional right to have an executory plea agreement specifically enforced.\u201d). Having no enforceable interest in the unexecuted plea agreement, he cannot claim that his due process rights were violated when it was left open for only one day. <em>Cf. United States v. Pickering, </em>178 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201cIf a prosecutor wishes to offer a defendant an \u2018exploding\u2019 plea bargain with a short fuse, as the prosecutor did here, this decision is entirely within his or her prosecutorial discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">(2) To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, Pena must show both that his legal representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s failings. <em>United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 96 (2d Cir.2001). Pena did not contend in the district court and has not averred on appeal that he would have accepted the original plea agreement had it been adequately explained to him. He thus makes no showing that the result of the proceeding would have been different but for trial counsel\u2019s alleged inadequacy \u2014 an omission that is fatal to Pena\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. <em>See Aeid v. Bennett, </em>296 F.3d 58 (2d Cir.2002) (affirming state court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the ground that \u201cfailure to allege that correct advice from defense counsel could have altered the defendant\u2019s decision\u201d was a \u201ccritical omission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
