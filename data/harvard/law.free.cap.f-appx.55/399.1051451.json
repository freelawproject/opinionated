Two months later, he filed a motion to withdraw his plea, which the District Court denied. In this appeal, Hughes presents one issue: whether the search of his girlfriend\u2019s apartment was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-23\">Because an unconditional guilty plea forecloses a defendant\u2019s right to challenge any of the prosecution\u2019s case, jurisdictional challenges excepted, we cannot review the constitutionality of the search of his girlfriend\u2019s apartment. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>12 F.3d 836, 839 (8th Cir.1994). Hughes could have preserved his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion had he entered a conditional guilty plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">Even if Hughes had not waived his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion by entering an unconditional plea of guilty, there is no merit to his claim that the search of his girlfriend\u2019s apartment violated his Fourth Amendment rights. We have carefully reviewed this claim and are satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the protective sweep of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>apartment was entirely reasonable. Given that Hughes was known to be linked to a violent street gang and that his girlfriend\u2019s apartment was unfamiliar territory to the officers, the officers had good reason to be concerned that another person or persons might be in the apartment posing a danger to the officers\u2019 safety. <em>See Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">By entering an unconditional guilty plea, Hughes waived his right to challenge the denial of his suppression motion. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-17\">. The Honorable Lyle E.
