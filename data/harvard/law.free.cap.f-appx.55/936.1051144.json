Bemus petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), which dismissed her appeal from a decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) on the basis that the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of her appeal. <em>Bemus v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>Docket No. CH-0870-02-0241-1-1 (May 6, 2002). The OPM denied Bemus\u2019s application for life insurance benefits accrued by her former spouse, Vernon Bemus, who died on September 7, 2001. The MSPB held that it lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s appeal because the relevant life insurance benefits, the ones accrued under the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act, are governed by Chapter 87 of Title 5, which does not come under the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d). <em>Bemus v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>Docket No. CH-0870-02-0241-1-1, slip op. at 2-3 (Feb. 28, 2002). The MSPB also found that OPM\u2019s error in informing the petitioner of a right to appeal to the MSPB did not confer jurisdiction on the MSPB. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Because the MSPB\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>sion is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)(1), we must <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The MSPB has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1) to review final decisions of OPM concerning rights and interests under the retirement statutes in Chapter 83 of Title 5. Life insurance benefits paid under the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act, as codified, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8701 <em>et seq., </em>however, are governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8714. Jurisdiction over claims based on Chapter 87 is expressly placed in the United States district courts and the Court of Federal Claims by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8715. <em>See Lewis v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>301 F.3d 1352, 1353-54 (Fed.Cir.2002) (holding that to the extent the petitioner alleged a breach by OPM of a duty to permit him to purchase additional life insurance, his appeal right lay in the Court of Federal Claims or the district courts, not with the MSPB). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8715 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">The district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of a civil action or claim against the United States founded on this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The jurisdiction over Bemus\u2019s Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act claim clearly does not he with the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">In addition, any misstatement by OPM cannot confer jurisdiction on the MSPB where, by law, there is none. The MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) is limited to agency actions that are made appealable to the MSPB by law, rule or regulation. <em>Cf. Anderson v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>12 F.3d 1069, 1071 (Fed. Cir.1993) (holding that because \u201cestoppel requires a forum\u201d so \u201cit cannot be used to build a forum,\u201d the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction may not be broadened on the basis of government error or misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">We therefore affirm the MSPB\u2019s dismissal of Bemus\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
