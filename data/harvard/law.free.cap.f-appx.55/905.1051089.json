DeVeau seeks review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because Mr. De-Veau\u2019s allegations were not within the scope of appeal rights accorded an employee terminated during a probationary period, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">A probationary employee may appeal his termination to the Board only in limited circumstances. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806; <em>Pierce v. Gov\u2019t Printing Office, </em>70 F.3d 106, 108 (Fed.Cir.1995). First, such an employee may appeal a termination that he \u201calleges was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b). Second, when the employee\u2019s termination is based on conditions arising before his appointment, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805, the employee may appeal on the ground that the termination was not effected in accordance with certain procedural requirements. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">Mr. DeVeau\u2019s appeal to the Board does not come within these narrow circumstances. The Navy terminated Mr. De-Veau based on his inability to be granted a security clearance within a reasonable period. Under Board precedent, denial of a security clearance during an employee\u2019s probationary period is not a pre-appointment reason for termination within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(c). <em>See Von Deneen v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>33 M.S.P.R. 420, 423, <em>affd, </em>837 F.2d 1098 (Table) (Fed.Cir.1987). Furthermore, Mr. DeVeau has not made a non-frivolous allegation that his termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">On appeal to this court, Mr. DeVeau does not challenge the findings underlying the Board\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Instead, he argues his case on the merits, contending that the Navy had no justification for denying his security clearance. Because the Board correctly dismissed Mr. DeVeau\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, however, neither the Board nor this court may address the merits of his case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
