Bruce seeks review of the final decision of the Merit System Protection Board (Board), which denied his appeal of his removal from a sensitive agency position. The Board concluded that no new, previously unavailable evidence was presented on appeal, and that the administrative judge made no error in law or regulation that affects the outcome of this case. This court <em>affirms </em>the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-38\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-39\">Mr. Bruce was employed by the Defense Logistics Agency (Agency) as a GS-6 Electronic Duplicating System Technician, a sensitive position requiring a security clearance. The Agency removed Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Bruce from this position because he lost his security clearance. Mr. Bruce appealed the Agency\u2019s decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">On May 2, 2002, based upon a review of the administrative record and relying upon <em>Department of Navy v. Egan, </em>484 U.S. 518, 108 S.Ct. 818, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988), the administrative judge affirmed the Agency\u2019s decision. In making this determination, the administrative judge held that the Board lacks authority to review the substance of an underlying security clearance determination in an adverse action appeal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. This statute provides a number of procedural protections to agency employees subject to removal, including notice, an opportunity to respond, representation by counsel and a written decision. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 (2000). The administrative judge found that Mr. Bruce\u2019s security clearance was revoked, that it was a condition of his employment, and that he was afforded the requisite procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Mr. Bruce petitioned the Board to reconsider its unfavorable initial decision. The Board denied this petition, making the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision final on August 12, 2002. This appeal followed. Jurisdiction for this court to consider this appeal is afforded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">This court\u2019s scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, this court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Board has no authority to review the substance of an underlying security clearance determination in an adverse action appeal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 involving the denial or revocation of a security clearance. <em>See Egan, </em>484 U.S. at 530-31. According to <em>Egan, </em>the Board\u2019s review is limited to determining whether the agency provided an employee removed for cause with the procedural protections required under \u00a7 7513. When a petitioner challenges an adverse agency action based on a security clearance determination, the Board may determine only: (1) whether a security clearance was denied; (2) whether petitioner\u2019s position required the security clearance; and (3) whether the statutory procedures with respect to adverse actions were followed. <em>Hesse v. Department of State, </em>217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Mr. Bruce does not dispute that his security clearance was revoked. Moreover, Mr. Bruce does not dispute that his position was designated as noncritical sensitive, and that he was required to possess a security clearance to serve in this position. While Mr. Bruce argues \u201cthe clearance matter was unimportant for my removal,\u201d the Board found that the agency removed Mr. Bruce because he no longer met a mandatory condition of employment absent his security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Mr. Bruce only asserts as reversible error a violation of procedural process under \u00a7 7513. Mr. Bruce argues he was denied priority placement or other \u201chelp\u201d in \u201crestoring his employment.\u201d This court understands these arguments to contend that the Agency did not offer Mr. Bruce a reassignment. However, the Board noted that, in order to prove entitlement to reassignment to a non-sensitive position, an appellant must show that the agency has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>policy, manifested by regulations, requiring such reassignment. <em>Hesse, </em>217 F.3d at 1381. Mr. Bruce provided no such evidence to the Board. The Board properly considered and denied Mr. Bruce\u2019s appeal in view of the criteria set forth in <em>Hesse, </em>accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
