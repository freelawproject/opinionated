An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Patterson has not made the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>showing. <em>See Patterson v. Rushton, </em>No. CA-01-1984-9-17BG (D.S.C. Sept. 26, 2002). <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
