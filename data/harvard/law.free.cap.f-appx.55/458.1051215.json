We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Getachew v. INS, </em>25 F.3d 841, 845 (9th Cir.1994), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">Rodriguez-Solomon contends the IJ denied him due process by refusing to calendar a hearing for his withholding of removal application and finding him ineligible for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">To prevail on a due process challenge to removal proceedings, Rodriguez-Solomon must show error and substantial prejudice. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000). Rodriguez-Solomon\u2019s answers to the IJ, which were consistent with his answers in his application for withholding of removal, showed no possibility that he was eligible for the relief he sought. Thus, Rodriguez-Solomon suffered no prejudice from the alleged violation because it could not have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, his due process challenge fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b501-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
