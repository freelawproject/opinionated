Fisher opposes. S&amp;G replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-28\">S&amp;G sued Fisher for declaratory judgments of patent noninfringement, invalidity, and unenforceability. S&amp;G also alleged violations of the Lanham Act and sought damages due to unfair competition and other state law claims. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>granted in part S&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary-judgment that the patent was unenforceable, granted S&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary judgment of a Lanham Act violation, granted S&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary judgment on S&amp;G\u2019s unfair competition claim, and granted S&amp;G\u2019s motion for summary judgment on S&amp;G\u2019s claim regarding tor-tious interference with a business advantage claim. Fisher appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">S&amp;G argues that Fisher\u2019s appeal is premature because the district court has not entered a final judgment and because damages due to unfair competition have not been determined. We agree. Although the parties disagree what proceedings may be held at the district court after dismissal of this appeal, at this stage there is no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">(1) S&amp;G\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
