On appeal, he asserts that the district court erroneously applied United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.1 at sentencing. In addition, he claims that the district court misunderstood its departure authority under Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3 and thus failed to grant his motion for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">After careful review of the record, in particular the sentencing transcript, we conclude that the court properly applied the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, at sentencing. To that extent, we affirm the sentence. We also agree with the United States that the district court denied the departure motion in an exercise of its discretion and not based on any misapprehension of authority. Thus, we may not review its decision. <em>See United States v. DeLeon, </em>187 F.3d 60, 69 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1030, 120 S.Ct. 551, 145 L.Ed.2d 428 (1999) (\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018no appeal lies from a discretionary refusal to depart\u2019 from the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
