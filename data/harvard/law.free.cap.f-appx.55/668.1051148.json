On appeal, Jackson asserts the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim on appeal, we must sustain the verdict if the record contains \u201csubstantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Applying this standard, we give due regard to the fact finder\u2019s prerogative to resolve questions of credibility. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996). With these principles in mind, we conclude the Government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find Jackson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Jackson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
