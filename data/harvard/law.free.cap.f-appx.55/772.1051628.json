This finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, makes it impossible to show that the district judge erred when finding by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant is responsible for five kilos. See <em>United States v. </em>Bequette, 309 F.3d 448 (7th Cir. 2002). Because this appeal is controlled by that recent decision, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to waive oral argument. On the authority of Bequette, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
