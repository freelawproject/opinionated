Oalden, former State Trooper LeRoy Ricksy, and Superintendent of New York State Police James W. McMahon, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, etc. McAleavey challenges trial rulings that (1) allowed the defense to elicit from MeAleav-ey his prior conviction for assault; (2) excluded evidence of a prior excessive force allegation brought against one defendant, and (3) excluded evidence of a defendant\u2019s termination from the state police for drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">We grant the district court broad discretion in regard to evidentiary rulings, and reverse only for abuse of that discretion. <em>See Silverstein v. Chase, </em>260 F.3d 142, 145 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">(1) Under Fed.R.Evid. 609, a witness\u2019s credibility may be attacked with evidence of a prior conviction punishable by imprisonment of more than one year if the conviction is not more than ten years old. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(a) &amp; (b); <em>United States v. Hourihan, </em>66 F.3d 458, 464 (2d Cir.1995). McAleavey\u2019s argument that his conviction is <em>almost </em>ten years old is frivolous. True, the district court calculated the age of the conviction from the date when McAleav-ey\u2019s parole was completed, rather than the date he was sentenced (the proper date if the sentence does not include imprisonment). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(b). However, the conviction was less than ten years old under either calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the evidence admissible under Rule 403. Most of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>prejudice cited by McAIeavey flows from the actions of his own counsel. Although counsel made a general objection during McAleavey\u2019s cross examination to an inquiry into McAleavey\u2019s \u201cfelony problems,\u201d counsel failed to object to a question regarding McAleavey\u2019s prior \u201cassault\u201d \u2014 and counsel himself elicited the most damaging testimony, regarding the circumstances of the assault, on redirect. Concerning the admission of the existence of a prior felony conviction, McAIeavey had the burden of demonstrating that the conviction\u2019s probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. The relevant circumstances include (1) when McAIeavey committed the crime, (2) when he was sentenced, and (3) when he completed his parole, all of which the court knew. While the court overstated the significance of the third and understated the significance of the second for purposes of Rule 609\u2019s bright line rule, the ruling that the conviction was admissible under Rule 403 was easily within the bounds of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">(2) McAIeavey argues that the evidence of defendant\u2019s past conduct was probative of a motive and intention to act \u201cmaliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d Br. for Plaintiff at 17. This argument \u201camounts to no more than a veiled attempt to do what Rule 404(b) expressly prohibits \u2014 introducing evidence of bad acts to show the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit such acts.\u201d <em>See Berko-vich v. Hicks, </em>922 F.2d 1018, 1022 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">(3) The defendant\u2019s failure of a random drug test (seventeen months after the alleged use of excessive force) had no appreciable bearing on the issues before the jury. Exclusion of that evidence was well within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
