We have reviewed the record and conclude that because Linton failed to obtain authorization to file a second or successive application for writ of habeas corpus before filing his motion in the district court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255. Moreover, we find that Linton is not entitled to a certificate of appealability. <em>See generally Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
