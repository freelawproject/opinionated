After increasing Ward\u2019s base offense level for abusing a position of public or private trust, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 5 months imprisonment and 5 months home detention, 3 years supervised release, and restitution of $49,944.01. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in applying the abuse-of-trust increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">The district court did not err. Ward occupied a position of trust \u2014 which he abused \u2014 with respect to Medicare, because he was able to defraud Medicare by certifying that in his professional judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>treatment was medically necessary and had been provided. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, comment, (n.l); <em>United States v. Hodge, </em>259 F.3d 549, 556-57 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hoogenboom, </em>209 F.3d 665, 671 (7th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rut-gard, </em>116 F.3d 1270, 1293 (9th Cir.1997). Further, having reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-24\">.
