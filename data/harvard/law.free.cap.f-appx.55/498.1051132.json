ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">These consolidated appeals are generally related to the appeal in <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>814 F.3d 1180 (10th Cir.2002), in which we recently affirmed the district court\u2019s approval of a settlement of a group of cases arising out of litigation concerning the production of CO2 contained within the McElmo Dome Unit in Colorado. In these appeals, appellants Harry Ptasynski and Bridwell Oil Co. appeal the denial of their motions to intervene in two of those actions which were the subject of the settlement: <em>CO2 Claims Coalition, LLC v. Shell Oil Co., </em>No. 96-Z-2451 (D. Colo, filed Oct. 22, 1996) and <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>No. 00-Z-1854 (D. Colo, filed Sept. 22, 2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Ptasynski and Bridwell were owners of overriding royalty interests (\u201cORIOs\u201d) in the McElmo Dome Unit and, as such, were part of the <em>C02 Claims Coalition </em>lawsuit from the beginning. The <em>Rutter &amp; Wil-banks </em>lawsuit sought to represent a class of McElmo Dome ORIOs alleging essentially the same claims regarding the pricing of C02 as were alleged in the <em>C02 Claims Coalition </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In August, 2001, Ptasynski and Bridwell moved to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 23 and 24 in <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks Corp., </em>and moved to intervene as plaintiffs \u25a0under Rule 24 in the <em>C02 Claims Coalition </em>case. The district court denied these motions on multiple grounds: the motions were untimely, Ptasynski\u2019s and Bridwell\u2019s interests, to the extent they were impaired at all were impaired \u201cby their own actions\u201d and, in any event, were cured by their decision to opt out of the settlement, the Texas actions they have thus far unsuccessfully pursued against the same defendants and alleging essentially the same claims raise potential res judicata problems, and their allegations in support of their claim that Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys cannot adequately represent them are conclusory and nonmeritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">The September 2001 settlement agreement settling the <em>C02 Claims Coalition </em>action and the <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks </em>action gave Ptasynski and Bridwell the right to opt out of the settlement. On December 4, 2001, Ptasynski and Bridwell filed these appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of their motions to intervene. In January 2002, they exercised their right to opt out of the settlement, and specifically reserved all of their claims. <em>See </em>Defendants-Appel-lees\u2019 SuppApp. at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">As indicated, Ptasynski has also been pursuing an action against the same defendants (Shell Oil Co. and Mobil Oil Co.) in Texas alleging essentially the same claims concerning underpayment of royalties on C02 gas production on the McElmo Dome Unit. His co-plaintiff in that case is the W.L. Gray Co. (\u201cGray\u201d), the denial of whose motion to intervene in <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks </em>we simultaneously affirm. <em>See Rutter &amp; Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>314 F.3d 1180 (10th Cir.2002). That Texas action was filed in May 1997, proceeded to trial in August 1999, and resulted in judgment for Shell and Mobil on all Ptasynski\u2019s and Gray\u2019s claims except a claim for negligent misrepresentation. In February 2002, the Fifth Circuit reversed the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment for Ptasynski on the negligent misrepresentation claim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>affirmed the judgment in favor of Shell and Mobil on all other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Bridwell has similarly been involved in extensive litigation in various Texas courts, most of which has resulted in rulings adverse to it and in favor of Shell and Mobil. On August 29, 2002, the Texas Supreme Court held that an action involving Brid-well, which had been transferred to the probate court of Denton County, Texas, had been improperly transferred. Gerald O. Bailey has been a co-defendant and co-plaintiff with Bridwell in a number of these Texas actions. We have simultaneously affirmed the denial of Bailey\u2019s motion to intervene in <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks </em>along with Gray\u2019s. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendants and Plaintiffs in this case argue that Ptasynski and Bridwell lack standing: \u201cAppellants seek to intervene in the <em>Coalition </em>and <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks </em>lawsuits in order to pursue their claims for allegedly underpaid overriding royalties for McElmo Dome C02. Because those cases have been settled and Appellants have elected to opt out of the settlement, however, these appeals must be dismissed for lack of standing.\u201d Defendants-Appel-lees\u2019 Answer Br. at 7. Alternatively, assuming appellants have standing, Plaintiffs and Defendants argue the trial court correctly denied their motions to intervene because they satisfy none of the requirements for intervention under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We first consider Plaintiffs\u2019 and Defendants\u2019 argument that Ptasynski and Brid-well lack standing at this point to pursue this appeal. Plaintiffs and Defendants argue that, having opted out of the settlement of the cases with respect to which Ptasynski and Bridwell sought intervention, they thereby lost their standing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">It is well settled that, in order to show standing necessary to invoke federal court jurisdiction, a party must demonstrate three things:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">(1) \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d by which we mean an invasion of a legally protected interest that is \u201c(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d; (2) a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, by which we mean that the injury \u201cfairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,\u201d and has not resulted \u201cfrom the independent action of some third party not before the court\u201d; and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision, by which we mean that the \u201cprospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of a favorable ruling\u201d is not \u201ctoo speculative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-11\"><em>In re Integra Realty Res., Inc., </em>262 F.3d 1089, 1101 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Northeastern Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, </em>508 U.S. 656, 663-64, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993)). In <em>In re Integra, </em>we held that parties who had opted out of a settlement lacked standing to challenge the settlement because they \u201clack[ed] any legally protected interest that could support the \u2018injury in fact\u2019 element necessary to demonstrate standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1102; <em>see also In re: Vitamins Antitrust Class Actions, </em>215 F.3d 26 (D.C.Cir.2000) (holding that presumptive class members who had opted out of a settlement had no standing to challenge a specific clause in the settlement). We, and other courts, have recognized a narrow exception to this where nonsettling parties can demonstrate that they will suffer \u201c \u2018plain legal prejudice,\u2019 as when \u2018the settlement strips the party of a legal claim or cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Integra, </em>262 F.3d at 1102 (quoting <em>Mayfield v. Barr, </em>985 F.2d 1090, 1093 (D.C.Cir. 1993)) (further quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>We have also held that \u201ca plaintiff must maintain standing at all times throughout the litigation for a court to retain jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Powder River Basin Res. Council v. Babbitt, </em>54 F.3d 1477, 1485 (10th Cir. 1995). Other courts have suggested that the issue is more properly framed as one of mootness: \u201cwhile it is true that a plaintiff must have a personal interest at stake throughout the litigation of a case, such interest is to be assessed under the rubric of standing at the commencement of the case, and under the rubric of mootness thereafter.\u201d <em>Becker v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>230 F.3d 381, 386 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2000); <em>see also Steger v. Franco, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Whether framed as an issue of standing or mootness, we agree with Plaintiffs and Defendants that Ptasynski and Bridwell no longer have the requisite personal interest in this action. They seek intervention in two cases which have now settled, and the validity of that settlement has been affirmed on appeal. During the pendency of these appeals from the denial of their motions to intervene, they opted out of that settlement and are, in fact, pursuing their individual claims in Texas courts. They therefore lack any personal stake or interest in the settlement and, more particularly, in the cases which were the object of that settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Alternatively, were they able to identify some interest sufficient to avoid a conclusion of mootness or lack of standing, we would affirm the district court\u2019s denials of their motions to intervene, for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s written orders denying those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
