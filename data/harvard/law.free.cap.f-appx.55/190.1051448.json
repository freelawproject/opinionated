California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he raises the issue of whether the district court correctly applied the Sentencing Guidelines. The mandatory statutory minimum for conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base is twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) (2000). Therefore, the district court did not err by sentencing Williams to a term of 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
