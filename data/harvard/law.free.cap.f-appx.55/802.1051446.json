Blossom Wang, M.D., sued Hawaii Medical Service Association (\u201cHMSA\u201d) and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\u201cBCBSA\u201d) alleging violations of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court granted BCBSA\u2019s motion to dismiss Wang\u2019s Second Amended Complaint, granted HMSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Wang\u2019s cross motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ment as moot and dismissed the case. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The district court properly granted HMSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Neither party claims that there are disputed issues <em>of </em>material fact, and Wang has failed to demonstrate the state action and compulsion necessary to support her First and Fourteenth Amendment claims. HMSA is not a state actor, and its behavior and any relationship it has to the government or governmental regulation do not constitute state action under any relevant theories. <em>Brentwood Academy v. Tenn. Secondary School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>531 U.S. 288,. 296, 121 S.Ct. 924, 148 L.Ed.2d 807 (2001) (listing seven approaches to the issue). Wang\u2019s payments to HMSA are not compelled, and her circumstances are not analogous to those cases in which individuals have been required to pay dues or fees as conditions of employment or education. <em>Cf. Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, </em>431 U.S. 209, 235-36, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The district court also properly granted BCBSA\u2019s motion to dismiss. Wang\u2019s Second Amended Complaint conclusorily stated that BCBSA is a \u201cState actor\u201d but failed to allege facts that could support such a finding. <em>See Navarro v. Block, </em>250 F.3d 729, 732, (9th Cir.2001) (Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is proper in the face of \u201cno cognizable legal theory\u201d or an \u201cabsence of sufficient facts alleged to support a cognizable legal theory\u201d) (citation omitted). Additionally, Wang did not allege that BCBSA compelled Wang\u2019s health plan membership or payment of fees. Wang\u2019s attempt to tie BCBSA to Wang through HMSA fails; BCBSA\u2019s relationship to HMSA is distinguishable from a local union\u2019s relationship to state and national labor organizations. <em>Cf. Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Ass\u2019n, </em>500 U.S. 507, 524, 111 S.Ct. 1950, 114 L.Ed.2d 572 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Accordingly, the district corut\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
