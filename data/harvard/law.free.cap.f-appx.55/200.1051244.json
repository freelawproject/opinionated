We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Wright v. Raleigh Police Dep\u2019t, </em>No. CA-02-392-5-BO(3) (E.D.N.C. Sept. 4, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
