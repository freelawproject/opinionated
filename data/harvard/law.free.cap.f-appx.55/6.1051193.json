The district court summarily denied petitioner\u2019s motion. In his motion, petitioner maintains that his convictions and sentence were illegal based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and other arguments. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-25\">The writ of coram nobis is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d which may be issued only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>under circumstances that compel such action \u201cto achieve justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 511, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954); <em>see United States v. Michaud, </em>925 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1991). In general, the writ of coram nobis is not available to a petitioner when another statutory remedy exists. <em>See United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 34, 54 (1st Cir.1999); <em>see also Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (\u201cWhere a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u201d). Because petitioner is currently in custody for the convictions at issue, he may seek relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Barrett, </em>178 F.3d at 54-55; <em>see Matus-Leva v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 758, 761 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -., 123 S.Ct. 544, 154 L.Ed.2d 431 (2002). Because a \u00a7 2255 petition is available to him, the writ of coram nobis is not. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Petitioner argues that he is barred from seeking relief under \u00a7 2255. He may not resort to coram nobis, however, merely because he cannot meet the AEDPA\u2019s requirements. <em>See Barrett, </em>178 F.3d at 55 (stating that \u201c[t]he writ of coram nobis may not be used to circumvent the clear congressional directive embodied in the \u2018second or successive\u2019 provisions of \u00a7 2255\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s coram nobis motion is no different from a second \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
