Brown, </em>No. 00-7254, 2000 WL 1707272 (4th Cir. Nov. 15, 2000) (unpublished). In the alternative, Brown requests that this court allow him to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). In his petition, Brown alleges that his conviction and sentence are unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and this court\u2019s cases applying <em>Apprendi. </em>Brown has failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying recall of the mandate. <em>See Calderon v. Thompson, </em>523 U.S. 538, 549-50, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998). Moreover, we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See San-Miguel v. Dove, </em>291 F.3d 257, 261 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny Brown\u2019s petition for writ of error. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
