Because Harrison only raises claims that are identical to those raised in his first habeas petition or that could have been raised in that petition, Harrison\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was actually a successive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. As the district court stated in denying Harrison\u2019s motion, Harrison failed to comply with the statutory procedures governing successive petitions. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>Criminal No: 2:97-00143-04 (S.D.W.Va. July 24, 2002). We agree. Harrison is not entitled to a certificate of appealability from this determination because he cannot make <em>\u201ca </em>substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). <em>See also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
