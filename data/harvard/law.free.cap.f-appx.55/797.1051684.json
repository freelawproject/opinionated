Having reviewed the record in this highly fact-bound case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion and that an extended opinion would have no precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The judgment is affirmed. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as moot is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. The Honorable Michael J. Melloy, then a United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa, now a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
