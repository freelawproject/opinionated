Following initial and reconsideration denials, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) held a hearing on November 30, 1998, and issued an unfavorable decision to the claimant. The Appeals Council denied the claimant\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ decision the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">Plaintiff then filed this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The District Court entered an order granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the appellant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment. The appellant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-22\">The facts are well-known to the parties and we refer to them only briefly. On appeal, the claimant presents three issues, each of which was raised in the District Court: (1) whether the Commissioner is bound by the treating physician\u2019s opinion where no contrary medical evidence exists; (2) whether the Commissioner failed to properly consider and credit claimant\u2019s ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>jective symptoms; and (3) whether the finding that the claimant can perform light work is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Our standard of review is limited to determining whether the District Court properly found that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. We do not undertake de novo review or determine questions of credibility. This is the same standard of review that governs the District Court\u2019s judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The District Court carefully reviewed the record in this case and each of the contentions raised by the appellant. The District Court found each of Orr\u2019s arguments unpersuasive. Specifically, the court concluded that the ALJ\u2019s stated reasons for rejecting Dr. Shaheen\u2019s opinion that plaintiff is totally disabled were proper and supported by substantial evidence. The District Court noted that after examining each of Dr. Shaheen\u2019s letter opinions that they were inconsistent. His statement, dated January 29, 1998, which was prepared in connection with claimant\u2019s application for disability retirement from his employment with Blair County, showed that claimant suffered from heart disease and stress syndrome, rendering him disabled as of January 8,1998. However, the court observed that in the same statement, Dr. Shaheen noted that the claimant had a slight limitation of functional capacity and was capable of performing light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Shortly after this statement, the claimant underwent further testing for his complaints of chest discomfort and, based on the result of those tests, his cardiologist reported to Dr. Shaheen that plaintiff continued to do \u201cquite well\u201d following his heart surgery, and that there was no evidence that his complaints of chest discomfort were cardiac in origin. On April 8, 1998, Dr. Shaheen wrote a letter stating that he was treating the claimant for stress syndrome that rendered him disabled \u201cat that time.\u201d The District Court again observed that this statement by the doctor failed to mention plaintiffs ankle injury or heart disease. In a \u201cdaily activities questionnaire\u201d prepared by the claimant two months later, he reported very little, if any, limitations on his activities of daily living. Finally, the Court noted that on December 4, 1998, in another letter prepared by Dr. Shaheen, the doctor stated that claimant was totally disabled due to the limitations in his ability to walk and stand as a result of the residuals of a gunshot wound to his right ankle thirty years before, and his open heart surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The District Court found that these limitations are not supported by objective medical evidence and are inconsistent with the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living as reported by the <em>claimant </em>himself. Moreover, the Court noted that in this letter \u201cDr. Shaheen [nowhere mentions] plaintiffs stress syndrome, which was the primary reason given by plaintiff at the hearing before the ALJ or his claim that he could no longer perform his work as a hearing officer for Blair County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">On examining the record, the District Court found that the ALJ in his decision noted that the claimant had never been diagnosed with an anxiety or stress disorder by a mental health professional and that this condition had been treated solely by Dr. Shaheen with medication. According to Orr, the medication does not produce any side effects, and Dr. Shaheen had never recommended any other type of treatment to control Orr\u2019s anxiety because the doctor believed that the medication was \u201ckeeping things under control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The District Court, therefore, concluded that the ALJ was not bound by Dr. Sha-heen\u2019s opinion that plaintiff became totally disabled as of January 8, 1998. We agree. In addition, the District Court observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>that there was other evidence of record to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that the claimant was not totally disabled. Specifically, the Court referred to three medical consultants who completed Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessments in connection with plaintiffs application for disability insurance benefits wherein they asserted that plaintiff could perform light work. Another medical consultant completed a Psychiatric Review Technique Form in which he concluded that the plaintiff had no medically determinable impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">After reviewing the briefs and record in this case on appeal, we see no error of the District Court with respect to the issue raised on this appeal. The judgment is affirmed. Costs taxed against the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
