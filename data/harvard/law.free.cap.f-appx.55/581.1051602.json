The Complaint alleged that the transfer was a fraudulent conveyance in violation of Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 52-552f (count one) and Connecticut common law (count two). The District Court ruled in favor of defendants on count one and for plaintiff on count two, ordering Nella Reale to convey Antonio Reale\u2019s one-half undivided interest in the marital residence back to him because the transfer to his wife was a common law fraudulent conveyance. <em>See Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Rubin, </em>209 Conn. 437, 441, 551 A.2d 1220 (1988) (holding, in the context of the predecessor statute to the UFTA (Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-552), that \u201c[t]he common law tort action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of real property has not been statutorily excluded from \u00a7 52-577\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">On appeal, defendants appeal the judgment entered in count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The District Court conducted a thorough and well-reasoned analysis of both the facts and the relevant law, and it properly concluded that the defendants engaged in a common law fraudulent conveyance of the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">We have considered all of plaintiffs claims and found them to be without merit. We affirm the judgment of the District Court, substantially for the reasons stated in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, entered April 2, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
