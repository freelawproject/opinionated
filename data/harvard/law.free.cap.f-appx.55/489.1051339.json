Solis wishes to retroactively challenge his sentence in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">The district court construed Solis\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 petition and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Petitions filed under \u00a7 2255 must be filed in the district court where the petitioner was sentenced. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Although Petitioner was sentenced in the Western District of Michigan, this petition was filed in the Western District of Oklahoma. For substantially the same reasons as stated by the district court in its Order of June 6, 2002, dismissing the appeal, we DENY a certificate of appealability and AFFIRM the dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-19\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
