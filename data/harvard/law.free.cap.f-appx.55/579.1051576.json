The agreement contained a choice of venue clause that read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>as follows: \u201cThe sole jurisdiction for any legal proceedings under this Agreement shall be Santa Barbara, California.\u201d Thereafter, the plaintiff sent transparencies to the defendant accompanied by her own \u201cJob Delivery Memo.\u201d When the transparencies disappeared, the plaintiff brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking compensation for them under the terms of the Job Delivery Memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice on the grounds that the choice of venue provision of the parties\u2019 contract permitted such a suit to be brought only in a court in Santa Barbara, California. We agree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment and order of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
