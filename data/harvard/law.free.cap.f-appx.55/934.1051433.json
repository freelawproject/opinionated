Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss James S. Magdalen-ski\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Mag-dalenski opposes and requests permission to file a supplemental brief. Magdalenski submits a \u201cCounter Motion\u201d seeking \u201cdamages of $460,000 or greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-24\">Magdalenski, the son of the deceased veteran, appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>a February 24, 2000 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denying entitlement to accrued benefits based on a claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that the Board\u2019s factual determinations did not constitute clear error and Magdalenski \u201cfailed to show he is entitled to accrued benefits.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALe\">Because the veteran did not demonstrate that he experienced any injury or aggravation of an injury that resulted in disability or death, the Court agrees that \u201cthere is a plausible basis in the record\u201d to conclude that the veteran\u2019s case did not warrant benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-5\">More importantly, the appellant [Mag-dalenski] does not warrant benefits, because the veteran\u2019s death ended the claim, and because the appellant is not a proper claimant for accrued benefits. The veteran completed his appeal before he died. \u201c[Veterans\u2019 claims under chapter 11 (of the U.S.C.) do not survive their deaths.... \u201d It is true that certain parties may receive benefits to which the veteran was entitled at death.... To qualify, a child must be an unmarried individual who either is under 18; became incapable of self-support before reaching 18; or is between 18 and 23 and is \u201cpursing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution.\u201d .... The appellant, by his own admission, fits none of these categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, rejecting Magdalenski\u2019s contention \u201cthat the VA is essentially being \u2018deceptive\u2019 for treating this as an accrued benefits claim.\u201d The Court of Appeals for Veterans claims stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-7\">[T]his is clearly a claim for accrued benefits. This appeal originated when the appellant filed the [application for accrued benefits]. Also, the appellant\u2019s representative, in the appellant\u2019s presence, asserted that this case is to adjudicate the appellant\u2019s claims regarding \u201centitlement to approved benefits based on the veteran\u2019s claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151.\u201d.... The appellant cannot, at this point, assert that his claim is something other than the claim for accrued benefits decided by the Board on February 24, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Magdelenski appealed. In his informal brief, numerous papers and correspondence, Magdalenski alleges that this court should award him the damages his father, the deceased veteran, sought in a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) complaint, which was dismissed based on the statute of limitations. <em>See Magdalenski v. United States Government, </em>977 F.Supp. 66 (D.Mass. 1997). He also asks this court to direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to reopen a wrongful death claim he filed under the FTCA, which previously settled. In general, Magdalenski states \u201c[t]he nature of the case is the violations of Constitutional procedural due process and the violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) of my father\u2019s Medical Malpractice, along with his Federal Tort claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). The statute provides that a party may obtain a review of a Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision with respect to the validity of the decision on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation \u201cor any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter).\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). The statute further dictates that this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The Board decision from which Magdal-enski appealed dealt only with the issue of Magdalenski\u2019s entitlement to accrued benefits and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims therefore limited its review to such matters. Magdalenski\u2019s arguments fail to address any reviewable issue concerning entitlement to accrued benefits and do not otherwise invoke this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 factual determinations pertaining to entitlement to accrued benefits and application of the law governing accrued benefits to the facts of this ease are not within our jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Because our review is limited to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision, we cannot consider issues pertaining to extraneous proceedings. Therefore, Magdalenski\u2019s appeal is not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">(3) Magdalenski\u2019s \u201ccounter motion\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">(4) Magdalenski\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">(5) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
