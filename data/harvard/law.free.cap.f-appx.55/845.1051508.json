We conclude that Wilson\u2019s petition was timely filed. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-26\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) imposes a one-year statute of limitation on habeas petitions filed in federal court by state prisoners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The AEDPA also provides tolling for \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The Supreme Court recently held that, for purposes of applying \u00a7 2244(d)(2) to California\u2019s collateral review system, \u201cpending\u201d includes an interval between the state court\u2019s disposition of a state habeas petition and the filing of a petition at the next state appellate level. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2140, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The district court ruled that Wilson\u2019s eight-month delay between state court filings was unreasonable and beyond the \u201couter limit of appropriate pursuit.\u201d We note, however, that the California Supreme Court denied Wilson\u2019s state habeas corpus petition on the merits rather than as untimely, supporting a conclusion that Wilson is \u201centitled to tolling ... for the period in question.\u201d <em>See Saffold v. Carey, </em>312 F.3d 1031, 1036 (9th Cir.2002), <em>amended by </em>\u2014 F.3d \u2014 , 2003 WL 112449 (9th Cir. Jan. 14, 2003) (order denying rehearing). Moreover, Wilson offered a justification for the delay at issue, namely, that he was diligently seeking state court transcripts. Although the district court questioned both Wilson\u2019s right and need for such transcripts, we cannot agree with the district court that Wilson \u201cwasted time\u201d seeking transcripts or that he had the burden to \u201cexplain[ ] how he needed the transcripts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Given the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial on the merits and the apparent reasonableness of Wilson\u2019s attempts to secure transcripts, we conclude that the time interval at issue in this case falls within the scope of \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of applying the tolling provision of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s federal petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b887-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
