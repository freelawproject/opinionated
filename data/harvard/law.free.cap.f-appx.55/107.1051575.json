She raises five issues on appeal, contending that (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict her of the firearm charge; (2) the district court erred in failing to submit a requested instruction to the jury; (3) the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress; (4) the district court clearly erred in declining to give her credit for acceptance of responsibility; and (5) the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a mistrial. Finding no merit to Flowers\u2019s claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">First, we find sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Flowers was an unlawful user of controlled substances at the time she possessed the firearm. A reviewing court must uphold a jury\u2019s verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We have reviewed the record and are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">We next address whether the district court should have given an expanded instruction to the jury regarding the definition of an unlawful user. The refusal to give a requested instruction is reversible error only if \u201cthe instruction (1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Squillacote, </em>221 F.3d 542, 564 (4th Cir.2000). We need not decide whether the first two requirements are met here because the third plainly is not. The evidence concerning Flowers\u2019s heroin use was compelling, and Flowers did not attempt to controvert it. Thus, the denial of her request for an instruction did not impair her ability to conduct her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Next, we find that the district court did not err in denying Flowers\u2019s motion to suppress. Although Flowers contends that the officers did not have authority to enter her residence without a warrant, we find that the district court correctly concluded that she consented to the officers\u2019 entry. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (noting that consent is a well-recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">We also find that the district court did not clearly err in denying Flowers an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 (2001). Flowers not only put the Government to its burden of proof at trial, but also consistently maintained that she is not an unlawful user of drugs and thus has never accepted responsibility for the firearms charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Finally, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Flowers\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Flowers objects to two statements made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Officer Howell during direct examination. Our review of the record reveals that Flowers cannot demonstrate that she was prejudiced by these statements. Where the jury acquits the defendant of at least some of the charges, we have found \u201cstrong evidence that the district court\u2019s denial of [her] motion for mistrial did not result in the type of prejudice that warrants reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>45 F.3d 809, 817 (4th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. West, </em>877 F.2d 281, 288 (4th Cir.1989) (same). Here, the jury acquitted Flowers of the most serious charge \u2014 maintaining a place for the distribution and storage of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Flowers\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately' presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
