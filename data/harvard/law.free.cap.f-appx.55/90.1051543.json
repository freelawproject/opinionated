This case arises from the rejection of the Partnership\u2019s request for a zoning variance on the land, by the appellee, the Board of Supervisors of Towamencin Township. The Partnership appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Board on the Partnership\u2019s \u00a7 1983 equal protection, substantive due process, and regulatory taking claims. Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Huang v. BP Amoco Corp., </em>271 F.3d 560, 564 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Inasmuch as the district court (Kauff-man, J.) has already set forth the underlying factual and procedural history of this case, we find it unnecessary to repeat that history here. <em>See Forty Foot Partnership v. Board of Supervisors, </em>No. 01-4135, 2002 LEXIS 11263 (E.D.Pa. January 3, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Moreover, the district court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, has carefully and completely expanded its reasons for denying Forty Foot Partnership the relief it seeks and granting summary judgment to the defendants. We need not engage in a redundant analysis simply to reach the same result. Accordingly, we will affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
