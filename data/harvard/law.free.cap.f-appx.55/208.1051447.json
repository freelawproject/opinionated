A petitioner may not appeal from the denial of relief on his \u00a7 2254 petition unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). Coward\u2019s petition was filed in April 2002, several years after the statutory limitations period expired for convictions that became final prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) (2000); <em>Brown v. Angelone, </em>150 F.3d 370, 374-76 (4th Cir.1998). Because the petition was not timely filed, Coward cannot meet the criteria for a certificate of appealability. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
