R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-25\">Wayne T. Felton, a military prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">In 1995, Mr. Felton was serving in the United States Army when he was court-martialed and subsequently convicted by a military court jury of attempted robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. Mr. Felton was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowance, and reduction in military rank. On Mr. Felton\u2019s appeal, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction. Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denied Mr. Felton\u2019s petition for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Mr. Felton later filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus in the district court for the District of Kansas. The district court dismissed the petition. In a separate order, the district court granted Mr. Felton\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) and denied Mr. Felton\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">A COA is not necessary to appeal a final order in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>See McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 810 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court unnecessarily reached the \u201cmerits\u201d of Mr. Felton\u2019s application for a COA. We turn then to Mr. Felton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\u201c[Fjederal courts have jurisdiction over applications for habeas corpus by persons incarcerated by the military courts.\u201d <em>Lips v. Commandant, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, </em>997 F.2d 808, 810-11 (10th Cir. 1993). However, \u201cthe military has its own independent criminal justice system governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. For that reason, \u201cin military habeas corpus the inquiry, the scope of matters open to review, has always been more narrow than in civil cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810-11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">\u201c[I]f the military gave full and fair consideration to claims asserted in a federal habeas corpus petition, the petition should be denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An issue has been given a \u201cfull and fair consideration\u201d by a military tribunal where it has been \u201cbriefed and argued,\u201d even if the military tribunal \u201csummarily disposed of the issue with the mere statement that it did not consider the issue meritorious or requiring discussion.\u201d <em>Watson v. McCotter, </em>782 F.2d 143, 145 (10th Cir.1986). In addition, federal courts \u201cwill not review petitioners\u2019 claims on the merits if they were not raised at all in the military courts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Even construing Mr. Felton\u2019s pro se appellate brief liberally, he does not satisfy these standards, focusing his argument on the issue of exhaustion, and on the substantive merits of his appeal. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s July 25, 2002 memorandum and order that each of the issues raised in Mr. Felton\u2019s petition for habeas corpus was either given full and fair consideration by the military courts or was never raised before the military courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Felton\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
