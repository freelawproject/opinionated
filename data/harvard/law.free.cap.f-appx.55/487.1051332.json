Mesa claims that ineffective assistance of counsel tainted his Arizona state conviction for first-degree murder and child abuse. He alleges that his attorney\u2019s failure to pursue or utilize potentially exculpatory medical information prejudiced his defense. The Arizona state court of appeals held that Mesa failed to establish ineffective assistance, and the district court denied habeas. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we recite them only as necessary. We review the denial of Mesa\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition <em>de novo. See Alva-rodo v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 <em>et seq., </em>narrowly limits federal ha-beas review of state court determinations. Section 2254(d) of the Act dictates that in order to obtain federal habeas relief, a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits resulted in a decision that was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established federal law, or was based on an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Here, the Arizona trial and appeal courts applied the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel articulated in <em>Arizona v. Amaya-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. 152, 800 P.2d 1260, 1288 (1990), an Arizona state decision which applied the same \u201cperformance\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d prongs set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690-93, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-22\">A federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus \u201csimply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Our review is narrowly limited to determining whether a state court\u2019s ruling contravenes federal law. <em>See Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 357, 358, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002)(per curiam), and <em>Early v. Packer, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 362, 364, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Under federal law, a petitioner can establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the outcome of the case. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. Where a petitioner cannot show prejudice, the court need not reach the performance prong. <em>Id. </em>at 697. In order to show prejudice, a defendant must establish a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The Arizona appeals court held that it was not reasonably probable that additional medical evidence on short distance falls would have altered the verdicts, as there was overwhelming evidence to support the testimony of the state\u2019s medical experts and the medical journal articles proffered by Mesa could have potentially hurt more than helped his case. Thus, in addition to holding that Mesa\u2019s counsel performed adequately in light of the evidence, the state court determined that Mesa failed to establish prejudice. The district court denied Mesa\u2019s habeas petition on the same grounds. The conclusion of the Arizona court of appeals was not unreasonable, so the federal district court acted properly in declining to grant habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b529-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
