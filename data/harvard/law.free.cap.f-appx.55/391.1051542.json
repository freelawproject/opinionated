At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied the Guidelines career-offender provision; denied Pelowski\u2019s motion for a downward departure, which had been based upon overrepresentation of his criminal history and also upon the circumstances of one of the convictions underlying his career-offender status; and sentenced Pelowski to 188 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. Pelowski appeals, arguing the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart downward based on the circumstances of his career-offender status as distinct from the over-representation of his general criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we find no indication the district court believed it lacked authority to depart downward on either basis. Consequently, Pelowski\u2019s appeal argument is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Correa, </em>167 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-23\">. The Honorable Lyle E.
