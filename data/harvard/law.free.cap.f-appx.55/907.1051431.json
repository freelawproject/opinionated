Fuentes petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming her removal from her position as Supervisory Paralegal Specialist based on her testing positive for illegal drug use. <em>Fuentes v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>Docket No. DA-0752-00-0129-1-2, slip op., 91 M.S.P.R. 129 (MSPB Jan. 8, 2002). Administrative Judge Cornelius found that Fuentes offered no <em>credible </em>explanation for why she asserted that her positive test results for amphetamines should not be considered adequate proof of \u201cillegal drug use\u201d as defined by Executive Order Number 12,-564, 51 Fed. Reg. 32,892 \u00a7 7 (Sept. 17, 1988),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or why she maintained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>agency did not properly consider all of the <em>Douglas </em>factors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before determining that removal was the appropriate penalty. <em>Fuentes v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>Docket No. DA-0752-00-0129-1-2, slip op. at 7,12 (MSPB Mar. 30, 2001). On appeal to the full board, the MSPB denied the petition for review. Because the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings were duly supported by substantial evidence and the penalty was reasonable, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">On appeal, a decision by the Board cannot be overturned unless it is found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1993). Fuentes tested positive for amphetamine use on March 1, 1999. There are, thus, two issues in this case: first, whether Fuentes\u2019 drug test should have been interpreted as proof of illegal drug use; and second, whether removal was an appropriate penalty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The Administrative Judge found Fuentes\u2019 only explanation for why she tested positive for amphetamines \u2014 that she was taking the medication Asenlix prescribed to her by a Mexican doctor \u2014 not credible. <em>Fuentes, </em>Docket No. DA-0752-00-0129-1-2, slip op. at 6 (MSPB Mar. 30, 2001). The Administrative Judge explained that \u201c[Fuentes\u2019] testimony was not direct and straightforward and many times she did not appear sure of her facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He also offered an extended list of facts that detracted from her explanation, including, for example, that she did not \u201cremember\u201d to disclose her use of Asenlix to the supervising physician even though she had no trouble remembering to disclose thirteen other medications, including some that she had supposedly taken much less recently. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. All of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings were well supported by substantial evidence, and the petitioner offers no cogent arguments for why the findings were erroneous. Instead, Fuentes argues that use of Asenlix procured by a prescription is not illegal. She ignores that the Administrative Judge disbelieved her explanation that Asenlix, taken pursuant to a valid prescription, caused her positive drug test. In light of that credibility assessment it is irrelevant whether \u201cillegal drugs\u201d includes drugs prescribed outside of this country. Fuentes\u2019 arguments are relevant only to issues the Administrative Judge never reached. Fuentes offers this court no logical or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>vincing reason to reverse the Board\u2019s decision on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Whether or not a penalty was reasonable we must leave to the sound discretion of the agency unless the Board\u2019s affirmance of the penalty is not supported by substantial evidence or the penalty amounts to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gonzales v. Def. Logistics Agency, </em>772 F.2d 887, 889 (Fed.Cir.1985) (holding that \u201cthe court will not disturb a penalty unless it exceeds the range of permissible punishment or is \u2018so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). We agree with the Board that the authorized penalty of removal does not exceed the limits of reasonableness under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Fuentes offers mitigating evidence but as the Administrative Judge found that the deciding official \u201cappropriately considered the <em>Douglas </em>factors under the circumstances of this case\u201d and offered a comprehensive summary of those circumstances, we see no error. <em>Fuentes, </em>Docket No. DA-0752-00-0129-1-2, slip op. at 12 (MSPB Mar. 30, 2001). Moreover, since \u201cthe law is well settled that an employee can be removed for off-duty possession and use of these illegal drugs,\u201d the nexus between the charge in this case and the efficiency of the service is indisputable. <em>Rice v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>998 F.2d 997, 999 (Fed.Cir.1993). The Board\u2019s holding that the penalty selected by the agency is reasonable and promotes the efficiency of the service is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-27\">.
