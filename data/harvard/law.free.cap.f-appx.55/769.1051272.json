Douglas\u2019s guilty plea, however, was conditional, allowing him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. On appeal he argues that the police lacked probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of his car. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">In September 2001 agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency enlisted \u201cD.J.\u201d to act as a confidential informant after he had been caught selling illegal narcotics. From September through November, D.J., who has a criminal record and a history of drug use, participated in several controlled drug purchases. During this time, he also provided information about various investigative targets, and his assistance led to several money seizures. One of D.J\u2019s controlled buys led to the December 2001 indictment of a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">In October D.J. told DEA agents that Douglas had sold large quantities of cocaine in the Madison area. According to D.J., Douglas would frequently drive to Chicago to pick up illegal narcotics, then return to Madison to deal. D.J. said that he had purchased multiple kilograms of narcotics from Douglas over the past year. Upon learning this information, agents set up a controlled buy in which D.J. purchased from Douglas three ounces of crack cocaine at Douglas\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-23\">On November 24, D.J. advised agent Craig Grywalski that Douglas had told him that he would be returning from Chicago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>that day with approximately one kilogram of cocaine. According to D.J., Douglas was planning to drive a black Expedition or Explorer along Interstate 90 from Chicago toward Madison that afternoon. After performing a records check, agents learned that Douglas\u2019s mother had a black Ford Expedition registered in her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Grywalski immediately contacted and briefed the Rock County Sheriffs Department, which placed an unmarked squad patrol car along Interstate 90. DEA agents located and tracked the SUV, and then relayed to the two awaiting deputy officers a description of the vehicle and its license plate number. After the SUV passed by, the deputies paced it, determined that it was exceeding the speed limit, and pulled it over.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">When confronted by the deputies, Douglas did not have identification or a driver\u2019s license. He identified himself as \u201cFrederick Douglas,\u201d his twin brother. The deputies then conducted a records check; \u201cFrederick Douglas\u201d did not have any outstanding warrants, but \u201cRoderick Douglas\u201d did. The deputies concluded that the driver was Roderick Douglas and arrested him on the outstanding warrants. They then searched the car and found one kilogram of cocaine under the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Douglas moved to suppress the evidence seized in the car on the ground that the warrantless search was not supported by probable cause. After Grywalski and the two patrol deputies testified at an eviden-tiary hearing, a magistrate judge concluded that the search was supported by probable cause and recommended denying the motion. Douglas filed objections, but the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">On appeal Douglas argues that the war-rantless inspection of his car violated his Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, police officers may stop and search cars without a warrant when they have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990). Probable cause exists where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a reasonably prudent person in believing that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). A finding of probable cause is based on probabilities, and need not rise to the level of certainty. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 231, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The district court properly concluded that there was probable cause to search the car. In <em>Gates </em>the Supreme Court held that a highly detailed tip from an anonymous informant that is corroborated by independent police work is sufficient to establish probable cause. <em>See id. </em>at 246, 103 S.Ct. 2317; <em>see also United States v. McClinton, </em>135 F.3d 1178, 1183 (7th Cir. 1998). In the present case, the informant was not only known to law enforcement, enhancing the information\u2019s reliability, <em>see Florida v. J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000), but he also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>had a proven track record of providing rehable information, including information leading to several controlled purchases (one, a successful buy from Douglas himself) and money seizures. <em>See United States v. Rucker, </em>138 F.3d 697, 700 (7th Cir.1998) (informant\u2019s past record of providing rehable information is relevant in estabhshing reliability of present information). Moreover, D.J\u2019s tip contained specific details about Douglas\u2019s future actions that were not easily predicted-he correctly earmarked the time and route of Douglas\u2019s return. <em>See McClinton, </em>135 F.3d at 1184. And the detailed information he provided about Douglas\u2019s trip was independently corroborated by the surveilhng agents and the deputies. <em>See United States v. Navarro, </em>90 F.3d 1245, 1252 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Douglas argues that D.J. lacked credibility because he was a known drug dealer and user with a criminal record. In evaluating an informant\u2019s credibility, this court considers (1) the informant\u2019s personal knowledge, (2) the degree of detail the informant provides, (3) independent police corroboration, and (4) testimony by the informant at the probable cause hearing. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>208 F.3d 603, 609 (7th Cir.2000). Here, all that was missing was D.J.\u2019s testimony. He was intimately familiar with Douglas\u2019s operation, having bought drugs from him on several occasions; his tip was highly detailed, accurately predicting the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d of Douglas\u2019s return; and law enforcement agents were able to verify his account at every step. D.J. was rehable and the war-rantless search was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">. The government focuses on whether D.J.\u2019s tip established probable cause. The magistrate judge rejected (and the government abandons on appeal) a simpler justification for the search of Douglas's car. He was speeding, which authorized the stop even though it was pretextual. And he had an outstanding warrant for which they arrested him. This custodial arrest permitted a search of the passenger compartment incident to the arrest. <em>See New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 460-61 n. 4, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
