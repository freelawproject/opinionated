R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Lawrence L. Kelly, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982. This court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Kelly filed the instant action against United States Magistrate Judge James P. O\u2019Hara, United States District Judge Richard D. Rogers, and the United States of America. The essence of Kelly\u2019s allegations is that Judge O\u2019Hara and Judge Rogers ruled in favor of certain defendants in a prior lawsuit brought by Kelly, even though, according to Kelly, his previous complaint was clearly meritorious. In its order dismissing the instant action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the district court patiently explained to Kelly that Judge O\u2019Hara and Judge Rogers were absolutely immune from suit for money damages. <em>See, e.g., M\u00edreles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (per cu-riam). The district court further explained that neither of the very narrow exceptions to absolute judicial immunity\u2014 the exception for nonjudicial actions and the exception for actions taken in complete absence of jurisdiction \u2014 were implicated by Kelly\u2019s allegations. <em>See generally id. </em>at 11-12. In particular, the district court noted that issuing pre-trial orders and granting summary judgment were clearly judicial functions and that the district court clearly had jurisdiction to hear and resolve the previous civil rights suit filed by Kelly which formed the basis of the allegations in the instant complaint. Finally, the district court explained that Kelly\u2019s allegation of bad faith on the part of the defendant judges was not sufficient to overcome judicial immunity. <em>See id. </em>at 11 (\u201cJudicial immunity is not overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice....\u201d); <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) (\u201c[I]mmunity applies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly.\u201d). As to Kelly\u2019s claims against the United States, the district court observed that the United States was immune from suit as a sovereign. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980). Furthermore, the United States had not waived its sovereign immunity for constitutional torts, <em>see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 410, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and Kelly had not identified any explicit waiver of immunity. Because Kelly could not amend his <em>pro se </em>complaint to overcome these infirmities, the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">In his brief on appeal, Kelly simply asserts, without any citation to authority, that \u201c[t]he Federal District Court can\u2019t stop me from sueing [sic] anyone. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Laws I used are adequate and appropriate.\u201d For those reasons ably set out in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal dated November 15th, 2002, this assertion is wrong. Upon close consideration of Kelly\u2019s brief on appeal and <em>de novo </em>review of both the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and the entire appellate record, this court AFFIRMS for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
