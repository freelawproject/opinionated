The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-23\">In his Rule 60(b) motion, Oglesby sought to relitigate the identical issues rejected by this court in the appeal from the denial of his second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Oglesby v. United States, </em>No. 95-6449, 1996 WL 470946 (6th Cir. Aug. 19, 1996). The district court denied the motion on the ground that civil rule 60(b) is not applicable in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-24\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision on grounds other than those employed by the district court. <em>Russ\u2019 Kwik Car Wash, Inc. v. Marathon Petroleum Co., </em>772 F.2d 214, 216 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-25\">Because we have rejected Oglesby claims previously on the merits, the law-of-the-case doctrine relieves us from repeating ourselves. The doctrine dictates that issues, once decided, should be reopened only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 817, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988). Oglesby\u2019s instant contentions implicate no extraordinary circumstances: they are mere echos of his prior unsuccessful contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-26\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
