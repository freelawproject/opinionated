It is</p>\n<p id=\"A--\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied. Petitioner challenges a regulation transferring amphetamine and methamphetamine from Schedule III to Schedule II under the Controlled Substances Act. Although Congress initially placed these drugs on Schedule III, the Act expressly authorizes the Attorney General to \u201ctransfer ... any drug\u201d \u2014 not just \u201cnew\u201d drugs, as petitioner suggests \u2014 from one schedule to another if certain criteria are met. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 811(a)(1). This does not represent an unconstitutional delegation of authority, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Gordon, </em>580 F.2d 827, 837-41 (5th Cir.1978), nor has petitioner demonstrated that the transfer of amphetamine and methamphetamine from Schedule III to Schedule II is otherwise objectionable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lafoon, </em>978 F.2d 1183, 1184-85 (10th Cir. 1992). The petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
