R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Defendant Anthony Burl Smith, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence. We deny the request for a COA and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (indicating \u201cappeal may not be taken\u201d without a COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In 1996, Smith pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and was sentenced to 121 months in prison. Judgment was entered on December 13, 1996, and Smith did not file a direct appeal. On May 30, 2002, Smith filed his \u00a7 2255 motion, asserting his federal sentence was improperly enhanced on the basis of a 1989 conviction for violating a Denver ordinance prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon. Smith pointed to a Colorado statute, Colo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-12-105.6, enacted August 2, 2000, limiting the ability of local governments within Colorado to enact or enforce certain local ordinances pertaining to the carrying of firearms in private vehicles. The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s motion as untimely. In doing so, the court accepted Smith\u2019s assertion that he did not receive a copy of the Colorado statute until May 1, 2002, but concluded \u201cthe existence of th[e] statute [wa]s a fact that could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence in 2000.\u201d ROA, Doc. 34 at 3. Further, the court noted that \u201cSmith admitted] that his attorney actually informed him of the existence of the statute in April 2001 when his attorney filed a postconviction motion in state court seeking to overturn the 1989 conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded that \u201cSmith had actual knowledge of the existence of the statute ... more than one year before the \u00a7 2255 motion was filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court denied a COA and Smith has renewed his application with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">Where, as here, \u201cthe district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim,\u201d the prisoner\u2019s entitlement to a COA hinges on his ability to show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and ... whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). After reviewing the record, we are not persuaded that Smith has stated a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. Accordingly, we need not examine the district court\u2019s procedural ruling and Smith\u2019s related arguments that equitable tolling should apply.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">If ... a prior [state] conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant is without recourse. The presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion of validity that attached to the prior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive, and the defendant may not collaterally attack his prior conviction through a motion under \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001). At the time of Smith\u2019s federal sentencing, his 1989 conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was presumptively valid. Although the record indicates that, following enactment of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-12-105.6, Smith attempted to collaterally attack the 1989 conviction in Colorado state court, there is no indication in the record that he did so successfully.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he presumption of validity that attached\u201d to the 1989 \u201cconviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive,\u201d and Smith \u201cmay not collaterally attack\u201d that \u201cconviction through a motion under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>532 U.S. at 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The application for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. Smith\u2019s request for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">. We note, in passing, that the Colorado Court of Appeals has interpreted Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-12-105.6 as simply \"limit[ing], not eliminat[ing], local ordinances regulating the carrying of weapons in private vehicles.\u201d <em>Trinen v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>53 P.3d 754, 760 (Colo.Ct.App.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
