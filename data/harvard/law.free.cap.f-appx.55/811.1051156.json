Magno, M.D. (\u201cDr.Magno\u201d), appeals from the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>trict court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d) pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in favor of cross-claim defendant John P. Cal-lan, M.D. (\u201cDr.Callan\u201d), and the entry of a judgment awarding damages to Joseph and Lila Bynum (collectively \u201cthe By-nums\u201d). We reverse the JMOL because the record shows that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support a finding that Joseph Bynum (\u201cMr.Bynum\u201d) was injured as the result of Dr. Callan\u2019s negligence. We also reverse the award of damages to the Bynums because the striking of Dr. Callan\u2019s name from the special verdict form denied Dr. Magno a fair trial on the issue of her liability for damages. The pertinent facts and procedural posture of this case are known to the parties. Therefore, we proceed directly to the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Dr. Magno contends that the district court erred in granting the Bynums\u2019 motion for a JMOL regarding her cross-claim against Dr. Callan because there was sufficient evidence of Dr. Callan\u2019s negligence to submit the question to the jury. A grant of a motion for a JMOL under Rule 50(a) is reviewed de novo and under federal law. <em>LaLonde v. County of Riverside, </em>204 F.3d 947, 959 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Dr. Magno maintains that the Bynums forfeited their right to object to the admission of Dr. Preston\u2019s opinion regarding Dr. Callan\u2019s breach of the applicable standard of care because they did not make a contemporaneous objection to its admissibility, nor did they move to strike Dr. Preston\u2019s opinion. We agree. A party who fails to make a contemporaneous objection to the introduction of testimony at trial forfeits its right to contest the use of that evidence in a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a) (providing that a party objecting to the admission of evidence must make \u201ca timely objection or motion to strike\u201d before the district court); <em>Kelly v. City of Oakland, </em>198 F.3d 779, 786 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that because an objection to testimony was not made at trial but in the defendants\u2019 Rule 50(b) motion the objection came too late to advise the court that the in limine order was being violated).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Dr. Magno also asserts that the Bynums should be judicially estopped from arguing that Dr. Preston was not qualified as a witness to testify that Dr. Callan breached his duty of care. In <em>Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>270 F.3d 778, 782-83 (9th Cir.2001), we applied the three factors the Supreme Court has identified as appropriate in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel: (1) whether a party\u2019s later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position; (2) whether the party persuaded a court to accept the party\u2019s earlier position; (3) whether the party \u201cseeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not es-topped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">The Bynums\u2019 conduct has met the above factors. The record shows that the By-nums took inconsistent positions over the course of the trial regarding Dr. Preston\u2019s competency to testify as to Dr. Callan\u2019s standard of care. In opposing Dr. Callan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the By-nums stated that \u201c[t]he testimony of Dr. Thomas Preston ... establishes that Cal-lan\u2019s care of Joe Bynum fell below the standard of care.\u201d However, in arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>that a JMOL should be granted on Dr. Magno\u2019s cross-claim against Dr. Callan, the Bynums stated: \u201cThere is not an adequate foundation or basis to keep [Dr. Preston\u2019s testimony] in this case.... Doctor Preston was not qualified as a pul-monologist, not qualified to render testimony as to the standard of care of a pulmonologist.\u201d These two positions are flatly inconsistent with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In denying Dr. Callan\u2019s motion for a summary judgment the court stated that the Bynums had submitted \u201cexpert declarations which provide that [Dr. Callan\u2019s] care of plaintiff in the form of his consultation was not up to medical standards.\u201d Dr. Magno apparently relied on the By-nums\u2019 pretrial representation to the court that Dr. Preston <em>was </em>qualified to testify as to Dr. Callan\u2019s standard of care to her detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The Bynums maintain that Dr. Magno \u201cknew that the Bynums intended to move for judgment as a matter of law on her cross-claim against Dr. Callan.\u201d At a hearing immediately after the Bynums rested their case in chief, Bynums\u2019 counsel stated that \u201cwith respect to [Dr. Callan] being an adverse witness, there is no medical testimony or no expert identified by the <em>defendants </em>that will establish that Doctor Callan fell below the standard of care.\u201d (emphasis added). This assertion did not alert Dr. Magno that the Bynums had abandoned their position that Dr. Preston, who had already testified as a <em>plaintiffs\u2019 </em>witness, was qualified to testify that Dr. Callan\u2019s conduct did not comply with the applicable standard of care. By waiting until after both sides had rested to contend that Dr. Preston was not qualified to opine regarding the standard of care of a consultant to a cardiologist, the Bynums unfairly misled Dr. Magno into the conclusion that she did not need to retain an expert witness on this seemingly undisputed factual issue. We are persuaded that the Bynums should be judicially estopped from arguing that Dr. Preston was not qualified to testify as to Dr. Callan\u2019s standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Dr. Magno also contends that there was sufficient evidence of Dr. Callan\u2019s negligence to submit her cross-claim to the jury. Whether evidence is sufficient to warrant giving a case to the jury is determined under Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 149, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). \u201c[I]n entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097. \u201cIf conflicting inferences may be drawn from the facts, the case must go to the jury.\u201d <em>Hoiuard v. Everex Sys., Inc., </em>228 F.3d 1057, 1060 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Multnomah County, </em>76 F.3d 1032, 1037 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">To establish a prima facie case for medical malpractice under Hawaii law, a party must show a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, a breach of that duty, a causal relationship between the breach and the injury suffered. <em>Bernard v. Char, </em>79 Hawaii 371, 903 P.2d 676, 682 (Haw.Ct. App.1995). In order to show duty and breach in a malpractice suit, the plaintiff must establish the standard of care of the defendant doctor by expert testimony. <em>Craft v. Peebles, </em>78 Hawaii 287, 893 P.2d 138, 149 (Haw.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Dr. Callan testified that he had a duty to evaluate the pulmonary risks of complications that could occur following the CABG surgery. He testified that the goal of a preoperative evaluation is to ensure that \u201cthe pulmonary risk factors are not so severe that the surgery would be danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ous.\u201d As Dr. Magno\u2019s consultant, Dr. Cal-lan was required to communicate the risks of surgery to Dr. Magno and Mr. Bynum. One of the common risks of CABG surgery is injury to the phrenic nerve. Dr. Callan acknowledged that a patient with COPD who develops bronchitis or pneumonia after surgery would be \u201cless able to cope with the consequences\u201d of phrenic nerve injury. Although Dr. Callan discussed the possibility of bronchitis and pneumonia with Mr. Bynum, he did not discuss the risks associated with phrenic nerve injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Dr. Callan acknowledged that he had a specific duty to determine the severity of Mr. Bynum\u2019s COPD and convey that information to Dr. Magno. Dr. Callan explained that in order to determine the severity of Mr. Bynum\u2019s COPD, it was necessary to look at the patient\u2019s \u201cblood gas\u201d level and his level of activity. However, Dr. Callan admitted that he only looked at one of Mr. Bynum\u2019s blood gas studies and never got any information about what his blood gas studies had previously shown at other institutions. Dr. Cal-lan also testified that he did not perform a basic pulmonary function test, which is one measure of the severity of COPD. Dr. Callan testified that he did not feel that it was necessary to obtain Mr. Bynum\u2019s previous medical records or consult with his mainland physicians. He also conceded that in his deposition he had testified that without Mr. Bynum\u2019s past medical records he lacked complete information to determine whether Mr. Bynum\u2019s COPD was moderate or severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Dr. David Fergusson, Dr. Magno\u2019s cardiology expert, testified that it was \u201cvery appropriate\u201d for Dr. Magno to call in a pulmonologist for a consultation \u201cto know if the pulmonary condition was so severe that that would make the risk of surgery greater than the risk of not doing the surgery.\u201d Dr. Fergusson testified that under the circumstances present in this case, a cardiologist has the right to rely on the consulting pulmonologist to determine what information he needs to make an adequate evaluation, and would expect the pulmonologist to discuss the pulmonary risks of surgery with the patient. Dr. Fergusson testified that \u201cthe pulmonologist is the man who really knows about the lungs and he is the man who\u2019s most appropriate to explain to the patient what the ... lung situation is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Dr. Preston testified that if a cardiologist has concern about the scope of his or her knowledge the \u201cappropriate thing to do is to get a consultant.\u201d He testified that Doctor Magno was correct in calling in a pulmonologist to evaluate Mr. Bynum and that if he had been in Dr. Magno\u2019s position he would have \u201cdone exactly the same thing.\u201d Dr. Preston testified that he would also have expected Dr. Callan to convey his evaluation to Dr. Magno and to Mr. Bynum. Dr. Preston agreed that \u201cDr. Magno ... would have a right to expect that [Dr. Callan] could know what to do to evaluate his part of the case ... he would then be expected to communicate his thoughts on that aspect of the case to the patient.\u201d Dr. Preston also testified that \u201cDr. Callan ... violated standards of care in terms of his role in getting information and conveying information to the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">The Bynums point to <em>Domingo ex rel. Domingo v. T.K., </em>289 F.3d 600 (9th Cir. 2002), for the proposition that bits and pieces of testimony can not give rise to a triable issue of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 607. In <em>Domingo, </em>the plaintiff offered stray comments out of the context in which they were presented from the depositions of the defendants\u2019 experts in an attempt to create a triable issue of fact regarding causation. <em>Id. </em>We noted in <em>Domingo </em>that the none of the defendants\u2019 experts testified that in their opinion the defendants\u2019 conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>caused the plaintiffs injuries. We also pointed out that all of the defendants\u2019 experts testified that \u201cthey could not say with reasonable scientific probability\u201d that the plaintiffs physician\u2019s surgical procedure caused severe brain damage. <em>Id. </em>at 608. Here, by contrast, Dr. Preston, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts, testified that Dr. Callan \u201cviolated standards of care in getting information and conveying information to the patient.\u201d Dr. Magno has not taken this testimony out of context. Nowhere in Dr. Preston\u2019s testimony did he state that Dr. Callan did not violate the standard of care he owed to his patient as a consultant to a cardiologist. Accordingly, the Bynums\u2019 reliance on <em>Domingo </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The evidence presented by the medical experts at trial was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding whether Dr. Callan violated the standard of care he owed to his patient when serving as a consultant to a cardiologist. The district court erred in granting the Bynums\u2019 motion for a JMOL regarding Dr. Magno\u2019s cross-claim against Dr. Callan.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Dr. Magno also contends that the exclusion of Dr. Callaris name from the special verdict form was prejudicial error and compels a reversal of the judgment awarding damages to the Bynums. We review a district court\u2019s formulation of civil jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>Monroe v. City of Phoenix, </em>248 F.3d 851, 857 (9th Cir.2001). A district court\u2019s error is prejudicial unless an appellate court finds that the jury\u2019s verdict is \u201cmore probably than not untainted by the error.\u201d <em>Haddad v. Lockheed Cal. Corp., </em>720 F.2d 1454, 1459 (9th Cir.1983). Had the district court not erroneously granted a JMOL as to Dr. Magno\u2019s cross-claim, Dr. Callan would have remained as a party in this action, and the jury would have been required to determine whether he was liable, in whole or in part, for Mr. Bynum\u2019s injuries. Therefore, the omission of Dr. Cal-lan\u2019s name from the special verdict form deprived Dr. Magno of her right to a reduction in the amount of damages she owed to the Bynums had the jury found that Dr. Callan was liable for Mr. Bynum\u2019s injuries. Because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that Dr. Callan was negligent, the district court committed prejudicial error in omitting Dr. Callan\u2019s name from the special verdict form. Accordingly, the judgment in favor of the Bynums for damages must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Dr. Magno further argues that the district court erred by submitting the amount of the medical expenses billed by Mr. By-num\u2019s healthcare providers to the jury as the reasonable value of their services, instead of the lesser amount negotiated by Medicare and Medi-Cal. Dr. Magno maintains that \u201c[i]f a medical provider is willing to accept a discounted fee for a medical service, it is because the provider recognized the fee as reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Because we have concluded that we must reverse the judgment awarding damages to the Bynums and the JMOL regarding Dr. Magno\u2019s cross-claim against Dr. Callan, we need not determine whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting the amount billed by Mr. By-num\u2019s healthcare providers as reflecting the reasonable value of the services performed. In the event that this case is not disposed of prior to a retrial, the novel question under Hawaii law whether the discounted amount paid to a healthcare provider by Medicaid and Medi-Cal reflects the amount that should be awarded to a plaintiff in a negligence action might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>well be a suitable candidate for certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law with regard to Dr. Magno\u2019s cross-claim against Dr. Callan is REVERSED. The final judgment in favor of the Bynums for damages is REVERSED. The case is REMANDED to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b854-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
