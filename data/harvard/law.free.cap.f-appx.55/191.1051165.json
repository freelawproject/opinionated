We have reviewed the record and agree with the district court that the claims Francis seeks to raise cannot be pursued under \u00a7 2241. Because Francis has previously filed a motion seeking relief under \u00a7 2255, <em>see United States v. Francis, </em>No. 99-6042, 1999 WL 147849 (4th Cir. Mar.18, 1999) (unpublished), however, he must seek authorization from this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000) prior to filing a successive motion under \u00a7 2255. Because Francis has not received this authorization, the district court properly dismissed his motion without prejudice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
