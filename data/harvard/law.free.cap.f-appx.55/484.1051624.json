He had known for at least two months that the law library in the county jail was not satisfactory to him. He also knew for several months that he was having problems obtaining an investigator. Almost all discovery was turned over a month before trial. Given all this, Green never once considered re-asserting his right to counsel until the day of trial, right before jury selection. We are not convinced that the state court\u2019s finding that he asserted this right only for purposes of delay was \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). We accordingly AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b526-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
