R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Jonathan Brady, a New Mexico prisoner, requests a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. A COA may be issued only when there is \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To demonstrate his entitlement to a COA, Mr. Brady must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">On appeal, Mr. Brady argues that the district court erred in failing to require the State of New Mexico\u2019s Department of Corrections to implement a statutorily mandated alternative incarceration program under N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-18-22, under which appellant was constitutionally entitled to apply for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">We have reviewed appellant\u2019s brief and appendix. We find no error, and affirm for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge, as adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Appellant\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
