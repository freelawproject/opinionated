For reversal, Garcia Lopez argues that the Immigration Judge erred in questioning the validity of his testimony, that the Immigration and Naturalization Service failed to show conditions in Guatemala have changed, and that he demonstrated both past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. Upon careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">We agree with the BIA that Garcia Lopez did not show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, as there was no evidence that guerrilla forces attempted to recruit him on account of his political opinion, affiliation, or any other characteristic that provides a basis for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We also conclude that, although respondent was not required to show improved country conditions because Garcia Lopez did not establish past persecution, <em>see Kratch-marov v. Heston, </em>172 F.3d 551, 553 (8th Cir.1999), it did so by introducing evidence that since Garcia\u2019s arrival in the United States, Guatemala\u2019s civil war has ended, and the guerrillas have renounced violence and are participating in the political process, <em>see Francois v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 926, 931 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-20\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
