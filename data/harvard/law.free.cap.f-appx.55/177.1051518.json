The IJ concluded Sanyang failed to present sufficient evidence to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground that would make him eligible for asylum relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 (2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). The Board\u2019s decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to law\u201d and an abuse of discretion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) &amp; (D) (2000). We find the Board correctly applied the law and did not abuse its discretion in rendering its decision here. Therefore, we affirm the reasoning of the Board. <em>Sanyang v. United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>BIA No. A75-367-787 (B.I.A. May. 30, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
