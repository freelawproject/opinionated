The two were prevailing parties on an underlying judgment that found an interference with their pension rights under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, when their employment with defendant-appellee Western Atlas was terminated in 1993. The underlying judgment was affirmed by a panel of this court in <em>Pennington v. Western Atlas, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 902 (6th Cir.2000). Fees and costs were awarded to counsel pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132. Appellants have asserted 11 items on which they claim the magistrate judge and district court judge erred in reducing the fees and costs requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Subsequent to this court\u2019s affirmation of the district court\u2019s judgment, Appellants requested 592.75 hours at $175 per hour through June 19, 2000, for trial, post-trial, and appellate work performed by Teresa Cunningham, Appellants\u2019 counsel, and interest on those fees. The district court reduced Cunningham\u2019s hours by 16 hours for elerical/travel time, by 10% for claims related to dismissed parties, and by 5% for lack of success on unrelated claims. The court did not award interest on the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Appellants later requested an additional 194 hours at $175 per hour for work performed by Cunningham in collecting the underlying judgment, preparing a response to Defendant\u2019s petition for certiora-ri, and preparing objections and fee petitions. The district court reduced the fees sought by 10%.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">On January 23, 2001, the district court considered Appellants\u2019 objections and filed an amended order, ordering Appellee to pay $125,515.02 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Appellants filed a motion for a Rule 70 order directing Appellee to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Appellee paid $118,398.78 in attorneys\u2019 fees February 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">On March 22, 2001, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to deny Appellants\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of $748.67 for collection of the fees. Appellants filed objections, and the district court adopted the report and recommendation May 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">Two notices of appeal were consolidated in this action. The first, filed February 20, 2001, appeals the district court\u2019s January 23, 2001 order. The second, filed June 4, 2001, appeals the trial court\u2019s May 8, 2001 order. Although Appellee argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>that the first appeal was untimely filed, this panel finds that it was filed in a timely manner, as Appellants filed objections on the same day the court issued its January 3, 2001 order. The district court subsequently considered those objections before entering its January 23, 2001 amended order; thus, the notice of appeal was timely, having been filed within the requisite 30 days. Fed. R.App. P. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s award or denial of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for an abuse of discretion. <em>Singleton v. Smith, </em>241 F.3d 534, 538 (6th Cir.2001). The trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is entitled to \u201csubstantial deference\u201d when the rationale for the award, as in this case, is predominately fact driven. <em>See Wilson-Simmons v. Lake County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>207 F.3d 818, 823 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">An ERISA judgment itself does not automatically entitle the prevailing party to attorneys\u2019 fees. Fees are discretionary pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), which provides in part, \u201cIn any action under this chapter ... the court in its discretion may allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs of action to either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Appellants seek interest on the attorneys\u2019 fees award dating from December 15, 1997, the date of the jury\u2019s advisory verdict in their favor on the underlying judgment on the merits. In <em>Associated General Contractors v. Drabik, </em>250 F.3d 482, 495 (6th Cir.2001), this court held that attorneys\u2019 fees will bear interest from the date of a judgment for such fees, even if the fees are not quantified until a later date. In <em>Drabik, </em>however, the underlying judgment awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. In this case, the original judgment on the merits did not provide for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees; instead, the fees were first declared in the magistrate judge\u2019s July 13, 2000 report and recommendation, which was later adopted by the district court in its January 3, 2001 order. At oral argument, Appellee agreed to pay interest from the July 2000 report and recommendation. Therefore, the court will vacate that portion of the district court\u2019s January 23, 2001 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The district court\u2019s decisions on the remaining issues presented for appeal, however, are entitled to substantial deference. \u201cIn light of a district court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988 is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In this case, the district court adopted detailed reports and recommendations by the magistrate judge, who had painstakingly considered Plaintiffs\u2019 numerous fee requests. Following our thorough review of the record, all applicable law, the parties\u2019 briefs, and oral argument by counsel, we conclude that the district court\u2019s orders contain no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Based upon Appellee\u2019s representations at oral argument, we VACATE those portions of the orders denying interest on attorneys\u2019 fees and GRANT interest on those fees from July 13, 2000. In all other respects, the orders of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
