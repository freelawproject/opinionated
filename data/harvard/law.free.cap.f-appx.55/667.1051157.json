Because the district court sua sponte dismissed Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely without affording him notice or an opportunity to be heard and because it is not indisputably clear from the district court record that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1), we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court for additional proceedings consistent with <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-23\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
