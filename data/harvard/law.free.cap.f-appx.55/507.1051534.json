R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-20\">This case is before the court on Terry Chancey\u2019s <em>pro se </em>requests for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and for permission to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pau-peris. </em>Chancey seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that no appeal may be taken from \u201cthe final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d unless the movant obtains a COA). Chancey\u2019s request to proceed on appeal in <em>forma pau-peris </em>is granted. Because Chancey has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d however, this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-21\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Chancey raised four general challenges to his conviction and resultant sentence for distribution of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). He further alleged that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective as cause and prejudice sufficient to overcome the procedural bar arising from his failure to raise these claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 167-68, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>91 F.3d 1388, 1391 (10th Cir.1996). In response, the district court reviewed and rejected each of Chancey\u2019s claims on the merits. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>all of the claims that Chancey asserted his counsel should have raised were without merit, the district court concluded Chan-cey had failed to demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective. As Chancey had failed to show a basis for relief, the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">To be entitled to a COA, Chancey must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make the requisite showing by demonstrating that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Upon consideration of Chance/s application for a COA and appellate brief, and <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s order and entire record on appeal, this court concludes that Chancey has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right for substantially those reasons set out in the district court\u2019s order dated February 13, 2002. Accordingly, this court GRANTS Chancey permission to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>DENIES his application for a COA, and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
