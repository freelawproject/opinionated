Ekmanis, an Arizona state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing his constitutional challenge to Arizona\u2019s statutory scheme that allows inmates serving consecutive sentences for offenses committed before January 1, 1994 to take advantage only of earned release credits accumulated during the last of their consecutive sentences. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After de novo review, <em>Webber v. Crabtree, </em>158 F.3d 460, 461 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">This court has held that no equal protection or due process violation arises from sentencing one group of prisoners under one statutory scheme and sentencing a later group of prisoners under a different statutory scheme. <em>See McQueary v. Blod-gett, </em>924 F.2d 829, 833-34 (9th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Ekmanis\u2019s claim that it is unconstitutional to apply the pre-1993 version of Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 41-1604.07 \u2014 renumbered in 1993 as \u00a7 41-1604.10 \u2014 to prisoners who committed their offenses before January 1, 1994, and the current version of Aeiz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 41-1604.07 to prisoners who committed offenses on or after January 1,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-22\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Ekmanis\u2019s claim that it violates equal protection and due process to treat prisoners serving concurrent sentences differently from those serving consecutive sentences. <em>See Miller v. Albright, </em>523 U.S. 420, 433-45, 118 S.Ct. 1428, 140 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998) (rejecting equal protection claim because the challenged classes were not similarly situated); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (holding that there is no constitutional right to good-time credits).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-23\">We do not consider the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ekmanis\u2019s remaining causes of action because he does not challenge those rulings on appeal. <em>See Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>797 F.2d 727, 738 (9th Cir. 1986) (\u201cCourt of Appeals will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b908-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
