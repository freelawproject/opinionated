R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estop-pel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-24\">Plaintiff Robert Wayne Hamby, an Oklahoma state inmate appearing pro se, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against various prison officials, alleging that those officials (1) violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect him from attacks by other inmates and (2) violated his due process rights by arbitrarily taking away 832 of his earned credits. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the complaint without prejudice based on Plaintiffs failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court adopted that recommendation and dismissed the action without prejudice, but ordered the Department of Corrections to permit Plaintiff to file an administrative grievance out-of-time, and further ordered Plaintiff to submit that grievance within 30 days. Plaintiff then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s finding of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Jemigan v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002). The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), requires a prisoner to exhaust \u201cavailable\u201d administrative remedies before filing an action with respect to prison conditions under \u00a7 1983. <em>Jemigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032. \u201cAn inmate who begins the grievance process but does not complete it is barred from pursuing a \u00a7 1983 claim under PLRA for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Apparently, Plaintiff does not dispute that he has not exhausted those remedies, but argues that he should not be required to exhaust because (1) exhaustion would be futile since the time for filing his grievance had expired; (2) he does not believe that prison officials will effectively assist him during the grievance process; and (3) his case involves an \u201cemergency situation\u201d which must be addressed as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">We disagree. The Supreme Court has declined to read \u201cfutility or other exceptions\u201d into the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. <em>See Booth v. Chumer, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741 &amp; n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). \u201cCongress ha[s] eliminated both discretion to dispense with administrative exhaustion and the condition that it be \u2018plain, speedy, and effective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jemigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032 (quoting <em>Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 739). Moreover, Plaintiff \u201cmay not successfully argue that he had exhausted his administrative remedies by, in essence, failing to employ them and since he may now be time barred from pursuing them, they are exhausted by default.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. This proposition has particular force where, as here, the district court granted extra time to pursue administrative remedies. Finally, we note that the Department of Corrections\u2019 grievance policy provides for an emergency grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation dated April 30, 2002, and the district court\u2019s order dated July 29, 2002, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
