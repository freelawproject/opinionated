Holston seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Holston has not satisfied this standard. <em>See Holston v. Clarke, </em>No. CA-01-223-1 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 13, 2002). Accordingly, we deny Holston\u2019s motion requesting a court order, deny his motion to stay proceedings, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
