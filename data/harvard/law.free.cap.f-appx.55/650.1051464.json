He contests the 156-month career offender sentence imposed by the district court, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level by three levels for possession of a firearm during the offense when that fact was not alleged in the indictment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), 4B1.1 (2001). He contests his career offender sentence on the same ground. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-22\">Tuttle contends that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), facts that increase the sentencing guideline range must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the sentencing court makes factual findings that increase the sentencing guideline range but the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). The statutory maximum for Tuttle\u2019s offense is 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Because neither of the issues raised by Tuttle has merit, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
