C.P.L.R. \u00a7 202 (McKinney 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In 1995, Fitzgerald inherited a share certificate, which originally had been issued in 1930 for fifty shares of common stock of E.L. Smith Oil Company (\u201cSmith Oil\u201d). In 1938, Smith Oil merged into Lion Oil Refining Company (\u201cLion Oil\u201d), with Smith Oil shares exchanging for Lion Oil shares on a ten for one basis. In 1955, Lion Oil merged with Monsanto Company, with Lion Oil shares exchanging for one and one-half shares of Monsanto. Monsanto subsequently changed its name to Pharmacia and has transferred parts of its operation to Solutia. After inheriting the certificate, Fitzgerald\u2019s representative contacted Monsanto to ascertain its value. On October 28, 1996, Monsanto sent Fitzgerald a letter stating that it had determined that since 1965 it had no further obligation to Smith Oil shareholders who had not exchanged their shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Despite her awareness in 1996 of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to recognize her purported rights as a shareholder, Fitzgerald did not file suit until July 2001, seeking damages for Monsanto\u2019s failure to issue stock in exchange for the certificate she possessed. Monsanto moved for summary judgment, contending that Fitzgerald\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The District Court carefully analyzed Fitzgerald\u2019s claims and correctly concluded that they (1) were subject to, at most, a four-year statute of limitations; (2) accrued, at the latest, in 1996; and (3) were consequently time-barred. Having considered all of Fitzgerald\u2019s arguments, we affirm the judgment of the District Court, substantially for the reasons stated by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
