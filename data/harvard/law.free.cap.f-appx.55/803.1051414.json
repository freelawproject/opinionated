We affirm in part and reverse in part. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">In this case, the district court granted summary judgment as to TMC\u2019s bad faith tort claim, a decision that we review de novo. <em>Nodine v. Shiley, Inc., </em>240 F.3d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir.2001). In considering the propriety of summary judgment, we \u201cmust determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-21\">TMC alleges that Truck violated its duty of good faith in denying its request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>for reimbursement. Under Arizona law, \u201c[t]he tort of bad faith arises when the insurer \u2018intentionally denies, fails to process or pay a claim without a reasonable basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zilisch v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., </em>196 Ariz. 234, 995 P.2d 276, 279 (2000). \u201cWhile an insurer may challenge claims which are fairly debatable, its belief in fair debatability is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhile fair debatability is a necessary condition to avoid a claim <em>of </em>bad faith, it is not a sufficient condition. The appropriate inquiry is whether there is sufficient evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that in the investigation, evaluation, and processing of the claim, the insurer acted unreasonably and either knew or was conscious of the fact that its conduct was unreasonable.\u201d . <em>Id. </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to TMC, there was \u201csufficient evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that in the investigation, evaluation, and processing of the claim, the insurer acted unreasonably and either knew or was conscious of the fact that its conduct was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, TMC tendered evidence of Truck\u2019s \u201cProtocol Unpaid Hospital Bills\u201d (\u201cProtocol\u201d), which addressed the circumstances under which Truck would reimburse its insureds for unpaid hospital bills. Viewed in the light most favorable to TMC, the Protocol could indicate that Truck\u2019s denial of coverage was contrary to its operative internal guidelines, which Truck\u2019s expert admitted Truck had an obligation to consider in its coverage decision. The Protocol created a sufficient genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment on TMC\u2019s tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Given the jury\u2019s subsequent verdict in Truck\u2019s favor on TMC\u2019s breach of contract claim, we must also consider whether the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment constituted harmless error. However, under Arizona law, \u201cbreach of an express covenant of an insurance policy is not a necessary prerequisite to a tort claim based on bad faith.\u201d <em>Deese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>172 Ariz. 504, 838 P.2d 1265, 1266 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">TMC argues that the district court erred in excluding evidence at trial of the Protocol. The district court excluded the evidence because: (1) it was not relevant and (2) any probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">We examine a district court\u2019s evidentia-ry rulings under the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Duran v. City of Maywood, </em>221 F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it \u2018base[s] its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bay Area Addiction Research &amp; Treatment, Inc. v. City of Antioch, </em>179 F.3d 725, 730 (9th Cir.1999). However, \u201c[rjeversal will not be granted unless prejudice is shown.\u201d <em>City of Long Beach v. Standard Oil Co., </em>46 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.1995). We also recognize that \u201c[t]he district court has considerable latitude in performing the Rule 403 balancing test\u201d and that we \u201cwill not reengage in a balancing of the probative value and prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Raymark Ind., Inc., </em>922 F.2d 1426, 1430 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Given the factual circumstances of this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Although the Protocol was arguably relevant to coverage, coverage was not an issue at trial. The Protocol was irrelevant to question of timely notice by TMC to Truck, which was the primary trial issue. We also find no reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>error in the district court\u2019s alternative ruling under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Mockler v. Multnomah County, </em>140 F.3d 808, 815 n. 8 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cJudgment as a matter of law is proper if the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, allows only one reasonable conclusion and that conclusion is contrary to that reached by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The jury\u2019s verdict must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence.\u201d <em>Gilbrook v. City of Westminster, </em>177 F.3d 839, 856 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Neither party contests the jury instructions given by the district court as to the applicable law. Relevant to TMC\u2019s argument, the district court instructed the jury that under Arizona law an insurer is not relieved of its obligations under a policy based on the insured\u2019s failure to comply with policy conditions unless the insurer was substantially prejudiced by that failure. <em>Holt v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>157 Ariz. 477, 759 P.2d 623, 627 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">TMC argues that there was no evidence from which the jury could find substantial prejudice. \u201cWhether an insurer has suffered substantial prejudice is a question for the trier of fact, which not be disturbed ... unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Clark Equip. Co. v. Ariz. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Fund, </em>189 Ariz. 433, 943 P.2d 793, 802 (1997). Truck provided testimony that it was prejudiced by TMC\u2019s failure to give timely notice because it would have interceded with the patient\u2019s family and with the family\u2019s insurer, but lost the opportunity to do so due to lack of notice. From this testimony and from letters from the insurer introduced at trial indicating that it would extend coverage, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Truck might have had some success in reducing the expense to TMC and Truck. Thus, although the evidence on prejudice is not particularly strong, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">We reverse the grant of summary judgment on TMC\u2019s bad faith claim. We affirm the judgment against TMC on its breach of contract claim. We remand for further proceedings. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
