The trial court determined that \u201c[bjecause the allegations of the complaint state a claim which appears to be lodged against the United States Soccer Federation, rather than the United States, the court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Summary affirmance of a case is appropriate \u201cwhen the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists\u201d. <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994). In his 70-page complaint, Nava seeks damages from several entities and individuals but not from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Court of Federal Claims correctly held that it lacks jurisdiction over claims against defendants other than the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). We conclude that no substantial question regarding the outcome of this appeal exists; therefore, summary affirmance is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">(1) The United States\u2019 motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
