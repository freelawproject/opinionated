In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>brief filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Williams\u2019 attorney states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 in the wake of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), nevertheless. Williams was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">This Court and other courts of appeals have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 following <em>Apprendi. See, e.g., United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir.2001). Hence, Williams\u2019 sole argument on appeal is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Williams\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
