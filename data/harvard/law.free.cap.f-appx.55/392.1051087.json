Post\u00e9is sought disability insurance benefits asserting mental disorders disabled her beginning on June 15, 1981. An ALJ found Post\u00e9is did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>show she had any impairment that significantly limited her ability to perform basic work activities before March 31, 1987, her last date insured. The ALJ thus concluded Post\u00e9is was not entitled to benefits. <em>See Basinger v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1166, 1168 (8th Cir.1984). The Appeals Council denied further review. Post\u00e9is sought judicial review, and the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> held substantial evidence supported the decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">On appeal, Post\u00e9is contends the ALJ committed error in rejecting the opinions of her treating physicians and in terminating the analysis before considering vocational factors. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the ALJ properly determined that Post\u00e9is did not show she suffered from a severe mental impairment before her insured status expired on March 31, 1987. The ALJ properly rejected the retrospective testimony of Postels\u2019s treating physicians because they had limited contact with Post\u00e9is during the relevant time period. Because Postels\u2019s impairment would have had no more than a minimal effect on her ability to work, the ALJ properly terminated the analysis after determining she had no severe impairment. <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>75 F.3d 429, 431 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the denial of benefits, thus we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> The Honorable Charles R.
