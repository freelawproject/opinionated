We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Allah v. Montgomery, </em>No. CA-01-958-0-24BF (D.S.C. Sept. 30, 2002). We deny Allah\u2019s motion for production of documents, his motion for an injunction, his motion to amend, his motion for declaratory judgment, his motion for an award of compensatory and punitive damages, his motion to review the record in the Clerk\u2019s Office, his motion for sanctions, his motion to strike, and his motion for default judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
