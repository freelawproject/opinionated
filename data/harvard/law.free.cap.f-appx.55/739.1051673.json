The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">In March 2002, Salyers pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute schedule II controlled substances cocaine, oxycodone, and methadone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, attempting to possess with intent to distribute oxycodone, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possessing with intent to distribute oxycodone and percocet, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and possessing firearms during the commission of a drug offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court sentenced Salyers to a total of ninety-seven months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">Salyers has filed a timely appeal, arguing that the district court should have required the government to file a downward departure motion because he was entitled to such a departure based on his substantial assistance, or that the court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine if Salyers\u2019s cooperation warranted a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not err when it declined to hold an evidentiary hearing concerning Salyers\u2019s entitlement to a downward departure. As Salyers acknowledged, existing case law simply does not support his arguments. First, \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines allows a sentencing court to depart from the guidelines if the government files a motion indicating that a defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed a crime. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. However, a district court lacks the authority to effect a \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d sentencing reduction in the absence of the appropriate government motion. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Second, courts may only review the government\u2019s refusal to file a motion for a downward departure in an effort to determine whether the government\u2019s decision was based on unconstitutional motives. <em>United States v. Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d 1069, 1073 (6th Cir.1998). The government\u2019s decision may not be reviewed for bad faith. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>225 F.3d 637, 641 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-22\">Here, Salyers does not assert that the government\u2019s failure to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>tion was based upon an unconstitutional motive, and an independent review of the record reveals no evidence that the government\u2019s failure to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was so motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
