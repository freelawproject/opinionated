Clark contests the district court\u2019s determination that he had the necessary predicate convictions for a career offender sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant offense, (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. A prior felony conviction must be \u201ca prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year....\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.l). A conviction sustained before age eighteen may qualify as a predicate conviction \u201cif it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Clark had prior convictions for cocaine trafficking and for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. Clark argues that the latter conviction, which he concedes was an adult conviction, may not be used as a predicate conviction under \u00a7 4B1.1 because he received a juvenile sentence. <em>See United States v. Mason, </em>284 F.3d 555, 560 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that adult conviction for which juvenile sentence imposed may not be predicate conviction under \u00a7 4B1.1). <em>Mason </em>dealt with a West Virginia sentencing scheme that permitted a defendant under eighteen who was convicted as an adult to be sentenced as a juvenile delinquent. North Carolina has no analogous statutory provision. <em>See </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 7A-611 (1995) (providing for immediate transfer to Department of Correction of juvenile convicted of criminal offense in superior court who receives active sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The assault at issue here occurred when Clark was fifteen. He was initially charged as a juvenile, but his case was transferred to state superior court and he was prosecuted as an adult. At age sixteen, Clark was given a suspended sentence of 20-33 months imprisonment with three years supervised probation and 120 days in the IMPACT (boot camp) program. Clark\u2019s probation was revoked a few months later, and he served nearly two years imprisonment in the North Carolina Department of Correction Western Youth Institution. Clark acknowledges that the North Carolina statutory sentencing scheme is not like the West Virginia statutes considered in <em>Mason. </em>However, he contends that, because he served his sentence in an institution designated by the North Carolina Department of Correction as a \u201cyouth facility\u201d where male felons between the ages of 13 and 18 are housed with males between the ages of 19 and 22 who have been convicted of misdemeanors, he did not receive an adult sentence for his assault conviction. We conclude that the North Carolina Department of Correction\u2019s practice of housing younger inmates together and limiting the IMPACT program to younger inmates does not convert an adult sentence into a juvenile sentence of the kind at issue in <em>Mason. </em>Consequently, the district court did not err in treating Clark\u2019s assault conviction as a predicate conviction for career offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
