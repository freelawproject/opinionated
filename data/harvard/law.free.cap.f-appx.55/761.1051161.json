Swanson appeals, challenging his sentence on two grounds. First and foremost, he argues that his prior felony conviction for unlawful restraint does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and so he lacks the requisite two prior convictions for classification as a career offender. Second, he argues that the district court increased his offense level by two points for obstruction of justice based on an erroneous finding that he attempted to escape from custody before trial. Swanson acknowledges, however, that the district court\u2019s obstruction-of-justice finding is inconsequential if he indeed qualifies as a career offender. We therefore first address Swanson\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s career offender determination. Because we believe that Swanson\u2019s unlawful restraint offense presented a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury,\u201d and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Whether an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the guidelines is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Cole, </em>298 F.3d 659, 661 (7th Cir.2002). Section 4B1.2(a) defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">[A]ny offense under state or federal law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that-(l) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Illinois defines the crime of unlawful restraint as follows: \u201c[a] person commits the offense of unlawful restraint when he knowingly without legal authority detains another.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/10-3. Although in many cases, if not most we think, physical force or threatened force will be used in order to restrain the victim\u2019s movement, the Illinois courts have stated that \u201c[ajctual or physical force is not a necessary element of unlawful restraint as long as an individual\u2019s freedom of locomotion is impaired.\u201d <em>People v. Bowen, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 608, 182 Ill.Dec. 43, 609 N.E.2d 346, 361 (Ill.App.Ct.1993). Because the Illinois unlawful restraint statute does not have as a necessary element the use or threatened use of physical force, Swanson\u2019s unlawful restraint conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence under subsection one of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">But Swanson\u2019s offense involved conduct that, by its nature, presented a serious risk of physical injury to another, and thus qualifies under subsection two of \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Under subsection two, a federal court is not confined to the minimum conduct that would create an offense under the applicable statute; it also may look to the face of the charging document. <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>110 F.3d 382, 384, 387 (7th Cir.1997). The commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2(a) explains that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes any offense for which \u201cthe conduct set forth <em>(i.e., </em>expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted ... by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">A risk of violent confrontation is inherent in a crime such as Swanson\u2019s that involves restraining another person against her will. For that reason, our sister circuits have held that the similar crimes of false imprisonment and kidnapping by deception that do not have physical force as an element nonetheless present a serious risk of physical injury, and thus are \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d <em>See United, States v. Zamora, </em>222 F.3d 756, 764-65 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>110 F.3d 50, 52-53 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Kaplansky, </em>42 F.3d 320, 324 (6th Cir.1994) (en banc). Although one could envision an unlawful restraint where physical force is not used, e.g., secretly locking someone inside his or her office, \u201cthe benchmark should be the possibility of violent confrontation, not whether one can postulate a nonconfrontational hypothetical scenario.\u201d <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>302 F.3d 722, 723 (7th Cir.2002). Illinois cases demonstrate that the crime of unlawful restraint is frequently attended by physical violence. <em>See, e.g., People v. Alvarado, </em>235 Ill.App.3d 116, 175 Ill.Dec. 778, 600 N.E.2d 1236, 1237 (Ill.App.Ct.1992) (finding that evidence that the defendant refused to let the victim out of his car by grabbing her by the neck and then physically preventing her from entering her house sufficed for unlawful restraint conviction); <em>People v. Leonhardt, </em>173 Ill.App.3d 314, 123 Ill.Dec. 99, 527 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>N.E.2d 562, 564-65, 567 (Ill.App.Ct.1988) (affirming unlawful restraint conviction where the defendant drove the victim to a secluded area, sexually assaulted her, and when she tried to escape, chased, grabbed, and hit her). This case is no different.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Here, the information to which Swanson pleaded guilty in state court demonstrates that he used physical force to restrain his victim and that his conduct involved a serious potential risk of injury. The information charged that Swanson \u201cknowingly and without legal authority detained Yolando Combs in that the defendant repeatedly grabbed Yolanda Combs by her arms and detained her on County Road <em>1000 </em>E approximately^ mile from County Road 700 N for approximately two hours.\u201d Swanson argues that \u201cgrabbing\u201d someone by their arms does not necessarily imply force. To the contrary, he asserts, the charge reasonably could be interpreted as meaning that Swanson grabbed Combs and asked her not to leave in a \u201csoothing manner.\u201d We disagree. The word \u201cgrab\u201d connotes forcefulness. As the government points out, \u201cto grab\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cto take or seize by or as if by a sudden motion or grasp.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>505 (10th ed.1999). In this case, Swanson\u2019s repeated grabbing of Combs was sufficiently forceful to prevent her escape for two hours, and accordingly, presented a serious potential risk of injury to Combs.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Because Swanson\u2019s unlawful restraint conviction indeed was a crime of violence, we conclude that he was properly sentenced as a career offender. We therefore need not consider Swanson\u2019s argument that the district court also erred by increasing his offense level by two points for Swanson\u2019s alleged escape attempt. The career offender guideline mandates a higher offense level than Swanson would receive even if he were correct about the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>United States v. Un-thank, 109 F.3d </em>1205, 1206 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">FAIRCHILD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">FAIRCHILD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">With all respect I am unable to agree that the conduct described in the charging document presented \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to\u201d Yolanda Combs. I acknowledge, however, that if we were permitted to consider other facts recited in the presentence report, it would be easy to find that there was such risk. It there appears that defendant had fathered children with Combs, had a history of domestic violence with her, and court orders had been issued against defendant for the protection of Combs. The Guidelines, however, seem to limit us to the \u201cconduct set forth (i.e. expressly charged) in the count\u201d of conviction.
