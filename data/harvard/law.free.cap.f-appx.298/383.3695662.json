Walker, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>challenged the federal Defense of Marriage Act and the Army\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask \u2014 don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, complaining that his rights to due process and equal protection were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">On May 12, 2008 \u2014 four days before this suit was filed \u2014 Walker had filed another suit raising identical claims against the same defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Civil Action l:08cv0381. Walker concedes that the complaint in the present suit was a photocopy of his earlier complaint filed in the Western District of Texas. The second complaint, the one filed in the Southern District of Texas, was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">A district court may dismiss a complaint that is duplicative of another federal lawsuit filed by the same plaintiff. <em>Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 995 (5th Cir.1993). There certainly is such duplication here. Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing what was Walker\u2019s second complaint on the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
