The jury found him not guilty, however, for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) (West Supp.2008). He was sentenced to 151 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Cortez alleges the district court erred by giving him a two-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2007), for possessing a dangerous weapon (here a pistol), in light of the jury\u2019s verdict on the \u00a7 924(c) charge. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">Cortez concedes on appeal that we review this issue for plain error, as trial counsel failed to raise this issue below.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>495 F.3d 142, 148 (4th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1471, 170 L.Ed.2d 296 (2008). Without the two-level enhancement, Cortez\u2019s advisory sentencing range would have been 121-151 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">Cortez\u2019s argument fails as a matter of law. In <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997), the Supreme Court held that \u201ca jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 117 S.Ct. 633; <em>see United States v. Hunter, </em>19 F.3d 895, 897 (4th Cir.1994) (upholding firearm enhancement where defendant was acquitted of \u00a7 924(c) firearm charge). Accordingly, we affirm Cortez\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\"> Trial counsel initially filed written objections to the enhancement but he and Cortez abandoned the argument at the sentencing hearing.
