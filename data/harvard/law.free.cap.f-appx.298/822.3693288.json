Camafel Building Inspections, Inc., Filer &amp; Hammond Architects, Inc., and Ford, Dean, &amp; Mallard, P.A., on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of BAPCO on Appellants\u2019 breach of contract claims. The Appellants also contest a number of other rulings made by the district court, including the denial of class certification, but they do not petition this court for review of any of these rulings; instead the Appellants ask this court to remand the case for further consideration should we overturn the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">In the event that we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims, BAPCO conditionally cross-appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>See Patrick v. Floyd Med. Center, </em>201 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to BAPCO on the Appellants\u2019 breach of contract claims. Georgia law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> deems voluntary any payments made with knowledge of all material facts and disallows recovery of such payments unless certain statutory exceptions are met. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-1-13. The record contains undisputed evidence that the Appellants had knowledge of all the facts material to their current claims when they made the payments at issue in this case, and the Appellants do not argue that they meet any of the statutory exceptions to the voluntary payment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">Instead, the Appellants maintain that their payments were not voluntary because they were made pursuant to a contractual obligation. As the district court noted, Georgia courts regularly apply the voluntary payment doctrine to contractually mandated payments. <em>See, e.g., Yeazel v. Burger King Corp., </em>241 Ga.App. 90, 97-101, 526 S.E.2d 112, 119-21 (1999); <em>Henson v. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>144 Ga.App. 80, 82-83, 240 S.E.2d 284, 286-87 (1977). The Appellants also raise two new arguments on appeal: that BAPCO is required to show prejudice to retain the protection of the voluntary payment doctrine and that BAPCO has somehow waived its ability to invoke the voluntary payment doctrine because of the litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>positions it has taken. These arguments, in addition to being untimely, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Having found that the district court properly granted summary judgment on the Appellants\u2019 claims, we decline the Appellants\u2019 invitation to remand the case for further consideration. The Appellants have not directly appealed the district court\u2019s denial of class certification; therefore, that decision stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 claims, we do not reach BAPCO\u2019s conditional cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-10\">. The parties agree that Georgia law applies to the Appellants\u2019 claims pursuant to the choice of law provisions in the contracts governing the parties\u2019 relationships.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
