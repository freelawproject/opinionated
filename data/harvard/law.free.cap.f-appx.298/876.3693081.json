On appeal, Slaughter argues that the district court erred by imposing a four-level increase for his role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). He argues that the increase was improper because his criminal activity did not involve \u201cfive or more participants\u201d nor was not \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.) <em>(en banc). </em>Section 3Bl.l(a) provides for a four-level enhancement if a \u201cdefendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">An \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d operation does not require a set number of criminally responsible participants. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir. 1994). \u201cAlthough this [C]ircuit does not employ a precise definition for the \u2018otherwise extensive\u2019 standard, there are a number of factors relevant to the extensiveness determination, including the length and scope of the criminal activity, as well as the number of persons involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046. \u201cIn assessing whether an organization is \u2018otherwise extensive,\u2019 all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered. Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 3. In <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>981 F.2d 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.1993) (footnote omitted), we held that the facts established that a defendant was involved in an \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d criminal activity when the defendant \u201cwas organizing a drug transaction that extended from Columbia to Florida to Boston to New York, and which included the purchase and street distribution of 100 kilos of cocaine worth $350,000 in the wholesale market.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1198 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the district court clearly erred by not finding that a criminal activity involving \u201cseven corporations, numerous straw owners, Medicare reimbursements of over $ 15 million, and repeated failure to disclose related party status over a seven-year period\u201d was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. Because Slaughter caused a principal loss of over $5.5 million and involved many knowing and unknowing individuals in his criminal activity, the district court did not err in finding that he was a leader and organizer of a criminal activity that was \u201cextensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2006), we held that it was unnecessary to decide an enhancement issue where the district court made clear that even if its interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines were wrong, it would still impose the same sentence. 470 F.3d at 1348-49. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>case, the district court stated that, even if it were wrong about the enhancement, it would impose the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A0I\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
