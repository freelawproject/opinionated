Jerome alleged that when he was placed in administrative segregation, his legal documents were confiscated and never returned. He asserted that he requested the documents in order to prepare for a motion to reconsider sentence that was eventually denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The district court dismissed Tapp\u2019s claims as frivolous and for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as frivolous for abuse of discretion; however, a dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is reviewed \u201cunder the same de novo standard of review applicable to dismissals pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (2005); <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999). Because the district court dismissed the claims pursuant to both subsections, review should be de novo. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373. \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1230, 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">Even assuming that the defendants did deny Tapp access to the courts, he fails to allege how he was prejudiced. Tapp does not identify which documents were needed or why the documents were necessary for his motion to reconsider. Merely obtaining an unsuccessful result at the motion hearing does not demonstrate a connection between the alleged denial of access to the documents and legal prejudice. As such, Tapp\u2019s access-to-the-courts claim fails. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">Tapp does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to allege a due process violation in regard to the loss of his property. He has therefore abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">Tapp is informed that our affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal counts as one strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Tapp is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
