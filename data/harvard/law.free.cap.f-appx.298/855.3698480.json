Clifton challenges the ruling on two grounds. First, Clifton argues that the administrative law judge erred in finding that Clifton had substantial medical improvement. Second, Clifton argues that the administrative law judge erred in finding that Clifton could perform work that existed in the national economy without consulting a vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden rests with the claimant to prove that she is disabled and entitled to Social Security benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the administrative law judge that Clifton experienced substantial medical improvement. An individual is eligible for disability benefits for chronic pulmonary disease when her capacity to expel carbon monoxide is less than 40 percent. Athough Clifton qualified for benefits in 1999 when her diffusion capacity was between 37 and 41 percent, she had improved considerably by 2002, when her diffusion capacity was 97 percent. Because Clifton no longer qualified as disabled, she was not entitled to further benefits. <em>See Vaughn v. Heckler, </em>727 F.2d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir.1984) (benefits can be terminated once \u201cthere is substantial evidence of actual improvement to the point of no disability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">The record supports the decision by the administrative law judge to rely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the medical vocational guidelines to determine that Clifton could resume work. Clifton does not challenge the finding that she had the functional capacity to perform a full range of light work. The judge accounted for Clifton\u2019s mild mental limitations and found that she could understand and execute \u201csimple two step instructions\u201d and interact appropriately with coworkers. The \u201cunskilled work\u201d limitation fully accounts for the limitations posed by Clifton\u2019s mental impairments. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.968(a) (\u201cUnskilled work is work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The denial of Clifton\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
