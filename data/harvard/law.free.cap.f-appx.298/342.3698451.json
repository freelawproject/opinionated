He seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s orders transferring to this court his motion to reopen direct appeal and his motion to reduce sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">If necessary, we must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s transfer orders were nonappealable interlocutory orders. <em>See Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir.2001). We are without jurisdiction to consider the present appeal. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. West\u2019s motions for a COA, for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, and for appointment of counsel are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
