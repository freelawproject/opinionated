The BIA concluded that Lin\u2019s testimony was not credible and that he had failed to establish eligibility for the requested forms of relief. Because Lin\u2019s only claims before the BIA concerned the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application and a motion to remand, we lack jurisdiction to consider his arguments for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Accordingly, we DISMISS Lin\u2019s petitions for withholding of removal and CAT relief and DENY Lin\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">A. <em>Lin\u2019s 2001 Asylum Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUE\">Lin is a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China who entered the United States through Los Angeles in 1990. Administrative Record at 817. Because he lacked a valid entry document, he was briefly detained and ordered to appear at a hearing before an IJ to determine his immigration status. <em>Id. </em>at 1509-10. Lin failed to appear for the hearing and was ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>in 1991. <em>Id. </em>at 1394-95. In 2000, Lin filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, alleging that he did not receive notice of the 1991 hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1386-87. The IJ granted the motion to reopen, and a new hearing date was set. <em>Id. </em>at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">In February 2001, Lin filed an application for cancellation of removal, seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 1117-34. He claimed that he would be persecuted in China under the country\u2019s birth control policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1130. Lin attached an affidavit to his application in which he provided a brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>personal narrative. <em>Id. </em>at 1137. Lin stated that he was born and previously resided in Fujian Province, China, and that he married his wife, Bi Xian Zheng (\u201cZheng\u201d), in 1988. He registered his marriage with the government in 1989. After her first child was born, Zheng was forced to have an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) implanted by Chinese family planning officials. She later had the device removed by a private physician due to pain and discomfort. Soon thereafter, Zheng became pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child. Lin stated that he left China for the United States in October 1990, shortly after his wife became pregnant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Mindful that her second pregnancy was in violation of China\u2019s birth control policy, Zheng went into hiding from family planning officials. Government officials soon learned of the pregnancy and arrested Lin\u2019s mother when she refused to divulge Zheng\u2019s location. Zheng gave birth to the child in secret and a large fine was imposed on her for violating China\u2019s family planning laws. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Lin stated that he divorced Zheng in 1994. Four years later, he reconciled with her after she arrived in the United States with her son. Lin and Zheng then had a third child together in the United States. Lin stated that, if forced to return to China, he or his wife would be sterilized, and they wanted to have more children. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Lin attached a copy of an article by Dr. John Aird, an expert on China\u2019s family planning laws, to his February 2001 affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-48. The article described the coercive aspects of China\u2019s one-child policy and concluded that China maintained its coercive birth control tactics despite stories to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 1235-48. Also attached was a transcript from a 1998 Nightline television broadcast in which former Chinese officials and China experts discussed forced sterilizations and abortions in the country. <em>Id. </em>at 1249-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">1. Lin\u2019s 2003 Supplement</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">In May 2003, Lin supplemented his application and included the asylum applications of his wife and son. <em>Id. </em>at 817-37. He also filed a supplemental affidavit in which he largely reiterated his previous statements. <em>Id. </em>at 840-43. Lin did state for the first time in his supplemental affidavit that his wife was forced to undergo an abortion in China when she became pregnant after the couple\u2019s first child. <em>Id. </em>at 840. Lin also explained that his wife was forced to pay three separate fines after their second child was born: one to obtain her mother-in-law\u2019s release from custody, one to pay for the second child\u2019s registration with the government, and one for her refusal to identify the doctor who delivered their second child. <em>Id. </em>at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Lin\u2019s supplemental asylum application also included an affidavit from Zheng which largely matched Lin\u2019s statements regarding their dealings with family planning officials in China. <em>Id. </em>at 848-51. In addition, Lin included a note from his son that stated that he would experience hardships if he and his family were forced to return to China as he does not read or write Chinese characters. <em>Id. </em>at 858-60. Finally, Lin attached several documents to his supplemental affidavit, including a \u201cPlanned Birth Control Operation Certificate\u201d from a Chinese hospital which indicated that Zheng had a midterm induced abortion. <em>Id. </em>at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">2. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">In response, DHS filed the following documents related to Zheng\u2019s immigration proceedings: (1) Zheng\u2019s asylum application; (2) the transcript from Zheng\u2019s asylum hearing; (3) a DHS forensic report; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>and (4) the 2004 State Department Country Report. <em>Id. </em>at 696-1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">a. IJ\u2019s Decision Regarding Zheng\u2019s Asylum Application</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In her asylum application, Zheng contended that she was forced to have an abortion and was forced to submit a bond to ensure her return for sterilization in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 706-07. The IJ denied Zheng\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, finding that her testimony was not credible because her claim to a forced abortion was contradicted by a State Department Report that indicated certificates of abortion were only issued if the abortion was voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 724-25. The IJ also noted that the State Department indicated that there were no forced abortions in the Fuji-an province and that birth control laws were not aggressively enforced there. <em>Id. </em>at 725-26. The IJ also questioned the authenticity of the documentary evidence submitted. <em>Id. </em>at 728-29. The IJ further found that Zheng failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 728-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">b. Zheng\u2019s Asylum Hearing Transcript</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Also included in the government documentation was the transcript from Zheng\u2019s January 2000 asylum hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 738-814. During Zheng\u2019s hearing, the DHS objected to the authenticity of Chinese documents submitted by Zheng on grounds that they could not be verified. <em>Id. </em>at 758. Zheng testified that though she was then divorced from Lin, she continued to live with him in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 762-63. She testified to having three children, one who was born in the United States, one born in China who was in the United States, and one that was born and resided in China. <em>Id. </em>at 764. Zheng stated that she had her first child at age twenty-two before China enacted regulations requiring that women wait until they were twenty-five. <em>Id. </em>at 770. She claimed that she was married at the time to Lin though the couple had not yet registered their marriage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">She stated that twenty days after giving birth to her first child she became pregnant again. <em>Id. </em>at 771. The pregnancy was discovered when she was taken to a hospital to have an IUD implanted. <em>Id. </em>at 771-72. Zheng testified that she was three months pregnant when she was taken to a hospital and forced to have an abortion. <em>Id. </em>at 771-73. When she became pregnant a third time with her second child, Zheng claimed that she hid from family planning officials at her brother\u2019s house and her mother was arrested for not disclosing where she was. <em>Id. </em>at 777. After giving birth in secret at her brother\u2019s house, she was visited by family planning officials and forced to pay a large fine. <em>Id. </em>Zheng stated that she was taken to be sterilized after giving birth to the second child but convinced officials not to go through with the procedure because her husband was out of the country. She then posted a bond to ensure she would not give birth again. <em>Id. </em>at 779-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">c. DHS Forensic Document Laboratory Report</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">The government also filed a report from DHS\u2019s Forensic Document Laboratory which examined the Chinese documents submitted by Lin and concluded they could not be authenticated. <em>Id. </em>at 1408. The laboratory noted that based on the fee-for-service nature of the Chinese notarial system, documents such as the birth certificates and payment receipts had limited value without the primary evidence from which the documents were based. <em>Id. </em>at 1409.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">d. 2004 State Department Country Report</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Finally, the government submitted a 2004 State Department Country Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>which stated that Chinese documents were subject to widespread fraud and fabrication, particularly documents related to birth and birth control measures. <em>Id. </em>at 1438. The report noted significant problems with notarial documents originating in the Fujian province as well. <em>Id. </em>The report also underscored the lack of evidence of forced abortions or sterilizations occurring in the Fujian province in the previous ten years, apart from isolated incidents in the 1980s and early 1990s. <em>Id. </em>at 1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">B. <em>Lin\u2019s 2003 Hearing Before the IJ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Lin\u2019s testimony before the IJ largely tracked the information that he provided in his supplemental affidavit, with a few notable additions. Lin testified that he was twenty-four when he married Zheng. He also fleshed out his rationale for divorcing his wife, claiming that he did so in order to enable her to attempt a sham marriage with a U.S. citizen to gain entry into the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In addition to his testimony, several exhibits were introduced at the hearing, including the 1998 and 2002 State Department Country Reports for China. <em>Id. </em>at 220-321. Also included was an affidavit from Dr. Aird which outlined instances of forced abortion and sterilization in China and criticized the holdings of the IJ in Zheng\u2019s asylum case. <em>Id. </em>at 324-71. Attached to the affidavit were numerous exhibits cited by Dr. Aird in his affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 425-682. In addition, Lin entered into evidence an affidavit from Dr. Jacques deLisle, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, stating that the Chinese documents submitted by Lin appeared to be authentic. <em>Id. </em>at 685-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The IJ did not make a decision at the time of the hearing so that she could review the extensive documentary evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 81. The IJ then denied Lin\u2019s application in a written decision, finding that Lin\u2019s testimony in support of his application was not credible. <em>Id. </em>at 77-101. The IJ noted that Lin testified that Zheng became pregnant in October 1989 after giving birth on 15 September 1989 and then became pregnant again in July 1990 after her IUD was removed in June 1990. While stating that it was \u201cnot out of the realm of medical possibility,\u201d the IJ found it unlikely that Zheng could become pregnant six weeks after giving birth and one month after having her IUD removed. <em>Id. </em>at 92. In addition, the IJ noted that Lin testified that family planning officials would arrest or forcibly sterilize women who missed IUD appointments, however, Lin\u2019s wife missed more than three appointments and was only levied a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">The IJ also noted inconsistencies between Lin\u2019s testimony and that of Zheng. Lin testified that he married Zheng when he was twenty-four years old, while she testified that they were twenty-two. In addition, Lin testified that Zheng became pregnant six weeks after giving birth whereas she testified that she conceived after only twenty days. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">With regard to the corroborating documentation, the IJ noted that such documentation was tainted by reports of widespread fraud and fabrication in China and consequently assigned the documents limited value. In addition, the IJ noted that Zheng\u2019s abortion certificate listed a midterm abortion but that Lin had testified his wife was two months pregnant at the time of the abortion. The IJ rejected Lin\u2019s testimony that the time discrepancy was the result of a clerical error. <em>Id. </em>at 93-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">The IJ then denied Lin\u2019s asylum claim, finding Lin had not provided sufficient evidence that he or his wife suffered past prosecution or that they had a credible fear of future prosecution. Specifically, the IJ found that Lin could not show past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>persecution because his account of the forced abortion was incredible and the record was otherwise devoid of any other evidence of past persecution. Lin did not show a subjectively genuine fear of future persecution based on the fact that he was not credible. Additionally, he did not show an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution because his fear of being forcibly sterilized was not supported by the documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The IJ found that if Lin could not meet the standard for asylum, he could not meet the higher standard for withholding. The IJ also denied relief under CAT, finding that Lin\u2019s testimony was not credible and that Lin could safely relocate internally in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">C. <em>Lin\u2019s Appeal to the BIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Lin appealed to the BIA and also moved for the case to be remanded to the IJ for further proceedings. In his notice of appeal, Lin alleged that the IJ erred in discrediting his testimony based on minor inconsistencies and speculation. In his brief to the BIA, Lin contended that the IJ erred by rejecting all the documentary evidence without making a ruling as to the authenticity of specific documents. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. With regard to the abortion certificate, Lin claimed that the IJ should not have rejected it as he had adequately explained that the reference to a midterm abortion was a clerical error that the hospital refused to correct. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Lin also alleged that he had established eligibility for asylum relief based on past persecution by providing extensive documentary evidence and detailed personal testimony. He also claimed that he had established a well-founded fear of future persecution, noting that he provided evidence that foreign-born children to Chinese nationals were treated as Chinese citizens and that there was an official policy of forced sterilization in Fujian Province for those returning to China who have more than one child. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA noted that the IJ found a series of reasons to be suspicious of Lin\u2019s claim of persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The BIA found that while no single reason would lead to a conclusion that Lin\u2019s story was untrue, the \u201caccumulated effect\u201d of the issues led to a conclusion that Lin failed to meet his burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The BIA discounted Lin\u2019s argument that the IJ improperly rejected the documentary evidence, finding that the IJ\u2019s decision was proper considering the record as a whole. The BIA found that \u201c[i]nasmuch as the applicant did not credibly testily,\u201d there was no basis to overturn the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>The BIA also rejected Lin\u2019s motion to remand, finding that the factors for granting remand did not warrant a granting of the motion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Lin makes three arguments in support of his appeal. First, the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Second, the IJ improperly rejected the bulk of Lin\u2019s documentary evidence. Third, the IJ erred in denying Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">A. <em>Whether Substantial Evidence Supports the IJ\u2019s Adverse Credibility Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Lin argues that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it was not supported by substantial evidence and was based on mischaracterizations of Lin\u2019s testimony, the IJ\u2019s speculation and conjecture, and the improper rejection of supporting documents. Furthermore, Lin argues that the IJ erred in finding inconsistencies in his testimony because he adequately explained any discrepancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>We \u201creview only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, we will only review the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent it refers to the reasoning of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">\u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 2004). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires that \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test as well and we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IJ must make \u201cclean\u201d credibility determinations. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJq\">[T]he IJ [or BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-10\"><em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if an applicant produces evidence other than his testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Much of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination hinges on seemingly minor inconsistencies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although many of our sister circuits have held that in order to support an adverse credibility finding, such inconsistencies must go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim\u201d to be sufficient grounds for such a finding, we have yet to adopt the \u201cheart of the claim\u201d test in a published opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Gao v. Ash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number><em>croft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination regarding Lin\u2019s claim that his wife was forced to have an abortion was supported by substantial evidence. The record contains several inconsistencies between Lin\u2019s testimony, Zheng\u2019s testimony, and the abortion certificate submitted as evidence of the abortion. Lin testified that his wife became pregnant six weeks after giving birth to their first child. Zheng testified it was only twenty days. Lin testified that his wife was two months pregnant when the abortion occurred. Zheng testified that she was three months pregnant. Lin testified that the abortion certificate submitted into evidence had a clerical error as his wife did not receive a midterm abortion. Zheng testified that the document evidenced her midterm abortion and did not testify that the document was in error. Lin testified that his wife was forced to have an abortion but the abortion certificate indicated that the abortion was \u201cplanned.\u201d Administrative Record at 910. Perhaps most tellingly, Lin never mentioned his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion in his original 2001 asylum application. Given these discrepancies, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding regarding Lin\u2019s claim that his wife had a forced abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Substantial evidence also supported the adverse credibility finding as to Lin\u2019s testimony that he or his wife would be persecuted if returned to China. There are several discrepancies between Lin and Zheng\u2019s testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the birth of their second child. Lin testified that his wife hid from family planning officials at his aunt\u2019s house where his second child was born. Zheng testified that she hid at her brother\u2019s house. Lin testified that his mother was arrested when she would not disclose where his wife was hiding whereas Zheng testified that her own mother was arrested. Lin and Zheng testified that they feared sterilization if returned to China, but both also testified that Zheng received only a fine for violating China\u2019s family planning law. In addition, both Lin and Zheng testified that government officials allowed families to have more than one child in their region. Given these discrepancies, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding with regard to Lin\u2019s testimony regarding the response of government officials after the birth of their second child.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The IJ was free to reject Lin\u2019s explanations of the discrepancies in his testimony. Lin argues that the IJ erroneously discredited his testimony given that he explained many of the inconsistencies. For example, he testified that the abortion certificate contained a clerical error the hospital refused to correct, Zheng was fined instead of sterilized because he was outside of the country, he simply miscalculated his age of marriage, and his wife refers to her mother-in-law as \u201cmother.\u201d Credibility determinations are left to the IJ and BIA. We can only overturn them if the record compels it, and here it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Finally, Lin asserts that the IJ erred in finding that it was implausible that his wife could get pregnant six weeks after giving birth and pregnant one month after having her IUD removed. Lin is correct in arguing that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. There is no medical evidence included in the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ord which would support the IJ\u2019s finding that the pregnancies were unlikely to have occurred when Lin testified. Lin argues that if any reason cited by the IJ for finding Lin\u2019s testimony incredible is determined to be erroneous, we must reverse the IJ\u2019s entire credibility determination. However, Lin cites no case law in support of this proposition. Because the bulk of the IJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record, the fact that one of the IJ\u2019s conclusions was incorrect does not compel us to overturn the entirety of the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. Because the BIA and IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and the finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record, we conclude that the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">B. <em>Whether the IJ Erred in Rejecting Lin\u2019s Documentary Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Lin argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision because the IJ improperly rejected much of the documentation he submitted as evidence simply because the documents were products of the Chinese notarial system. He also contends that there is no evidence that the IJ or BIA considered the documentary evidence he submitted regarding conditions in China and instead overly relied on the State Department Country Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">As previously discussed, we review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, which requires that \u201cwe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027. We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation marks omitted). We have held that the BIA and IJ are entitled to rely heavily on the State Department Country Reports. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not allow us to reweigh ... from scratch the importance to be placed on the [Country] Report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The IJ\u2019s treatment of the documentary evidence is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ did not reject the documentary evidence as Lin argues but instead gave it limited weight. First, Lin challenges the limited value the IJ placed on the certificate of abortion he submitted as proof his wife received a forced abortion. As discussed above, portions of the abortion certificate were inconsistent with Lin\u2019s testimony. For example, Lin testified his wife was two months pregnant when the abortion occurred and the certificate stated it was a midterm abortion. In addition, the government provided a State Department Report, which indicated widespread fraud and fabrication in such documents, especially those from the Fujian province. Also, the government could not verify the authenticity of the document and noted the limited value of documents obtained from China\u2019s fee-for-service notarial system. Based on this record, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s decision to give the abortion certificate limited value.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Second, the IJ did not err in giving limited weight to the additional documents submitted from China. As discussed, the government submitted evidence of the unreliability of documents procured through the Chinese notarial system. As such, there was evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s decision to give these documents limited weight. Moreover, the IJ did not reject the factual propositions underlying the bulk of Lin\u2019s documentary evidence. The documents at issue consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>ed of Lin\u2019s marriage certificates, his children\u2019s birth certificates, and documents related to the fines paid for violating family planning laws. There is no indication that the IJ rejected Lin\u2019s claim to being married to Zheng, to having fathered three children, or that Zheng was fined for violating family planning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Finally, the IJ reviewed the additional documentary evidence submitted by Lin and did not err by overly relying on the State Department Country Report. While the IJ did not discuss each document submitted by Lin in her report, the IJ specifically allocated herself additional time to complete her \"written report noting the \u201cextensive documentation submitted in support of Lin\u2019s claim.\u201d Administrative Record at 81. Because the IJ specifically delayed issuing her decision in order to review the documentary evidence, Lin\u2019s contention that the IJ ignored this evidence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">C. <em>Whether the IJ Erred in Denying Lin\u2019s Application for Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and Relief under the CAT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Lin contends that the BIA and IJ erred in determining he was ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. He argues that he established past persecution because his wife was forced to undergo an abortion. In addition, he argues that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution because he is likely to be sterilized upon his return to China based on his violation of China\u2019s one-child policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(l)(2007). The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)(2007). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cTo establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that [he] was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">If he cannot show past persecution, the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both (1) subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable, and (2) on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>The subjective component can be proven \u201cby the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Furthermore, the petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The petitioner must establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d on account of the statutory factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (quotation marks omitted). However, the alien does not need to prove that he or she would be singled out for persecution if (1) there is a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution against similarly situated individuals and (2) the alien establishes his inclusion within that group of individuals such that his fear of persecution upon return is reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(2)(C)(iii)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation marks and internal alterations omitted). The \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the alleged incidents of persecution must amount to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861-62 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We generally lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review where the petitioner did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to hear arguments on appeal that were not raised before the BIA because the petitioner has not exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Because Lin did not challenge the denial of his claims to withholding of removal and CAT relief before the BIA, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and we lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments. In addition, Lin failed to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to remand in his initial brief, and so has abandoned that issue. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Lin argued before the BIA that the IJ erred in denying his claim for asylum because his testimony and the documentary evidence established that his wife had suffered past persecution, and that he and his wife had a well-founded fear that if they returned to China they would be sterilized. Because Lin exhausted administrative review of his claim for asylum, we may consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision that Lin failed to establish past persecution. The record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Lin\u2019s testimony that his wife was forced to have abortion was not credible, and the IJ properly gave limited weight to the abortion certificate submitted by Lin. Because Lin did not provide any additional evidence in support of his claim, the IJ correctly found that Lin failed to meet his burden of establishing that he or his wife suffered past persecution by being forced to have an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">While the arrest of Lin\u2019s mother might support a claim of past persecution, Lin did not raise this issue with the BIA or argue it in his initial brief. As such, Lin has abandoned the issue, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>Alim, </em>446 F.3d at 1253; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1282 n. 12. Lin also failed to present evidence of any other instance of possible past persecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Thus, he failed to show he suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision that Lin failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. As discussed, Lin testified that his wife received a fine after the birth of their second child in violation of China\u2019s family-planning laws. Also, both Lin and Zheng testified that couples were allowed to have more than one child in their region. In addition, as noted above, the IJ did not err in relying on the State Department Country Report for China, which stated that coercive techniques have not been employed to enforce family planning laws in Fujian Province since the early 1990s. Because Lin\u2019s wife was not previously subjected to coercive techniques and the Country Report indicated those techniques are not used, the BIA did not err in finding that Lin failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution as he failed to show a subjectively genuine or objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Lin petitions us for review of the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s removal order and denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. We concur with the BIA and conclude that Lin\u2019s testimony was not credible and that he had not met his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum. Because Lin\u2019s only claims before the BIA concerned the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application and a motion to remand, we lack jurisdiction to consider his arguments for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Accordingly, we DISMISS Lin\u2019s petitions for withholding of removal and CAT relief and DENY Lin\u2019s petition for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">PETITION DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-13\">. Lin\u2019s case predates the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), which renamed deportation and exclusion proceedings as removal proceedings. In this case, we employ the post-IIRIRA term \"withholding of removal\u201d as that term is used by the parties and there is no functional difference between the terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">. We do not apply the \"totality of the circumstances\u201d test regarding credibility determinations as set out in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) as Lin's asylum application predates passage of that amended portion of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-13\">. We have, however, addressed the test in our nonprecedential, unpublished opinions. In <em>Thamsir v. United States Attorney General, </em>we stated that inconsistencies must go to the heart of a petitioner's claim in order for an IJ or the BIA to find an alien not credible. <em>Thamsir v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>167 Fed.Appx. 788, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>790 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Conversely, in <em>Drejaj v. United States Attorney General, </em>we questioned the \u201cheart of the claim\u201d test because there is no statutory or regulatory basis for it. <em>Drejaj v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>192 Fed.Appx. 847, 854 n. 4 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
