On appeal, Townsend\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in sentencing Townsend under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000), when the Government did not allege his prior convictions in the indictment and was not required to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. Townsend was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">We review Townsend\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 590, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires us to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2525, 171 L.Ed.2d 805 (2008). We then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding our presumption).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in sentencing Townsend to the mandatory minimum prison term. Townsend does not challenge the existence of his prior convictions or their qualification as predicate offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Rather, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), has been effectively abrogated. We have rejected this argument. See <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005). The district court properly determined Townsend had three or more prior convictions for a violent felony and/or serious drug offense, and that his guideline range was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>180 to 188 months. The district court then granted his request for a sentence at the low end of the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
