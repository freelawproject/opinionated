In his appeal to the BIA, Barrera-Rosales failed to challenge the determination of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) that he was not entitled to asylum as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-20\">Judicial review of a final removal order may be had only if \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Because exhaustion is statutorily required, the failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to this court\u2019s consideration of the issue. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">To prevail on his asylum claim, Barrera-Rosales must show that the BIA erred in affirming (1) the IJ\u2019s determination regarding statutory eligibility for asylum and (2) the determination that he was not entitled to asylum as a matter of discretion. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Because Barrera-Rosales did not challenge the discretionary denial of asylum in his appeal to the BIA, he has not exhausted that issue, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-22\">Barrera\u2019s withholding-of-removal claim also fails. He argues that he is eligible for withholding of removal because he experienced past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his membership in a particular social group. Under the substantial-evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 8 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). The record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s finding that Barrera did not demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">For the forgoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
