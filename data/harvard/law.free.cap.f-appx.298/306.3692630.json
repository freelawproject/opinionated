Rodriguez contends that the BIA and IJ erred by refusing to afford her the benefit of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I), which excludes time spent in the United States by a minor from the calculation of a period of unlawful presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-26\">The plain language of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii)(I) limits its application to \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i). <em>Cf. United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (looking first to plain language in interpreting statute). Rodriguez was deemed inadmissible under another provision, \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C), which sets forth more culpable conduct than does subsection (a)(9)(B). <em>See Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>409 F.3d 246, 255-56 (5th Cir.2005) (distinguishing subsections). Further, \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C) has its own exception and waiver provisions, which do not include any exception for minors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(ii) <em>&amp; </em>(iii). The inclusion of some waivers implies the exclusion of others. <em>See Thompson v. Goetzmann, </em>337 F.3d 489, 499 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that, although \u201cunlawful presence\u201d has the same general meaning in subsections (a)(9)(B) and (a)(9)(C), there is no presumption \u201cthat the waiver provisions are also incorporated, particularly where they are contained in separate provisions and not within the definition itself.\u201d <em>Acosta v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 550, 557 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201chardship\u201d waiver of \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B) was not incorporated into \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Rodriguez was properly held to be removable under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C). Her petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
