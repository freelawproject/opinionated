Ocampo claims: although his sentence was within the advisory guidelines range, it should not be presumed reasonable because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), wherein the Supreme Court recognized that certain Guidelines do not take account of empirical data and national experience. Ocampo also contends that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>guidelines sentence was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g. United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in the light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using the above-referenced abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. A </em>sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Citing <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575, Ocampo asserts his within-guidelines sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Ocampo contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, used to calculate his advisory sentencing range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d He portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\"><em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack-cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Ocampo has demonstrated neither that there was any procedural error with respect to his sentence nor that it was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Neither has he rebutted the presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence. Accordingly, he has not shown that his sentence was an abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
