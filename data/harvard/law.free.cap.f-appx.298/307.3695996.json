He was indicted for being found in the United States in violation of \u00a7 1326, and the judgment states, under the heading \u201cNature of the Offense,\u201d that he was adjudicated guilty of \u201cre-entry of a deported alien.\u201d Prieto-Hernandez asserts that the offense of illegal reentry is distinct from the offense of being found in the United States. He seeks a remand pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 for correction of the judgment to reflect the proper offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Rule 36 authorizes us to correct only clerical errors, which occur when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Steen, 55 </em>F.3d 1022, 1025-26 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). Section 1326 is entitled \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens\u201d and provides, inter alia, that any alien who has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed, and who subsequently enters, attempts to enter, \u201cor is at any time found in, the United States\u201d without having obtained required consent or without showing that such consent is not required, is subject to certain criminal penalties. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The judgment\u2019s \u201cnature of the offense\u201d description, \u201c[r]e-entry of a deported alien,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326. The district court\u2019s judgment uses the term \u201cre-entry of a deported alien\u201d intentionally in reference to \u00a7 1326 generally; there is no clerical error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
