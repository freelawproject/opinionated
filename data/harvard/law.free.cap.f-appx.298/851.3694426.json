Brown challenges the ruling on two grounds. First, Brown challenges the finding of the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>tive law judge that Brown\u2019s complaints of pain and fatigue were not credible. Second, Brown challenges the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden rests with the claimant to prove that he is disabled and entitled to Social Security benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(a); <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Brown was not credible. \u201c[T]o establish a disability based on testimony of pain and other symptoms,\u201d a disability claimant must present \u201cevidence of an underlying medical condition\u201d and either medical evidence that he suffers severe pain or evidence that the condition is \u201cexpected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). Although Brown has heart problems, Brown complained only once in 2001 about \u201cmild\u201d chest pain and he testified that periodic consumption of nitroglycerine alleviated his chest pain. In addition, Brown\u2019s treating physician had advised him to increase his physical activity and two residual functional capacity assessments stated that Brown could perform light work. Brown\u2019s complaints about pain and severe fatigue were also inconsistent with his testimony that he daily vacuumed and cleaned his home and walked a quarter of a mile to his mailbox, mowed segments of his lawn, and carried two and a half gallons of water for 20 to 30 minutes to water his plants. <em>See Harwell v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The administrative law judge could consider Brown\u2019s failure to comply with a treatment regimen as a factor in assessing Brown\u2019s credibility. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2003). Although Brown complains that he cannot afford the necessary treatment, Brown acknowledged at his second evidentiary hearing that the Veteran\u2019s Administration provided medications that were prescribed by his current treating physician. Medical records also establish that Brown received samples of medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The administrative law judge posed an accurate and complete hypothetical question to the vocational expert. The judge found implausible Brown\u2019s allegations of extreme fatigue because they were inconsistent with medical evidence and Brown\u2019s testimony. The judge \u201cwas not required to include findings in the hypothetical that he had ... rejected as unsupported.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155,1161 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The denial of Brown\u2019s application for benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
