On appeal, Great Lakes argues that the district court abused its discretion in staying the federal court case by: (1) failing to apply, or properly apply, the test established by this Court to determine whether to stay a declaratory judgment action; and (2) otherwise committing a clear error of judgment in resolving the motion. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">We review a federal district court\u2019s stay of a declaratory judgment action for abuse of discretion. <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 289-90, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). Under this standard, we will leave undisturbed a district court\u2019s ruling unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Ameritas Variable Life Ins. Co. v. Roach, </em>411 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2005). District courts have \u201csubstantial latitude in deciding whether to stay or dismiss a declaratory judgment suit in light of pending state proceedings.\u201d <em>Wilton, </em>515 U.S. at 286, 115 S.Ct. 2137. We, as the reviewing court, \u201cmust be mindful that the district courts are closer to the facts and the parties, and that not everything that is important about a lawsuit comes through on the printed page.\u201d <em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1332 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Indeed, the Declaratory Judgment Act (\u201cDJA\u201d) is \u201can enabling Act, which confers a discretion on courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.\u201d <em>Wilton, </em>515 U.S. at 287, 115 S.Ct. 2137 (quotation omitted). It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>In a case of actual controversy -within its jurisdiction, ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, <em>may </em>declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (emphasis added). As its use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d indicates, the DJA \u201conly gives federal courts competence to make a declaration of rights; it does not impose a duty to do so.\u201d <em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also Wilton, </em>515 U.S. at 286, 115 S.Ct. 2137 (\u201cSince its inception, the Declaratory Judgment Act has been understood to confer on federal courts <em>unique and substantial discretion </em>in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Amer, </em>316 U.S. 491, 494, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942) (\u201cAlthough the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act ..., it was under no compulsion to exercise that jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Relying on these principles, this Court has outlined nine factors that a district court should consider in determining whether to accept or decline jurisdiction under the DJA when a related state action is pending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">(1) the strength of the state\u2019s interest in having the issues raised in the federal declaratory action decided in the state courts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">(2) whether the judgment in the federal declaratory action would settle the controversy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">(3) whether the federal declaratory action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">(4) whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d \u2014 that is, to provide an arena for a race for res judicata or to achieve a federal hearing in a case otherwise not removable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">(5) whether the use of a declaratory action would increase the friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach on state jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">(6) whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">(7) whether the underlying factual issues are important to an informed resolution of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">(8) whether the state trial court is in a better position to evaluate those factual issues than is the federal court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-15\">(9) whether there is a close nexus between the underlying factual and legal issues and state law and/or public policy, or whether federal common or statutory law dictates a resolution of the declaratory judgment action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-16\"><em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1330-31. We also, after setting forth these factors, have upheld a district court\u2019s refusal to assert jurisdiction where the district court had considered only two of the factors: (1) that the state court action encompassed the entire controversy, and the federal action involved only some of the parties and some of the claims; and (2) that the federal action would improperly interfere with the state action. <em>Id. </em>at 1331. We explained that \u201c[o]ur list is neither absolute nor is any one factor controlling; these are merely guideposts in furtherance of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions in <em>Brillhart </em>and <em>Wilton.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">In light of this case law, Great Lakes has not persuaded us that the district court abused its discretion in declining jurisdiction here. As an initial matter, we recognize that the district court did not expressly cite to the <em>Ameritas </em>case, or its nine-factor test. Yet a review of the record reveals that Great Lakes itself did not cite the case, or its test, to the district court. <em>Cf. Stewari v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cthis court will not address an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>argument that has not been raised in the district court\u201d). Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s decision <em>did </em>address prongs of the <em>Ameritas </em>test, including whether the federal case would serve a \u201cuseful purpose,\u201d whether there was a better alternative remedy, and whether factual issues were important to the resolution of the federal case. To the extent the district court did not consider all of the factors, or considered other factors, we have already held that the list of factors is not exclusive, and that no \u201cone factor is controlling.\u201d <em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Moreover, we simply reject Great Lakes\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that \u201cuniquely federal\u201d issues of admiralty law are central to its federal case. As the district court noted, Florida courts are regularly required to apply principles of federal maritime law, <em>see Carnival Corp. v. Carlisle, </em>953 So.2d 461, 464 (Fla.2007) (\u201cBoth federal and state courts must apply federal maritime law .... \u201d) \u2014 an observation that is well supported by case and statutory law. Since the original Judiciary Act of 1789 and enshrined in the statute that, today, confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear maritime disputes in the first instance, the law has codified the common law right to seek a jury trial in state court on admiralty issues in the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1) (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of ... any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, <em>saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). As the Supreme Court has held, \u201cthe saving to suitors clause preserves remedies and the concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., </em>531 U.S. 438, 445, 121 S.Ct. 993, 148 L.Ed.2d 931 (2001); <em>see also id. </em>at 455, 121 S.Ct. 993 (\u201c[T]o define admiralty jurisdiction as federal question jurisdiction would be a destructive oversimplification of the highly intricate interplay of the States and the National Government in their regulation of maritime commerce.\u201d) (quotations omitted). But in any event, even if admiralty law were a \u201cuniquely federal\u201d question, we have upheld a district court\u2019s decision to stay a case where the federal case involved just such a question \u2014 the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s Wrongful Death Statute. <em>Old Republic Union Ins. Co. v. Tillis Trucking Co., </em>124 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, that Great Lakes\u2019s federal case involves admiralty law does not control the district court\u2019s decision whether to stay the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We likewise find no merit to Great Lakes\u2019s contention that the district court improperly considered Great Lakes\u2019s failure to oppose the Insureds\u2019 motion to remand the state court case. Indeed, that Great Lakes did not oppose the motion is telling, since it suggests that Great Lakes is attempting to obtain a federal hearing in a case that is otherwise not removable. <em>See Lewis, </em>531 U.S. at 455, 121 S.Ct. 993 (\u201cWe have previously refused to hold that admiralty claims ... fall within the scope of federal question jurisdiction out of concern that saving to suitors actions in state court would be removed to federal court and undermine the claimant\u2019s choice of forum.\u201d). Great Lakes\u2019s conduct therefore goes directly to one of the <em>Ameritas </em>factors \u2014 the existence of \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d \u2014 and was not improperly considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Finally, other <em>Ameritas </em>factors further support the district court\u2019s granting of the stay. As the district court recognized, there is no indication that the federal case would serve a \u201cuseful purpose,\u201d and it is clear that factual issues, including whether the Insureds made material omissions in their application, and whether the type of damage the Insureds\u2019 vessel sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>would be covered by the policy, would be important to the resolution of the federal case. In addition, because a jury trial would not be available in federal court\u2014 where \u201c[maritime claims are] exercised according to the historic procedure in admiralty, by a judge without a jury,\u201d <em>Romero v. Int\u2019l Terminal Operating Co., </em>358 U.S. 354, 363, 79 S.Ct. 468, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 59 \u2014 the state court proceeding actually may provide an alternative remedy that is more effective than the federal action, since it allows for a jury trial on the many fact-intensive questions that are central to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Under the broad discretion outlined in <em>Ameritas, </em>as well as the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Ameritas, </em>411 F.3d at 1332. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order staying the case, pending resolution of the state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-11\">. Because the district court\u2019s order would be resolving the same issues as the state court, the order staying the case effectively terminated the case, and is therefore final and appeal-able. <em>See Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 8-13, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
