He argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Special Agent Joe Paggit to testify regarding the authenticity of Cabrera\u2019s Mexican driver\u2019s license because Agent Paggit was not an expert and had no special training regarding Mexican identification documents. Cabrera also argues that the admission of Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony was not harmless as the testimony destroyed Cabrera\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Cabrera has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony concerning the authenticity of Cabrera\u2019s Mexican driver\u2019s license. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Farias, </em>294 F.3d 657, 662 (5th Cir. 2002). Agent Paggit testified that he had twenty-one years of experience working as a border patrol agent in San Diego, CA and Amarillo, TX, and that he had observed thousands of Mexican driver\u2019s licenses. He testified that he was familiar with driver\u2019s licenses from Chihuahua, Mexico, both authentic and counterfeit. He testified that he thought Cabrera\u2019s Mexican driver\u2019s license was fraudulent. Agent Paggit acknowledged on cross-examination that he did not hold himself out as an expert and that he did not have any certification in document examination or special training in Mexico. He stated that he was relying on his twenty-one years of field experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">The district court specifically instructed the jury to determine the weight to give to Agent Paggit\u2019s opinion and that it could disregard the opinion if the opinion was not based upon sufficient education and experience, the reasons given for the opinion were not sound, or the opinion was outweighed by other evidence. \u201c[J]uries are presumed to follow their instructions.\u201d <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993) (citation omitted). In view of Agent Paggit\u2019s acknowledgment that he was not an expert and that his testimony was based on his experience, and the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury, Cabrera has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence. <em>See Gutierrez-Farias, </em>294 F.3d at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">Further, any error in the admission of Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony was harmless because it did not \u201caffect[ ] the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Harper, </em>527 F.3d 396, 408 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 212, 172 L.Ed.2d 157 (2008). Although Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony impugned Cabrera\u2019s credibility, the Government presented substantial circumstantial evidence that Cabrera knew that the drugs and currency were hidden in the truck. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954-55 (5th Cir.1990) (nervous behavior, inconsistent statements to customs officials, and a less-than-credible explanation for defendant\u2019s actions are part of overall circumstance evidence from which possession and knowledge may be inferred).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Texas State Trooper Jason Henderson stopped a 2005 white Nissan pickup truck driven by Cabrera on Interstate 40 near McLean, Texas. Cabrera appeared nervous, and his hands and voice were shaking. Based on Henderson\u2019s observation of an overwhelming odor of spray paint and Bondo, Henderson asked for and received Cabrera\u2019s permission to search the truck. Henderson found a secret compartment under the hood and asked Cabrera to follow the police ear to a garage in McLean. A drug-sniffing dog alerted Henderson to the presence of drugs in the area of the suspected compartment. In the compartment, Henderson found four bundles, one of which contained 987.7 grams of 80% pure cocaine worth about $20,000. Henderson also found that the other three bundles contained $99,020.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Cabrera testified that he lives in Phoenix, Arizona, and that he purchased the truck there for $10,000 from a man named Jaime Vasquez. Vasquez borrowed the truck for a few days, drove it to Boston, MA, and left it there. Vasquez agreed to give Cabrera $700 to drive the truck back to Phoenix, AZ. Vasquez sent a man named \u201cJose,\u201d and another man, whose name Cabrera did not know, to drive Cabrera to Boston to get the truck. In Boston, they went to a warehouse where Jose introduced Cabrera to a man identified as \u201cEl Maestro.\u201d El Maestro gave Cabrera the $700 promised by Vasquez. Cabrera was driving the truck back to Phoenix when he was stopped by Henderson. Cabrera testified that he was nervous because he was in the United States illegally. Cabrera also testified that he did not know that drugs and cash were in the truck and that his Mexican driver\u2019s license was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The jury could infer that Cabrera had knowledge of the hidden drugs and currency from Cabrera\u2019s nervousness and implausible explanations for his actions. <em>See Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d at 954-55. In view of the evidence presented at trial, Cabrera has not shown that the district court\u2019s admission of Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony concerning Cabrera\u2019s Mexican driver\u2019s license \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>See Harper, </em>527 F.3d at 408. Therefore, any error in the district court\u2019s admission of Agent Paggit\u2019s testimony was harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
