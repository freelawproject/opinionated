Smalls appeals from the decision of the United States Court of Federal Claims dismissing his amended complaint as barred by the statute of limitations and, in the alternative, dismissing the amended complaint under the doctrine of <em>res judicata. Smalls v. United States, </em>No. 07-715 C, 2008 WL 2396757 (Fed.Cl. June 6, 2008). Because Smalls has not demonstrated that the court committed legal error in its decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">Smalls began serving in the United States Marine Corps on active duty on June 28, 1978. Smalls claims that, prior to entering the Marine Corps, he was not suffering from any mental or physical problems. In fact, his entrance medical report indicates that he had no preexisting mental or physical condition. During his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>service, he was diagnosed with bilateral pes valgo planus and chronic plantar fasciitis, and the Marine Corps medical board accordingly declared him unfit for duty. Smalls was honorably discharged on December 4, 1980 for \u201cphysical disability without service pay as existing prior to service and not aggravated by service .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Following his discharge, between 1986 and 1992, Smalls made several requests to the Board for Correction of Naval Records (\u201cBoard\u201d) to correct his military records. Smalls requested that his records reflect that he retired because of a physical disability that occurred during his service in the Marine Corps and that he was entitled to disability retirement benefits. The Board denied Smalls\u2019 requests, first on June 26, 1986 and, in a final decision, on November 13, 1992. Smalls appealed the Board\u2019s decisions to the Secretary of the Navy, who affirmed the decisions on April 11,1997 and again on January 5,1998. On May 20, 2005, Smalls requested reconsideration by the Board, submitting new evidence. The executive director of the Board denied his request on June 15, 2005 because the new evidence did not warrant reconsideration as it was not material. Smalls filed numerous other claims before the Board, all requesting the same correction of his military records, and all were denied by the Board\u2019s executive director.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Meanwhile, Smalls also pursued his claim in two other district court actions before his filing in the Court of Federal Claims that led to this appeal. As outlined in detail in the court\u2019s opinion, Smalls first filed suit in the District of Hawaii on November 12, 1998, seeking review of the Board\u2019s refusal to correct his military records. After a complicated appellate process via the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that case ultimately arrived at this court, and we directed the Hawaii court to dismiss Smalls\u2019 amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction as barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Smalls v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Appx. 167 (Fed.Cir.2004). We held that Smalls\u2019 claim was time-barred because, under <em>Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(en </em>banc), the six-year statute of limitations in a military pay action for back pay, provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, began to run at the time of Smalls\u2019 discharge from service, not on the date of the final decision of the Board. We thus held that Smalls\u2019 claim accrued on December 4, 1980, and he did not bring suit in the District of Hawaii until November 12, 1998, almost eighteen years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Smalls also filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on December 22, 2003, alleging the same claim. The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that <em>res judicata </em>barred Smalls\u2019 claim. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Smalls eventually filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims on October 4, 2007, asserting new evidence and asking the court to compel the Board to reconsider his application for correction of his military records. The government moved to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Smalls\u2019 claim was barred under the statute of limitations, and based on <em>res judicata. </em>The court dismissed Smalls\u2019 amended complaint as barred by the statute of limitations and, in the alternative, under the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Smalls timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">On appeal, Smalls makes the same arguments that he made before the Court of Federal Claims. He essentially argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>that, in his May 2005 motion for reconsideration, he submitted new and material evidence that should have restarted the statute of limitations on his claim. Alternatively, Smalls argues that the executive director\u2019s denial of his application for correction is a new final agency action subject to judicial review. Smalls also argues that the executive director is not authorized to make decisions that are reserved for a three-member panel of the Board. Finally, Smalls argues that <em>res judicata </em>cannot bar his claim because it was never decided on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The government argues that Smalls\u2019, claim is time-barred because it accrued on November 13,1992, when the Board issued its final decision, and Smalls did not file this suit until November 2007, fifteen years later. The government adds that the six-year statute of limitations is not subject to equitable tolling and cannot be restarted based on the newly-submitted evidence because Smalls waited too long to submit the alleged new evidence. Further, the government argues that Smalls\u2019 claims are barred by <em>res jvidicata </em>for the reasons articulated by the trial court. The government also argues that the Court of Federal Claims lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider any of Smalls\u2019 constitutional claims or claims under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal by the Court of Federal Claims for lack of jurisdiction. Wil<em>son v. United States, </em>405 F.3d 1002, 1008 (Fed.Cir.2005). A six-year statute of limitations exists for claims against the government brought in the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (2000). That limitation is a jurisdictional requirement that is not subject to equitable tolling or waiver. <em>Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 1573, 1576-77 (Fed.Cir.1988); <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008) (affirming that Section 2501 is jurisdictional in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">A disability retirement claim under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, when \u201can appropriate military board either finally denies such a claim or refuses to hear it.\u201d <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1218, 1224 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A petition for reconsideration by the Board does not restart the statute of limitations unless there is a showing of new evidence or changed circumstances. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. 270, 278-79, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987). However, to restart the statute of limitations, any motion for reconsideration must be made within a reasonable time. <em>Van Allen v. United States, </em>236 Fed.Appx. 612, 614-15 &amp; n. 2 (Fed.Cir.2007) (agreeing with Court of Federal Claims that a two-year delay in petitioning for reconsideration by the Board \u201cclearly exceeds the short or reasonable period which serves to deprive an administrative decision of finality for statute of limitations purposes\u201d) (citing <em>Chambers, </em>417 F.3d at 1226; <em>Real v. United States, </em>906 F.2d 1557, 1561-63 (Fed.Cir. 1990); <em>Dayley v. United States, </em>169 Ct.Cl. 305, 309 (1965)); <em>see Cooley v. United States, </em>324 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cReconsideration of an agency\u2019s decision must arise within a reasonable period of time.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">We agree with the government that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>tion over this case because Smalls\u2019 claim was barred by the six-year statute of limitations. The statute cannot be tolled, and it was not restarted by Smalls\u2019 submission of new evidence when he filed for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Smalls\u2019 claim for correction of his military records accrued in 1992, when the Board finally denied his application. He filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims in 2007, long past the expiration of the statute. The fact that he was pursuing other avenues of appeal does not change that fact. Moreover, his request for reconsideration by the Board was also long past the point of reasonableness and it therefore did not restart the six-year time period for filing suit in the Court of Federal Claims. Because we hold that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction, we need not decide whether Smalls\u2019 claims are also barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm, </em>the decision of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-6\">. Although we held in Smalls\u2019 Hawaii appeal that, under <em>Martinez, </em>333 F.3d 1295, Smalls' action for back pay accrued at the time of his . discharge from service, our later decision in <em>Chambers </em>requires us to consider Smalls' claim as a disability retirement claim, rather than an action for back pay. Either way, Smalls loses because his complaint in the Court of Federal Claims was filed much too late.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
