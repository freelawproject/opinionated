Because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review Joe Sr.\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his complaint, we address on the merits his claims that the district court abused its discretion in: (1) directing Joe Sr. to pay sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees, and (2) striking Joe Sr.\u2019s notice of bankruptcy case filing. After thorough review, we dismiss the appeal in part, and affirm it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-22\">Where it appears that we may lack jurisdiction, we must review our jurisdiction in the first instance. <em>Robinson v. Tanner, </em>798 F.2d 1378, 1379 (11th Cir.1986). We review jurisdictional issues de novo. <em>AT &amp; T Mobility, L.L.C. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2007). We review a district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Taylor v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>810 F.2d 1551, 1556 (11th Cir.1987). We also review an order striking pleadings for abuse of discretion. <em>McCorstin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>630 F.2d 242, 244 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-23\">As an initial matter, we must dismiss Joe Sr.\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his complaint. \u201cIt is by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>now abundantly clear that a timely and properly filed notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2006). Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), an appellant must file a notice of appeal \u201cwith the district clerk within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d Here, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Joe Sr.\u2019s complaint was issued in July 2006, and reconsideration was denied in August 2006, but Joe Sr.\u2019s notice of appeal \u2014 which did not even make reference to either of these orders \u2014 was not filed until May 2008, well over 30 days after the orders were issued. Thus, to the extent Joe Sr. is appealing the 2006 orders, his appeal is untimely and we lack jurisdiction to review them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Turning to the merits of the remaining appeal, we reject Joe Sr.\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in directing Joe Sr. to pay sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees. Joe Sr. asserts that the award of fees and sanctions \u201cshould have been premised on a proper determination of [Joe Sr.\u2019s] Sonitrol stock ownership claims.\u201d However, as we conclude above, the merits of the underlying action are not before us. And even more important to the attorneys\u2019 fees and sanctions issue, Joe Sr. has failed to show any error in the bases of the district court\u2019s award \u2014 that, among other things, the Sons were \u201cprevailing parties,\u201d Joe Sr.\u2019s actions during the litigation were \u201cdilatory\u201d and \u201cunduly prejudiced\u201d the Sons, and Joe Sr.\u2019s filings were \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201cmeritless,\u201d and \u201ctantamount to bad faith.\u201d In short, Joe Sr. has made no showing whatsoever as to why the award of attorneys\u2019 fees or the award of sanctions was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking Joe Sr.\u2019s \u201cNotice of Bankruptcy Case Filing\u201d of Sonitrol of Mobile, Inc. Although we are unpersuaded by the Sons\u2019 claim on appeal that this order is not an appealable final judgment, we nevertheless reject Joe Sr.\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s striking of a notice apparently filed by Joe Sr. on behalf of Sonitrol without the consent of any Sonitrol representatives, and in violation of an order from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Alabama. Indeed, the district court has broad inherent powers, as well as authority under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) to \u201corder stricken from any pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\u201d Joe Sr. has not made any showing as to how the district court abused its discretion in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">DISMISSED in part, AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-17\">. Former Fifth Circuit decisions, issued before close of business on September 30, 1981, bind this Court. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209-10 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">. While Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A) extends the time for appealing an order where a party has filed a motion for \"attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 <em>if </em>the district court extends the time to appeal under Rule 58,\u201d (emphasis added), the district court did not extend the time to appeal here. Moreover, Local Rule 54.3(e) of the Southern District of Alabama expressly provides that \"[p]endency of a motion [for attorneys' fees] filed under this rule does not extend the time for appealing from ... the judgment giving rise to the claim for attorneys' fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A73F\">. In addition, we lack jurisdiction over any appeal in the name of Joe Sr.\u2019s counsel, Willie James Ellison, from the district court\u2019s order directing Joe Sr. <em>and </em>Ellison to pay sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees. The notice of appeal filed in this case provided only that <em>Joe Sr. </em>appealed from the district court's order. Because \u201c[t]he failure to name a party in a notice of appeal ... constitutes a failure of that party to appeal,\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>443 F.3d at 844 (quotations omitted), Ellison has failed to perfect any appeal he may have here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
