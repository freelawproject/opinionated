For the first time on appeal, Proctor argues that his conviction should be overturned because this court, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>444 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.2006), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008), held that the statute under which he was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B), was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">Ordinarily, \u201c[w]e review a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>490 F.3d 1268, 1270 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 547, 169 L.Ed.2d 383 (2007). However, where, as here, a defendant does not challenge the constitutionality of a statute in the district court, we review such challenges for plain error. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder the plain error standard, before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain,, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283 (quotation omitted). If these criteria are met, a court of appeals has the discretion to correct the error, but \u201cshould\u201d correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1779, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) of Title 18 provides that any person who knowingly advertises, promotes, presents, distributes, or solicits through the mails, or in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, any material or purported material in a maimer that reflects the belief, or that is intended to cause another to believe, that the material or purported material is, or contains\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-26\">(i) an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">(ii) a visual depiction of an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">shall be imprisoned not less than 5 and not more than 20 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In <em>Williams, </em>we held that \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B) was facially unconstitutional because it was both substantially overbroad and impermissibly vague, and we reversed Williams\u2019s conviction under the statute. <em>Williams, </em>444 F.3d at 1308-09. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B) was neither substantially overbroad nor impermissibly vague. <em>See Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1838-47 (2008). On remand from the Supreme Court, we affirmed \u201cWilliams\u2019s conviction and sentence for pandering child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>534 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Because the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 2252A(a)(3)(B) is constitutional, we affirm Proctor\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
