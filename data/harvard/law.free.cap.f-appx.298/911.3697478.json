Following a guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>(b)(l)(A)(iii), and 846, Adderson was sentenced, based on his prior felony drug conviction, to a 240-month statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which was higher than the applicable guideline imprisonment range. Subsequently, he filed a \u00a7 3582 motion, asserting that he was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, as his conviction was for a crack cocaine offense. On appeal, Adderson reasserts his eligibility for a two-level reduction in his sentence based on this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). An error of law can constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) [18 USCS \u00a7 3553(a)] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Amendment 706, which reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) by two levels, became effective November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2007, by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1 to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs where, as here, the defendant was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (noting that defendant is not eligible for reduction, even if amendment is listed in subsection (c), if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008)(affirming the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 3582 motion because defendants were sentenced as career criminals and not based on the form of cocaine that they possessed).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Here, the district court\u2019s calculation of the applicable guideline imprisonment range resulted in a range that was lower than the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment that applied based on Adderson\u2019s prior felony drug conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Accordingly, Adderson\u2019s sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, and he was precluded from receiving a \u00a7 8582 reduction in his sentence. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\">. We decline to address Adderson\u2019s argument on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Cf. United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that this court \"will not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
