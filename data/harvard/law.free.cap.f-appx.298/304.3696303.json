McPherson, Texas prisoner # 390173, moves for a certificate of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>pealability (COA) and to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging disciplinary procedure #20070275873. He argues that (1) although he lost no previously-earned good-time credits, the mandatory language and substantive predicates of the TDCJ-ID regulations created a liberty interest entitling him to procedural due process protections during his disciplinary proceeding and (2) he had a property interest in the craftshop tools confiscated as a result of his disciplinary conviction, which deprivation also required that he be afforded procedural due process protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">With regard to his liberty interest claim, McPherson has not shown \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). With regard to his property interest claim, the district court did not address that issue below. We therefore DENY COA in part, GRANT COA in part, GRANT IFP, VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for the district court to consider only the property interest claim. <em>See Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). The district court should consider whether McPherson has stated a cognizable claim under either 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 2254 and whether the procedural due process requirements of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), were satisfied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
