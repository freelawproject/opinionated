The Appellees move to dismiss the appeal as untimely. Because the notice of appeal was not timely filed, we grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on April 7, 2008, 2008 WL 942101. The notice of appeal was filed on May 9, 2008. Because Wright failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the motion to dismiss the appeal. Also, we deny as moot the Appellees\u2019 motion to extend the time for filing an informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
