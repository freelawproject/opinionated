Hayes argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">Hayes was convicted in 1995 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); possession of firearms in furtherance of the possession of cocaine, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and possession of an unregistered firearm, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). The district court sentenced Hayes to imprisonment for 300 months for the conspiracy crime, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (Nov.1987), a concurrent term of 120 months for the unregistered firearm charge, and a consecutive term of 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>months for the possession of firearms crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In March 2004, Hayes filed a motion to reduce his sentence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied the motion. On appeal, the government conceded that Amendment 599 applied to Hayes. This Court reversed and remanded the case with directions to recalculate Hayes\u2019s sentence under the amended guidelines and determine whether to reduce Hayes\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>No. 05-12306 (11th Cir. Oct. 31, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">On remand, the district court ruled that Hayes was entitled to a two-level reduction of his base offense level, which provided a sentencing range between 210 and 262 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008); <em>id. </em>App. C, Amend. 706 (Nov. 2007). The district court considered arguments from both parties regarding the sentencing factors and sentenced Hayes to imprisonment for 240 months for the conspiracy crime, a concurrent term of 120 months for the unregistered firearm charge, and a consecutive term of 60 months for the possession of firearms crime. The court explained that it considered \u201cthe need to reflect the seriousness of the offense and promote respect for the law and provide just punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir.1999)). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">A district court may reduce a sentence when the guideline imprisonment range is lowered and the court concludes, after considering the factors in section 3553(a), that a \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This decision requires that the \u201cdistrict court ... make two distinct determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). The district court must substitute the amended guideline range and then decide whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence after considering the sentencing factors of section 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">The district court did not err in reducing Hayes\u2019s sentence. The court applied the new guideline range of 210 to 262 months, considered the factors of section 3553(a) and the arguments of Hayes, and explained that a sentence within the guidelines was necessary to accomplish the goals of punishment and deterrence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Hayes\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">Hayes\u2019s amended sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
