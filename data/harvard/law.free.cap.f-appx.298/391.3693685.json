Quijas appeals a judgment affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denying her claim for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">In applying for disability-insurance benefits and social-security income, Quijas claimed disability due to headaches, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, stress, nervousness, fatigue, memory and concentration problems, and mood swings. After her application was denied initially and on reconsideration, Quijas received an administrative hearing. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the application, and the Social Security Appeals Council denied Quijas\u2019 request for review, affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision as the final decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">Quijas sought judicial review of the administrative decision. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">Quijas claims: (1) the ALJ failed to properly evaluate Quijas\u2019 mental impairment; (2) the ALJ\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence; (3) the ALJ erred in finding that Quijas was able to perform her past relevant work; and (4) the ALJ erred in not finding Quijas disabled under the medical vocational guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">The Commissioner\u2019s decisions are reviewed \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) [they are] supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence\u201d. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d, <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); it must be \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance\u201d. <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">The Commissioner applies the well-known five-step sequential evaluation process to determine disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a); <em>see, e.g., Crowley v. Apfel, </em>197 F.3d 194, 197-98 (5th Cir.1999). The plaintiff must establish the first four steps before the burden shifts to the Commissioner, at step five, to show there is other gainful employment in one or more occupations that the claimant is capable of performing in spite of her existing impairments. <em>E.g., Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000). If the Commissioner meets this burden, the plaintiff must prove she cannot perform the alternate work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Id. \u201cA </em>finding that the claimant is not disabled at any step is conclusive and ends the inquiry.\u201d <em>Masterson v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 272 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The ALJ found Quijas met her burden under the first step because she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since 2004. For the next three steps, the ALJ concluded: (1) although Quijas had severe impairments in the form of arthritis and obesity, her mental impairment was not severe; (2) her impairments did not qualify as any of the listed impairments; and (3) Quijas retained a residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform a slightly limited range of medium work. Quijas\u2019 claim failed at step four of the sequential evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Quijas asserts her mental impairment was not properly evaluated because the ALJ failed to develop the record and relied solely on the opinions of non-examining physicians. Quijas\u2019 examining physician, Dr. Fernandez, diagnosed her with a single episode major depressive disorder. Quijas told Dr. Fernandez she was able to perform her basic daily activities. Dr. Fernandez concluded Quijas demonstrated variable concentration, weak recall, and mild weakness in practical judgment and verbal abstract reasoning. Dr. Fernandez attributed some of Quijas\u2019 deficits to her limited education. Dr. Fernandez suggested additional testing might be necessary to rule out borderline intellectual functioning and learning disability. Relying on Dr. Fernandez\u2019 report and other medical evidence, the non-examining physicians concluded Quijas\u2019 mental impairments were not severe. After examining all the evidence, including Dr. Fernandez\u2019 report, the ALJ determined Quijas\u2019 mental impairment of depression was not severe. The ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Quijas maintains the ALJ\u2019s failure to request additional psychometric testing prejudiced her. Additional testing is required only when the record is inadequate for the ALJ to make a determination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e). The ALJ\u2019s decision is based on an extensive record, which includes reports from examining physicians Drs. Fernandez and Barahona, and Quijas\u2019 medical records from Centro De Salud Familiar and R.E. Thompson General Hospital. The ALJ properly considered that Quijas had no history of mental health treatment. <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 566 (5th Cir.1995) (holding the ALJ did not err by not ordering psychological tests where the record showed the claimant was never treated for alleged anxiety, stress, and depression). The ALJ also extensively questioned Quijas about her education, prior work experience, family circumstances, daily routine, and physical and mental conditions. The record was adequate for the ALJ to conclude Quijas\u2019 mental impairments were not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, the ALJ\u2019s findings that Quijas (1) retained the RFC for unskilled medium work, and (2) was able to perform her past relevant work are likewise supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ found Quijas had severe impairments in the form of shoulder and back arthritis and obesity, but she could perform a slightly limited range of medium work. The ALJ properly accounted for Dr. Barahona\u2019s finding regarding Quijas\u2019 limited reaching ability. Dr. Barahona\u2019s physical examination did not identify any other physical limitations. The ALJ properly credited Quijas\u2019 subjective testimony to the extent it was supported by her medical record. <em>Chambliss v. Massanari, </em>269 F.3d 520, 522 (5th Cir.2001) (subjective complaints must be corroborated by objective medical evidence). Likewise, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Quijas was able to perform her past relevant work is supported by Quijas\u2019 work history report.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In sum, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Quijas is not disabled is</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
