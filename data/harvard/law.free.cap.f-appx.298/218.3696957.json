The district court sentenced Shelton to 262 months in prison. Shelton\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Counsel questions whether the district court complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Shelton\u2019s guilty plea and whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Shelton. Shelton filed a pro se supplemental brief as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>serting that the Government reneged on promises made to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea hearing but concludes that there were no deficiencies in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 inquiries. Our careful review of the record convinces us that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Shelton\u2019s guilty plea and ensured that Shelton entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that the plea was supported by an independent factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Counsel next questions whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Shelton\u2019s motion for a downward variance sentence. We review the sentence imposed by the district court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Shelton, properly calculating the guideline range and considering that recommendation in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008). <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We also find that the district court meaningfully articulated its refusal to vary from the guideline range and its decision to sentence Shelton at the bottom of the range. <em>See id.; Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guideline sentence). Thus, we conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Aecordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\"> We have reviewed the claims in Shelton\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
