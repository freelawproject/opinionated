In rejecting Lin\u2019s application, the BIA found that Lin lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review the factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994). Under the substantial evidence standard, we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 8. \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The decision of the BIA to reject Lin\u2019s testimony as incredible is based on a reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). As the record does not compel a contrary conclusion, Lin\u2019s asylum claim fails. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir.2006). The adverse credibility determination also defeats Lin\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
