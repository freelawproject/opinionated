The present dispute arose after Yeager discharged Brown because he believed that she called a friend to warn her that the Sheriffs Office received evidence that the friend\u2019s daughter-in-law was involved in illegal activity. Brown, however, claimed that Yeager unlawfully terminated her employment because of her race and gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">On appeal, Reeves argues that (1) she established a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>case of race and gender discrimination because she presented evidence that similarly situated employees were treated more favorably; and (2) the reasons given for her termination were a pretext for unlawful race and gender discrimination. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.Bd 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">A <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>case of disparate treatment is established when the plaintiff demonstrates that she \u201cwas a qualified member of a protected class and was subjected to an adverse employment action in contrast with similarly situated employees outside the protected class.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">The record here shows that while Reeves\u2019s alleged comparators all engaged in misconduct, they were not involved in or accused of the same or similar misconduct as Reeves. None of the misconduct involved warning a friend of a possible criminal investigation involving the friend\u2019s relative. Therefore, we conclude that Reeves failed to establish a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>case of race and gender discrimination because her alleged comparators were not similarly situated in that their actions were not nearly identical to Reeves\u2019s informing her friend that the Sheriffs Office discovered a photograph possibly linking the friend\u2019s daughter-in-law to criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">We note, however, that even if Reeves had successfully established a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>ease of race and gender discrimination, the district court correctly found that she did not present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Yeager\u2019s articulated reasons for terminating her employment were pretexts for unlawful race or gender discrimination. Reeves admitted that she had acted inappropriately in warning her friend. Her employer\u2019s belief that Reeves jeopardized a criminal investigation and could have jeopardized the investigators themselves was a legitimate and non-discriminatory reason for her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\">. This suit was ultimately brought only against the Coweta County Sheriffs Office, not Sheriff Mike Yeager, but as Yeager\u2019s name remains on the case style, it will be used throughout this opinion when referring to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
