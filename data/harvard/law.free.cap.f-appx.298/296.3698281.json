Jeanlouis, Louisiana prisoner # 121703, appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the defendants dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. In his \u00a7 1983 action, Jeanlouis alleged, among other things, that the defendants stopped his medical treatment for Hepatitis C in retaliation for his filing an administrative grievance concerning his enlarged breast medical condition. The district court determined that Jeanlouis failed to exhaust his administrative remedies concerning his retaliation claim and that Jeanlouis\u2019s retaliation claim lacked merit because his medical records established that he refused to continue the medical treatment for Hepatitis C in November 2006, due to the side effects of the medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Jeanlouis argues for the first time on appeal that the defendants waived the exhaustion defense by failing to raise it in a timely manner. Jeanlouis may not raise this claim for the first time on appeal. <em>See LeMaire v. La. Dept. of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Theriot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). Jeanlouis attempts to show that he exhausted his administrative remedies regarding the retaliation claim. However, a review of the three administrative grievances file by Jeanlouis, attached to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, shows that Jeanlouis did not exhaust his administrative remedies concerning his retaliation claim against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Jeanlouis does not address or identify any error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his retaliation claim and determination that the appeal would be frivolous and not taken in good faith. When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the decision. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Jeanlouis\u2019s IFP motion is not directed at the district court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision, he has not shown that his appeal is taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">Because Jeanlouis\u2019s filings do not show that he will be raising a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), his IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See id.; </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the instant appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Jeanlouis is cau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>tioned that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See \u00a7 </em>1915(g). Jeanlouis\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied. <em>See Cupit v. Jones, </em>885 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
