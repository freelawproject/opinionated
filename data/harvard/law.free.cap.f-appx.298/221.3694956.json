In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 851, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The district court entered judgment on November 2, 2007. Peg\u00faese filed the notice of appeal on March 10, 2008. Because Peg\u00faese is incarcerated, the notice is considered filed as of the date it was properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The notice of appeal is dated after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. The record is otherwise ambiguous as to when Peg\u00faese gave the notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing. Accordingly, we remand the case for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to obtain this information from the parties. If the district court determines that the notice of appeal was given to prison officials during the excusable neglect period, the court should proceed to determine whether Peg\u00faese has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
