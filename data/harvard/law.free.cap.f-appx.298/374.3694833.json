Josan asserts that his removal proceedings are invalid and should be terminated because his application for relief pursuant to the Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act was used in connection with his removal proceedings in violation of the confidentiality provision found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(c)(5). Josan also contends that the BIA and IJ erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal because his deportation will cause hardship to his family and because the IJ ignored some of the evidence when conducting the hardship analysis. He insists that his due process rights have been infringed because the cancellation places an unconstitutionally high burden on aliens seeking relief, and that his children\u2019s due process rights were violated by the denial of his request for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-21\">Josan has shown no error in connection with the BIA\u2019s decisions. To the extent that Josan challenges the . BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of his request for cancellation, we lack jurisdiction to consider this contention. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (ii); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Josan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>attempts to circumvent this jurisdictional limitation by arguing that his claim concerning the IJ\u2019s hardship analysis presents a legal question. This argument is unavailing. <em>See Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006). As we lack jurisdiction to review the hardship determination, Josan\u2019s petition for review is dismissed in part for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We do, however, have jurisdiction to consider the due process challenges that Josan raises in relation to the denial of his request for cancellation of removal. When we consider these challenges, we conclude that they lack merit. Aliens have no due process rights in connection with discretionary relief such as cancellation of removal. <em>See Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1229b. Josan\u2019s assertions concerning his children\u2019s rights are unavailing because these rights are not at issue in this action. <em>See Garcia v. Boldin, </em>691 F.2d 1172, 1183 (5th Cir.1982). Josan has not shown a violation of his due process rights in connection with the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of Josan\u2019s request for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, his petition for review of this decision is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Josan has not shown error in connection with the denial of his motion for reconsideration, in which he maintained that his removal proceedings should be terminated because they were incurably tainted by a breach of \u00a7 1255a(c)(5)\u2019s confidentiality provision. The BIA rejected this argument because (1) the charge arising from the LIFE application was dismissed, (2) Josan admitted the charge on which he was ordered removed, and (3) he had not shown that he was prejudiced by any error that occurred. There is no indication that this decision was \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Josan\u2019s petition for review of this decision is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
