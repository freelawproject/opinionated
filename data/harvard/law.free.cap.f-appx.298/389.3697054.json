He argues that the district court\u2019s written judgment of sentence conflicts with its oral pronouncement of sentence. The Government agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court imposed a supervised release term of two years. However, the written judgment reflects a three-year term of supervised release. Because the written judgment in this case conflicts with the oral pronouncement of judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the case is remanded for the district court to amend its written judgment to conform to its oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
