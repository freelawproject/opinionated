Where, as here, the BIA has adopted the analysis and conclusions of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Hoeung challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of relief based on the IJ\u2019s finding that Hoeung\u2019s testimony was not credible. He contends that his testimony did not contradict his written asylum application and materials; he asserts that his testimony simply clarified and elaborated on certain details. He asserts that the IJ misread and misinterpreted the facts, statements, and testimony and that the inconsistencies identified by the IJ are trivial, innocent oversights that do not go to the heart of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">A review of the record establishes that the IJ\u2019s finding that Hoeung\u2019s testimony is not credible is substantially supported by the record. Hoeung\u2019s arguments do not compel this court to substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994) (\u2018We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d); <em>see also Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 905 (\u201cThe panel cannot replace the Board or IJ\u2019s determinations concerning witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with its own determinations.\u201d). Further, Hoeung has not challenged the alternative conclusions that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims for asylum, for withholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, he has abandoned any challenge to these conclusions. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (issues not raised in alien\u2019s brief in support of his petition for review of decision of BIA are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
