The district court sentenced him to concurrent sentences of imprisonment totaling 168 months. We dismissed his appeal of his convictions and sentences because, in executing the plea agreement, he waived the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>On January 28, 2007, Felix moved the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his convictions and sentences. The court denied his motion. Then, on January 18, 2008, he moved the district court pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(E) to require the Government to produce audio recordings and communications on the ground that they constituted <em>Brady </em>material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Although it is not apparent from the district court\u2019s order denying the motion that the court treated it as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a reading of the motion indicates that it does seek relief from Felix\u2019s convictions and sentences. To the extent that the motion sought such relief, it was due to be denied, because Felix had not obtained leave of this court to file it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The court was also obliged to deny Rule 16 relief because the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion. Rule 16 imposes on the Government an ongoing duty to disclose information \u201cbefore or during trial.\u201d Nothing in the rule grants the district courts the authority to enforce the rule long after the criminal case has concluded. The district court\u2019s order denying Felix\u2019s motion is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. <em>See Brady v.
