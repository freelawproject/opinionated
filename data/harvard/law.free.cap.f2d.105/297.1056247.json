The contract was issued to appellee on April 1, 1918, and was in. force on August 19, 1919, on which date appellee claims to have become permanently and totally disabled. There was a jury trial and a verdict and judgment for appellee. That judgment was reversed. United States v. McCreary, 9 Cir., 61 F.2d 804, 808. The case was remanded for retrial and was retried. The result was, as before, a verdict and judgment for appellee. Appellant seeks reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">At the retrial, appellee introduced evidence tending to establish the claimed disability. To refute this, appellant introduced the testimony of medical experts, one of whom was Dr. Charles George Rattner. Dr. Rattner\u2019s testimony was given by deposition taken in New York. He was not present at the trial. He testified that he had made a full and complete examination of appellee at the Veterans\u2019 Hospital, Portland,, Oregon, on August 31, 1922, and had at. that time made a report of his findings. He had, at the time of giving his deposition, no independent recollection of the examination, but, refreshing his memory from the report, Dr. Rattner testified that the findings were negative; that \u201cthere was no disability at all, and [appellee] was entirely well;\u201d that appellee\u2019s only complaint was of gas on the stomach; that he was \u201cquite anguished and nervous\u201d when he came to the hospital, but that during his stay in the hospital the nervousness entirely disappeared; that the laboratory findings for gastro-intestinal observations were negative ; and that, therefore, appellee was discharged as a patient without any disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In rebuttal, appellee, under questioning by his counsel, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cQ. Now one last proposition, Mr. Mc-Creary. Dr. Rattner, of New York City, gave his deposition here. He said he found nothing the matter with you. Do you remember a time when Dr. Rattner attended you when you were in the Veterans\u2019 Hospital and told you there was something the matter with you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cQ. What did he tell you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Thereupon, appellant\u2019s counsel objected:. \u201cIf your Honor please, we object to this as hearsay testimony. Any attempt to impeach the doctor should have been done at the time the doctor\u2019s deposition was taken. We object to it as hearsay and not a proper attempt to impeach.\u201d The objection was overruled, appellant excepted, and appellee answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u201cA. After I finished my general routine examination the doctor called me in his office and he says, \u2018Well, McCreary, we found out what is wrong with you.\u2019 I said, \u2018That is good, Doctor. What is it?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, you will have to go to the surgery.\u2019 I said, \u2018That 'is all right, but,\u2019 I says, \u2018what is it?\u2019 He says, \u2018Well, you have got acute appendicitis.\u2019 And I looked at him. I says, \u2018Why, that is strange, Doctor.\u2019 And he says, \u2018What is strange about it?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well I had my appendix removed about a year ago, or a little over.\u2019 And then he told me, he says, \u2018Well, I have got it now.\u2019 He says, \u2018You have got postoperative adhesions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The admission of this testimony over appellant\u2019s objection was duly excepted to and is assigned as error. The assignment is well taken. The testimony was designed and intended to impeach and discredit Dr. Rattner and, in the minds of the jury, doubtless had that effect. No foundation had been laid for the introduction of such testimony. Its admission was obviously improper and obviously prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">We might stop here, but, in view of a possible third trial, other assigned errors will be briefly noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Appellee testified that in August, 1921, he went to work in a dairy; that his employer was one Wilcox; that Wilcox told appellee that appellee \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry on,\u201d meaning, evidently, that appellee was unable to work, and that appellee would have to quit. The statement that Wilcox told appellee that appellee \u201ccouldn\u2019t carry on\u201d was hearsay and was objected to by appellant on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Appellee testified that he talked to Dr. A. E. Tamasie about vocational training in 192S, but that Dr. Tamasie claimed that appellee was not \u201cfeasible.\u201d Appellee further testified: \u201cWell, he said if I got the training I would be expected to make my livelihood from that after I finished my training, but he didn\u2019t think that I could carry on, that I hadn\u2019t been able to in the past, and he could see no reason why I could in the future.\u201d This was hearsay and was objected to by appellant on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">Appellee introduced evidence tending to show that he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Thereafter, appellee testified that Dr. H. M. Read, one of several physicians who had examined appellee, told appellee that duodenal ulcers never heal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>This was hearsay and was objected to by appellant on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"AEV\">Appellee testified that he was treated in the Veterans\u2019 Hospital for amebiasis. This was either hearsay or opinion testimony on a subject concerning which appellee was not qualified to express an opinion. It was objected to by appellant on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"AfA\">Appellee\u2019s witness, Helen Lyons, an office technician (not a physician or nurse) employed by Dr-. Quentin Tucker in 1929, testified that appellee came to Dr. Tucker several times. Asked what appellee\u2019s complaints were, the witness answered: \u201cWell, his complaint, the one that worried the doctor so very much, was the condition of his heart. This was hearsay and was objected to by appellant on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"AiB\">Dr. Herbert H. Hughes, a witness for appellee, testified that he had known appellee since the latter part of 1919, and that since he had known him appellee had \u201cnever been able to do a good conscientious day\u2019s work.\u201d There was other testimony of similar import. This was objectionable, and was objected to by appellant, as invading the province of the jury. Compare United States v. Stephens, 9 Cir., 73 F.2d 695, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"A9C\">The trial court overruled each of the above mentioned objections and, in so doing, erred. Whether or not these errors were prejudicial, and whether, if standing alone, they or any of them would necessitate reversal of the judgment, we need not and do not decide. It is assumed that, in the event of another trial, the errors will not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
