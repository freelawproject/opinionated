The stipulation was executed on October 1, 1938, and the Board\u2019s order entered on November 26, 1938. This petition was filed on June 1, 1939, more than eight months after the execution of the stipulation, which provided in the first paragraph that the order should be entered \u201cforthwith\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-27\">The petition is under Section 10 (e) of the Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which gives the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cpower to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board.\u201d Entry of the Court\u2019s order is a matter of discretion. If the Board had applied promptly as it was required to do by the terms of the stipulation we should have, as a matter of course, entered the order. But it is not alleged that the respondents are disregarding the Board\u2019s order, or have failed to comply with its provisions. Practice under this Act should be prompt in order to make it effective. The long delay in this case had the effect of making unenforceable the provision in the stipulation that the order should be entered forthwith. If the respondents fail to comply with the Board\u2019s order it can again apply to us for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-28\"> 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
