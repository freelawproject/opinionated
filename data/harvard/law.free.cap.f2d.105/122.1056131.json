We are not here concerned with the insurer\u2019s liability to furnish \u201cmedical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment\u201d under the provisions of section 7 of the Act. 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On May 21, 1928, Boles Kozlowski, an employee of the Delaware Terminal Company, sustained an injury in the course of his employment which totally disabled him for the rest of his life and eventually caused his death on January 2, 1932, about three and a half years later. Surviving him were his widow, Pauline Kozlowski, and his two minor children, Peter and Henry Kozlowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In accordance with an order of compensation, duly filed on December 7, 1928, awarding him disability benefits under section 8 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 908, the appellee, insurance carrier for the Terminal Company, paid him during his life sums amounting to $3,585.57. After his death, a second order of compensation was filed on February 16, 1932, awarding death benefits to his widow and children. Under the terms of this order, the appellee was required to pay $200 for funeral expenses and to make payments of death benefits to Pauline Kozlowski amounting to $15.675 per week in bi-weekly installments of $31.35. On April 2, 1937, when the amounts paid under the above order totalled $3,914.43, and the total amount of compensation paid by the appellee both as disability benefits ($3,585.57) and death benefits ($3,914.43) equalled $7,500, the appellee discontinued all payments under the award of February 16, 1932 on the ground that it had paid \u201cthe aggregate statutory compensation in this case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">After investigation of the facts, the appellant, deputy commissioner, filed a supplementary order on August 4, 1937, directing the appellee to pay Pauline Kozlowski \u201cdeath benefits in default in the sum of $119.70\u201d and \u201cto continue payment of death benefits * * * until the death benefits paid hereunder and under the compensation order of February 16, 1932, including $200 funeral expenses, shall aggregate the sum of $7500 or until the further order of the deputy commissioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The appellee refused to comply with the order and on September 2, 1937 filed a bill of complaint in the District Court praying, among other things, that the order of August 4, 1937 be set aside and its enforcement enjoined. This relief was granted both by a preliminary injunction filed October 8, 1937, and by the final decree of the court, filed August 3, 1938. An appeal from the final order was taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Section 14 (m) which provides that \u201cthe total compensation payable * * * for injury or death shall in no event exceed the sum of $7,500\u201d, contains no apparent ambiguity. The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the phrase \"injury or death\u201d necessitates the conclusion that the limit of liability for disability resulting from an injury is $7,500 and the limit of liability for death is also $7,500. Unless that section contains some hidden ambiguity it must be interpreted literally, for \u201cwhere the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, there is no occasion for construction.\u201d 59 C.J. 953 ; United States v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., 278 U.S. 269, 49 S.Ct. 133, 73 L.Ed. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">The learned trial judge held that, as the word \u201cinjury\u201d is defined in the Act as \u201caccidental injury or death\u201d (sec. 2(2), 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 902(2), the use of the word \u201cinjury\u201d in section 14(m) indicates that the phrase \u201cinjury or death\u201d should be given a conjunctive rather than disjunctive interpretation. He said that if Congress \u201chad * * * intended to refer disjunctively to compensation for disability and compensation for death it would have used the words \u2018disability or death\u2019, not the words \u2018injury or death\u2019\". 24 F.Supp. 243, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">If the word \u201cinjury\u201d is given its statutory definition in construing the phrase \u201cinjury or death\u201d, it would read \u201cinjury or death or death\u201d which is tautological. In using the phrase \u201cinjury or death\u201d in section 14 (m) as well as in sections 5, 12, 13, 14, 29, 30, and subsections thereof, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 905, 912-914, 929, 930, we think Congress used the word \u201cinjury\u201d in its ordinary sense of \u201cdamage or hurt dona to or suffered by a person or thing\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 1929 Ed.) in which the idea of \u201cdeath\u201d is not included. As such an injury is compensable under this Act, only when it produces disability, the phrase \u201cinjury or death\u201d must be interpreted as synonymous with \u201cdisability or death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">There is nothing in the act or in the record which indicates that Congress meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201cinjury and death\u201d or \u201cdisability and death\u201d, when it used the phrase \u201cinjury or death\u201d. In the absence of such indication, we are compelled to give the Act a literal interpretation and hold that the dependents of an employee whose injury results in death are entitled to compensation for his death regardless of the benefits paid to him for disability.

Co., 69 App. D.C. 330, 101 F.2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The decree of the District Court is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
