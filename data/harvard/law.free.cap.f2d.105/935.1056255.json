We based the jurisdiction of the District Court upon \u00a7 41(1) (a) and \u00a7 41(1) (c) of Title 28, U.S.Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(1) (a, c), disregarding \u00a7 632 of Title 12, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 632, which gave it jurisdiction regardless of the amount in controversy. Federal Reserve Bank v. Kalin, 4 Cir., 77 F.2d 50. This throws out the reasoning by which we affirmed the judgment; that is, that costs were not involved because no more than nominal damages could be recovered. Nevertheless, we are not called upon to go into any further extended discussion of the merits. We concluded that if between November 24, 1933, and December 28, 1933, the defendant had complied with the plaintiff\u2019s demand and had turned over the bullion, the plaintiff would have been bound at once to hand it back. From this it necessarily follows that the refusal could not be a conversion, for the plaintiff had no right of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
