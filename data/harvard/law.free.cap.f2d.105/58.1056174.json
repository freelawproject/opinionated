McCutchen, dated November 10, 1936. In his bill he alleged the execution by McCutchen, also, of a deed of trust dated January 22, 1934, in which legal title to the same property was conveyed to Trustees Jones and Frizzell\u2014 appellees herein \u2014 to secure payment of a note executed on the same day to the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, but that the conveyance was ineffective because upon investigation he discovered that \u201c * * such alleged Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation was not a body corporate, either de jure or de facto, on January 22, 1934, * * * that such alleged Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation is not now, and never has been, an existing corporation, either de jure or de facto, and has never been authorized, by law, to enter into any contract with the said Edna L. McCutchen, as aforesaid, or to transact any business whatever * * And he alleged as a conclusion from the foregoing and other allegations in his bill, \u201c * * * that as a consequence thereof the beneficiary or cestui que trust, named in the aforesaid deed of trust * * * is non-existing either in fact or in law.\u201d He prayed (1) that a decree be issued establishing his rights and declaring a resulting trust in his favor; (2) that the deed of trust be declared revoked; (3) for an accounting of moneys received as rents, issues and profits; (4) for an injunction restraining the trustees from selling or dealing with the property described in the bill, and (5) for the appointment of a receiver. This appeal is from the order of the lower court dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">The theory of appellant\u2019s alleged cause of action, as revealed by the bill, seems to be that the trust declared by the deed of trust failed for lack of a beneficiary because the beneficiary named therein was without legal existence; and that this resulted from the failure of the officers of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board \u201c * * * to take any steps whatever to procure from any State of the Union, or the District of Columbia, or from the Congress of the United States, any corporate charter for the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation <em>as required by law; </em>* * * \u201d [Italics supplied] This quoted allegation is twice repeated, in slightly dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ferent form, at other points in the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"As6\">The pertinent section of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act of 1933<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is set out in appellant\u2019s bill and we reproduce it in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u25a0 It shows on its face that the law did not' require the Board to proceed in the manner suggested by him. The allegation quoted constituted a conclusion of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The correctness of such a conclusion is not admitted by a motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> especially when, as here, its incorrectness is clearly revealed by the very statute from which the conclusion purports to be drawn.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">Congress has at different times adopted various methods for creating federal or government corporations. In some instances it has directed or authorized administrative boards or officials to secure charters from states or from the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But this has been by no means the only method. In some cases it has created corporations by its own acts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In others it has authorized the President to create them, or to procure their creation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The method provided by the present Act was that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board should itself create the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation. This, too, is a method which has been commonly used by Congress in the past.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIG\">There is no more virtue in the act of corporate creation when performed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>state legislature, or by an officer of a state or of the District of Columbia under a general law, than when the ceremony is performed by a governmental officer or agency, specially designated by Congress for that purpose. That is what occurred in the present case. Congress provided the name of the corporation, designated its board of directors, specified its powers, and directed the Board to create it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The law presumes that the officers of the Board performed the duty imposed by the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the absence of any proper allegation to the contrary there is no reason why we should inquire further.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The duty imposed upon the officers of the Board in this case was to <em>create </em>a corporation, not to procure from some other sovereign a charter for that purpose. Subjected to this analysis, therefore, it is obvious that appellant\u2019s bill does not deny the performance of the duty imposed by the Act, but, instead, denies performance of duties imposed by no law.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Moreover, the truth of the allegations in the bill was not admitted by the motion to dismiss in this case because they were in conflict with facts judicially known to the court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Performance of the duty specified by the Act appears affirmatively in the present case. We take judicial notice<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the fact that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board issued a charter to the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, immediately after the Act was approved in June, 1933 ;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> organized the corporation and began its work six months prior to the transaction with Edna L. McCutchen, which occurred in January, 1934. These official acts have been recorded in the records and reports of the Board, which are public documents and to which reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>properly may be made for this purpose, even though formal proof thereof was not made in the court below.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The creation and legal existence of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation has been referred to and noticed by courts on a number of occasions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> most recently by the Supreme Court itself in Graves v. New York ex rel. O\u2019Keefe, 59 S.Ct. 595, 596, 83 L.Ed. 927.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Congress has recognized the existence of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation as its creature in several instances; and has appropriated vast sums of money to be expended by it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the face of these facts appellant\u2019s contention is' entirely lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We have carefully considered his other contentions and find them equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> 48 Stat. 128, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1461 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> Sec. 4. \u201c(a) The [Federal Home Loan Bank] Board is hereby authorized and directed to create a corporation to be known as the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, which shall be an instrumentality of the United States, which shall have authority to sue and to be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, Federal or State, and which shall be under the direction of the Board and operated by it under such bylaws, rules, and regulations as it may prescribe for the accomplishment of the purposes and intent of this section.
