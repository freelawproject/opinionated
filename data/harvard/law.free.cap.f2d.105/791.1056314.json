The sole question is whether prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. Section 582 of the Criminal Code provides that \u201cNo person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any of- fense,\u201d with exceptions not material here, \u201cunless the indictment is found * * * within three years next after such offense shall have been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 583 provides: \u201cNothing in sections 581 and 582 of this title shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.\u201d The indictment was found</p>\n<p id=\"b839-33\">on March 3, 1937, and fixes the date of the crime as January 23, 1934. It is stipulated that the defendant \u201cshortly after January 24, 1934, absented himself from the District of Co- lumbia and thereafter remained continu- 118 u.S.C. \u00a7 582, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ously absent therefrom\u201d until February 26, 1938; and that from January 29, 1934 to February 26, 1938, he was confined in a penal institution in Virginia. The record contains no other pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">\u201cTo be a fugitive from justice, in the sense of the act of congress regulating the subject under consideration, it is not necessary that the party charged should have left the state in which the crime is alleged to have been committed, after an indictment found, or for the purpose of avoiding a prosecution anticipated or begun, but simply that having within a state committed that which by its laws constitutes a crime, when he is sought to be subjected to its criminal process to answer for his of-fence, he has left its jurisdiction, and is found within the territory of another.\u201d The Supreme Court first used that language with regard to the extradition law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but afterwards expressly applied it to the statute here involved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly appellant, when he left the District after committing forgery, was a \u201cperson fleeing from justice,\u201d regardless of his motive in leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Appellant urges that he was no longer \u201cfleeing\u201d while he was a prisoner in Virginia. But the reason for his continued absence would seem to be no more material, on the question of \u201cfleeing,\u201d than the reason for his original departure. Moreover, the question whether he continued to be \u201cfleeing\u201d is itself immaterial. Just as \u201cany person selling drugs\u201d is equivalent, in statutory language, to \u201cany person who shall sell drugs,\u201d so \u201cany person fleeing from justice\u201d is equivalent to \u201cany person who shall flee from justice.\u201d The statute does not say \u201cany person fleeing from justice and continuing in flight for three years.\u201d \u201cWe must take the statute to mean what its language plainly imports, that a person who flees from justice before its bar takes effect shall have no benefit whatever from it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The question is not whether he remained out of the District for any particular reason, or at all ; it is enough that he did not remain for three years within the District.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-34\"> 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 582~ 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 582~</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> Roberts v.
