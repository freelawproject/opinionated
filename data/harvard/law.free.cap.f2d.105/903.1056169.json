Leonard, 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 900, handed down herewith, only in that the divorce was granted in Nevada, and the trust was in full discharge of the husband\u2019s duty to support the wife. Under the law of Nevada a settlement of the kind here in question does not conclude the divorce court as to the wife\u2019s allowance, but the allowance once made is final (Sweeney, v. Sweeney, 42 Nev. 431, 179 P. 638) unless the decree reserves power to the divorce court to modify it. Lewis v. Lewis, 53 Nev. 398, 2 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>131; Aseltine v. Second Judicial District Court, 57 Nev. 269, 62 P.2d 701. The decree of divorce contained no such reservation in the case at har, and the settlement was a final discharge. The income from the trust was therefore taxable only to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Order reversed; deficiencies expunged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
