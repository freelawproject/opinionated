The question involved is whether the trial judge had power to issue the injunction under the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-21\">The appellant, Wilson &amp; Co., is engaged in the wholesale meat business, with a plant in Philadelphia, where it processes and stores meat, shipped to it in interstate commerce, and sells twenty-five per cent of its products in interstate commerce. There are three unions involved as defendants. Local 195, the meatcutters, includes all but five of appellant\u2019s production and maintenance employees. Local 107, the truckers, has all appellant\u2019s truckers; and the members of Local 18571 are the employees of a cold storage warehouse where appellant stores its products. On December, 29, 1938, the meatcutters and truckers struck on account of the employment of the five nonunion maintenance men, to force on the employer a closed shop, and have picketed Wilson\u2019s plant, and persuaded its customers not to accept deliveries of goods, threatening them with picketing, and in some instances picketing their places of business. It is clear from the record that these activities were the result of a concerted effort of the three unions to bring about a closed shop. Judge Kirkpatrick found that there had been little violence in general, and no evidence that the three or four instances of violence had been ratified. This finding is supported by the record. As a result of the unions\u2019 activities appellant\u2019s business is virtually at a standstill.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-22\">The trial judge also specifically found that appellant had complied with \u00a7 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requiring that an empoyer make every reasonable effort to settle a labor dispute before being entitled to injunctive relief; that, with respect to \u00a7 7 of the Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> greater injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>would be inflicted upon the appellant by the denial of the relief asked for than upon the appellees by granting it; and that the appellant had no adequate remedy at law. Subsection (e) requires a finding that \u201cthe public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant\u2019s property are unable or, unwilling to furnish adequate protection.\u201d As to this Judge .Kirkpatrick said: \u201cThe picketing of the plaintiff\u2019s plant is being carried on under police supervision and control, and the police appear to have supplied protection against injury to physical property.\u201d He added that the plaintiff was not protected against loss of business with its customers. But it would be unreasonable to con'strue the subsection to include losses which the exercise of the powers of the police are hardly calculated to prevent. The words mean that only where the police can\u2019t or won\u2019t do their job of protecting physical property the court may step in. The act takes this executive function out of the courts, and leaves it to the appropriate executive officer, unless he fails to function. Heintz Mfg. Co. v. Local No. 515, D.C.Pa., 20 F.Supp. 116 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to show that the police did not have the situation under control. On this ground alone the injunction could have been refused. Knapp-Monarch Co. v. Anderson, D.C.Ill., <em>7 </em>F.Supp. 332, 337.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">Section 7 makes one other prerequisite before an injunction can issue \u2014 that unlawful acts have been threatened or committed. Appellant argues that the acts of the union are unlawful under Pennsylvania law \u2014 striking for a closed shop, coercion of appellant\u2019s customers not to deal with it, the acts of violence (even though none were proved to have been authorized), picketing in greater numbers than calculated merely to publish the existence of the dispute. It is not necessary for us to discuss whether or not Pennsylvania law condemns these activities, although it may be pointed out that the legality of the closed shop is established by statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the propriety of a strike to enforce it was recently recognized by our court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For, as pointed out by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>below, \u00a7 4 of the act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 104, enumerates certain acts <em>not </em>subject to injunctive relief. The test is objective; not the purpose or intent of the acts sought to be restrained, and not even their illegality; hut whether they come under \u00a74.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">This section provides that no United States Court shall have jurisdiction to enter injunctions in labor disputes to prohibit persons from doing \u201cwhether singly or in concert\u201d certain specified acts. These acts are classified under nine subsections, (a) to (i) inclusive; hut we need consider only those which are applicable to the particular activities in this case. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">\u201c(a) Ceasing or refusing to perform any work or to remain in any relation of employment.\u201d A strike, therefore, cannot be enjoined. Whether or not the strike in this case is illegal, because of its purpose, as argued by appellant, is therefore beside the point. The test is no longer given the uncertain elasticity of \u201cillegality\u201d. The statute, dealing strictly with procedure, nowhere attempts to define as lawful the acts which it says may not be enjoined. The purpose of the act to remove the jurisdiction of courts to enjoin strikes as such is emphasized in \u00a7 9<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which defines the manner in which the court shall make its findings. The injunction \u201cshall include only a prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the bill of complaint * * * and as shall be expressly included in said findings of fact * * A strike is not the type of specific act contemplated by the exception, which looks to a particular action of an individual, whether singly or in concert with another. We are of the opinion that Federal courts may no longer issue general injunctions against striking, but only to restrain specific acts of individuals, which we shall presently discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The picketing here complained of averaged 10 to 15 persons at a time, and on one occasion rose to 97. The subsections dealing with picketing, found in (e) and (f), are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-11\">\u201c(e) Giving publicity to the existence of, or the facts involved in, any labor dispute whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling, or by any other method not involving fraud or violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-12\">\u201c(f) Assembling peaceably to act or to organize to act in promotion of their interests in a labor dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Again, the uncertain test, expressed in the word \u201clawful\u201d (picketing) is not employed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the picketing is peaceful, unaccompanied by act's of violence, irrespective of whether it may be mass picketing, and therefore according to appellant\u2019s argument illegal in Pennsylvania, it cannot be enjoined by a Federal court. Strikes and picketing are general acts, involving concerted efforts; the. narrow limit of federal restraining power, under this act, is confined to forbidding defined acts of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">It is true that the picketing (\"assembling peaceably\u201d) referred to in (f) is \u201cin promotion of their interests in a labor dispute.\u201d Obtaining a closed shop is clearly in furtherance of the interests of the strikers \u2014 an effective step towards a more cohesive and powerful organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">Three other subsections of \u00a7 4 may be considered together:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-16\"><em>\u201c(g) </em>Advising or notifying any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>of an intention to do any of the acts heretofore specified;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-4\">\u201c(h) Agreeing with other persons to do or not to do any of the acts heretofore specified; and ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-5\">\u201c(i) Advising, urging, or otherwise causing or inducing without fraud or violence the acts heretofore specified, regardless of any such undertaking or promise as is described in section 103 of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\"> The language of these subsections, and of (e), is broad enough to include the other acts of the appellees exerted against the appellant and its customers \u2014 following its delivery trucks, and persuading its customers by threats of picketing and actual picketing to reject its goods. Where no violence or fraud is involved a district court is without jurisdiction to enjoin members of a labor union from inducing contractors and owners of buildings not to let subcontracts to members of an employers\u2019 association which favored an open shop. Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 2 Cir., 71 F.2d 284, certiorari denied, 293 U.S. 595, 55 S.Ct. 110, 79 L. Ed. 688. As found by the trial judge, the appellees\u2019 \u25a0 acts did not involve fraud or violence. Such pressure on others often loosely termed a \u201csecondary boycott\u201d, falls within the sections and cannot be enjoined. Carrying placards stating that Wilson &amp; Co. was unfair to organized labor may have been misrepresentative. It was not fraudulent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Moreover, the words \u201cunlawful-acts\u201d in Section 7(a), which must be alleged in the complaint and included in the findings, cannot be read separately from the rest of the section, and assume appropriate meaning only when we consider the section as a whole. Irreparable injury to the complainant\u2019s property, which has no police protection, is an essential averment and finding; and the \u201cunlawful acts\u201d do not constitute a general reference to anything that may be considered illegal, but specifically to the acts of violence which the authority of the executive is calculated to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">When the Sherman Act was amended in 1914 by the Clayton Act, \u00a7 6 of the latter provided that labor unions should not \u201cbe held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws\u201d;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and section 20, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 52, regulated the granting of injunctions in cases between employer and employees, and exempted certain acts from restraint. The language would appear to differentiate labor unions from trade combinations, and to exclude them from the operations of the Act. Yet the decisions have emptied the words of significance other than the affirmation of what the law had been for a long time \u2014 that labor unions are not in themselves unlawful.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The act had little effect in narrowing equity jurisdiction in labor disputes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We believe that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was adopted to prevent a similar construction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>of the Act, to quote the trial judge, was \"\u201cto take the Federal courts out of the business of granting injunctions in labor disputes, except where violence or fraud are present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-16\"> 29 U.S.C. \u00a71101-115, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b997-17\"> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 108, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 108. \u201cNoncomplianee with obligations involved in labor disputes or failure to settle by negotiation or arbitration as preventing injunctive relief.
