State ex rel. Veith vs. Capdevielle, 140 La. 812, 74 South. 110. For that reason the appeal in this case must therefore be dismissed unless protected by the provisions of Section 9 of Act 112, p. 241, of 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-21\">The cited provision is in substance to the effect that no appeal shall be dismissed on account of any error in the amount of the bond or for any inaccuracy or omission in the bond or for the insufficiency of any surety or sureties on said bond until the party furnishing such bond shall have failed to correct the error, inaccuracy or omission or to have furnished supplemental or additional bond, etc. There is here no question of any error, inaccuracy or omission, or insufficiency of surety, but no surety at all under the terms of the Act of 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-22\">We do not believe that the Aqt 112 of 1916 was intended to relieve an appellant who, although he personally signed an appeal bond, fails to furnish any surety whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">It is therefore ordered that the appeal be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
