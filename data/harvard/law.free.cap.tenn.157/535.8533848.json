The rule to the contrary was changed by statute in this State, section 5125 of the Code of 1858 (Shannon\u2019s Code, section 7088), providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cIt is not necessary for the indictment to allege where the offense was committed, hut the proof shall show a state of facts bringing the offense within, the jurisdiction of the county in which the indictment was preferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">In counties which have more than one court, with criminal jurisdiction limited to a portion of the county, this statute jias been given the effect of requiring only that the proof shall show the commission of the offense charged in that portion of the county over which the court has jurisdiction. <em>Wickham </em>v.
