Words and Phrases (First Series), Yol. 6, p. 4912.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The legislature, in our opinion, intended to make the practice of law in any of the courts in this State a privilege, which it had authority to do. 6 C. J., 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Article 6, section 1, of the Constitution of Tennessee is in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">\u201cThe judicial power of this State shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such circuit, chancery and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>other inferior courts as the legislature shall from time to time, ordain and establish; in the judges thereof, and in justices of the peace. The legislature may also vest such jurisdiction in corporation courts as may be deemed necessary. Courts to be holden by justices of the peace may also be established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">This system of courts constitutes the judicial department of the State. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Nimmo, </em>71 Tenn., 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The corporation court, provided for in the. constitution as a part of the judicial system of the State, refers to a municipal corporation, and a similar provision for such courts was contained in the Constitution of 1834.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The complainant seems- to have overlooked the fact that a municipal court is a part of the judicial system of the State, and that the municipality of Memphis is an arm of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
