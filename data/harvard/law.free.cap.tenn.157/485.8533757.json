But if the fact of this removal and his participation therein be conceded, it is apparent that the location had long been in dispute, as well as whether this particular stump, or tree, was the corner stump or tree which marked the boundary, or another of like ,description located' nearby, as contended by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The record indicates that much feeling had existed between the interested parties touching this dispute, extending over some years, resulting in a sort of neighborhood feud. It is, we think, apparent that the jury reached the conclusion, as they might well have done, that the weight of proof established both that the location and stump contended for by the prosecutor were the true ones, and that the stump had been removed by or at the instance of the defendant, and thereupon rendered its verdict of guilty. But granting that there is in this record no preponderance against such finding on these issues, is a ease for conviction under the statute invoked made out?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In the unreported case of <em>Carden </em>v. <em>The State, </em>from Anderson County, decided at Knoxville, December, 1925, this court considered facts quite similar to those now presented, and construing this highly penal section of the Code, reversed a judgment of conviction. We quote therefrom as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cEnough had been said to indicate that here was a substantial controversy. Conceding that the State has shown the better title, that this was in fact a corner tree in the boundary of prosecutor\u2019s land and not substantially east and south of said corner, is a case under this statute made out by a preponderance of the testimony? We think not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201cThe like offense of destroying a boundary fence (Shannon\u2019s Code, 6496, snb.-sec. 10) is not made ont unless it be proven that the fence was destroyed with an unlawful, wilful and malicious intent to injure the owner, and not, if if appear that the accused was acting under a belief of ownership, or right of occupancy and use. See <em>Goforth </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Hump., 37, and unreported case of <em>Belk </em>v. State, Knoxville, October, 1924, from McMinn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>119 Tenn., 521, Mr. Justice Neil construed the Act of 1897 making it a felony to \u2018knowingly, wilfully and maliciously cut or remove, for the purpose of marketing the same, timber from the lands of another,\u2019 and says, that this Court construes the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 as being \u2018that state of mind wherein the person charged was in possession of facts under which he was aware that he could not lawfully do the act whereof he was charged; knowledge of the law being necessarily imputed to him, as in all criminal eases \u2014 but not, of course, of the essential facts. \u2018Maliciously,\u2019 which is the equivalent of the words \u2018maliciously\u2019 and \u2018corruptly\u2019 in the statute now before us, \u2018is used in the broad legal sense of criminal intention, or that state of mind of a person who does a wrongful act intentionally, or wilfully, and without legal justification or excuse.\u2019 He says, further, that the three terms, \u2018knowingly, wilfully and maliciously\u2019 \u2014which have substantially the same meaning as the terms \u2018unlawfully, knowingly, wilfully and corruptly\u2019 found in Code Section 6503, must be construed together and that when \u2018taken together contemplate a case wherein a man acts advisedly, intentionally and with criminal intent. \u2019 He construes the word \u2018feloniously\u2019 to be equivalent to \u2018maliciously\u2019 as we conceive the words \u2018unlawfully and \"corruptly \u2019 to be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cThe question is not alone whether the tree cut was a corner tree, nor who in fact owned the land on which it stood. It must be established that the defendant acted <em>\"unlawfully, knowingly, wilfully </em>and <em>corruptly.\u2019 </em>This is inconsistent, of course, with any good faith belief on his part that the tree was not the corner tree of prosecutor\u2019s land. This statute has no proper application to conduct based merely on ignorant or mistaken claims or conceptions. Determination of title is not conclusive under it.. The question is, did this old man act \u2018unlawfully, knowingly, wilfully and corruptly.\u2019 Is there no good ground to conclude that he honestly believed that he was within his rights \u2014 that by virtue of his purchase and the facts indicated this tree was not on the boundary corner, but on his own and not \u2018another\u2019s lands\u2019? . . . There is much to be said in support of the defendant\u2019s theory that this tree was clearly within his boundaries and on his property. But certainly we are not satisfied that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that he actedi otherwise than under an honest belief in his claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The reasoning and conclusions thus announced have application to the instant case, with the result that this conviction cannot stand. The civil courts provide ample remedies for the protection of boundary rights which are in dispute, and resort to criminal prosecutions in such cases are not favored. Good faith differences, however ill advised and unsupported in law or fact the several claims may be, are not proper subjects for the criminal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It becomes unnecessary to consider assignments of error based on the refusal of the trial judge to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>new trial because of newly discovered evidence, or alleged misconduct of the jury in improperly giving consideration to the failure of the defendant below to testify. For the reasons hereinbefore stated and following' <em>Carden </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
