J. C. Crosby, under a license regularly issued by tbe county court clerk of said county and lived together as man and wife continuously from tbe date of tbeir marriage until bis death on March 26, 1926. During said period they held themselves out as husband and wife, and were so received and accepted by their friends, relatives and the public. Ellen Mitchell Kinnard believed herself to be the lawful wife of Bob Kinnard, and never knew that he had another wife until after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">In 1903, Bob Kinnard and Lula Bailey were married, but the latter deserted the former and left Tennessee, and was not heard of subsequent to 1907, until she testified as a witness for the defendant on the hearing of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">It affirmatively appears that Bob and Lula were never divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">It further appears that Ellen Mitchell Kinnard was a faithful and dutiful wife, and was supported by the deceased during the thirteen years that they, lived together.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the Chancellor was correct in decreeing compensation to the petitioner, Ellen Mitchell Kinnard.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In <em>Bohlen-Hwse Goal </em>&amp; <em>Ice Go. </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>148 Tenn., 633, it is said:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u201c \u2018It is a familiar doctrine that in all cases, except prosecutions for bigamy and actions for criminal conversation, a marriage may be' presumed, or be established by reputation after a lapse of many years. <em>Ewell </em>v. <em>State, </em>6 Yerg., 364; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Park\u2019s Lessees, </em>4 Humph., 480.\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bank, supra </em>(115 Tenn., 12).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cSuch presumption should have particular force when, as said by Judge Turley, the question of the legality of a marriage \u201carises incidentally, the controversy not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>between persons claiming under conflicting rights of heir-ship. \u2019 <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Park\u2019s Lessees, </em>4 Humph., 480.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-3\">\u201cWe conclude, therefore, that upon our authorities and the facts of this case the plaintiff in error cannot he permitted to deny that a valid marriage subsisted between Mose McDaniel and the rnother of the deceased, in this case where the question is purely incidental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">About six years before the death of Boh Kinnard he and his wife, Ellen, took into their home a two-months-old baby, unrelated to either of them, and reared said child as a member of their family. Said child was wholly dependent upon Bob Kinnard for its support.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In construing section 30 of the Compensation Act of 1919, which relates to those dependent upon the deceased workman, this court, in <em>Portin </em>v. <em>Portin, </em>149 Tenn., 535, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cThe conclusion, therefore, seems inevitable that it was intended by subsection 3 and subsection 3a to provide for a class of children, not necessarily his legitimate offspring, but children supported by the deceased workman at the time of his death, either wholly , or in part. We think his illegitimate child, or perhaps his adopted child, might be in this class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cAs indicated in the caption vof chapter 123 of the Acts of 1919, its purpose was \u2018to provide compensation for injured employees; or in case of death, for the dependents of such employee. \u2019 The child in this case was wholly dependent upon the deceased for support, was an actual dependent, and is, we are satisfied, entitled to the benefits of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is-not a statute of descent or distribution. It was intended to relieve society of the burden of caring for injured workmen or the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u25a0pendents of deceased workmen, and to place that burden upon the industry employing the workman. In case of the workman\u2019s death, the lawmakers were concerned for the care of his dependents, not about the devolution of the workman\u2019s property. The dependency of the claimant is the true basis of his right to compensation rather than blood or marriage. Relationship is really only evidence of dependency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In <em>Aluminum Company of America </em>v. <em>Fendnall, </em>150 Tenn., 449, it was pointed out that a stepchild, who was dependent upon a deceased stepfather, would be entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">It is apparent that if a stepchild, or an illegitimate child, or an adopted child, is entitled to compensation under the act, the test of liability cannot be made to depend upon the relationship which the child bore to the deceased workman, but the test is whether such child was wholly dependent upon such workman for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Applying this test to the facts of this cause, we agree with the Chancellor that such child is entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">It follows that the decree of the Chancellor will be in all things affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
