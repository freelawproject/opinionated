Reliance is had. on a proviso concluding the subsection reading as follows: \u201cProvided, further, that this Act and the above privilege tax shall not apply to merchants, in this State, who handle such farm products and pay a privilege tax and an <em>ad valorem </em>tax under the provisions of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The term \u201cmerchants\u201d is defined in the General Assessment Act of 1907, Section 26, referred to in Section 3 of the Revenue Act of 1927 levying the <em>ad valorem </em>tax on merchants, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cThe term 'merchant,\u2019 as used in this Act, includes all persons, copartnerships, or corporations engaged in trading or dealing in any kind of goods, wares, merchandise,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Applying this comprehensive legislative definition, there can be no doubt that, although appellees are produce dealers, they are also merchants, and this being so, they were liable as such for \u201ca privilege tax and an <em>ad valorem </em>tax, \u2019 \u2019 which they have paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">If appellees had held themselves to be produce dealers only, as defined in this subsection, and not merchants, and paid the tax of $50 imposed, and been here resisting the <em>ad valorem </em>tax imposed on \u2018 \u2018 all merchants, \u2019 \u2019 could they successfully insist that they are not merchants under the broad statutory definition of that term? Could they maintain that they are not engaged in trading or dealing in any kind of goods, wares, or merchandise, whether kept on hand for sale, or purchased and delivered for profit? \u201cMerchandise\u201d is defined as \u201cthe objects of commerce; whatever is usually bought or sold in trade or market. \u2019\u2019 Webs. New Inter.- Diet. And \u201cmer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>chant\u201d is defined as \u201canyone making a business of buying and selling commodities; a trafficker; a trader.\u201d <em>Mem. </em>The term \u201cmerchant\u201d has been held to include ice dealers, saloon keepers, druggists, butchers, and, specifically, produce dealers doing a business so limited. 40 C. J., 646, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict., page 2196. In <em>Kansas City </em>y. <em>Lorber, </em>64 Mo. App., 604, it was directly held \u201ctoo plain for argument\u201d that authority to tax a \u201cproduce dealer \u2019 \u2019 was included in the power to tax \u2018 \u2018 merchants, \u2019 \u2019 citing authorities. If merchants, and taxable as such, appellees are expressly exempted by the proviso from this special tax on produce dealers, a special class of merchants embraced within the broader term. And but for the exempting proviso this special class of merchants would have been liable for both taxes. <em>Rosenbaum </em>v. <em>Newbern, </em>118 N. C., 83, 32 L. R. A. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Now looking to the plain language of the proviso above quoted, it seems apparent that it was not the purpose of the legislature to impose a triple tax, that is, a merchant\u2019s privilege (page 318), an <em>ad valorem </em>(section 3) and the special produce dealers\u2019 privilege tax under consideration. A different conclusion would violate well-recognized rules of construction, namely, that (a) Revenue Statutes are construed against the government and in favor of the taxpayer, (b) the intention will not be extended by implication, but must be .clearly expressed, (c) that no intention to duplicate taxation will he presumed, but the contrary, and (d) that a concluding proviso is to be taken as conclusive of the legislative will. These general rules hardly require supporting citation of authorities, but see <em>Plow Co. </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>125 Tenn., 148, and citations therein on page 155; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Hauk, </em>144 Tenn., 215; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and <em>White </em>v. <em>Nashville, etc., R. R. Co., </em>54 Tenn. (7 Heisk.), 518, at page 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\">For appellant it is urged that a construction of the proviso which exempts merchants who are also produce dealers, and whose business is so confined, is repugnant to the provisions of the subsection proper, leaving it without possible application and meaningless, and authorities are cited for the general proposition that it is the duty of the Court to adopt that construction of apparently conflicting statutes, or clauses of statutes, which will save, rather than destroy. It must he conceded that there is apparent conflict, and that giving reasonable effect to the proviso operates to restrict somewhat the practical application of the special tax imposed by the subsection. It is, however, easy to conceive of classes of produce dealers who carry no stock and employ no capital to which no <em>ad valorem </em>merchant\u2019s tax could apply, and who would, therefore, be subject to the special privilege tax under consideration, and were intended to he reached by this subsection. For illustration, many produce dealers handle farm products not as merchants, hut on consignment and for a commission.; or buy for delivery direct to the purchaser; or deal altogether in farm products purchased direct from the producer, not taxable \u201cin the hands of the producer and his immediate vendee.\u201d Const. Art. 2, Sec. 28. The exemption of the proviso extends to those produce dealers only who pay a privilege tax and an <em>ad valorem </em>tax. As already indicated, we think it quite apparent that the legislature has affirmatively disclaimed a purpose to collect from those who are merchants dealing in or \u201chandling\u201d farm products a triple or double tax. The test of the applicability of the special tax to such dealers is set forth in the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>eluding lines of the proviso, exempting those who \u201cpay a privilege tax and an <em>ad valorem </em>tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">It is plausibly insisted that the legislature intended, by the opening paragraph of the subsection, to place produce dealers in a class distinct from merchants, and that, this being so, when the term \u201cmerchants\u201d was employed in the proviso, it was not intended to exempt such merchants as were defined as produce dealers in the opening paragraph. \"While this is plausible, yet, looking to the act as a whole and giving application to the rules of construction above noted, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">It results that the decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
