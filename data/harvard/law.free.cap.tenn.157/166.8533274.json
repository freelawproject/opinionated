This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>application comes more than forty-five days after the decree of the Conrt of Appeals and we are without power to entertain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Section 14 of Chapter 100 of the Acts of 1925, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cPetitions for <em>certiorari </em>to require the removal of any case from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court for review, shall he filed in the Supreme Court within forty-five days after final decree in the Court of Appeals, including decree upon any application to that court for \u25a0a rehearing or for different or additional findings; provided, the Supreme Court or any of the Judges thereof, upon application, may extend such time for filing petitions for <em>certiorari </em>for an additional time not to exceed ninety days after final decree as above defined in the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">It will be noted that this Court or any of the Judges thereof are given authority upon application to <em>extend such time </em>(forty-five days) for filing petition for <em>cer-tiorari. </em>T'o extend means to stretch out or to draw out or to enlarge a thing. It implies something in existence. Extend is a transitive verb, requiring an object. The object of the extension in the statute is the forty-five days. The forty-five days having elapsed, there is nothing to extend, no period to prolong.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">To grant time, in which to file petition for <em>certiorari, </em>after the expiration of the original term, is a power not given to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The application is accordingly denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
