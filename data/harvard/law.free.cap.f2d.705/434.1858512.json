The convictions stem from the seizure of a Browning pistol, a sawed-off shotgun, and six additional firearms from Griffin\u2019s business premises. Finding no merit in any of the contentions raised by the appellant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Griffin argues that the district court committed several errors in its jury instructions. Griffin first objects to the court\u2019s defining \u201cbarrel\u201d as \u201cthe distance from the bolt face to the open end of the barrel.\u201d Griffin contends that the shotgun barrel should be measured over its entire length, including the non-functional portion which merely serves to attach the functional barrel to the stock. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1976) makes it unlawful for any person \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\u201d The definition of a firearm includes a shotgun having a barrel less than eighteen inches in length. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)(1) (1976).. The regulations, 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 179.11 (1982), state that \u201cthe length of the barrel on a shotgun or rifle shall be determined by measuring the distance between the muzzle and the face of the bolt, breech, or breech-lock when closed and when the shotgun or rifle is cocked.\u201d We conclude that the trial court correctly defined barrel length and left the factual determination of the length of the shotgun barrel in question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Griffin also argues that the district court erred in not instructing the jury that a defendant must have travelled with the weapon in interstate commerce to violate 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). We conclude that the district court correctly instructed the jury that the firearm must have moved in-interstate commerce prior to defendant\u2019s possession. <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Griffin raises two other objections to the trial judge\u2019s instructions. He argues that the district judge erroneously instructed the jury that constructive possession can constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). We disagree and hold that under 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), possession may be either actual or constructive. <em>See United States v. </em>Smith, 591 F.2d 1105, 1107 (5th Cir.1979). Finally, Griffin objects to the trial court\u2019s instructing the jury as to aiding and abetting in the absence of a specific charge in the indictment. The government need not cite the aiding and abetting statute in the indictment to obtain a conviction on this theory. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>681 F.2d 1372, 1375 (11th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>692 F.2d 116 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Griffin mentions in his statement of the issues that the trial court erred in allowing the government to charge in the conjunctive and. prove in the disjunctive. The law is well established, however, that where an indictment charges several means of violation of the statute in the conjunctive, proof of only one of the means is sufficient to convict. <em>United States v. Haymes, </em>610 F.2d 309, 310-11 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Griffin argues on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to give a special verdict instruction. Since Griffin\u2019s counsel did not contemporaneously object to the district court\u2019s refusal, we must view his challenge under the plain 'error standard. <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>650 F.2d 84, 87 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1100, 102 S.Ct. 675, 70 L.Ed.2d 642 (1981); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Griffin initially requested a special verdict so that it would be clear that the jurors agreed as to which of the six firearms, if fewer than all, formed the basis for a violation of 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1). The district judge indicated that a special verdict was unnecessary be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cause he would instruct the jurors that they would have to agree on all essential elements of the offense with respect to at least one of the six firearms. .Griffin did not object to this course of action. Special verdicts in criminal jury trials are generally disfavored. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>588 F.2d 1242, 1251 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 2822, 61 L.Ed.2d 275 (1979). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions adequately protected Griffin\u2019s interest and that the refusal to give a special verdict instruction did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Griffin claims that the government failed to prove \u201creceipt\u201d of the firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) as charged in count one. He argues that the government has only proved possession. This contention lacks merit. In viewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Harper, </em>680 F.2d 731, 736 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 229, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982). \u201cReceipt,\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h), is interpreted broadly and includes any knowing acceptance or taking of possession of a firearm. <em>United States v. Lipps, </em>659 F.2d 960, 962 (9th Cir.1981). The court charged that \u201creceive\u201d means more than simple possession and means \u201cto get, to take, to acquire, [or] be the recipient of\u201d at a particular time prior to March 22,1982, and that the receipt was or took place in Jefferson County, Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Griffin knowingly accepted and took possession of the firearm at his place of business in Birmingham, Alabama between January 6, 1982 and March 22, 1982. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h), proof of the specific date of the crime is not an essential element so long as it is shown to have occurred after the felony conviction, within the statute of limitations, and before the indictment. <em>United States v. Francisco, </em>575 F.2d 815, 818 (10th Cir.1978); <em>see also United States v. Grapp, </em>653 F.2d 189, 195 (5th Cir.1981). Griffin was indicted on May 6, 1982, while his prior felony conviction occurred on June 2, 1978. Additionally, the statute of limitations was clearly met. We conclude that the government presented sufficient evidence to convict Griffin of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Having disposed of all of the issues raised by the appellant, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
