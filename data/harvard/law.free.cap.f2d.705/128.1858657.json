Concluding that Al-corn Bank\u2019s loss is not covered by the subject liability policy, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Alcorn Bank\u2019s comprehensive general liability insurance policy with USF &amp; G included an endorsement entitled \u201cStop Payment or Dishonor Liability Insurance.\u201d Under this provision, the insurer assumed responsibility for those sums for which the bank became liable as damages in certain situations involving dishonored or stop payment checks. The endorsement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">The Company will pay on behalf of the Named Insured all sums which the Named Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages in connection with any check, note or draft, other than a \u201ctravelers check\u201d, payable by the Named Insured and drawn, made or accepted by any depositor of the Named Insured and arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-16\">(a) compliance or failure to comply with any notice to stop payment received by the Named Insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">(b) refusal to pay or to certify such check, note or draft; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-18\">(c) failure to give proper notice of dishonor of such check, note or draft ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">The policy excludes recovery for \u201cliability arising out of dishonest or fraudulent acts of officers or employees of the Named Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-20\">Alcorn Bank seeks recovery of $36,064.30 which it paid for one of its depositors, W.M. Rhodes. On May 12, 1980, Alcorn Bank received checks on Rhodes\u2019 account, payable to Aycock Equipment Company, which had been routinely processed through the Federal Reserve System. At that time, the balance in Rhodes\u2019 account was insufficient to cover the checks. On May 12 and 13, checks from Aycock Equipment Company totaling over $114,000 were deposited to Rhodes\u2019 account. As uncollected funds these deposits did not increase Rhodes\u2019 balance, which remained insufficient. Notwithstanding this inadequacy, the president of Alcorn Bank, Robert Farmigoni, approved the payment of the checks drawn against Rhodes\u2019 account.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-21\">On May 14, at the suggestion, perhaps urging, of bank examiners, Alcorn Bank attempted to improve its legal position by issuing notice of dishonor on Rhodes\u2019 checks. The effort came too late. Under both Mississippi and federal law, the checks were automatically paid through the Federal Reserve System when they were not timely dishonored. Checks received by a bank through the Federal Reserve System are considered honored by failure to meet a \u201cmidnight deadline.\u201d <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u00a7 75-4-302 (1972); <em>National City Bank v. Motor Contract Co., </em>119 Ga.App. 208, 166 S.E.2d 742 (Ga.App.1969). Although banks may avoid this automatic payment by filing a notice of dishonor before midnight of the day after receipt, no timely notice was provided by Alcorn Bank. This failure obligated the bank to honor Rhodes\u2019 checks to Aycock. Alcorn Bank seeks to recover the amount paid on the checks from its insurer, USF &amp; G.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Alcorn Bank\u2019s suit in state court was removed by USF &amp; G to federal court. After full discovery, both parties sought summary judgment. Concluding that the policy does not cover losses sustained by the bank but only those suffered by third persons for which the bank was liable, the court granted summary judgment to USF &amp; G and denied the bank\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>The Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The insurance contract before us is a comprehensive general liability policy purchased by Alcorn Bank to protect it from various liability exposures. The endorsement at issue focuses on liability arising out of errors in the handling of stop payment or dishonor notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Alcorn Bank correctly contends that most of the endorsement\u2019s conditions are met: the involved checks were drawn by a depositor, payable by Alcorn Bank, and the loss at issue resulted from failure to give proper notice of dishonor. Further, because of its untimely dishonor notice, Alcorn Bank was legally obligated to pay Rhodes\u2019 checks to Aycock Equipment Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The endorsement is express. Under the policy, USF &amp; G agrees to \u201cpay on behalf of [Alcorn Bank] all sums which [Alcorn Bank] shall become legally obligated to pay as damages\u201d in certain instances involving the stop payment or dishonoring of checks, notes and drafts. The essential question is whether the money Alcorn Bank paid Aycock Equipment on Rhodes\u2019 checks constitutes \u201cdamages\u201d within the intendment of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In this diversity case we apply the substantive law of Mississippi. The Supreme Court of Mississippi has provided some guidance in noting a distinction between \u201closses\u201d sustained by the insured and \u201cdamages\u201d sustained by third persons. In a garnishment action seeking payment of a judgment in a tort suit, the Mississippi court quoted this court and distinguished \u201cindemnity against liability [to third persons]\u201d from \u201cindemnity against loss [by the insured].\u201d <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co. v. Skinner, </em>190 Miss. 533, 1 So.2d 225, 226 (1941) <em>(quoting Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation v. Bodron, </em>65 F.2d 539, 540 (5th Cir.1933)). In <em>American National Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>215 So.2d 245, 249 (Miss.1968), the Mississippi court referred to \u201cthe distinction between liability and indemnity contracts.\u201d This distinction between first party losses and third party damage claims is generally recognized. <em>See Cain v. American Policyholders Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 645, 183 A. 403 (1936) (coverage on liability policy does not extend to damages for injuries to the insured personally since \u201cliability insurance ..., as concerns the assured, is third party coverage\u201d). <em>See also </em>44 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 21 (liability insurance covers injuries sustained by others); 44 Am.Jur.2d <em>verbo </em>Insurance \u00a7 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The district court concluded that the insurance contract \u201conly encompasses losses sustained by third parties for which the bank is ultimately liable.\u201d We agree. This liability insurance policy does not extend first party protection to Alcorn Bank. That type protection may be purchased, <em>see </em>Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 81-5-15 (1972), but it was not a part of the comprehensive general liability insurance policy USF &amp; G issued to Alcorn Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
