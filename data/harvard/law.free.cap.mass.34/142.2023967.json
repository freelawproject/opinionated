Within one year from that time, (pursuant to <em>St. </em>1817, <em>c. </em>190, \u00a7 8,) Davis and wife petitioned this Court for leave to enter and prosecute an appeal from the decree, and at October term 1826, it was ordered that they should be allowed to enter an appeal, upon condition that they should, within thirty days, give bond with sureties to the judge of probate to pay costs, if the administrator should not be charged beyond the sum of $109-64.
