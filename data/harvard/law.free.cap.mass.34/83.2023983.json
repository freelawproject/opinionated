Pelatiah died on Octuber 29, 1828. On the next day the plaintiffs forwarded to the defendants a quantity of leather, to sell on commission and apply the proceeds to the payment of the draft. The leather was received by ihe defendants in New York, and it paid the draft in full.

They afterwards represented the estate insolvent, and commissioners of insolvency were appointed, before whom the plaintiffs presented the abovementioned debt of the defendants as paid by the plaintiffs, and the commissioners reported and the judge of probate ordered to be paid thereon a dividend of $380T9. The deficiency of assets was notified to the defendants, and the amount paid beyond the dividend, was demanded of them by the plaintiffs before commencing this action.
