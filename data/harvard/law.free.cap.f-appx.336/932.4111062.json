Cortes-Pacheco argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence above the guideline range. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline range of zero to six months of imprisonment and found that a sentence within that range would be \u201cineffective\u201d based on Cortes-Pacheco\u2019s \u201crepeated and apparently inexcusable repetitive reentries into this country[.]\u201d The district court considered the sentencing factors and found that a variance above the guideline range was necessary to address Cortes-Pacheco\u2019s recidivism and deter him and \u201cthose similarly situated that this sort of repetitious and reckless behavior and defiance of established law [was] unacceptable.\u201d The statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment for illegal reentry is two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a). Cortes-Pacheco\u2019s sentence of 20 months of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Cortes-Pacheco\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
