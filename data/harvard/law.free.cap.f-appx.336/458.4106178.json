He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)). He also moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-25\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>quently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review the denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Jones argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion because, pursuant to Amendment 505 of the Guidelines, the base offense level for his offense could not exceed 38. He concedes in his reply brief, however, that his properly recalculated offense level was 40 and that although Amendment 706 lowered his offense level by two levels, the reduction had no effect on his ultimate sentencing range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A., Sentencing Table. We do not consider Jones\u2019s arguments made for the first time in his reply brief that the district court nevertheless abused its discretion in denying his motion because it failed to consider <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Taita Chem. Co. Ltd. v. Westlake Styrene Corp., </em>246 F.3d 377, 384 n. 9 (5th Cir.2001). Neither do we consider his arguments made for the first time in his reply brief that the enhancements to his offense level violated his Sixth Amendment rights and that he should have been appointed counsel in connection with his \u00a7 3582(c) proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The district court properly held that Jones was ineligible for a sentence reduction because the amendment did not reduce his advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Jones\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED AS MOOT because the district <em>court </em>has already granted Jones permission to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
