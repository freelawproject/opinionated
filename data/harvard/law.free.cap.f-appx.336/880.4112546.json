Jose N. BENITEZ, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A-p\">No. 09-10613</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aej\">Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"A5C\">United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Adh_\">July 7, 2009.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A9B\">Before TJOFLAT, EDMONDSON and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Am8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"A7z\">Jose Benitez appeals his sentence, imposed following admitted violations of the terms of his supervised release, arguing that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and departed above the sentencing guidelines range without sufficiently articulating the basis for the departure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the district court made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>clear that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and referred to certain of the appropriate factors, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On January 20, 2009, the district court held a final revocation hearing on Benitez\u2019s violation of supervised release. Benitez admitted committing all ten of the violations alleged in the petition filed by the U.S. Probation Office. The court found that Benitez had violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release and revoked the period of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Although the parties agreed that the sentencing guidelines range was between four to ten months\u2019 imprisonment and jointly recommended a ten month sentence, the probation officer recommended a twenty-four month sentence. The court noted that the violations consisted of \u201cmu-litple DUI arrests, which is an accident waiting to happen\u201d and that Benitez had demonstrated \u201ca fair amount [of] disregard for the law.\u201d The court concluded that a 24-month sentence was appropriate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">I have determined that an upward variance from the applicable guideline range in this case is warranted. The defendant absconded the jurisdiction, has continued to have violations including DUI ... I\u2019m concerned about protection of the public and about the defendant\u2019s disregard of the law. And I find the applicable advisory guideline range is insufficient to deter future criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3I\">The court also stated that it \u201ccarefully considered the statements of all parties and the information contained in the violation report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Upon finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose imprisonment after considering certain of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors relevant to sentencing for violations of the terms of supervised release include the need the afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The review for reasonableness, involves two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If there was no procedural error, we consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Benitez\u2019s only argument on appeal is that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court, however, \u201cneed not conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and expound on how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision.\u201d <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 758 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005)). It is sufficient if the district court considers the substance of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1355 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">We find no procedural unreasonableness in the imposition of Benitez\u2019s sentence. The district court stated that it felt a sentence outside the guidelines range was warranted because of the need to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public. These are relevant and appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors to consider for violations of conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Additionally, the district court noted the repeated nature of Benitez\u2019s DUI violations and found that he demonstrated \u201ca fair amount [of] disregard for the law.\u201d This continuing disregard for the law justified the district court\u2019s decision to vary above the sentencing guidelines range. Accordingly, the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence and we AFFIRM Benitez\u2019s twenty four month sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Auf\">. Benitez was convicted of importation of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 and on October 23, 1998 was sentenced to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and 4 years of supervised release. Benitez's term of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>release began on December 5, 2002. In response to a petition filed by the U.S. probation office, Benitez was arrested for alleged violations of the terms of his supervised release. Benitez admitted the allegations. This appeal involves the district court's sentence for the admitted violations of the conditions for Benitez\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-11\">. The district court had the authority to vary the sentence above the guidelines, because Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which relate to the imposition of a prison sentence for violating the terms of supervised release, are \"merely advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
