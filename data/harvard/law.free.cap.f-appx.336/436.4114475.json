Khan asserts that his sister\u2019s prior testimony may have persuaded the IJ that Khan more likely than not would be tortured if he were returned to Pakistan. Khan particularly argues that his sister\u2019s testimony (a) corroborated his claims that he previously was arrested and mistreated by the police, and (b) showed that the police in Pakistan have maintained an interest in his whereabouts since he immigrated in 1985 to the United States. Khan also argues that the BIA\u2019s failure to remand the proceedings to the IJ for a complete review of his sister\u2019s prior testimony was a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The denial of relief under CAT is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 353 (5th Cir.2002). This standard requires that the BIA\u2019s conclusion be based upon the evidence presented and that it be substantially reasonable. Car<em>bajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). An alien alleging deprivation of due process in removal proceedings must make an initial showing that he was substantially prejudiced by the procedural error that he advances. <em>See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">The record does not show unequivocally that the IJ did not evaluate the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>testimony of Khan\u2019s sister and the instant argument thus may be wholly speculative. However, even if the IJ did not consider the prior testimony of Khan\u2019s sister, Khan has not shown that the BIA wrongly held that the IJ\u2019s disregard of that testimony was reversible error. The testimony would not have affected the BIA\u2019s disposition of Khan\u2019s claims because the veracity of Khan\u2019s testimony about his experiences with the Pakistani police and their continued interest in him were immaterial to the BIA\u2019s denial of relief. The BIA assumed that Khan testified credibly about those matters and nonetheless held that Khan had not shown that he likely would be tortured upon removal to Pakistan. The prior testimony of Khan\u2019s sister, which was largely cumulative of Khan\u2019s testimony, merely corroborated evidence that the BIA otherwise held was insufficient to warrant relief. <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (noting that an alien\u2019s credible testimony may be sufficient to sustain burden of proof without additional corroboration). Moreover, to the extent that Khan\u2019s sister provided unique testimony about the continued interest of the police in Khan, Khan has not shown how additional testimony on that issue would have changed the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Thus, Khan has failed to show any harm resulting from the IJ\u2019s purported exclusion of his sister\u2019s testimony. He therefore has not shown that the BIA wrongly held that the omission did not represent reversible error. Accordingly, Khan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
