For the reasons stated herein, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">On April 13, 2005, Shao, a native and citizen of China, received a notice to appear charging him with entering the United States without a valid entry document, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Shao conceded re-movability and filed for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Shao argued that he was entitled to asylum because the Chinese government had forced his wife to abort an unauthorized pregnancy and to be sterilized after she gave birth to their second child. In support of his asylum application, Shao submitted a sworn statement with supporting documentation and testified before the IJ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to this evidence, officials forced Shao\u2019s wife to have an IUD inserted following the birth of their first child. Shao testified that he was not present when officials took his wife because he was \u201con the street ... shopping.\u201d Because his wife had a bad reaction to the IUD, she asked a private doctor to remove the device and, a few months thereafter, she became pregnant again. Shao sent his wife to live at his brother\u2019s house to hide the pregnancy, but Chinese officials found her, arrested her, and forced her to undergo an abortion and to have another IUD inserted. Several years later, the government allowed Shoa and his wife to remove the IUD and have another child. After the birth of their second child, officials came to their home and forcibly took Shao\u2019s wife to the hospital to undergo a sterilization operation. Shao testified that he \u201ctried to stop [the officials taking away his wife] but there was no way for [him] to stop them.\u201d Six years later, Shao fled to the United States with the help of a smuggler, leaving his wife and two children in China. Shao testified that he believes, if he returned to China, he would be arrested, jailed, and fined for leaving the country illegally and would be persecuted because he had violated the family planning policies in China. Shao also submitted to the IJ a 2005 report entitled \u201cChina: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\u201d, the 2004 State Department Country Report on human rights practices for China, and articles about China\u2019s birth control policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">On August 3, 2006, the IJ denied Shao\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ found that Shao\u2019s assertions that his wife had been forced to have an abortion and had been involuntarily sterilized were not credible and that the fact Shao remained in China for six years after the sterilization of his wife belied his claimed fear of persecution for violating China\u2019s birth control policies. Accordingly, the IJ found that Shao had failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of any of the five protected grounds enumerated by the INA. Because Shao failed to satisfy the lower bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>den of proof required for asylum, the IJ found that he also failed to satisfy the more stringent standard required to prove eligibility for withholding of removal. The IJ also found that Shao had not shown his eligibility for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Shao filed a notice of appeal with the BIA. The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision, although on different grounds, and dismissed the appeal. In its decision dated December 2, 2008, the BIA noted that the Attorney General had recently determined that the basis of Shao\u2019s claim \u2014 that his wife had been forced to have an abortion and to be sterilized \u2014 did not <em>per se </em>state a valid claim for asylum. The BIA cited to <em>Matter of J-S- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (AG 2008), in which the Attorney General, instructed the IJs and the BIA to engage in the \u201ccase-by-case assessment of whether an individual ... who has not physically undergone a forced abortion or sterilization procedure can demonstrate that (i) he \u2018resisted\u2019 China\u2019s coercive population control program, (ii) suffered or has a well-founded fear that he will suffer persecution by the Chinese government, and (iii) can show that such persecution was inflicted or that he has a well-founded fear that it would be inflicted, \u2018on account of his resistance to the coercive population control program.\u201d Applying this standard, the BIA found that Shao had provided \u201cho evidence that he engaged in conduct which constitutes resistance' to China\u2019s coercive population control program such that he has been or would be persecuted upon return.\u201d The BIA did not adopt the decision of the IJ and made no finding regarding Shao\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">In his petition for review, Shao argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s determination that he is not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 525 </em>F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo. Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 555 </em>F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2009). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will leave them undisturbed if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot reverse factual findings unless the record compels it; \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">At issue in this case is whether Shao has a well founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion, thereby entitling him to asylum, under the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">[A] person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of a political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to such persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Before 2008, the BIA interpreted this provision as providing that the \u201cpast persecution of one spouse can be established by coerced abortion or sterilization of the other spouse.\u201d <em>In re C-Y-Z- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915, 917, 919 (BIA 1997) <em>(en banc). </em>In 2008, however, the Attorney General overruled this interpretation and instructed the BIA to require the spouse of one forced to undergo involuntary sterilization to independently show his resistance to the coercive population control program and that he would be subject to persecution on account of this resistance. <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 523. Our circuit recently adopted this rule, concluding that the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) was \u201creasonable and entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2009). This court also held that the BIA\u2019s application of <em>Matter of J-S- </em>to cases that were open and on direct review when <em>Matter of J-S-</em>was decided did not involve an improper retroactive application of the law because the BIA was simply applying the \u201cAttorney General\u2019s determination of what the law had <em>always </em>meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333 (emphasis in original). \u201cOnce the Attorney General clarified the meaning of \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B) in <em>Matter of J-S-, </em>that decision became the controlling interpretation of the law and was entitled to full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review, regardless of whether the events predated the Attorney General\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">In his petition for review, Shao argues that the BIA should have remanded his case to the IJ for reconsideration because, at the time the administrative record was developed, the law only required Shao to show that his wife had been forcibly sterilized in order for him to be entitled to refugee status. Shao asserts that the record shows that he \u201cresisted\u201d China\u2019s coercive population control program through his unsuccessful attempts to protect his wife from being forcibly sterilized, but that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to develop this aspect of the record. Shao notes that, in a footnote in <em>Matter of J-S-</em>the Attorney General contemplated that certain cases decided under the BIA\u2019s former <em>per se </em>rule should be remanded in light of the change in the rule. 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 543 n. 15. Accordingly, Shao asserts that justice demands that this matter be remanded so that he may present additional evidence and the IJ may consider in the first instance whether Shao has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">We disagree. In <em>Matter of J-S- </em>the Attorney General noted that remand may be appropriate, but limited this remedy to cases in which the record indicated that the applicant may be entitled to relief if given a full opportunity to present evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">Whether the Board and the courts should remand other cases for reconsideration in light of this opinion depends on the particularized facts of those cases. Where, as here, a case that was decided principally on the basis of the <em>per se </em>rule appears to involve credible evidence of threats or action against the applicant that might support relief under the legal framework set forth herein, but that were not adequately considered or developed before the Immigration Judge, it may be an appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>priate exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion to order a remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-5\"><em>Id. </em>In this case, Shao had a full opportunity to present evidence of past or future persecution on account of his \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s policies. At his removal hearing, Shao told the full story of his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization. Shao testified that he and his wife attempted to hide her unauthorized pregnancy and that he \u201ctried to stop\u201d the Chinese officials from taking his wife to be sterilized. Even assuming this conduct could be construed as \u201cother resistance,\u201d Shao did not claim or present <em>any </em>evidence indicating that he was persecuted in the six years he remained in China after committing these alleged acts of resistance, nor did he present evidence indicating that one who has resisted China\u2019s family planning policies has a well-founded fear \u25a0 of such persecution. Moreover, Shao does not indicate what kind of evidence he would present if given the opportunity. Although remand may be appropriate where an applicant has presented \u201ccredible evidence of threats or action against the applicant that might support relief\u2019 which were not \u201cadequately considered or developed\u201d before the IJ, we conclude that remand is not required where, as in this case, there is nothing in the record to indicate what other evidence of persecution an applicant could have offered, nor does the applicant say. Accordingly, we also conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Shao has not shown either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy or any other protected ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Yu, </em>568 F.3d 1328 (noting that to the extent hiding his wife from authorities to avoid sterilization could considered \u201cother resistance,\u201d the record did not compel a finding of persecution where Yu was never detained or physically harmed); <em>Lin, </em>555 F.3d at 1316 (\u201c[E]ven assuming Lin\u2019s accidentally hitting the family planning official and tearing up the fine amounted to \u2018other resistance,\u2019 he has not made the requisite showing that he was persecuted on account of that resistance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Inasmuch as the record does not compel a finding that Shao has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground, Shao caiinot satisfy the more stringent standard applicable to a claim for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>Lin, </em>555 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Because the evidence does not compel a finding that Shao suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion or any other protected ground, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-9\">. Shao presented letters from his wife, his father and a neighbor, birth certificates for members of his immediate family, his household register, his marriage certificate, and an x-ray examination report, birth control operation certificate, and other medical records for his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-6\">. Shao also argues that the \"BIA err[ed] in affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that Petitioner was not credible.\u201d As discussed above, however, the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1006 (11th Cir.2008). Because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision as to Shao\u2019s credibility, we may not review the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AqP\">. Although Shao testified at the hearing before the IJ that he would be imprisoned and fined for leaving China illegally, he does not raise this claim in his petition. Accordingly, this claim has been abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228. Even if he had raised the issue, \"prosecution for leaving China illegally is not a statutorily protected ground entitling an alien to asylum.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>568 F.3d at! 1334 n. 4 (citing <em>Lin, </em>555 F.3d at 1316).'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
