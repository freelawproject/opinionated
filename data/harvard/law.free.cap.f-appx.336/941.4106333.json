Montero argues the district court erred when it refused to grant him a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility at sentencing on the ground his last-minute plea was not timely. He contends although his plea, offered on the morning trial was set to commence, was not timely for the purposes of a one-point reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b), considerations other than timeliness govern possible reductions under \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">We review for clear error both the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines and the denial of a reduction of sentence for an acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Frank, </em>247 F.3d 1257, 1261 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cA district court is in a \u2018unique position to evaluate\u2019 whether a defendant sufficiently demonstrates acceptance of responsibility; therefore \u2018the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u2019 \u201d (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 app. 5.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Consistent with the applicable Guideline provisions, the district court ruled Montero failed to demonstrate his entitlement to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. The court found Montero\u2019s plea was not timely<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because Montero did not offer his plea until the morning his trial was to begin, thus necessitating significant trial preparation by the government and the transportation of witnesses from across the state, and inconveniencing the jury pool which was already assigned to the trial, Montero himself conceded his plea was not timely. The district court\u2019s reliance on the timing of Montero\u2019s plea and the context in which it was offered is in full accord with \u00a7 3El.l(a), the , explanatory comments accompanying that section, and the cases interpreting and applying it. Montero has therefore failed to demonstrate clear error. We conclude the district court\u2019s decision to deny Montero a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-22\">. The timeliness of a guilty plea is a consideration under both \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, n.l (h) (\"In determining whether a defendant qualifies under subsection (a), appropriate considerations include, but are not limited to, the following: ... the timeliness of the defendant's conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, n.6 (\"The timeliness of the defendant's acceptance of responsibility is a consideration under both subsections, and is context specific.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
