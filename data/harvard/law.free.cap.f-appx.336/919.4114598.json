Paul\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses involving less than 4.5 kilograms. On appeal, Paul argues that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to correct an alleged error in the drug quantity attributed to him during his original sentencing and denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Paul was convicted of a drug conspiracy that included an underage individual, the probation officer had doubled the total amount of cocaine base involved. Paul asserts that the original pre-sentence investigation report erred in this calculation by doubling the whole drug quantity rather than just that possessed by the underage individual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore it incorrectly attributed more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine to him, and his base offense level should have been 34, not 36. The district court ruled, however, that it did not have the legal authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">Section 3582(c)(2) forbids a court from modifying a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d The applicable policy statement provides that if a defendant\u2019s guideline range has \u201csubsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) ], the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d and \u201cany such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). But where a defendant\u2019s sentencing range does not change under Amendment 706, the district court has no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792, 793 (11th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Pursuant to Amendment 706, defendants who are responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine are now eligible for a base offense level of 36. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2008). Thus, in order for the guidelines range to have changed \u2014 a necessary prerequisite for re-sentencing \u2014 the district court would have to find that Paul is correct that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>original base offense level determination was incorrect and should be 34. However, proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged[J\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In this ease, Paul is asking that his base level offense be changed, but that is an original sentencing determination. The district court did not have jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues, such as a re-examination of the drug quantity for which Paul was held responsible. Thus, Paul\u2019s base offense level of 36, based on a drug quantity of more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, must remain the same. Consequently, his guidelines range remain unchanged by Amendment 706, and the district court correctly found that Paul was not eligible for a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">.
