Plaintiffs suit arises out of the actions of a housing code enforcement officer who misidentified Plaintiff as the own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>er of a property that allegedly violated a housing ordinance and then sent a notice of abatement to Plaintiff to the wrong address. When Plaintiff did not appear for the scheduled hearing, arrest warrants were issued and Plaintiff was later arrested. All charges were eventually dismissed. Reviewing the judgment <em>de novo, see Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>329 F.3d 409, 414 (5th Cir.2003), and for the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">1. \u201cUnder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a municipality cannot be held vicariously liable for the constitutional torts of its employees or agents.\u201d <em>Gros v. City of Grand Prairie, </em>181 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.1999). For liability to attach, three elements must be proved: \u201c(1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policy maker' can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is that policy (or custom).\u201d <em>Pineda v. City of Houston, </em>291 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2002). Plaintiff thus bore the burden of substantiating either a formal policy officially adopted and promulgated by city policymakers, or a well-settled and common practice by city officials or employees of which the city or its policymakers were actually or constructively aware. <em>See Webster v. City of Houston, </em>735 F.2d 838, 841 (5th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">2. Plaintiff in his brief wholly fails to allege, let alone substantiate the existence of, a custom or policy of which the City, through a specific policymaker, knew or should have known. This is so even though the district court found that the absence of such proof warranted summary judgment in favor of the City. By failing to dispute the district court\u2019s adverse finding on an essential element of his action under \u00a7 1983, Plaintiff has necessarily waived his challenge to the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the City. <em>See R.R. Mgmt. Co., L.L.C. v. CFS La. Midstream Co., </em>428 F.3d 214, 220 n. 3 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that failure to challenge the district court\u2019s alternative basis for a ruling waived the challenge asserted); <em>see also United States v. Hatchett, </em>245 F.3d 625, 644-45 (7th Cir.2001) (failing to address one of two or more alternative holdings on an issue waives claims of error with respect to that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">3. Plaintiff also asserts for the first time on appeal that the City did not properly train the code enforcement officer and municipal court clerk who submitted the affidavits underlying the arrest warrants. Although failure to train may give rise to \u00a7 1983 liability, <em>see City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989), we will not consider new allegations or legal theories not presented below, <em>see Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
