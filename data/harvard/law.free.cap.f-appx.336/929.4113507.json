The district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable, and the district court did not clearly err in determining that Bell held a managerial or supervisory role in the criminal conspiracy. Therefore, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">I. REASONABLENESS OF SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">A. <em>Procedural Unreasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Bell argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to make an individualized assessment based on the facts in relation to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, thus precluding meaningful appellate review as required by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">The Supreme Court has held that sentences must be reviewed for unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The reasonableness of sentences must be measured against the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. The reasonableness standard of review announced in <em>Booker </em>requires appellate courts to review the ultimate sentence imposed under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. However, a district court\u2019s failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors constitutes \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">The sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The sentence should reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">A court should consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d based on the facts presented. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The district court, however, need not discuss each factor; rather, an acknowledgment \u201cthat it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). However, the court \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The district court acknowledged that it considered all of the \u00a7 8553(a) factors and that it reviewed the PSI and all relevant evidence in determining that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was reasonable under the circumstances. Because the district court adequately explained the sentence and properly made an \u201cindividualized assessment,\u201d considering the Guidelines along with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the sentence was not procedurally unreasonable, and the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">B. <em>Substantive Unreasonableness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Bell argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider a downward variance or departure from the career offender guideline. Bell argues that he had presented as factors for a variance his personal characteristics, the relatively minor degree of his criminal history, and the sentencing disparity between defendants convicted of crack versus powder cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The district court has discretion to determine the weight that should be given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). However, we may find that the district court has abused its discretion if the weight it gives to the factors yields a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">The district court properly considered Bell\u2019s arguments for a downward variance along with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the district court determined that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines was fair and reasonable. Furthermore, Bell\u2019s criminal history appropriately qualified him for career offender status. The district court noted that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was sufficient to punish Bell and to deter him from future criminal misconduct, and it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to determine the weight that should be given to those factors. Thus, the sentence was substantively reasonable, and the court did not abuse its discretion by applying Bell\u2019s career offender status and rejecting the request for a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">II. BELL\u2019S ROLE AS MANAGER OR SUPERVISOR</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">Bell argues that the district court erred by determining that he held a managerial or supervisory role in the criminal conspiracy because he only cooked crack cocaine and delivered it to street vendors. Relying on <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405 (11th Cir.1998), Bell argues that no evidence exists that shows that he recruited workers, acted in a supervisory capacity, or received a disproportionate share of the conspiracy\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) (providing for a two-level increase in offense level to a defendant who was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of fewer than five other participants in any criminal activity that was not otherwise extensive). We have held that a district court\u2019s decision that is supported by the record and applies the law properly will rarely be clearly erroneous. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. In distinguishing a leadership or organizational role from a managerial or supervisory role, the district court should consider the following factors: (1) exercise of decision making authority, (2) nature of partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>ipation in the commission of the offense, (3) recruitment of accomplices, (4) claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4). To qualify as a manager or supervisor, the defendant must assert control or influence over at least one other participant in the crime. <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1013 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2) (\u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants\u201d). In addition, a defendant\u2019s status as a \u201cmiddleman or distributor\u201d is insufficient to receive the enhancement. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Alred, </em>144 F.3d at 1422. <em>But see United States v. Perry, </em>340 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2003) (listing the act of paying another member of the conspiracy for transporting drugs as a factor supporting the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The district court did not commit clear error in finding that Bell had a managerial or leadership role in the criminal conspiracy, and thus warranted the two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (rather than the four-level enhancement sought by the government). Bell supplied drugs to another member of the conspiracy when the street level sellers ran out, and he collected the proceeds after the drugs were sold. Furthermore, Bell was more than a \u201cmiddleman or distributor\u201d because he paid other members of the conspiracy to distribute the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Therefore, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
