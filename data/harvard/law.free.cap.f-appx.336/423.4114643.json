In his motion, Kelly challenged the 105-month sentence that he received following his 2001 conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Kelly\u2019s district court motion was an attempt by Kelly to collaterally attack his sentence by raising errors that occurred at or prior to sentencing. As such, the motion should have been construed by the district court as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Santora, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 and n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). Such a recharac-terization of Kelly\u2019s motion has important consequences of which Kelly should be apprised. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Also, because Kelly\u2019s motion was in the nature of a \u00a7 2255 motion, this court lacks jurisdiction over Kelly\u2019s appeal absent a certificate of appealability ruling in the district court. <em>See Muniz v. Johnson, </em>114 F.3d 43, 45 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1114-15 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A5B\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
