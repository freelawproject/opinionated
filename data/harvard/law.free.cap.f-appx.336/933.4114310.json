In 2003 Coley was sentenced as a career offender based in part on a previous Florida conviction for carrying a concealed firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). At the time of Coley\u2019s sentencing, this circuit considered carrying a concealed firearm a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cWe thus hold that carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a \u201ccrime of violence ...\u201d \u201d). However, our interpretation of \u00a7 4B1.1 has since changed in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1586, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that, after <em>Begay, </em>carrying a concealed firearm was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and that <em>Gilbert </em>had been abrogated).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">Therefore Coley\u2019s motion argued that his concealed firearm conviction could no longer serve as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in light of <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer. </em>Accordingly, Coley asked that his sentence be set aside and reconsidered without the career-offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">The district court denied Coley\u2019s motion. It observed that Coley was asking for a retroactive application of <em>Begay, </em>but because the Supreme Court did not \u201cexpressly indicate\u201d that <em>Begay </em>would apply retroactively on collateral review, the district court declined to so apply it. Coley requested a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether <em>Archer </em>and <em>Begay </em>apply retroactively and the district court granted it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also accepted Coley\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>tention, made through counsel, that his original <em>pro se </em>motion should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion to set aside his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The first issue is whether Coley\u2019s motion was properly recharacterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion to set aside Coley\u2019s sentence. It was.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The government argues that the district court should not have considered Coley\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2255 because the court failed to give Coley notice of its intent to recharacterize his motion, as required by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). But the point of <em>Castro </em>is that a <em>pro se </em>litigant must be warned before a district court recharacterizes his motion as one brought under \u00a7 2255. The reason for this requirement is to avoid surprising that litigant later when he tries to file what he believes is a first \u00a7 2255 motion, but then is forced to surmount the much higher standard for a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 124 S.Ct. at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\"><em>Castro\u2019s </em>protections therefore exist to protect <em>pro se </em>litigants from unfair surprises based on recharacterization. In this case Coley later obtained counsel and through counsel he specifically asked the district court to consider his motion as one brought under \u00a7 2255. The protections of <em>Castro </em>are inapposite here. Coley\u2019s motion is to be considered, as he requested, one arising under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo.\u201d Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). The legal question presented by the certificate of appealability is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay, </em>and our circuit\u2019s application of <em>Begay </em>in <em>Archer, </em>can apply retroactively during \u00a7 2255 proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-13\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming ... that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law ... may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">However, the Supreme Court has foreclosed using \u00a7 2255 as Coley wishes to in this case. In <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 478 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3044 n. 10, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), the Court stated that \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 will not be allowed to do service for an appeal.... For this reason, nonconstitutional claims that could have been raised on appeal, but were not, may not be asserted in collateral proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sunal v. Large, </em>332 U.S. 174, 178-79, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 1590-91, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947), <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 345-46 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 2304-05, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). We have clarified that \u201ca non-constitutional error that may justify reversal on direct appeal does not generally support a collat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>eral attack on a final judgment ... unless the error (1) could not have been raised on direct appeal <em>and </em>(2) would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2004) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Coley has not argued that his sentence violates any constitutional right, but only that it violates the sentencing guidelines after <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer. See Hunter, </em>559 F.3d at 1189 (observing that because a prisoner erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal had failed to show the denial of a constitutional right, he could not attack his sentence in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding). Accordingly, if Coley\u2019s claim \u201ccould ... have been raised on direct appeal,\u201d then it is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1233. \u201cA ground of error is usually \u2018available\u2019 on direct appeal when its merits can be reviewed without further factual development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233 n. 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Coley did not raise this issue on direct appeal. In fact, it appears that he filed no direct appeal at all. Nor does Coley offer any reason why he could not have raised this issue on direct appeal. Of course, <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer </em>had not yet been decided when Coley was sentenced in 2003; however, if he believed that his career offender status was improper under the guidelines that claim could have been made on direct appeal-just as Begay and Archer later did. <em>Cf. Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. </em>527, 534-35, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 2666, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986) (holding that perceived futility in raising an issue on direct appeal does not constitute cause for not doing so); <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (\u201c[Fjutility cannot constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>Turner v. Crosby, </em>339 F.3d 1247, 1281 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cIf a defendant perceives a constitutional claim and believes it may find favor in the federal courts, he may not bypass the state courts simply because he thinks they will be unsympathetic to the claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Because his status as a career offender is a non-constitutional issue that Coley could have raised on direct appeal, it is not cognizable on collateral review under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-14\">. We observe that the certificate of appeala-bility in this case should not have been granted. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), a \"certificate of appealability may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d In <em>Hunter v. United States, </em>559 F.3d 1188, 1189 (11th Cir.2009), we stated that \"Although <em>Begay </em>provides good reason to conclude that [the prisoner] was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal, a sentencing error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>alone does not amount to \u2018a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in <em>Hunter </em>we denied the prisoner a certificate of appealability. <em>Id. </em>at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"A0fi\">However, the government has not challenged the certificate of appealability. And we do not <em>sua sponte </em>challenge the propriety of a granted certificate. <em>See Thomas v. Crosby, </em>371 F.3d 782, 785 (11th Cir.2004) (\"An obligation to determine whether a certificate should have been issued, even if the parties do not present this issue for decision ... would increase the complexity of appeals in collateral attacks and the judicial effort required to resolve them, the opposite of the legislative plan_ This we will not do.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
