Kerns, Sr., appeals his 240-month sentence imposed on remand of his case for resentencing, following his convictions for conspiracy to commit, securities fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, securities fraud, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78ff(a), wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and money laundering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957. Kerns appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from further representation prior to resentencing. Kerns asserts the district court abused its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw because his complaints about his attorney\u2019s performance during his original pre-trial, trial, sentencing, and appellate proceedings created a conflict of interest between himself and counsel. He con-, tends he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s denial of the motion because a different attorney would have raised arguments regarding the loss calculation used to determine his sentence, and, as a result, he would have received a lower sentence. Kerns further argues his sentence was substantively unreasonable because: (1) his advanced age rendered his 240-month sentence a <em>de facto </em>life sentence; and (2) his codefendants received sentences substantially shorter than the sentence he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1343 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Calderon, </em>we held the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from further representation, where, although the defendant had vigorously complained about counsel\u2019s performance at trial, the defendant and his counsel had communicated with each other about the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1342^13. As the basis for his motion to withdraw, counsel referred to a series of <em>pro se </em>letters the defendant had written to the district court after his conviction, in which the defendant asserted that counsel had failed to file proper motions, was biased and inexperienced, and was unenthusiastic about his representation of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Counsel argued his continued representation of the defendant would be unethical and contrary to his chent\u2019s wishes, but conceded he still could make legal arguments on the defendant\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 1343. This Court reasoned the district court had not abused its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion because counsel had been able to communicate with the defendant regarding the sentencing hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">The record reflects Kerns and his counsel remained able to communicate about his resentencing proceedings. Additionally, counsel admitted, both at the hearing on his motion to withdraw and at resen-tencing, that he could represent Kerns in an ethical and competent manner. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>fore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion, we do not discuss Kerns\u2019s assertion that a different attorney may have successfully argued for a lower loss amount attributable to him under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will reverse only if the district court made a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. \u201c[A] sentence may be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure used.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the court imposes a sentence that is within the guideline range, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Where the sentence imposed is outside the guideline range, we may not presume the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We have rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that his 305-month sentence was unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because he was 65 years\u2019 old when he was sentenced. <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that \u00a7 5H1.1 generally discourages the use of age as a basis for a downward departure). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), a district court should consider, among other things, \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d We have held a defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a)(6) where, although the defendant\u2019s sentence was greater than the sentences his codefendants received, factors such as the defendant\u2019s role in coordinating a scheme or his codefendants\u2019 substantial assistance to the government caused the disparity to be reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1356-57 (11th Cir.2006) (holding the defendant\u2019s 121-month sentence was reasonable despite the fact that his codefendants\u2019 sentences ranged from 41 to 53 months\u2019 imprisonment because the defendant had coordinated the offense); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323 (11th Cir.2008) (holding the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable, despite the fact that a co-defendant received a substantially shorter sentence, because the co-defendant\u2019s sentence reflected his substantial assistance to the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Kerns has not met his burden of demonstrating his sentence was unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. In consideration of Kerns\u2019s age, the district court weighed Kerns\u2019s advanced age against the seriousness of his offense and the need to protect the public from fraud, and, accordingly, varied downward from the minimum of Kerns\u2019s guideline range by 84 months. In light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s general disfavor of age as a mitigating factor, the fact that the district court did not give Kerns a further downward variance based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>on his age did not cause his sentence to be unreasonable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1; <em>Dowd, </em>451 F.3d at 1256-57. Moreover, while Kerns received a substantially longer sentence than his four codefendants, various factors warranted this disparity. First, two of Kerns\u2019s four codefendants were not convicted of the same conspiracy as Kerns, but of unrelated money marketing conspiracies. Second, Kerns did not dispute that each of his codefendants had cooperated with the government and received substantial-assistance departures under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Third, while the record reflects that Kerns\u2019s codefendants participated in the conspiracy by illegally selling stock, Kerns was the one who fraudulently solicited the stock and directed the stock be sold. Thus, the dissimilarities between Kerns and his codefendants were such that it was not unreasonable for Kerns to receive a substantially longer sentence than his codefendants. <em>See Thomas, </em>446 F.3d at 1356-57; <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1323. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining a 240-month sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of Kerns\u2019s offense, deter crime, and protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189-90. Thus, Kerns has not met his burden of demonstrating his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">Accordingly, after review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
