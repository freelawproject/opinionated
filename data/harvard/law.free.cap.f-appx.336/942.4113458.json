Hall argues that the district court should not have enhanced his sentence by two levels for the possession of a firearm. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the application of an enhancement for the possession of a dangerous weapon to a sentence. <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006). A district court may enhance a sentence by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\u201d during an offense involving drugs. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). A defendant charged in a conspiracy to distribute drugs may receive a two-level enhancement for the possession of a firearm when a cocon-spirator possessed the weapon in furtherance of the conspiracy and the possession was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce the government shows that a firearm was present, \u2018the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">The district court did not err by enhancing Hall\u2019s sentence. Hall argues that the government failed to prove he knew about, possessed, or saw a coconspirator in possession of a firearm during the drug conspiracy, but that argument is incredible in the light of the evidence that Hall worked for a national organization, the Black Mafia Family, that distributed cocaine and transported drugs and firearms in hidden compartments of modified high-end luxury cars. Hall loaded and unloaded cocaine from a storage facility and a Hummer sport utility vehicle where law enforcement discovered several firearms. Even if Hall did not possess a firearm, it was reasonably foreseeable that a cohort possessed a firearm during the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Westry, </em>524 F.3d 1198, 1221 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>S.Ct. 251, 172 L.Ed.2d 189 (2008), <em>and, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 902, 173 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009); <em>Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1245-46; <em>Fields, </em>408 F.3d at 1359. Hall failed to present any evidence that the connection between the firearms and the conspiracy was clearly improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"ABo\">Hall\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
