Facing state court charges for forgery and theft by deception in connection with filing federal income tax returns, Hurt-Whitmire sought to remove her case to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1442 and 1443(1). The district court remanded the case to the state court, concluding that Hurt-Whitmire failed to satisfy the removal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s removal jurisdiction. <em>Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>261 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir.2001). If, after examining a defendant\u2019s notice of removal, the district court finds that removal is not permitted, the district court shall summarily remand. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">On appeal, Hurt-Whitmire argues that removal was proper under \u00a7 1442 because she was a federal agent of the IRS, and under \u00a7 1443 because the state court would deny her equal protection, due process, and civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986. We address each basis in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">A. Removal under \u00a7 1442</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">A defendant may remove her state criminal prosecution to federal court if the defendant is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-15\">The United States or any agency thereof or any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). An individual or private company\u2019s \u201ccompliance (or noncompliance) with federal laws, rules, and regulations does not by itself fall within the scope of the statutory phrase \u2018acting under\u2019 a federal \u2018official.\u2019 And that is so even if the regulation is highly detailed and even if the private firm\u2019s activities are highly supervised and monitored.\u201d Wat<em>son v. Philip Morris Co., Inc., </em>551 U.S. 142, 153, 127 S.Ct. 2301, 2308, 168 L.Ed.2d 42 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Here, Hurt-Whitmire was not a federal officer of the IRS or a person acting under an IRS officer. Instead, a private firm employed her as a tax preparer and as a result of her occupation, Hurt-Whitmire was regulated by the IRS. This does not form the basis for removal under \u00a7 1442.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">B. Removal under \u00a7 1443</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">A defendant may remove a criminal prosecution initiated in state court if the case is \u201c[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>The defendant must meet a two-pronged test in order to qualify for \u00a7 1443(1) removal: \u201cFirst, the petitioner must show that the right upon which the petitioner relies arises under a federal law \u2018providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u2019 Second, the petitioner must show that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts.\u201d <em>Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790-91, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966)). As to the first prong, broad assertions under the Equal Protection Clause or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are insufficient to support a valid claim of removal because racial equality rights do not include rights of general application. <em>Id. </em>at 1295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In this case, Hurt-Whitmire\u2019s broad assertions that her equal protection, due process, and \u00a7 1983 rights were violated do not support a claim for removal. <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295-96. Additionally, her allegations of civil rights violations under \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986 do not support a claim for removal because Hurh-Whitmire is not a federal officer. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(1) (conspiring to prevent federal officers from performing their duties); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986 (requiring a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 violation). Therefore, the district court did not err by remanding Hurt&gt;Whitmire\u2019s case for lack of removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Because neither \u00a7 1442 nor \u00a7 1443 provided a basis for removal jurisdiction, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AT-\">. Because we conclude the district court properly remanded the case, we deny the motion for writ of habeas corpus as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
