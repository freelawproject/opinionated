After review, we vacate Young\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Young pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and did so without a written plea agreement. At the plea hearing, the government offered the following factual basis for the plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-10\">The government would expect the evidence to show that on or about April 6, 2007, deputies from the Madison County [Alabama] Sheriffs Office responded to a burglary call at 244 Wilson Manley Road, at Owens Cross Roads, Alabama. The homeowner found Mr. Young inside the residence and chased him. Deputies responded to and located Young near Williams Service Station on Gene Carpenter Road in Owens Cross Roads. Deputies observed Young to be in possession of a firearm, a Smith and Wesson 9 millimeter pistol stolen from the above referenced residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">When the district court asked Young whether the brief outline of the facts was \u201csubstantially correct,\u201d he answered affirmatively. And when the district court asked whether he did the things that the government said that he did, Young said that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">As to sentencing, the base offense level for Young\u2019s offense \u2014 being a felon in possession of a firearm \u2014 turned on whether he had one or more prior felony convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (setting a base offense level of 24 if defendant has \u201cat least two felony convictions of ... a crime of violence\u201d), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) (setting a base offense level of 20 if defendant has \u201cone felony conviction of ... a crime of violence\u201d). The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Young\u2019s base offense level at 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), because Young had <em>two </em>prior felony convictions for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u2014 namely, two Alabama convictions for escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">As to the nature of the two convictions, the PSI reported that Young was convicted \u201con March 4, 2002, for Escape 1st, in the Coosa County, Alabama, Circuit Court (CC01-132); and on September 29, 2003, for Escape 2nd, in the Madison County, Alabama, Circuit Court (CC03-2837). Therefore, the base offense level is 24.\u201d In the district court, the parties did not dispute that the September 29, 2003 escape conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d but they hotly disputed whether the March 4, 2002 conviction was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The PSI, in paragraph 28, described Young\u2019s March 4, 2002 escape conviction as failing to report back to a \u201cwork release center\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-14\">According to the United States Probation Office in the Middle District of Alabama, on February 16, 2001, the defendant was an inmate at the Alexander City, Alabama, Work Release Center in Coosa County, Alabama. On that day, the defendant failed to check back in at the work center after work, and he was subsequently placed on escape status. The defendant surrendered himself at the work release center the following day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>The PSI recommended increasing Young\u2019s offense level to 29 by adding: (1) two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), because the firearm was stolen; (2) four levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), because Young committed the felony possession crime while committing the felony offense of burglary; and (3) two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, because Young \u201crecklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person when he fled from the officers, held a pistol to his head, and caused officers to prepare to fire their weapons;\u201d and by then subtracting: (4) two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), for accepting responsibility; and (5) one level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), because Young \u201ctimely provided complete information concerning his involvement in the offense, or timely notified authorities of his intent to enter a guilty plea.\u201d Young\u2019s total adjusted offense level of 29 and criminal history category of VI yielded an advisory guidelines range of 151 to 188 months in prison. Because the guideline range exceeded the statutory maximum of 120 months, see 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(2), the statutory maximum became the guideline sentence, p\u00farsuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Young made several written objections to the PSI prior to sentencing. First, Young argued that his base offense level should have been 20 \u2014 not 24 \u2014 -because his March 4, 2002 escape conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Young\u2019s counsel pointed out that Young\u2019s escape conviction was a walkaway while he was on work release. His counsel directed the court to paragraph 28 of the PSI, which described Young\u2019s escape as a failure to check back in at the work release center after work and stated that Young surrendered to the center the following day. Although the government argued that the district court could not look beyond the charged escape offense, the government did not introduce the indictment or sentence relating to this state escape conviction. Indeed, neither the PSI nor the government ever identified . the Alabama statute under which Young was convicted (either in the district court or on appeal).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">When the district court heard Young\u2019s objection, the Supreme Court had not yet rendered its decision in <em>Chambers v. United States, 555 </em>U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), which concluded that a failure to report to a penal institution crime is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>129 S.Ct. at 693. At the 2008 sentencing hearing, both the government and the district court relied on <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950 (11th Cir.2001),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which held that \u201ca prior escape conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019\u201d 251 F.3d at 954. In response to Young\u2019s objection, the government argued that <em>Gay </em>was controlling. Although the district court looked to the undisputed facts of Young\u2019s underlying escape conviction outlined in the PSI (i.e., Young failed to report back to a work release center) and treated them as true, it overruled Young\u2019s objection based on <em>Gay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">In addition to the crime-of-violence issue, Young also argued at sentencing that: (1) the application of the two-level enhancement for the stolen firearm and the four-level enhancement for using the firearm in a burglary constituted improper double counting; (2) the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice should not have applied because his three-hour standoff with the police posed no risk of harm to anyone other than himself; and (3) any enhancement based on facts to which Young did not admit ran afoul of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The district court overruled each objection and adopted the factual statements contained in the PSI. It found Young\u2019s offense level was 29 and his criminal history category was VI, yielding an advisory guidelines imprisonment range of 120 months. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a 120-month sentence. Young appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">Young raises a number of challenges to his sentence. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">A. Crime-of-Violence Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Relying on <em>Chambers, </em>Young argues that the district court erred by treating his March 4, 2002 escape conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and setting his base offense level at 24. As we note above, the Supreme Court in <em>Chambers </em>held that the failure to report to a penal institution crime is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. 129 S.Ct. at 693. Because the ACCA defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d the same way as the guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d Young argues that <em>Chambers </em>means that his escape conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the guidelines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">On appeal, the government concedes that Young was improperly sentenced in light of <em>Chambers. </em>The government\u2019s brief states: \u201c[T]he government is unable to meaningfully distinguish Young\u2019s escape conviction from that at issue in <em>Chambers. </em>Thus, Young\u2019s conviction for failing to report back to a work release center should not have been deemed a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d Appel-lee\u2019s Br. at 9. In addition, no party claims on appeal that the district court improperly looked to the facts in the PSI that showed the conduct in Young\u2019s March 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>2002 escape conviction was a failure to report back to a work release center.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, the government did not introduce a judgment of conviction or tell the district court which Alabama escape statute Young violated. It is thus not surprising that the government now concedes that it cannot show that Young\u2019s March 4, 2002 escape conviction is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Therefore, given the undisputed facts in the PSI, the government\u2019s concession, and the defendant\u2019s <em>explicit </em>stipulation and reliance on the facts of the PSI,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude that Young\u2019s March 4, 2002 offense consisted only of his failure to report back to his work release center while he was incarcerated and does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We vacate his sentence on this ground alone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">B. Sentence Enhancement Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Young also raises a number of challenges to the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, he argues that the district court\u2019s enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) and (b)(6) constituted impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">\u201c \u2018Impermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.1999)). Unless the guidelines direct otherwise, this Court presumes \u201cthat the Sentencing Commission intended separate guideline sections to apply cumulatively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227. \u201c \u2018Double counting a factor during sentencing is permitted if the Sentencing Commission ... intended that result and each guideline section in question concerns conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>(quoting <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1995)) (alteration in original). Further, \u201c[t]he offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are applied cumulatively (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 emt. n. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The district court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). Young contends that it is impermissible double counting to apply the \u00a7 2K2.2(b)(4)(A) enhancement based on the firearm being stolen because the basis for his conviction was being a felon in possession of a firearm. In his view, the theft and the possession \u201cwere one in the same.\u201d However, the enhancement, which was based on Young\u2019s theft of a firearm, was not fully accounted for by Young\u2019s base offense level, which was based on Young\u2019s being a felon in possession of a firearm, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). A felon can impermissibly possess a firearm without stealing it. Thus, Young\u2019s enhancement for stealing the firearm that he impermissibly possessed does not constitute impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Young also argues that the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for possession of \u201cany firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d The felony in this case was Young\u2019s burglary of a home. In the plea colloquy, Young admitted that detectives responded to a burglary call at the home of another person in Owens Cross Roads, Alabama, that he was in the home, that he was chased out by the homeowner, and that he was in possession of a firearm he stole from that residence. Young does not argue that these facts are insufficient to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he committed the felony offense of burglary. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1280-81 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that the government has the burden of proving, \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, the facts necessary to support [a] sentencing enhancement\u201d). Rather, Young argues that this enhancement is duplicative with U.SlS.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), which imposes a two-level enhancement for possession of a stolen firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">We find no impermissible double counting in this regard either. The four-level increase, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), accounts for the fact, that Young possessed the gun in connection with his burglary of a home in Owens Cross Roads, Alabama. The two-level increase, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), for possessing a stolen gun does not account for the harm involved with possessing a gun in the course of burglarizing a dwelling. Possessing a stolen gun is one thing. But possessing a stolen gun that one obtains by burglarizing a dwelling is quite another. And the guidelines reflect that difference.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Lastly, Young asserts that he should not have received a two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight, because his conduct was more akin to the behavior outlined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, which deals with obstructing or impeding the administration of justice. Section 3C1.2 authorizes a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">For starters, at the plea hearing, Young admitted that law enforcement officials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>were forced to engage in a \u201cthree-hour stand-off with Young who was threatening to shoot himself with a firearm before surrendering the firearm to deputies.\u201d The PSI confirms this, too. The PSI states that \u201cthe officers on the scene had their own firearms pointed at [Young] because [he] threatened suicide by putting the firearm to his head. After three hours of negotiation, [Young] subsequently released the firearm and was placed into custody. According to the government, the firearm was loaded.\u201d The PSI further states that the incident occurred in congested areas where the general public was at risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">Not knowing whether or not [Young] would fire or attempt to fire at other individuals, the officers aimed their own firearms at [Young] for protection and security purposes. According to [Investigator] Chaffin, the instant offense occurred during the middle of the day, behind a congested service station, with a hardware store located next to the service station. There were individuals who were at the service station at the time of the instant offense. This conduct also occurred on a congested four-lane road where the general public was at risk to be fired upon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The district court adopted the facts of the PSI and specifically noted that \u201cthe particular facts of this ease did create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person, and [Young] was clearly fleeing.\u201d These findings are supported by the record and thus are not clearly erroneous. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">C. Constitutional Error</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">Young argues that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because he was never charged with or convicted by a jury of a burglary, but yet his sentence was enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for possession of a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">Under <em>Apprendi, </em>any fact <em>that increases </em>the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. And under <em>Blakely, </em>the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is the maximum sentence a judge may impose based solely on facts admitted to by the defendant or reflected by the jury\u2019s verdict. 542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. at 2537. Here, Young\u2019s actual sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>do not apply.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, Young admitted to the facts underlying the basis for the burglary enhancement and was sentenced under an advisory guidelines regime. Therefore, his sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005). After review, we find no error under <em>Apprendi </em>or Blakely.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>In conclusion, we vacate Young\u2019s sentence solely based on the crime-of-violenee issue and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-4\">. The most that the PSI said was \"Escape 1st.\u201d Perhaps we could surmise that \"Escape 1st\u201d meant escape in the first degree, and we have located an Alabama statute providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-5\">A person commits the crime of escape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">(1) He employs physical force, a threat of physical force, a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument in escaping or attempting to escape from custody; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">(2) Having been convicted of a felony, he escapes or attempts to escape from custody imposed pursuant to that conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-8\"><em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-10-31(a) (1975). Even if this was the correct statute, we still would not know what subsection Young violated, and the government bears the burden of showing that Young\u2019s escape conviction was a \"crime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Young, </em>527 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 616, 172 L.Ed.2d 470 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b978-16\">. In this Circuit, there is no material difference between the ACCA\u2019s use of the phrase \"violent felony\u201d and the guidelines\u2019 use of the phrase \"crime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). The phrases are coterminous. <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1291 (noting that the phrases are \"identical ... in all material respects\u201d). Although these cases discuss the phrase \"crime of violence\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), \"crime of violence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>means the same thing in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.1(a)(2), the guideline provision setting the base offense level here, as it does in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1 (stating that \" '[c]rime of violence' has the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b979-14\">.
