For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-29\">The United States of America filed the instant civil action against Offiler,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401 and 7403, seeking to reduce to judgment her federal tax liabilities for tax years 1994 through 2000 and foreclose upon the resulting federal tax lien by attaching Offiler\u2019s ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>interest in real property located in Kissim-mee, Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The government filed a motion for summary judgment and attached documents showing that the government had made valid assessments for unpaid income tax against Offiler for the years 1994 through 2000. The government also attached an affidavit by an employee of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), who confirmed that the government had made valid tax assessments against Offiler and that she had outstanding tax liabilities of almost $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Offiler filed an opposition to the government\u2019s summary judgment motion. She did not submit any evidence, but rather attached a self-prepared affidavit, in which she advanced numerous tax-protester legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In a brief order, the district court granted the government\u2019s summary judgment motion. The court stated: \u201cOffiler, a tax protester, has filed numerous documents in this case, but her arguments are uniformly frivolous, and her response to the instant motion is no exception.\u201d After the court subsequently denied Offiler\u2019s motion to vacate the summary judgment order, it entered a decree of foreclosure and order of sale of the property. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions on the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>490 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2007). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>United States v. Ryals, </em>480 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Under the Internal Revenue Code, when an individual fails to pay an assessed tax, a lien in that amount arises in favor of the United States \u201cupon all property and rights, whether real or personal, belonging to such person.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321. That lien \u201carise[s] at the time the assessment is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is <em>satisfied-\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 6322. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403, the government may file a civil action in the district court to enforce the lien and subject the delinquent taxpayer\u2019s property to the payment of such tax liability. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403(a); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 7403(c) (providing that after the district court finds the government\u2019s tax lien to be established, it \u201cmay decree a sale of such property ... and a distribution of the proceeds of such sale\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">Offiler first contends that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction in this case, but this contention is without merit. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402(a) (granting the district courts jurisdiction over civil actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 7403); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340 (granting the district courts jurisdiction over \u201ccivil action[s] arising under any Act of Congress providing for internal revenue\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 (granting the district courts jurisdiction over \u201call civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States\u201d). In this respect, to the extent that Offiler contends that the Florida courts had exclusive jurisdiction over this action, that argument is plainly incorrect. Furthermore, Offiler\u2019s reliance on the federal tax exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act is misplaced because the government was not seeking a declaratory judgment in this case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). Thus, we conclude that the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">Offiler next contends that the district court lacked an evidentiary basis to grant the government summary judgment. However, the government attached evidence to its summary judgment motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>indicating that it had in fact made valid tax assessments against Offiler from 1994 to 2000 and that those taxes went unpaid. <em>See United States v. Chila, </em>871 F.2d 1015, 1017-18 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201c[T]his Court accepts the document \u2018Certificate of Assessments and Payments\u2019 submitted by the government as presumptive proof of a valid assessment.\u201d). Moreover, the government also attached an affidavit by an IRS employee who verified that information. Rather than submit any rebuttal evidence in her response to the government\u2019s summary judgment motion, Offiler merely raised frivolous tax-protester legal arguments. <em>See id. </em>at 1018 (\u201cGiven that the defendant has produced <em>no </em>evidence to counter this presumption, the Court is satisfied that the government has established that the claimed tax liability was properly assessed against the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">To the extent that Offiler argues that her property was protected by Florida\u2019s homestead exemption, that argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. <em>See United States v. Rodgers, </em>461 U.S. 677, 701, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 2146, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983) (noting that the Supremacy Clause \u201cprovides the underpinning for the Federal Government\u2019s right to sweep aside state-created [homestead] exemptions\u201d under \u00a7 7403). We also conclude that Offiler\u2019s alleged failure to receive certain documents during the course of the litigation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Thus, the district court properly granted the government summary judgment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-19\">. The government also named Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., and Dolphin Bay Holdings, Inc., as defendants in the action, but these defendants are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
