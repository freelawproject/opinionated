Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">On January 18, 1997, Torres and three other individuals burglarized the home of Robert Bryan to steal marijuana and cash. Bryan was bound, hit, and at the conclusion of the burglary was left face down on the floor. Bryan\u2019s body, still bound on the floor of his residence, was found on January 25, 1997. He had died from deprivation of food and water. Torres was indicted in Florida state court for his role in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">The only count relevant to this appeal is Count 1, murder in the first degree. The indictment cited to Florida Statute 782.04(1), a provision that criminalizes <em>both </em>felony murder and premeditated murder, but only charged Torres with the unlawful killing of Bryan \u201cwhile engaged in the perpetration of or in an attempt to perpetrate the crime or armed burglary and or armed robbery.\u201d Torres\u2019s case went to trial. During the charge conference, the trial judge stated that she would instruct the jury as to \u201ctwo options with First Degree Murder, one is premeditated, one\u2019s felony.\u201d Torres did not object. In its closing statement, the prosecution did not mention premeditated murder, instead concluding by arguing \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt how Rob Bryan died; there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s Felony First Degree Murder.\u201d After closing arguments, the judge charged the jury that Torres could be convicted of Count 1 if he committed either felony murder or premeditated murder. Again, Torres did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">The jury convicted Torres of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and armed burglary. The verdict form did not ask the jury to specify whether the first-degree murder verdict was based on felony murder or premeditated murder. The trial judge sentenced Torres to life imprisonment for this crime. Torres appealed to the state appellate court, arguing for the first time that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on premeditated murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The convictions were affirmed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Florida Supreme Court denied Torres\u2019s petition for discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Torres timely filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, asserting, inter alia, that he was denied \u201cdue process under the 5th and 14th Amendments when [the] trial court submitted [the] premeditated murder charge to the jury.\u201d The district court held that this claim was procedurally barred because Torres did not object to the jury charge at trial, and he did not show cause and prejudice resulting from the default or that review was necessary to correct a fundamental miscarriage of justice. The district court therefore denied Torres\u2019s petition for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) limited to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_5\">Whether, in light of <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 217, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), the district court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the trial court instructed the jury on premeditated murder, which was not charged in the indictment returned by the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo. </em>Mixed questions of law and fact also merit <em>de novo </em>review. Furthermore, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular claim is procedurally defaulted.\u201d <em>Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>568 F.3d 894, 907 (11th Cir.2009) (citations, quotations, and editing marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Where a state prisoner\u2019s claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal courts only may grant habeas relief where the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u2014 (2). The phrase \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d refers to \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). Factual findings of the state court are entitled to a presumption of correctness. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Torres argues that his due process rights were violated when the state court instructed the jury on premeditated murder, which was not charged in the indictment. Before reaching the merits of this argument, however, we must determine whether this issue is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Generally, we limit our review to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998). However, in a case where the district court\u2019s decision was based on procedural default, we should first address that ruling. <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cUnless we review a district court\u2019s threshold ruling that a claim is procedurally barred from consideration, it would be a waste of our time to consider the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">A party may procedurally default by failing -to preserve a claim for collateral review. <em>Johnson v. Wainwright, </em>778 F.2d 623, 628 (11th Cir.1985). \u201c[A]n adequate and independent finding of procedural default [by the state court] will bar federal habeas review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show \u2018cause\u2019- for the default and \u2018prejudice attributable thereto,\u2019 or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number><em>Harris v. Reed, </em>489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989) (citations omitted). \u201cThe mere fact that a federal claim might have been procedurally defaulted does not prevent a federal habeas court from reviewing that claim if the state court did not rely on the procedural bar as an independent basis for its decision.\u201d <em>Parker v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>331 F.3d 764, 771 (11th Cir.2003). Applying this rule, \u201ca procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case \u2018clearly and expressly<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 263, 109 S.Ct. 1038 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The Supreme Court, however, has explained that \u201cclearly and expressly\u201d should not be read \u201ctoo broadly.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 735, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). In <em>Coleman, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that Coleman\u2019s claims were procedurally barred from federal review even though the state supreme court dismissed Coleman\u2019s petition without explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 740, 111 S.Ct. 2546. The Supreme Court later explained that the state court\u2019s dismissal in <em>Coleman </em>\u201cclearly and expressly\u201d relied on procedural default because, \u201calthough the order was unexplained, the nature of the disposition (\u2018dismissed\u2019 rather than \u2018denied\u2019) and surrounding circumstances (in particular the fact that the State had rested its argument entirely upon a procedural bar), indicated that the basis was procedural default.\u201d <em>Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 802, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991) (discussing <em>Coleman, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In the instant case, the state appellate court held that Torres\u2019s claim was procedurally barred due to failure to comply with the state\u2019s preservation rule. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.390(d). Although the state appellate court never used the word \u201cpreservation,\u201d the surrounding circumstances in this case indicate that the basis for the state court\u2019s opinion was Torres\u2019s failure to adequately preserve the issue for appellate review. <em>See Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 740, 111 S.Ct. 2546. In the state appellate court\u2019s opinion, it noted at length that Torres never objected to the premeditated murder charge. The court detailed four different times during which the issue of premeditated murder was discussed with the trial judge or mentioned before the jury, each time noting that defense counsel did not object. <em>Torres v. State, </em>779 So.2d 393, 394 (Fla.App.2000). The court also quoted a colloquy that took place at the charge conference between the trial judge and defense counsel, in which the trial judge said, \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re gonna stop me if you have any problems with any of these [charges,]\u201d and defense counsel responded \u201cRight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then analyzed whether \u201cthe giving of the premeditated first-degree murder instruction constituted fundamental error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under Florida law, an error in a jury instruction is only reviewed for fundamental error if the claim was not properly preserved. <em>See Hernandez v. State, </em>919 So.2d 707, 710 (Fla.App.2006); <em>Lane v. State, </em>861 So.2d 451, 453 (Fla.App.2003). Although the state court\u2019s opinion would have been clearer had it stated outright that Torres\u2019s claim was not preserved for appellate review, the use of the fundamental error standard, when coupled with the detailed recitation of Torres\u2019s failure to object to the premeditation charge, indicates that the court found that Torres did not properly preserve the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Because the state court found that Torres procedurally defaulted by failing to preserve his claim, we may only review the merit of Torres\u2019s claim if he \u201ccan show \u2018cause\u2019 for the default and \u2018prejudice attributable thereto,\u2019 or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038 (citations omitted). Torres has not shown either.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Ordinarily, to demonstrate \u201ccause,\u201d the appellant must \u201cshow that some \u2018objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Siebert v. Allen, </em>455 F.3d 1269, 1272 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986)). \u201cSuch external impediments include evidence that could not reasonably have been discovered in time to comply with the rule; interference by state officials that made compliance impossible; and ineffective assistance of counsel at a stage where the petitioner had a right to counsel.\u201d <em>Mize v. Hall, </em>532 F.3d 1184, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). Torres has not identified any such external impediments and, although he raised ineffective assistance of counsel arguments below, such arguments were rejected or held procedurally barred and are not properly before this court for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">To demonstrate a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d Torres needs to \u201cshow that, in light of new evidence, it is probable that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice\u2019 occurs in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of someone who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Campbell, </em>353 F.3d 880, 892 (11th Cir.2003). Torres has made no such showing. Torres was convicted by the jury of the felonies of armed burglary and armed robbery. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. 782.04(l)(a)(2). Torres does not dispute that ample evidence was provided to show that Bryan\u2019s death was the result of activities undertaken by Torres and his accomplices during the course of these felonies. Such evidence is sufficient to satisfy the requirements, under Florida law, to convict a defendant of first-degree felony murder. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Torres has failed to demonstrate a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d because there is no evidence that Torres is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Having concluded that the issue contained in the COA is procedurally barred and Torres has failed to show cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice to overcome the bar, the district court\u2019s denial of Torres\u2019s habeas petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-13\">. Torres also raised a number of other alleged errors, none of which are relevant to the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-19\">. The case was remanded, but only for consideration of sentencing issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. The state appellate court also provided an alternative holding that even \u201cif error, [the premeditated murder instruction] did not affect appellant's substantial rights.\u201d <em>Torres, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>779 So.2d at 394. Under this circuit\u2019s precedent, however, \"where a state court has ruled in the alternative, addressing both the independent state procedural ground and the merits of the federal claim, the federal court should apply the state procedural bar and decline to reach the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Zant, 22 </em>F.3d 1541, 1549 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
