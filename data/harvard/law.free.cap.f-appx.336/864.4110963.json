Gareia-Rivera argues that a review of the \u00a7 3558 factors as they apply to his situation shows that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because: (1) the nature of his offense was non-violent, and he did not commit any new offenses while out of custody but instead worked; (2) he was originally in custody for a drug offense committed in order to pay for his father\u2019s funeral; (3) imposing the lower sentence would not have had a diminished impact on him or other inmates at the camp; (4) a reasonable person would believe that being sentenced to additional time, even a year, for escape would have a deterrent effect; and (5) his criminal history gave no indication that the public needed to be protected from him due to a risk of violence as none of his convictions were for violent offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Agbai </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.2007). The Supreme Court has clarified that the reasonableness standard means review of sentences for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>If there are no procedural errors, we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>Such review entails determine ing whether the district court erred in finding that the sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 600. Reasonableness review is deferential, there is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness, we will ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">The district court gave Gareia-Rivera a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range for escaping from federal custody. The district court noted that a sentence under the Guidelines range and a sentence under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors would be essentially the same. Based on seriousness of the offense, Gareia-Rivera\u2019s criminal history, and the rest of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We conclude that, because the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the advisory Guidelines range, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Presentence Investigation Report, and the parties\u2019 arguments as to an appropriate sentence, and because the district court committed no procedural errors and imposed a reasonable sentence, the district court did not err in imposing an 18-month sentence. Garcia-Rivera\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
