Perry\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. On appeal, Perry argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it did not properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He argues that the district court erred by focusing exclusively on his \u201caggravating post-sentence conduct,\u201d without considering his \u201cmitigating post-sentence conduct.\u201d He contends that the district court should have considered the following: (1) he started a drug treatment program; (2) he completed a self-improvement course; (3) he worked as a cook for one year in prison; (4) he completed a commercial driver\u2019s license program with the objective of becoming a truck driver; and (5) he has three children awaiting his release. He maintains that if the court had considered both aggravating and mitigating factors, he would have received a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(e)(2) for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the first part of the analysis, the district court \u201cmust consider\u201d the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, as well as public safety considerations, under the second part of the analysis, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). The district court \u201cmay consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each factor, \u201cas long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhile the district court must undertake this two-step analysis, its decision whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, and to what extent, remains discretionary.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Perry\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence. First, the district court explicitly stated in its order that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, the district court cited the need to protect the public and to provide Perry with educational training as the basis for not reducing his sentence. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. The district court noted that Perry had completed neither a GED program nor an inmate financial responsibility program, as further support for its decision not to reduce Perry\u2019s sentence. Second, the district court found that a reduction was not warranted because an earlier release date for Perry would pose a danger to public safety. The district court\u2019s findings are supported by Perry\u2019s nine post-sentencing disciplinary violations, which included being disciplined for physical violence. <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(ii) (stating that the court, in determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, shall consider any danger posed to the community by a reduction in the sentence). The court did not err by considering Perry\u2019s post-sentencing conduct as a reason for denying a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (stating that the court may consider post-sentencing conduct that occurred after the imposition of the original sentence in determining whether a reduction is warranted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Contrary to Perry\u2019s contentions, the district court\u2019s order indicates that it did consider the mitigating factors raised by Perry. He raised these arguments in his amended \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; the district court stated that it considered this motion'. Moreover, the district court did not have to explain how it weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors under \u00a7 3553(a). Finally, undisputed information in the record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
