Curtis argues that the district court should have applied <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to reduce his guideline range in recognition of the disparate treatment between cocaine and crack cocaine. He also argues that the district court erred in holding him accountable for six kilograms of crack cocaine because it should have considered only the drugs that were distributed after he joined the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">Here, the district court properly denied \u00a7 3582 relief because Curtis\u2019s guideline range was not lowered as a result of Amendment 706 because he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 only lowered base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range). Furthermore, Curtis\u2019s argument that the court improperly attributed more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine to him is meritless because the district court must keep all the original factual findings the same during \u00a7 3582 proceedings, and he was held accountable for 6 kilograms at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resen-tencing, and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged\u201d). Additionally, Curtis\u2019s arguments under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>fail because those cases are not retroactively applicable guideline amendments and cannot be a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009) (holding that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>render a guideline range advisory in the context of a \u00a7 -3582 proceeding, whether or not the guideline range is reduced -by a sentencing amendment); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>did not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief because it was not a sentencing amendment). Therefore, the district court properly denied the \u00a7 '3582 motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AnI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
