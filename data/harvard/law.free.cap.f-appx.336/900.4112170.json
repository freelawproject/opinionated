Burns\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Burns argues that the district court was entitled to reduce his sentence because the ba\u2018se offense level for his underlying crack cocaine offenses has been altered by Amendment 706, but Burns acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008). Burns was sentenced as a career offender. Burns argues that the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence below the amended range under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), but those decisions do not apply to a motion to reduce a sentence. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009). The district court did not err by denying Burns\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">The denial of Burns\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
