Coley was designated as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 based on prior convictions for selling cocaine and carrying a concealed firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">Coley\u2019s initial offense level was 23 based on the amount of crack cocaine he possessed, and he had a criminal history category of III. But because of his career offender status, Coley\u2019s offense level increased to 31 and his criminal history category to VI. Accordingly, Coley faced a prospective sentence of 188 to 235 months imprisonment on the crack cocaine count, plus a mandatory consecutive minimum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>60 months on the firearm count. To reward Coley for testifying against-- other defendants, the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion seeking a downward departure in his sentence. That 5K1.1 motion freed the court from the mandatory sentencing guidelines <em>pre-Booker. See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (\u201cUpon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance ... the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d). At Coley\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court asked defense counsel what Coley\u2019s guidelines sentence would have been if not for the career offender status. Counsel answered that the crack cocaine count would carry a guidelines range of 78 to 97 months under the original calculation, based on the amount of crack cocaine involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court eventually sentenced Coley to 84 months on the crack cocaine count, plus 36 consecutive months for the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines reduced the offense levels that apply based on the quantity of crack cocaine attributed to a defendant. After Amendment 713 made that change retroactive, Coley filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion seeking a reduction in his sentence. The district court denied that motion because Coley was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, meaning that Amendment 706 did not lower his applicable guidelines range. Accordingly, the court found that Coley\u2019s motion was outside the proper scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Coley contends that the district court erred in determining that he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because (1) he no longer qualifies 'as a career offender after <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), and (2) his sentence was based, at least in part, on his initial guideline range calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 the drug quantity guideline altered by Amendments 706 and 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Coley\u2019s first argument is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582. His assertion that he is no longer a career offender after <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer </em>asks us to revisit the application of \u00a7 4B1.1,. not the -crack cocaine quantity guideline at \u00a7 2D1.1. Section 4B1.1, unlike \u00a7 2D1.1, has .not been amended since Coley\u2019s sentencing, and \u00a7 3582 proceedings do not encompass challenges to the application of guidelines that have not been retroactively amended. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b) (\u201cthe court shall substitute only [retroactively amended guidelines] .. i that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]e have held that <em>all </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 782 (stating that \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d are not cognizable in \u00a7 3582 motions, and must be brought as \u00a7 2255 collateral attacks on the sentence). Coley has brought a separate \u00a7 2255 motion raising his <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer </em>issue, and it is addressed in <em>Coley v. United States, </em>08-15962.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Coley\u2019s second argument is that his actual sentence was based, in part, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>application of the crack cocaine quantity guideline instead of the career offender one. Section 3582(c)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-3\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Coley appears to concede that ordinarily a prisoner whose guidelines range was set by the career offender guideline rather than the crack cocaine quantity guideline is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201calthough Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to [these] defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1\u201d and thus denying relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Coley argues, however, that although his final guideline range was set by the career offender guideline, his actual sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He points out that the district court was freed from the constraints of the career offender guideline by the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure. And in searching for guidance about how much to depart in Coley\u2019s case, the court asked his counsel what his (crack cocaine) guidelines range would have been had the career offender provision not applied. The court then sentenced Coley within that range on the crack cocaine count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Coley\u2019s theory, which is plausible, is that the district court did \u201cbase\u201d its <em>actual </em>sentence on what it believed his crack cocaine guideline was at the time. That guideline has since been reduced two levels by Amendments 706 and 713, so Coley argues that he should be allowed a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Coley correctly notes that <em>Moore </em>does not control. In <em>Moore, </em>one of the defendants was sentenced under the career offender guideline range but received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure, just like Coley. 541 F.3d at 1330. However, in <em>Moore </em>there was no correlation between the actual sentence received and guideline range calculated before adding on the defendant\u2019s career offender status; the district court in <em>Moore </em>apparently never asked what the original range-had been. We pointed out that there was no \u201cindication that the court based Moore\u2019s sentence on the guideline range that would have applied absent the career offender designation. Thus ... there is no basis for concluding that the reduction of Moore\u2019s base offense level lowered the sentencing range relied upon by the district court in determining his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. <em>Moore </em>did not say, and could not have held, what would have happened if the district court in that case had relied on the crack cocaine quantity guideline in deciding how much to reduce Moore\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">But that question is answered by another requirement embedded in \u00a7 3582 \u2014 one that sinks Coley\u2019s argument. Section 3582 requires that any application of that statute be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201cwe must treat such commentary [in the policy statements] as binding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>The applicable policy statement is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which states: \u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. 8582(c)(2) if \u2014 ... (B) [a retroactive amendment] ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2). Thus, the policy statement requires Coley to show that his <em>actual applicable guideline range </em>was lowered by Amendments 706 and 713. It is not enough for Coley to have made a plausible argument that the district court, departing downward from his applicable guideline range, used Coley\u2019s crack-cocaine-quantity-based guideline range as a suggestion to inform its discretion in fashioning a sentence for Coley.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The simple fact is that Coley\u2019s <em>applicable guidelines range </em>was 188 to 235 months, and it was based on \u00a7 4B1.1 \u2014 the career offender guideline. That range was not changed at all by Amendments 706 or 713, which changed only \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 the crack cocaine quantity guideline. <em>See generally Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1342 (observing that because the defendant \u201cwas subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure\u201d and so he could not get a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the policy statements). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Coley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. Counsel miscalculated slightly by forgetting the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The right answer would have been 57 to 71 months, not including the mandatory consecutive 60 months for the firearm charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. More specifically, within the range that counsel told the court would have applied to Coley; counsel was slightly off. <em>See </em>supra note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
