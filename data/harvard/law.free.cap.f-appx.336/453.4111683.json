The IJ denied Gebresadik\u2019s application after finding that she was not a credible witness. Alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tively, the IJ ruled that even if Gebresa-dik\u2019s testimony were credible, she had not demonstrated eligibility for relief. The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision ordering Gebresadik\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Gebresadik argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. She challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that her asylum interview and hearing testimony were inconsistent concerning the beatings that she testified that she underwent while she was in prison in Eritrea. She also challenges the IJ\u2019s determinations that it was implausible that (1) she received six months of noncombat training merely to be a \u201cdomestic,\u201d (2) guards who were friends risked repercussions by helping her to escape the prison, and (3) a friend gave her $16,000 to be smuggled from South Africa to the United States. Additionally, she challenges the IJ\u2019s inclusion of her failure to provide sufficient corroboration in his reasons for determining that she was not credible because corroboration concerns only the burden of proof and is analytically distinct from the issue of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Because Gebresadik filed her application for relief in 2007, this case is governed by the standards set forth in the REAL ID Act for evaluating witness credibility in asylum and withholding of removal cases. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1168(b)(1)(B)\u00ae, (iii); REAL ID Act \u00a7 101, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-05 (May 11, 2005). \u201c[I]t is the factfinder\u2019s duty to make determinations based on the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d and \u201c[w]e cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to ... factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). A credibility finding is a finding of fact that is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See Vidal v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2007). Under substantial evidence review, we may not reverse a finding unless the evidence compels it. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Gebresadik has not shown that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. The IJ\u2019s determination that it was implausible that Gebresadik\u2019s prison guard friends who believed she was innocent and who did not want to see her suffer would have risked persecution in helping her to escape is questionable, and it is arguable whether the IJ misspoke when stating that lack of corroborating evidence further impeached her credibility. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). However, the IJ\u2019s additional findings concerning the inconsistencies in Gebresadik\u2019s accounts concerning whether she was beaten while in prison and her implausible assertions concerning her training to be a secretary and her friend\u2019s payment of $16,000 to smuggle her to the United States from South Africa suffice to support the IJ\u2019s finding that she was not a credible witness. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence in this case does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; see <em>also </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (specifying criteria for BIA\u2019s credibility determination). The denial of relief in this case was based on the factual finding that Ge-bresadik failed to provide a plausible claim, and the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Gebresadik also argues that the IJ erred in stating that the REAL ID Act required corroboration of a credible asylum claimant\u2019s account. However, because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ported by substantial evidence, the issue whether a credible asylum applicant\u2019s account requires corroboration is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we need not address Gebresadik\u2019s argument challenging the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that there was a lack of a nexus between the harm and fears she endured and a protected asylum ground. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. Accordingly, Gebresadik\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
