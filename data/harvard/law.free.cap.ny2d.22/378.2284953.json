Klein Department Store, Hempstead, New York, by two store detectives for allegedly stealing an aerator (a small water faucet device). He was taken to the office of the store\u2019s security manager and emptied his pockets at the manager\u2019s request. The security manager then <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>frisked \u2019 \u2019 defendant to determine if he possessed additional stolen property or weapons. This \u201c frisk \u201d revealed a loaded semi-automatic pistol which was forcibly taken from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Defendant was indicted for felonious possession of a loaded firearm. His motion to suppress the pistol was denied after a hearing. Defendant was thereafter convicted upon his plea of guilty of criminal possession of a firearm as a misdemeanor in Nassau County Court and sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. Execution of sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on probation for one year. The Appellate Division, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Second Department, affirmed in an opinion upon the ground that \u201c evidence wrongfully obtained by a private person is admissible in a State criminal prosecution \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Defendant contends that his pistol was unlawfully seized by Klein\u2019s security manager during a search following an unlawful arrest and, therefore, should have been suppressed upon his motion. He argues that his arrest was unlawful because he was acquitted in a separate trial of the shoplifting charge for which he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Here, the store detectives had no connection with the police and seized defendant\u2019s pistol in pursuance of their private responsibility to provide security for the store. The validity of defendant\u2019s arrest, therefore, is measured by the standards applicable to arrests by private citizens. At the time of this incident, the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 183, subd. 1) authorized a private person to arrest without a warrant for a crime<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> committed in his presence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Governale, </em>193 N. Y. 581; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>10 N Y 2d 99), but the validity of such an arrest depended upon the guilt of the defendant. <em>(McLoughlin </em>v. <em>New York Edison Co., </em>252 N. Y. 202, 205; cf. Citizens Arrest, 65 Col. L. Rev. 507 [1965].) Section 218 of the General Business Law makes reasonableness of arrest available to retail stores and their employees as a defense to civil false arrest suits, but does not validate an otherwise invalid private arrest. It follows that defendant\u2019s arrest was invalid since he was acquitted of the shoplifting charge. We do not reach, therefore, the question whether a private person may conduct a search without a warrant incidental to a lawful arrest. (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Viale, </em>312 F. 2d 595, 600 [2d Cir., 1963], cert. den. 373 U. S. 903; contra, cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Alberta, </em>37 Misc 2d 847, 849.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The question presented then is whether the Fourth Amendment requires exclusion in <em>criminal </em>prosecutions of evidence wrongfully obtained by private individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Historically, the Fourth Amendment protections of privacy against unlawful searches and seizures have their origins in the English law of the 17th Century and earlier (Lasson, History and Development of the Fourth Amendment [John Hopkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Press, 1937], <em>passim; </em>cf. historical material in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U. S. 616, 624-630 [1886]). These protections have not been applied to searches and seizures by persons other than government officers and agents. <em>(Sackler </em>v. <em>Sackler, </em>15 N Y 2d 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It has long been settled that our State\u2019s prohibitions against unlawful searches and seizures (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 12; Civil Rights Law, \u00a7 8) do not require exclusion of evidence because a private individual has gathered it by unlawful means. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Defore, </em>242 N. Y. 13, 22, 23 [1926]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Richter's Jewelers, </em>291 N. Y. 161,168 [1943].) Likewise, successive Legilatures and constitutional, revisers since <em>Before </em>have refused to act favorably on proposals to bar from evidence proof so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell </em>(256 U. S. 465) the Supreme Court (p. 475) flatly stated that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201corigin and history clearly show that it was intended as a restraint upon the activities of sovereign authority, and was not intended to be a limitation upon other than governmental agencies\u201d. (Cf. <em>Gambino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U. S. 310, 316 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Defendant, however, argues that <em>Burdeau </em>has been overruled by <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States </em>(364 U. S. 206) and by <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(367 U. S. 643). The dissenters in <em>Sackler (supra) </em>made a similar argument. We rejected this argument in <em>Sackler </em>and held that evidence obtained by private persons was not required to be excluded in <em>civil </em>litigation on the grounds of an illegal search and seizure. However, we expressly did not reach in <em>Sackler </em>the issue of whether information wrongfully obtained by private individuals may be used by the State in <em>criminal </em>prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument is necessarily premised upon the proposition that evidence unlawfully seized by State officials as well as by private persons was not proscribed by the Federal Constitution prior to <em>Elkins. </em>Accepting this argument, it would follow that the exclusionary rule announced by <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio (supra) </em>would apply to all evidence unlawfully seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">However, a careful reading of <em>Elkins </em>demonstrates that prior to <em>Elkins </em>evidence seized by government officials was treated differently in Federal prosecutions than evidence procured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>private individuals. Justice Stewart, writing for the <em>Elkins </em>court, noted that evidence illegally seized by State officials was held admissible by <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(232 U. S. 383) because the Fourth Amendment did not apply to State activity. <em>(Elkins, </em>supra, pp. 209-210.) Justice Stewart then noted that the court unequivocally determined in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>(338 U. S. 25) that the Federal Constitution by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited unreasonable searches and seizures by State officers although it did not require the States to adopt the exclusionary rule. <em>(Elkins, supra, </em>p. 213.) Thus, it is clear that the <em>Elkins </em>decision did not overrule <em>Burdeau. </em>The evidence seized by State officers in <em>Elkins, </em>although admissible in a State court because the exclusionary rule had not yet been applied to the States, was inadmissible in a Federal court because it had been obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. Likewise, <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio (supra) </em>did not overrule <em>Burdeau </em>because <em>Mapp </em>only held that State courts must exclude evidence which is seized in violation of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In <em>Burdeau, </em>however, and in the case at bar, the evidence was not seized in violation of the Federal Constitution because neither the Fourth nor Fourteenth Amendment proscribes private as opposed to governmental activity. Therefore, since the evidence in this case was seized without the participation or knowledge of any governmental official, it is admissible in a criminal prosecution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kowalczyk, </em>20 N Y 2d 835; <em>People </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>49 Misc 2d 39; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trimarco, </em>41 Misc 2d 775; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>220 Cal.
