We have limited jurisdiction to pass on the factual determination affirmed by the Appellate Term, unless unsupported, as a matter of law <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leonti, </em>18 N Y 2d 384).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Appellant claims, however, that this case \u20181 presents an extraordinary state of the evidence, which raises the issue to one of law, rather than fact \u201d, since \u201c [a] 11 the events alleged to constitute the crime in this case are recorded from moment to moment in a film shot by the American Broadcasting Company, as a television newsreel. \u2019 \u2019 This is not sustained by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">At the time of trial, it was stipulated that the films were not \u201c in sequence \u201d and <em>x\u2018 </em>must have been cut and spliced.\u201d Furthermore, there was no testimony elicited upon the trial as to whether the events depicted in this television tape represented a complete pictorial record of the facts and circumstances leading to the appellant\u2019s arrest. Hence, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that such tape establishes that there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Since we cannot hold, as a matter of law, that the spliced and cut television tape constitutes a complete refutation of the testimony of the People\u2019s witnesses, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b137-9\">Burke, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AaP\">On March 4, 1966, the Attorney General of the United States announced that his office was investigating the DuBois Club to determine whether it Avas a Communist organization. The folloAving day, a press conference was held at the Brooklyn chapter of the club, located at 621 Vanderbilt Avenue, to reply to the Attorney General\u2019s statement. Eric Eisenberg, then 23 and a staff member of the New York City chapter of the club, was present at the conference. By the time it concluded, shortly after three o \u2019clock, a crowd had gathered outside consisting primarily of neighbors Avishing to express their dislike for the club. At this time, police draAvn from two local precincts ordered the members to leave their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>club as soon as possible \u2014 well aware that this was the easiest way to disperse the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">One of the first to leave was David Barkin, who, with four friends, walked to his car, which was parked around the corner on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue. After these youths were in the car, garbage cans were thrown at them by members of the crowd. The police quickly restored order, and then removed the boys from the car and searched them preparatory to their arrest. This commotion caused many of the people still on Vanderbilt Avenue to run to St. Mark\u2019s Avenue. Eisenberg was on the club steps when he 'first realized a disturbance was going on around the corner. By the time he reached the car on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue, the police had complete control of the crowd. Informed that the garbage throwing incident could not have been the fault of these youths since they were in the car when the outburst occurred, he approached Officer Pollino who was handcuffing Barkin, and, according to the officer\u2019s own testimony, stated: \u201c I don\u2019t know why you are doing this. You can\u2019t arrest them. They didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d The officer further testified that, in the course of this inquiry, Eisenberg grabbed him by the arm and spun him around. In addition, he said that the defendant immediately thereafter laid his hands on him a second time, turning him in a \u201c half spin \u201d, No attempt was made by any of the other officers then present to arrest the defendant for his conduct, nor did Officer Pollino request them to make the arrest. At least two of the cameramen covering the press conference, also being attracted by the commotion on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue, were able to film this confrontation between Officer Pollino and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A short time later, Officer Pollino observed the defendant grappling with three policemen in front of the DuBois Club on Vanderbilt Avenue. At this point, Pollino arrested him, charging him with resisting a public officer in the discharge of his duties (former Penal Law, \u00a7 1851), because of his activities on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue and with disorderly conduct (former Penal Law, \u00a7 722, subd. 2), arising from his struggle with the police on Vanderbilt Avenue. At the trial, at which some of the film referred to above was introduced, the appellant was convicted only under the former charge \u2014 i.e., resisting an officer in the discharge of his duties. No opinion was written. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>appeal to the Appellate Term, Second Department, resulted in an order unanimously affirming his conviction, again without opinion. The appeal is here by permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In substance, section 1851 makes it a misdemeanor for one to willfully resist, obstruct or delay an officer in discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of his office. Officer Pollino, in the information, stated that the defendant did \u201c wilfully and unlawfully violently push and pull \u201d him while performing a duty of his office. At the trial, Pollino\u2019s testimony was verified by two fellow officers and a civilian who, on cross-examination, admitted that he had a dislike for the DuBois Club. While other witnesses were called, their testimony did not relate to the incident on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Defendant, in his own behalf, testified that he did in fact approach Officer Pollino twice on St. Mark\u2019s Avenue and, while he was not certain, admitted that he might have touched his arm the second time. Regarding the conversations between the officer and himself, he testified that he merely inquired as to the basis for the arrest. After two futile inquiries, he left with the idea of securing counsel for the boys. This part of his testimony was not disputed. Eisenberg then denied that he either spun the officer around or otherwise violently pushed or pulled him. In this regard, his testimony was substantiated both by other witnesses and by the film segments referred to above. In addition, 43 still photographs \u2014 enlargements of the most critical frames in the film \u2014 were submitted to the court, vividly portraying the sequence of events during-which, according to the officer\u2019s testimony, the defendant resisted him while he was discharging his duties. They also lend credence to the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The majority has found the record in this case \u2014 containing 229 pages of conflicting and inconclusive testimony supplied by interested witnesses \u2014 sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction. An objective account of the occurrence, supplied by the continuous filming of the events in question, flatly contradicts their determination. Stated otherwise, the evidence that was presented at the trial is, in our opinion, incredible as a matter of law, to sustain the conviction of this defendant. The film, viewed by this court, presents an accurate record of the events which, according to the majority, constitute the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>of willfully interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty. While the film and photographs are not conclusive, nevertheless, the cumulative pictorial evidence both supplies deficiencies existing in Officer Pollino\u2019s testimony and does substantial damage to it. Thus, Officer Pollino testified that he did not know how many officers were present when he was handcuffing Barkin. The film and pictures show that at least seven other officers were there at that time, who were not engaged in any discernible activity. Also, the officer testified that the defendant grabbed him and spun him around, while he was performing this act. (His information described it as a violent act on defendant\u2019s part.) There is not one photograph showing that the defendant either grabbed or spun the officer. Certain photographs do show that Officer Pollino\u2014while applying the handcuffs \u2014 did in fact turn his head to the right on two occasions to observe the defendant. However, the only hand visible that would cause him to turn from force or pressure belonged to a fellow patrolman, as evidenced by his uniform sleeve. The film also confirms defendant\u2019s testimony. As noted above, the testimony in support of the officer was furnished by two fellow patrolmen and a civilian who admitted a dislike for the DuBois Club. In like manner, the witnesses appearing on behalf of the defendant were members of the club. For all these reasons, the only conclusion to be drawn from the record is that there was in fact no interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The majority, however, would discount this film because of a stipulation by the parties that it was cut and spliced. As the record indicates, the photographer who filmed these events covered the DuBois Club conference from two o\u2019clock until three forty-five in the afternoon. Judicial expediency alone required that the film be cut and spliced before being introduced at the trial. The majority would infer from this stipulation that the critical portions of the film were also cut and spliced. The stipulation, as found in the record, does not sustain this position, since it merely provided that the entire film segment would not be shown. It is noteworthy that the majority \u2014 although it viewed the film \u2014 does not contend that it failed to present what appeared to be a continuous, uninterrupted account of the events recorded. Bather, they have distorted the stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tion\u2019s applicability, thereby discarding the film\u2019s impartial account of the facts involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The majority also discredits the film because \u201c there was no testimony elicited upon the trial as to whether the events depicted in this television tape represented a complete pictorial record of the facts and circumstances leading to the appellant\u2019s arrest.\u201d In this regard, the arresting officer testified that, to the best of his recollection, the film might have been taken either before or after the events for which he arrested the defendant. Undeniably, he was the only person who could state whether the film depicted the \u201c criminal act \u201d. At an earlier point in the trial, however, this officer positively stated that he was handcuffing one David Barkin at the time of the interference. Indeed, it is essential to this case that the officer was performing some duty at the time of the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The film shows Barkin being taken from the car, it shows Officer Pollino arresting him, and it shows the defendant coming up to the officer to remonstrate. In short, the film shows the incident which is the basis of this <em>case; </em>and establishes that the officer\u2019s recollection was erroneous. Undaunted, the majority has predicated its affirmance on his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Additionally, since the record is totally devoid of proof that the defendant (assuming only for purposes of the following paragraphs that he did in fact interfere) was <em>willfully </em>resisting, delaying or obstructing the officer, we have a further ground for reversal. There is no testimony which will serve as a basis for supplying this element of the offense involved herein, nor has the majority enlightened us as to how it resolved this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The word \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>wilful \u2019 \u2019 is present with some frequency in criminal laws. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bruce </em>(33 F. R. D. 133 [N. D., Miss.]) for example, the court was reviewing a conviction under section 1509 of title 18 of the United States Code \u2014 willfully obstructing, impeding and interfering with a United States Marshal as he was performing his duties. The court stated in part (p. 135): <em>\u201c </em>the word \u2018 wilful \u2019 means that the forbidden act is done deliberately and with knowledge. McBride v. United States, 225 F. 2d 249, 253-255 (5 Cir., 1955), certiorari denied 350 U. S. 934 \u2019 \u2019. Our own courts have spoken in similar terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Broady, </em>5 N Y 2d 500; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>29 Misc 2d 545).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">With the enactment of the present Penal Law, various sections dealing with resistance to governmental functions and governmental officers were consolidated in section 195.05 which provides in part that it shall be a Class A misdemeanor to intentionally obstruct, impair or pervert the administration of law. This statute, according to its legislative history, replaces without modification its predecessor \u2014 section 1851. Consequently, the definition of the word \u201c Intentionally \u201d, as set forth in section 15.05 of the new law, is pertinent \u2014 \u201c A person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In light of the traditional meaning accorded the word willful, and aware of the present statutory language, it is necessary that it be shown that the defendant did more than merely touch the officer while asking him questions, before he may be convicted of a violation of section 1851. (See 1 Burdick, Law of Crime, \u00a7 285; Marks and Paperno, Criminal Law in New York, \u00a7 34.) Accordingly, it must be shown that the defendant intended to interfere with the arrest of Barkin. (See <em>State </em>v. <em>Knudson, </em>27 S. D. 400, wherein a conviction in an analogous situation was reversed, since the act involved was found not to be willful.) The only evidence in the record which gives any indication of whether the defendant\u2019s act was willful is testimony by an interested witness that, after inquiring as to the reason for the arrest, Eisenberg departed to retain an attorney for these youths. Under such circumstances, a conviction here is tantamount to holding that an individual has no right to inquire as to the validity of an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Concededly, the circumstances under which an act is performed may sometimes permit an inference of the willfulness of an act without further proof. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Knight </em>(35 Misc 2d 216), the defendant refused to obey the orders of a policeman and instead laid down on the sidewalk. More recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(43 Misc 2d 94), the defendant refused to voluntarily leave police headquarters. This, however, is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>For each of these reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction should be reversed, the fines paid remitted and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Scileppi, Bergan and Keating concur with Judge Jasen ; Judge Burke dissents and votes to dismiss the information in an opinion in which Judge Breitel concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
