The statutes which are clear and precise do not unconstitutionally denigrate appellant\u2019s fundamental rights and are a recognition that a State in its role as <em>parens patries </em>has a serious responsibility to minors within its jurisdiction. <em>(Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.

No prejudicial error was committed by the court at the hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trimarchi, </em>231 N. Y. 263; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States, </em>61 F. 2d 695, 289 U. S. 1.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-5\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A33E\">These three cases, heard together although differing in details, have a common question: What constitutes moral depravity or the '' danger of becoming morally depraved \u2019 \u2019 within the wayward minor provisions of subdivisions (5) and (6) of section 913-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Appellants attack the constitutionality of the statute for vagueness and for opening the possibility of conviction and a penal-type method of correction for persons between 16 and 21 on standards which, for an adult, would not be sufficiently definite as to exactly the kind of conduct which would lead to correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The court, as recently as 1966, has sustained the constitutionality of the statute <em>(People </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>18 N Y 2d 899) against the argument that \u201c morally depraved \u201d was too vague a statutory prescription (p. 900); and for the reasons which are developed here leading to reversal of these convictions on the merits it is unnecessary to reconsider the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">A person adjudged a wayward minor may be committed to a <em>\u201c </em>reformative institution\u201d (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 913-c), subject to release therefrom as in the case of \u201c adult \u201d offenders (Code, \u00a7 913-d), and these include Elmira Reception Center (Correction Law, \u00a7 61) or Elmira Reformatory <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The year after <em>Salisbury </em>was here, the Supreme Court decided <em>Matter of Gault </em>(387 U. S. 1 [1967]) holding a juvenile delinquent in a Juvenile Court in Arizona was entitled to due process substantially similar to that which would underlie criminal charges against an adult. (See, also, <em>Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>386 U. S. 605 [1967]).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">It seems fair to read <em>Gault </em>as Justice Stewart described it in dissent, that it tended to impose on juvenile courts the \u201c restrictions that the Constitution made applicable to adversary criminal trials \u201d (p. 78).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">To be consistent, this procedural requirement should apply as well to the substantive definition of acts committed by juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>niles which are made the subject of corrective or penal discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">It is true, of course, as the People argue, that the protection of the young permits some variation in statutory and other legal arrangements affecting them. Obscenity in its impact on children is one example <em>(Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U. S. 629, [1968]; <em>Bookcase, Inc. </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>18 N Y 2d 71, 75, app. dsmd. <em>sub nom. Bookcase, Inc. </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>385 U. S. 12; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahan, </em>15 N Y 2d 311, 312). But, as the court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Munoz </em>(9 N Y 2d 51, 60), an act made an offense for a juvenile and not for an adult is open to attack as discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Some guidance on the general sufficiency of \u2018 \u2018 morally depraved or is in danger of becoming morally depraved\u201d (\u00a7 913-a, subds. [5], [6]) is possible by reading <em>Giaccio </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(382 U. S. 399 [1966]) where the statute prohibiting the discharge of firearms at another person permitted the jury to assess costs against the accused, even if acquitted, under some circumstances from which the jury might infer misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The trial court, in interpreting the statute, charged this could be done if the jury, acquitting defendant on the crime charged, nevertheless found defendant guilty of misconduct \u201c of some kind as a result of which he should be required to pay some penalty \u201d (p. 404). This was held too vague to justify even the imposition of costs (see opn., Black, J., 382 U. S. 399, 404).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The decision of this court invalidating the vagrancy statute <em>(Fenster </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>20 N Y 2d 309 [1967]) throws collateral light on some theoretical aspects of the present cases. See, also, on this point <em>People </em>v. <em>Munoz </em>(9 N Y 2d 51, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Although, as it has been noted, it is unnecessary to reconsider the general validity of the statute or presently overrule <em>Salisbury, </em>in view of the tightening of due process requirements in this type of juvenile proceeding authorizing the judicial option of confinement in institutions which serve also for the treatment of persons convicted of felony, particular care should be taken that the charge has substance based on acts which point to grave danger to youth and is not merely a compliance with form; and that the conduct inquired into is seriously harmful and not merely an exaggerated manifestion of intra-family parent-child conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">A decision of the Appellate Division rather closely following the enactment of the wayward minor statute suggests this care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>(People ex rel. Deordio </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>230 App. Div. 397 [1930]). Among other things, it was there held a determination under section 913-a could not be predicated alone on a plea of guilty. But see, also, <em>People ex rel. Pogoda </em>v. <em>Superintendent </em>(217 App. Div. 763 [1926]).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">It is not easy to define this for all kinds of situations and, of course, the draftsmen of the statute in 1923 (L. 1923, ch. 868) had difficulties intrinsic to the objective sought. Part of the trouble in the resolution of the draft is \u201cmorally depraved\u201d, a term which probably changes in meaning for each generation. The term is one not readily visualized. Even less easily palpable is \u2018 \u2018 danger of becoming \u2019 \u2019 morally depraved.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">A dictionary definition of \u201c depraved \u201d is \u201c marked by debasement, corruption, perversion or deterioration \u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary [1961]). These characteristics, each suggesting regression, are undoubtedly rare in young people.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The term \u201c morally depraved \u201d is used conjunctively in specifications (5) and (6) of section 913-a; in one instance combined with the desertion of home and in the other with disobedience to parents. When either of these things is shown \u201c and \u201d there is moral depravity or \u201cdanger\u201d of it, the youth may be \u201c deemed \u201d a wayward minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In the three present cases, one or the other of the conjunctive conditions may be deemed established, principally disobedience to parental commands, but the establishment of moral depravity, in addition, is open to valid objection and on analysis the proof of this necessary statutory ingredient is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In Joan Klein\u2019s case, the 18-year-old girl was in conflict with her father concerning her conduct. She had formed an attachment to a man of 30 to whom her parents objected. Her father\u2019s complaint to the court stated she \u201c may have indulged in sexual intercourse with her boy friend, has a key to the apartment of her boy friend \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">There is no proof of sexual intercourse and defendant herself not only denied it but stated she did not believe in sexual intercourse before marriage. The key to her friend\u2019s apartment she explained as having because she had delivered pictures there on one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The complaint also alleged that she \u2018\u2018 stayed away from home for the last three days \u2019 \u2019; but defendant testified she stayed at the home of married people, whom she named, on one of the two nights she was not in her parents \u2019 house; and spent the other alone at a hotel she named. For the rest, she testified she worked at two jobs and had completed high school. It is a fair appraisal of this record to say it shows the defendant in growing conflict with her parents and thus disobedient to them within the terms of the statute; but it fails fairly to establish a reasonable basis to say she is either morally depraved or in danger of becoming so.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In John Fuller\u2019s case, his mother complained that he did not obey her, stayed out late, associated with people of whom she did not approve and was abusive to her. At time of trial defendant was between 17 and 19 years old. His mother also testified that she had found narcotic implements in the house; but since her son had been in custody on this present charge for a week before she found the items and other people lived in the house, the court refused to receive this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">For the rest, she testified she believed be used narcotics because of his \u2018 \u2018 actions and everything \u2019 \u2019 and also that sometimes he stayed out all night but had told her he was staying at a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant denied the use of drugs and stated he had been working in a hospital and had left this job on his own in order to seek a new position. He was adjudicated a wayward minor June 17, 1966. A Judge, other than the Trial Judge, imposed sentence on July 26, some five weeks after the adjudication. Counsel for defendant told the court at sentence that the mother, who had made the complaint, said \u201che\u2019s working and he\u2019s at home now and behaving himself \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Nevertheless, defendant was sentenced to Elmira Reception Center. Thus, with no proof of any substantive act except disobedience and being abusive, defendant has been committed to an institution commonly used for people convicted of felony. The proof does not justify the adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In John Allen\u2019s case, the proof is adequate that defendant was addicted to narcotic drugs. The charge made by his mother included this and that he \u201c steals money from the home \u201d, keeps \u201c late hours \u201d and refuses to obey her commands ; that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>morally depraved or in danger of becoming so. Proof of stealing of money from the home was that on one occasion he took 15 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">At the time of the charge in September, 1966, defendant was 20 years old; he is now over 22 years old. He was adjudicated a wayward minor and sentenced to Elmira Reception Center. Essentially defendant is a narcotics addict in need of treatment rather than a wayward minor under the present charge, and the People, on argument here, suggest remission to consider placement for treatment under article 9 of the Mental Hygiene Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The judgments in <em>Klein </em>and <em>Fuller </em>should be reversed and the complaints dismissed; and in <em>Allen, </em>the judgment should be reversed and the charge remitted to the Criminal Court, Kings County, to consider treatment under article 9 of the Mental Hygiene Law.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-7\">Scileppi, J. (dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"AYfP\">In my opinion the facts as found by the trial courts and unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Term were legally sufficient in each of these cases to establish \u201cmoral depravity\u201d or the \u201cdanger of becoming morally depraved \u201d. It must be remembered that section 913-a of the Code of -Criminal Procedure is designed to protect youngsters against their own pernicious conduct and, while one who is adjudicated a wayward minor thereunder is subject to incarceration, the essential purpose of any judicial action taken after the adjudication is rehabilitation and not punishment. The entire fabric of this statute, which deals with errant youths, is woven around the concept that the courts will exercise the necessary legal means to protect them from their own moral weakness, lawless tendencies and personal indiscretions in order to protect them from inflicting more serious damage on themselves in the future. Hence, I find nothing unfair or unjust in applying the provisions of this salutary statute to accomplish this purpose when, as in these cases, a parent seeks the aid of the court to correct the ways of an irresponsible child who is in fact morally depraved or is in danger of becoming so.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">To my mind, there can be no doubt that the provisions of section 913-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure apply to the proven conduct of the youngsters in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>In the <em>Klein </em>case, the proof established not only that the defendant, an 18-year-old girl, had a strong attachment for a man of 30 years but that she had a key to his apartment; that she stayed away from home continuously for three days and two nights and that she otherwise willfully disobeyed the reasonable requests of her parents to come home early and to stop staying away from home overnight. As a result of her disobedience, there was constant conflict with her father concerning her conduct. While it is true that the parents\u2019 suspicion that she had sexual intercourse with this man is not proof thereof, the totality of the circumstances, in my opinion, justifies the finding that this girl was in danger of becoming morally depraved whether she actually had sexual intercourse or not. The court was not obliged to accept her self-serving explanation that she stayed at a home with married people whom she named but significantly did not offer to produce as witnesses. Nor was the court obliged to accept her further explanation that she spent the other night alone at a hotel which she merely named without offering other proof to support this explanation. The trial court apparently was not willing to be so naive as to close its eyes to the realities of such a situation and could find, as it did, that her explanations were not worthy of belief. Thus, considering all the circumstances, the court had ample evidence before it upon which to find that this girl was in danger of becoming morally depraved and, therefore, adjudged her a wayward minor under section 913-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure <em>(People </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>18 N Y 2d 899).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The defendant Fuller was about 18 years of age. At the time of trial he was unemployed and he had willfully disobeyed reasonable requests of his mother to come home at reasonable hours; he was abusive to her (telling her to shut up and cursing at her); he often stayed out late; he associated with people of whom his mother did not approve; and she found narcotic implements in the house. Evidence of the narcotic instruments, however, was excluded at the trial since there was proof that other persons lived in the house a week prior to their discovery. The mother, however, also testified that she had reason to believe that her son used narcotics because of his unusual actions. She stated that he would lock himself in the bathroom for awhile and, when he came out, he appeared to be \u201c different \u201d\u2014indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>eating that she detected that there was something radically wrong with his appearance and his actions. She also testified that her son stayed out all night about once a week, although he claimed he stayed at a friend\u2019s house. However, he apparently never offered to produce the friend to support this explanation. Moreover, defendant acknowledged that following his arrest he was treated for venereal disease which is of some significance, I suggest, in considering whether he was morally depraved or in danger of becoming so.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The provisions of section 913-a of the Code of Criminal Procedure are designed to protect youngsters from engaging in the kind of dangerous and irresponsible conduct proven in each of these cases; conduct which often results in tragic and permanent injury. To hold that the facts herein are insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a finding that these youngsters were either morally depraved or in danger of becoming morally depraved is to disregard the basic purpose and design of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In my opinion, the totality of the circumstances in both <em>Klein </em>and <em>Fuller </em>furnished sufficient legal evidence to warrant the adjudications and this court should not disturb the facts found below <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leonti, </em>18 N Y 2d 384).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The court in all three cases imposed a perfectly legal sentence (Correction Law, \u00a7 61) and the fact that Fuller was said to be working at the time of sentence and that he was then behaving in no way rendered the sentence illegal. Notwithstanding this information, the court had the discretion to impose the sentence it did, and it cannot be said that there was an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As I have indicated, these cases come within our ruling in <em>People </em>v. <em>Salisbury (supra), </em>and I find nothing said in <em>Matter of Gault </em>(387 U. S. 1) which mandates a reversal in any of these eases. However, since the District Attorney has recommended that the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>be remitted for further proceedings in the trial court, I have acceded to that recommendation and vote to reverse solely on that ground. Because of this, I have not referred to the facts in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Accordingly, the judgments of conviction in <em>Klein </em>and <em>Fuller </em>should be affirmed and the judgment of conviction in <em>Allen </em>reversed and remitted for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen: </em>Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Keating, Breitel and Jasen concur with Judge Bergan; Judge Soileppi concurs solely upon the District Attorney\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Klein: </em>Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Keating, Breitel and.
