Respondents are not qualified persons.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-4\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1V\">On March 5, 1966 respondents were injured while passengers in an automobile owned and operated by petitioner\u2019s insured. In December, 1966 petitioner disclaimed liability because of its insured\u2019s failure to give notice of the accident and co-operate in its investigation. The validity of that disclaimer is not in issue here. Thereafter, respondents served a notice of claim and demand for arbitration on both the petitioner and the Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation (MVAIC) under provisions of the \u201cNew York Automobile Accident Indemnification Endorsement \u201d of the insured\u2019s policy, which provides, <em>inter alia </em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\"I. Damages for Bodily Injury Caused by Uninsured Automobiles: The company will pay all sums which the insured * * * shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury * * * sustained by the insured, caused by accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such uninsured automobile; provided, for the purposes of this endorsement, determination as to whether the insured * * * is legally entitled to recover such damages * * * shall be made by agreement between the insured * * * and the company or, if they fail to agree, by arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>II. Definitions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">(a) Insured. The unqualified word-1 insured \u2019 means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">(1) the named insured and, while residents of the same household, his spouse and the relatives of either;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">(2) any other person while occupying (i) an automobile owned by the named insured * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">(b) Uninsured Automobile. * * * * * \u00ae the term 1 uninsured automobile \u2019 shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">(i) an automobile owned by the named insured or spouse</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">MVAIC opposed respondents\u2019 claim and in a separate proceeding not before this court obtained a stay of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">In the course of denying petitioner\u2019s application for an order staying arbitration, Special Term held that respondents unquestionably were insured persons at the time of the accident and that petitioner\u2019s disclaimer could not operate to change their status from insured to qualified persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court, noting that the effective date of the policy was January 3, 1966, reasoned that respondents were entitled to join petitioner in arbitration pursuant to the Automobile Accident Indemnification Endorsement inasmuch as section 605 of the Insurance Law, as amended by chapter 322 of the Laws of 1965, required the insurer to assume all obligations formerly assumed by MVAIC involving accidents occurring after June 30, 1965, where insurance policies were issued or renewed after that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is grounded on the contention that the New York Automobile Accident Indemnification Endorsement should be considered as part and parcel of the main policy and, therefore, a disclaimer should affect the entire policy and not merely the main liability portion. It is petitioner\u2019s position that the endorsement was never intended to constitute an additional policy of insurance; thus, the endorsement should not operate to revive coverage previously disclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>According to petitioner, although respondents might have been \u2018 \u2018 insured persons \u201d at the time of the accident, the disclaimer operated to make them <em>\u201c </em>qualified persons \u201d <em>ab initio. </em>It further argues that, even if respondents are to be considered \u201c insured persons \u201d despite the disclaimer, they are precluded from proceeding against petitioner by reason of the exclusionary language in the endorsement which by definition excludes a vehicle owned by the named insured from the category of uninsured automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">This is a matter of first impression in this court. The decisions below have often been conflicting and irreconcilable. (Compare <em>Matter of Murphy [Criterion Ins. Co.], </em>57 Misc 2d 52, and <em>O'Connell </em>v. <em>State-Wide Ins. Co., </em>57 Misc 2d 50, with <em>Matter of Shumate [MV AIC], </em>50 Misc 2d 31, and <em>Matter of Coppola [MV AIC], </em>53 Misc 2d 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Effective July 1, 1965 insurers were required to provide the coverage and pay claims arising out of accidents formerly administered by the MVAIC. (L. 1965, ch. 322.) Under the provisions of the amended statute, the insurer undertook the duties and liabilities formerly assumed by MVAIC and similarly collected the additional premium for the endorsement. (Insurance Law, \u00a7 605; \u00a7 167, subd. 2-a.) It has been recognized that the purpose of the statute is to provide compensation to the extent that claims would be recognized and claimants compensated as if the owner or driver of the vehicle causing the injury were insured. <em>(Matter of Nagle [MV AIC], </em>22 N Y 2d 165; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>MV AIC, </em>16 A D 2d 35, affd. 12 N Y 2d 922.) It seems inconsistent with this purpose that an insured person could be deprived of this coverage by some future act of a named insured or his insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Thus, the endorsement required by section 167 (subd. 2-a) of the Insurance Law should be considered to exist independently from the standard policy to which it is annexed and should remain viable even though liability under the main policy has been disclaimed by the insurer. <em>(Matter of MV AIC [Marshall], </em>39 Misc 2d 142, affd. 21 A D 2d 978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The Legislature in enacting article 17-A of the Insurance Law set up the mutually exclusive categories of \u2018 \u2018 Insured \u2019 \u2019 persons and \u201c Qualified person[s] \u201d. (Insurance Law, \u00a7 601, subds. b, i; <em>Matter of Edwards </em>v. <em>MV AIC, </em>25 A D 2d 420 [1st Dept., 1966].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>A future disclaimer as to the main portion of the policy cannot operate to change an \u201c Insured \u201d person to a \u201c Qualified person \u201d. Inasmuch as respondents are placed squarely within the category of \u201cInsured\u201d persons as defined in the Automobile Accident Indemnification Endorsement, the language purporting to remove an automobile owned by the insured from the category of uninsured automobile should be given a construction most favorable to the insured and one which results in coverage, rather than denial of coverage. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Criterion Ins. Co., supra; Matter of Garcia [MV AIC], </em>41 Misc 2d 858.) Thus, the negatively stated exclusionary language should not be held to encompass an automobile owned by the named insured where a disclaimer or liability for a particular accident has been interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Keatikg and Breitel concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\">. Section 601 (snbd. b) of the Insurance Law provides that a <em>\u201c1 </em>Qualified person \u2019 means (1) a resident of this state, other than an insured or the owner of an uninsured motor vehicle and his spouse when a passenger in such vehicle\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-16\">. Although subdivision (a) of section 605 of the Insurance Law discontinues MVAIC\u2019s obligation to an insurer\u2019s insured after June 30, 1965, subdivision (e) of section 605 requires MVAIC to continue to provide protection to qualified persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
