Sections 464 and 544 of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not require that <em>Miranda </em>apply to the retrial of defendants. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ressler, </em>17 N Y 2d 174; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>202 N. Y. 445; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cignarale, </em>110 N. Y. 23; <em>People </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>109 N.

The rationale of the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(384 U. S. 719) clearly establishes that <em>Miranda </em>standards are unavailable to a defendant upon retrial where his original trial began before <em>Miranda. (People </em>v. <em>La Belle, </em>53 Misc 2d 111; <em>United States ex rel. Pierce </em>v. <em>Pinto, </em>259 F.

S. 335.) III. The court should not extend the <em>Miranda </em>standards further than is demanded. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McQueen, </em>18 N Y 2d 337.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-9\"><em>Joseph Harris </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai9c\">I. The prosecution concedes <em>that </em>the subject confessions do not meet the standards of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(348 U. S. 436) and would not ordinarily be admissible. II. The <em>Miranda </em>rules are evidentiary or procedural rules and apply to all trials taking place after June 13, 1966, whether an original trial or a new trial or retrial. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U. S. 719; <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293; <em>People </em>v. <em>McQueen, </em>18 N Y 2d 337 ; <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.

Every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>State in whose criminal code is contained \u2022 sections similar to sections 464 and 544 of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, where the issue of this case has been decided, has decided said issue in favor of the applicability of <em>Miranda </em>to new trials; those States that have decided to the contrary do not have such similar sections in their criminal codes. IV. The equal protection of the laws provisions of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of New York mandate the applicability of the <em>Miranda </em>rules to the instant case. V. Applying the <em>Miranda </em>rules to the instant case would affect only an infinitesimal number of cases.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-4\">\n<em>Thomas J.

The prevailing <em>Per Curiam </em>determination of the immediate court below, sustaining the trial court\u2019s prenew trial order suppressing the alleged confessions of defendants-respondents, should be affirmed by this court. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>384 U.

II. The constitutional admissibility thrust and interrelation of section 2 of article I of the State Constitution; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(384 U. S. 436) ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Huntley </em>(15 N Y 2d 72), and sections 464 and 544 of the Code of Criminal Procedure mandate the application of the <em>Miranda </em>imperatives to <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements which are offered in <em>post-Miranda </em>pre-new trial admissibility hearings and in <em>post-Miranda </em>new trials. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>37 Misc 2d 73; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>31 Misc 2d 139; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pariser, </em>50 Misc 2d 727; <em>People </em>v. <em>Childers, </em>54 Misc 2d 752; <em>Metzger </em>v. <em>Koenigsberg, </em>302 N. Y. 523; <em>Zurich Gen. Acc. &amp; </em>Liab. <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chesterford Homes, </em>18 Misc 2d 470; <em>Erie County Water Auth. </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>4 A D 2d 545; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hollingsworth, </em>46 Misc 2d 1017; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nitzberg, </em>289 N. Y. 523; <em>People </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>109 N. Y. 413.) III. The greater weight of authority throughout the nation seemingly supports the thesis that the <em>Miranda </em>constitutional guideline specifics present constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>admissibility imperatives, which may be invoked by an accused to challenge <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements in <em>post-Miranda </em>new trials. IV. The ruling of the court below is consistent with <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(384 U. S. 719). There is also an identical consistency in the determination of courts of last resort in California, Kentucky, Hawaii, Arizona, Wisconsin, Kansas, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. V. The Federal and State constitutional imperatives conferring a continuing constitutional right to equal protection of the laws upon defendants-respondents and upon Richard M. La Belle, as intervening <em>amicus curiae, </em>would be meaningless if they are to be deprived of the <em>Miranda </em>procedural safeguards at their pre-new trial suppression hearings or at their new trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-5\">Keating, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVI1\">Bruce B. Sayers and Ronald G-. Trevail were adjudicated youthful offenders on January 25,1966. The Appellate Division (Third Dept.) reversed the adjudications because of the improper cross-examination of one of the defendants. A new trial was ordered (26 A D 2d 736).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The defendants moved to suppress the use of their confessions on retrial (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 813-g). The motion was granted by the County Court on the ground that the defendants had not been warned of their constitutional rights in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(384 U. S. 436). The Appellate Division with two Justices dissenting affirmed. The People appeal by permission of an Associate Judge of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We reverse the order of the Appellate Division and hold that the admissibility of the defendants\u2019 confessions should not be affected by the failure of the police to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona (supra) </em>\u2014a case which had been decided after the defendants were questioned and after their original trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(384 U. S. 719, 733) had occasion to deal with the question of what retroactive effect <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona (supra) </em>would be given. The court noted that there were no jurisprudential or constitutional obstacles preventing a purely prospective application of the rule set forth in <em>Miranda </em>and concluded that the decision should affect only those cases in which .the trial had begun after the date on which it was rendered and that those cases in the ordinary course of appeal and those which had already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>exhausted the appellate process should not be affected. In reaching its conclusion the court gave consideration to the fact that law enforcement officials had relied on earlier decisions of the court and, therefore, a retroactive application of <em>Miranda </em>would have a disruptive effect on the administration of justice by requiring numerous retrials. Additionally the court noted that the use of confessions obtained without compliance with the standards set forth in <em>Miranda </em>had a minimal effect on the integrity of the fact-finding process and thus no unfairness would result from a prospective application of the decision. The court went on to conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>decision would \u2018 \u2018 apply only to <em>cases </em>commenced after those decisions <em>[Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478] were announced \u201d <em>(supra, </em>p. 733; emphasis added). As a result, \u201c <em>[f]uture </em>defendants will benefit from [the] new standards * * * , while <em>past </em>defendants may still avail themselves of the voluntariness test\u201d <em>(supra, </em>p. 732; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">At the time of the decision in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona (supra) </em>these defendants were the \u2018 \u2018 past \u2019 \u2019 defendants about whom the Supreme Court spoke; they had been tried and convicted and their appeals were pending when the Supreme Court held that no confessions should be admitted unless a defendant had been apprised of his constitutional rights and had intelligently waived them. The question presented by this appeal is whether the admissibility of the confessions of these defendants must be determined by the standards set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona (supra) </em>merely because of the fortuitous circumstance that an error of law, unrelated to the admissibility of their confessions, took place at their trials which required a reversal of the convictions and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">At the outset it must be noted that the court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey (supra) </em>did not deal with the precise question of what effect <em>Miranda </em>would have on retrials. For this reason, we believe it would serve no purpose to base our decision in this case on strained interpretations of essentially conflicting-language\u2014 as it affects the question before us \u2014 which both parties cite in support of their position (see, generally, Note, The Applicability of <em>Miranda </em>to Retrials, 116 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 316). Rather our decision should be based upon the same considerations of policy which the Supreme Court has indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>are controlling in the determination of the retrospective effect to be given changes in constitutional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The consideration which prompted the Supreme Court to limit the retrospective application of the <em>Miranda </em>decision was, as noted earlier, its concern with the burden upon the administration of justice that would have resulted from upsetting convictions which rested upon confessions obtained in good faith reliance upon <em>pre-Miratida </em>decisions. In the instant case, while the confessions were obtained in reliance upon those same <em>pre-Miranda </em>decisions, a new trial has been necessitated for reasons independent of the <em>Miranda </em>decision and so it is urged that the application of the <em>Miranda </em>standards to the admissibility of the confessions upon a retrial would not burden the administration of justice in the manner in which the Supreme Court was concerned in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey (supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendants\u2019 argument might have some merit if we were to limit our discussion of the burden of the administration of justice merely to the necessity for retrials. There are, however, considerations which touch upon the facilitation of the administration of justice that are not ordinarily present in cases which had not come to trial at the time of the <em>Miranda </em>decision and those, like the instant case, where the trials had been completed and were in the appellate process. The primary consideration in this regard is the ability of law enforcement officials to obtain evidence independent of the confession. In cases where trials had been completed and were in the appellate process at the time of the <em>Miranda </em>decision, many months if not years had passed since the commission of the crime and the initial trial. The original trial in the instant case took place some six months prior to <em>Miranda </em>and the criminal conduct had .taken place long before that. The law enforcement officials in .possession of confessions obtained in accordance with the law as it was at the date of the confession will be unable at this late date to obtain evidence independent of the confession and these defendants and other confessed criminals in the same position will go free. Such a result is neither mandated law nor reason and we decline to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In reaching this conclusion we are fortified by one of the more recent Supreme Court decisions on this retroactivity issue. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(388 U. S. 293) the Supreme Court was required to determine the retroactive effect to be given its decisions requiring the exclusion of identification evidence which was tainted because the accused was exhibited for identification in the absence of counsel. The case in many respects involved the same considerations present in <em>Johnson. </em>There had been reliance by law enforcement officials on earlier decisions, and a retroactive application of the new decisions would have necessitated new trials and thus would have placed a great burden on the administration of justice. The case, however, was a stronger one than <em>Miranda </em>for the purpose of retroactive application since the new rules evolved in that case were designed to insure the fairness of the fact-finding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Supreme Court in a decision which cannot be distinguished from <em>Johnson </em>did not apply the new standards to trials commenced after the date of the new decision but only to those trials in which the lineups had taken place after the decision requiring the presence of counsel. Indeed, the court indicated that, when the basis of a nonretroactivity decision is the reliance by law enforcement officials on particular decisions of the court, the crucial test in determining the point at which the new rule was to be applied was the point at which reliance had taken place. The court cited with favor a lecture given by Mr. Justice Shaefeb of the Supreme Court of Illinois, who was critical of the failure of the <em>Johnson </em>decision to recognize this factor. Mr. Justice Shaefeb wrote (in a passage which was included within the citation in <em>Stovall, supra):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Again, however, in its determination [in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>supra] of the cutoff date for the application of new constitutional doctrines, the Court overlooked the factor of reliance. A police officer conducting an interrogation prior to <em>Miranda </em>could have complied fully with the then applicable constitutional standards but still have failed to comply with the newly added requirements. The earlier constitutional standards were relied upon, not at the moment that the trial commenced, but at the moment that the interrogation took place. <em>There have been cases, and there will be more, in which this distinction is </em>critical.\u201d (Schaefer, The Control of \u201c Sunbursts\u201d: Techniques of Prospective Overruling, 22 Record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of Association of Bar of City of N. Y. 394, 411 [emphasis added], cited in <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>p. 301, n. 2.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">There can be little question, in light of <em>Stovall, </em>that, if <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>were decided today, the standards adopted in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>would have applied to govern the admissibility of only those confessions obtained after the date of the decision. While we are bound to apply <em>Johnson </em>to situations which the court specifically dealt with, we should not apply it to situations such as this, which were not considered in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In closing, we wish to briefly deal with the effect of sections 464 and 544 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\n<em>Section 464</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\"The granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had. All the testimony must be produced anew; and the former verdict cannot be used or referred to, either in evidence or in argument. \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\n<em>Section 544</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\"><em>\u201c </em>When a new trial is ordered, it shall proceed in all respects as if no trial had been had. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">The argument is advanced that these sections bring this case within the ambit of the <em>Johnson </em>holding. The foregoing discussion clearly indicates that the crucial factors in determining whether <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey (supra) </em>applies here are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>considerations of policy and not labels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These sections are, therefore, totally irrelevant to the decision which we must make.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">For the reasons stated, the order of the Appellate Division should -be reversed and the motion to suppress the confessions should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Judges Sctleppi, Bergan and Jasen concur; Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke and Breitel dissent and vote to affirm on the prevailing opinion at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Order reversed and case remitted to the County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\">. The Supreme Court of Illinois has held unanimously that <em>Miranda </em>need not be applied to retrials (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Worley, </em>37 Ill. 2d 439).
