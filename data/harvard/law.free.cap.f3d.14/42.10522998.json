Because we find no merit to appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-25\">Appellant was deported from the United States on November 28, 1990, and again on March 6, 1992, pursuant to warrants of deportation issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cI.N.S.\u201d). On April 2,1992, a Border Patrol Agent spotted appellant at the Immokalee Stockade in Florida, an encounter which led to appellant\u2019s indictment for illegal re-entry into the United States and subsequent conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Appellant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in admitting into evidence portions of appellant\u2019s I.N.S. \u201cA-file.\u201d At trial, I.N.S. Agent Mike Lewis testified that he was the custodian of appellant\u2019s \u201cA-file,\u201d a compendium of documents which tracks an alien\u2019s status. Over appellant\u2019s objections, the Government then introduced portions of appellant\u2019s \u201cA-file,\u201d including warrants of deportation, an order to show cause and an I.N.S. 1-194 form. On direct examination, Agent Lewis pointed out a thumbprint on the warrant of deportation which subsequent testimony established to be that of appellant. Lewis also testified that the 1-194 form indicated that appellant had been warned previously of the penalties for re-entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The Government argues that these documents were admissible, pursuant to the \u201cpublic records\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. Fed.R.Evid. SOS\u00a9\u00ae.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that Rule 808(8) (B) is inapplicable because the documents contain observations of law enforcement officers in a criminal case, and therefore come within the law enforcement exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We hold that admission of routinely and mechanically kept I.N.S. records, such as the 1-194 form and warrants of deportation, does not violate Rule 803(8)(B). In so holding, we join the Fifth and Ninth Circuits. <em>See United States v. Quezada, </em>754 F.2d 1190, 1193 (5th Cir.1985) (admission of warrant of deportation did not violate Rule 803(8)(B)); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Rojas, </em>617 F.2d 533, 535 (9th Cir.) (notations on warrant of deportation did not violate 803(8)(B)), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 864, 101 S.Ct. 170, 66 L.Ed.2d 81 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Moreover, this court has recognized that the public records exception does not exclude police records \u201cprepared in a routine non-adversarial setting,\u201d as it does \u201cthose resulting from a more subjective investigation and evaluation of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (holding that admission of regularly kept property receipts did not violate Rule 803(8)(B)). Where, as here, the admitted records were prepared long before the alleged offense and relied on in daily I.N.S. operations, there are no hearsay concerns, for the \u201ccustodian ... had no incentive to do anything other than mechanically record the relevant information.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>9 F.3d at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Accordingly, we find no error in the admission at trial of appellant\u2019s \u201cA-file,\u201d and therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. Rule 803(8)(B) provides an exception to the hearsay rule for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by ... law enforcement personnel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
