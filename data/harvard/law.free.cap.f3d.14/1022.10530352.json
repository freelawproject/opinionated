Wisenbaker, Jr., a purveyor of diesel fuels, guilty of two counts of attempting to evade federal excise taxes in violation of I.R.C. \u00a7 7201. On this direct appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions and some of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and jury instructions. He also complains that the district court improperly allowed an amendment to or variance from the terms of the indictment. Because we find no merit to Wisenbaker\u2019s challenges, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">Houston M. Wisenbaker, Jr., bought diesel fuel tax-free and resold it through four companies he owned or controlled. He sold the fuel to several different retailers at prices the buyers found surprisingly cheap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Perhaps influenced by Johnson\u2019s low opinion of excise taxes, Wisenbaker had devised a scheme to reduce his costs of doing business. Unfortunately for him, an IRS investigation revealed that Wisenbaker\u2019s lower prices stemmed not from superior efficiency or economies of scale, but from the simple expedient of failing to render unto Caesar those things due unto him. Wisenbaker\u2019s invoices to some of the retailers represented that the price he charged them included the required federal and state excise taxes on diesel fuel. In fact, however, neither Wisenbaker nor any of his businesses paid the required federal excise taxes for the second and third quarters of 1986. Many of the companies who purchased fuel from Wisenbaker also failed to file federal excise tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-15\">Wisenbaker was charged with two counts of attempted tax evasion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the district court, he admitted failing to file the required tax returns, but raised as a defense his good faith belief that he was not responsible for filing them because he was not a retailer. The district court instructed the jury that Wisenbaker\u2019s belief that he was not responsible, even if unreasonable, was a defense to the charges against him if held in good faith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found Wisenbaker guilty of both counts of attempted tax evasion, and the district court sentenced him to five years on each count, to run concurrently. Wisenbaker appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-17\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-18\">Wisenbaker first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. When reviewing a jury verdict for sufficiency of the evidence, we ask whether a reasonable jury could have found each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tax evasion is a felony of three elements: (1) a tax deficiency; (2) an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax; and (3) willfulness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wisenbaker challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the second and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>third elements. We shall address each element in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">1. Affirmative Evasive Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">Wisenbaker contends on this appeal that \u201cthere was not a scintilla of evidence that Houston M. Wisenbaker, Jr. didn\u2019t pay all of the federal excise taxes in question\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is not precisely the issue in this ease: Wisen-baker is charged not only with evading his own taxes but also those of his customers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We shall deal with Wisenbaker\u2019s objection, though, on his own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">We begin by noting that Wisenbaker conceded at trial that he had failed to file quarterly excise tax returns.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is also evidence in the record that Wisenbaker took great pains to conceal his financial dealings. He conducted his business affairs mostly in cash. He hired Rebecca Morgan as secretary-treasurer of one of his companies but would not allow her to set up accounting records for the company. When Morgan attempted to set up aceounts-receivable records, Wisenbaker destroyed them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When state authorities asked Wisenbaker about state fuels taxes he owed, he began shredding boxes of documents.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is ample evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Wisenbaker took affirmative acts to attempt to evade payment of federal excise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">2. Willfulness</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Wisenbaker asserts that his good faith belief that he was not responsible for paying the taxes negates the element of willfulness the government must prove to convict him. To obtain a felony conviction for tax evasion the government must prove the defendant\u2019s specific intent to defeat or evade payment of a tax; a mere showing of willful failure to file a return is insufficient.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The government must prove \u201cthat the law imposed a duty on the defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and that he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A defendant\u2019s belief that he is not liable for a tax, if held in good faith, is a defense to a finding of willfulness even if the belief is unreasonable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-14\">Many of the actions listed above under \u201cAffirmative Evasive Acts\u201d also constitute evidence of Wisenbaker\u2019s willfulness. To defend against the abundance of proof of willfulness in the record, Wisenbaker interposes his alleged good faith belief that the retailers to whom he sold were hable for payment of all federal excise taxes and he was not hable. He bases this on his interpretation of the apphcable Treasury regulation at the time of his offenses. At that time, the regulation read, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-15\">The sale of diesel fuel to an owner, lessee, or other operator of a diesel-powered highway vehicle, ... is considered a taxable sale of the liquid fuel if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-16\">(i) The liquid fuel is dehvered by the seller into a bulk supply tank (or other container) that is not the fuel supply tank of a vehicle ...; and (h) The <em>purchaser famishes a written statement to the seller </em>before or at the time .of the sale stating that the entire quantity of the liquid fuel covered by the sale is for a taxable purpose as a fuel in such a vehicle....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-17\"><em>If the purchaser fails to provide the written statement required by paragraph (a)(2)(H) of this section, the purchaser is liable for the tax </em>on the later taxable sale or use.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>The tax that would otherwise have fallen on the seller of the diesel fuel (i.e. Wisenbaker), therefore, falls instead on the bulk purchaser unless the purchaser furnishes a written statement to the seller. The government proved at trial that some of the retailers who bought fuel from Wisenbaker furnished him with written statements of their desire to purchase the fuel with taxes included. Nevertheless, Wisenbaker contends that the regulation implicitly requires the government to prove also that he (1) <em>received </em>the statements, and (2) <em>accepted </em>the tax liability after receiving the statements. We shall dispatch his second proposed element first because it is the more frivolous and worthy of decisive rejection. Tax liability is not imposed by contract between the seller and buyer of diesel fuel; there is no \u201coffer\u201d the taxpayer must \u201caccept\u201d before liability attaches. Tax liability attaches by operation of law whether the taxpayer \u201caccepts\u201d it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">As to Wisenbaker\u2019s first purported element, we need not decide whether the government must prove Wisenbaker received the statement because there is ample evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that he did. Several of the companies to whom Wisenbaker sold diesel fuel provided his companies with written statements clearly stating their desire that Wisenbaker pay the applicable tax and include it in the selling price of his fuel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Wisenbaker\u2019s companies responded by sending some of the buyers letters assuring the buyers that taxes on the diesel fuel had already been paid.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The acknowledgements by Wisenbaker\u2019s companies are consistent with his having received the written statements required by the regulation. There is also evidence in the record of written statements being mailed and hand delivered to Wisenbaker\u2019s businesses. We conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that Wis-enbaker received written statements from his customers instructing him to pay the applicable federal excise taxes. Accordingly, we need not decide whether that additional requirement is implied in the regulation Wisen-baker relies on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">\n<em>B. Constructive Amendment to or Variance from the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">Wisenbaker next urges that the district court permitted the prosecution to amend constructively the indictment during the trial, a <em>per se </em>reversible error.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Alternatively, he contends that the proof adduced at trial varied from the allegations in the indictment, which would constitute reversible error if he was prejudiced by the variance.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We reject both of Wisenbaker\u2019s theories because both are based on the same misreading of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">Wisenbaker contends that the indictment charged him only with evading <em>his own </em>taxes, and that the proof that he assisted others (i.e. his customers) in evading their taxes constituted an amendment or variance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We do not find the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>indictment susceptible to the restrictive reading Wisenbaker wishes to impose on it. The relevant portion of both counts of the indictment charges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-4\">[T]he defendant HOUSTON M. WISEN-BAKER, JR., did knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully attempt to evade and defeat federal excise taxes ... by making and causing to be made false invoices; by using numerous entities to conceal the purchase of tax-free diesel fuel; by dealing in currency and cashier\u2019s checks; by failing to make a Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, Form 720, ... as required by law, with any proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service; and by other means.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">The indictment contains no terms restricting it to an allegation that Wisenbaker failed to pay his own taxes. It fairly encompasses the government\u2019s theory that Wisenbaker also violated I.R.C. \u00a7 7201 by evading any taxes his customers owed but did not pay because of Wisenbaker\u2019s false assurances that he had already paid the taxes. The proof adduced at trial constituted neither a variance from nor an amendment of the terms of the indictment, and the district court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">\n<em>C. The \u201cDeliberate Ignorance\u201d Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">We noted above that willfulness is an essential element of felony tax evasion. Wisenbaker next contends that the district court diluted the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving willfulness by giving the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-7\">The fact of knowledge or willfulness may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. The element of knowledge or willfulness may be satisfied by inferences drawn from proof that a defendant closed his eyes to or acted in deliberate ignorance of what would otherwise have been obvious to him. A showing of negligence or mistake is not sufficient to support a finding of willfulness or knowledge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqoM\">Wisenbaker timely objected to the instruction. Therefore, we review his challenge using the standard of \u201cwhether the court\u2019s charge, as a whole, is a correct statement of the law and whether it clearly instructs jurors as to the principles of law applicable to the factual issues confronting them\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">A \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d instruction has the potential to confuse the jury, because it allows them to find \u201cwillfulness\u201d without finding that the defendant was \u201caware of the existence of illegal conduct\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For that reason, \u201cthe instruction should rarely be given\u201d.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A deliberate ignorance instruction is \u201cproperly given only when [the] defendant claims a lack of guilty knowledge and the proof at trial supports an inference of deliberate indifference\u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">The district court\u2019s instruction in this case was appropriate. First, the core of Wisenbaker\u2019s defense at trial was his contention that he lacked the necessary willful mental state. Although he did not testify,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> his attorney\u2019s opening statement centered on Wisenbaker\u2019s mental state defense.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> On direct examination, Patricia Luden, the defense\u2019s only witness, testified at length about the basis for Wisenbaker\u2019s belief that he was not responsible for the taxes involved in this case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Second, the evidence plainly supports an inference of deliberate indifference. Wis-enbaker chose not to file federal excise tax returns even after his bookkeepers, including Ms. Luden, brought to his attention his duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>to do so. Because both parts of the test quoted above were met, the district court did not err in giving the deliberate ignorance jury instruction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">\n<em>D. Admission of Wisenbaker\u2019s Prior State Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Wisenbaker failed to pay Texas state taxes on diesel fuel and was twice convicted by the courts of that state.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The district court allowed the prosecution to introduce evidence of Wisenbaker\u2019s two prior state convictions for failing to pay excise taxes on diesel fuel, over Wisenbaker\u2019s Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) objection. We review the district court\u2019s admission of the convictions over a 404(b) objection under a heightened abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\"><em>United States v. </em>Beechum<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> calls for a two-part evaluation of the admissibility of evidence over a Rule 404(b) objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-7\">First, it must be determined that the extrinsic offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character. Second, the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of rule 403.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">The district court properly admitted the prior convictions at issue here. The government correctly urges that the prior state convictions are relevant to an issue other than Wisenbaker\u2019s character \u2014 specifically, that they are relevant to the element of <em>willfulness </em>and tend to negate Wisenbaker\u2019s assertion that he had a good-faith belief that he was not obligated to pay the taxes.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The probative value of the prior convictions outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Wisenbaker, so we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\">\n<em>E. Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-15\">Wisenbaker next argues that the following remarks made in the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement constituted an improper comment on his refusal to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-16\">Now, you may hear testimony from the defendant that he believed that he wasn\u2019t the responsible party for filing excise tax returns. Well, when you see those statements, the statements clearly say that the excise tax will be collected by Mr. Wisen-baker\u2019s company. Those letters were sent to his company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-17\">Secondly, you may hear the defendant believed he wasn\u2019t liable at all because the fuel was going to ships.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-18\">After the prosecutor concluded his opening statement, Wisenbaker\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the quoted text constituted an improper comment on the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify. The district court overruled the motion. We review the grant or denial of a mistrial for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-19\">Wisenbaker casts the prosecutor\u2019s statement as a comment on his failure to testify. We disagree. The context of the statement plainly reveals that the prosecutor was merely outlining the strategy he expected the defense to follow and highlighting its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>weaknesses.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Any error was immediately cured by the district court\u2019s lengthy address to the jury at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s opening statement<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and by its jury instruction restating the defendant\u2019s absolute right not to testify<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">\n<em>F. Rebecca Morgan\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Finally, Wisenbaker alleges that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after Rebecca Morgan, Wisenbaker\u2019s employee, testified on direct examination that Wisenbaker \u201chad been in some trouble in Louisiana\u201d.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Wisenbaker challenges that statement under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), contending that it constituted inadmissible evidence of his bad character. We agree that the statement was not relevant to any issue other than Wisenbaker\u2019s bad character and was for that reason inadmissible. The district court\u2019s error in admitting it, however, was harmless. Although the district judge \u201cdidn\u2019t hear anything that made me think she was talking about criminal trouble\u201d, she offered to give a curative jury instruction nonetheless. Wisenbaker refused. The government\u2019s counsel stated that he had not intentionally elicited the statement.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The government did not elaborate on the cornment, and made no further mention of \u201ctrouble in Louisiana\u201d. We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in denying a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-14\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">. 5 Rec. 351-53 (trial transcript vol. 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">.

He has an absolute right under the Constitution of the United States not to testify and that is not to be held against him by the jury and I want you to keep that in mind at all times. I don\u2019t know whether he is going to testify and counsel for the government doesn\u2019t know whether he is going to testify and any remarks counsel for the government may have made that might lead you to expect Mr. Wisen-baker will testify, you should put that it out of your mind entirely.
