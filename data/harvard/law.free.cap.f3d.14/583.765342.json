Sharp on his claim for a tax refund and denying the United States\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. <em>Sharp v. United States, </em>27 Fed.Cl. 52 (Ct. Fed.C1.1992). Because the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d or \u201cCode\u201d) in effect at the relevant time did not limit the carryover of investment interest to the amount of taxable income in the year the interest was paid or accrued, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">The material facts are undisputed. Sharp filed an amended tax return for 1987, seeking a refund of taxes in the amount of $59,-736.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For each of the taxable years 1983 through 1986 (the loss years), Sharp paid or accrued investment interest as defined by \u00a7 163 of the IRC. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 163(d)(3)(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amount of investment interest that Sharp was able to claim as a deduction for each of these years was limited by \u00a7 163(d)(1) to the sum of $10,000 plus Sharp\u2019s net investment income (investment income less investment expenses). <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 163(d)(1). For the years in question, Sharp\u2019s investment interest exceeded his \u00a7 163(d)(1) limitation. Nonetheless, in his return, he claimed that he was entitled to carry over from the loss years and deduct in 1987 the entire amount of his investment interest that exceeded the, \u00a7 163(d)(1) limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tion in each loss year pursuant to the carryover provision of \u00a7 163. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 163(d)(2). Sharp computed his carryover of investment interest to be $223,978, obtained by adding the carryover from 1983 to the excess investment interest in 1984, 1985, and 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">The following chart will be helpful in understanding Sharp\u2019s claim and the computation of his investment interest carryover.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">1983 investment interest paid $42,857 net investment income $87,791 \u00a7 163(d)(1) limitation $97,791 excess investment interest over \u00a7 163(d)(1) limitation $3,609<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> taxable income/(loss) $82,300 IRS\u2019s computed carryover limit $3,609 1984 1985 1986 1987 $897111 $877292 $92,362 $164,392 $16,321 $ 2,075 $0 $539,035 $26,321 $12,075 $10,000 $549,035 $62,790 $75,217 $82,362 $0 $(5,852) $42,954 $(6,894) not relevant $0 $42,954 $0 not relevant</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">The IRS disallowed most of the claimed deduction for carried-over investment interest on the theory that the amount of investment interest a taxpayer was entitled to carry over from a particular loss year was limited by the amount of taxable income for that loss year. The IRS notified Sharp that his claim for refund was disallowed and issued a notice of deficiency, assessing taxes and penalties, which Sharp paid. <em>See supra </em>n. 2. Sharp then filed a complaint seeking a refund in the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">In due course, Sharp filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that, as a matter of law, he was entitled to carry over and deduct in 1987 the investment interest he did not deduct in loss years 1983-86 because of \u00a7 163(d). The government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, urging that the investment interest Sharp was entitled to carry over from a loss year was limited to his taxable income in that year. The government based its position on \u201c\u00a7 163(d) \u2018construed as a whole\u2019; the general \u2018scheme of interest deductibility in general\u2019 revealed in</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">the legislative history of \u00a7 163(d); and the text of \u00a7 172(d)(4).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Sharp, </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-20\">Contrary to the government\u2019s position, the trial court held that according to the plain meaning of the statute, \u201cdisallowed investment interest\u201d for the purpose of the carryover subsection (d)(2) is interest \u201cnot allowable\u201d as a deduction solely by reason of the limitation in subsection (d)(1), irrespective of whether the interest exceeds taxable income for a loss year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court was not persuaded by contrary statements in the legislative history because it concluded that \u00a7 163(d)(2) was not ambiguous and the legislative history was \u201cequivocal\u201d and not a good indication of Congressional intent. The court refused to elevate statements in the legislative history over the plain language of the statute. The court concluded that to permit the carryover of investment interest from a loss year in excess of taxable income for that loss year would be consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 163(d), which is to offset investment income against expenses from the same type of investment activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">We review a decision of the Court of Federal Claims to grant or deny summary judgment <em>de novo. See Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. United States, </em>994 F.2d 824, 826 (Fed.Cir.1993). Under that standard, we evaluate the correctness of the decision as a matter of law and decide <em>de novo </em>whether genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Id. </em>There being no dispute as to any material fact here, our review of the decision below turns on the proper interpretation of \u00a7 163, a question of law for our <em>de novo </em>determination. <em>See id. </em>at 826-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In determining whether or not the Court of Federal Claims erred in concluding that Sharp is entitled to summary judgment, we must decide whether \u00a7 163(d)(2), which authorizes a carryover of certain investment interest, permits a taxpayer to carry over from a loss year and deduct in a future year investment interest that exceeds his taxable income in the loss year. Specifically, we must determine whether the portion of investment interest in excess of taxable income that is not allowable as a current deduction by virtue of \u00a7 163(d)(1) constitutes \u201cdisallowed investment interest\u201d as defined by \u00a7 163(d)(3)(E) and thus may be carried over pursuant to \u00a7 163(d)(2). The government argues that the carryover is subject to an implicit limitation equal to the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for the year in which the deductible expense was incurred. Sharp argues that no such limitation exists. We agree with Sharp.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In interpreting a statute, we first turn to its language. <em>VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., </em>917 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 922, 111 S.Ct. 1315, 113 L.Ed.2d 248 (1991) (citing <em>Mallard v. United States Dist. Court for S. Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 300-01, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 1817, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989)).

Sharp\u2019s investment interest otherwise allowable as a deduction was limited by subsection (d)(1) to $10,000 plus the amount of his net investment income (the excess of his investment income over his investment expenses). Sharp was permitted under the carryover provision, subsection (d)(2), to treat as investment interest paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year the amount of \u201cdisallowed investment interest\u201d for any earlier taxable year. Subsection (d)(3)(E) defines \u201cdisallowed investment interest,\u201d with respect to any taxable year, as \u201cthe amount [of investment interest] not allowable as a deduction <em>solely </em>by reason of the limitation in [\u00a7 163(d)(1) ] (emphasis added).\u201d Thus, in accordance with \u00a7 163(d)(3)(E), disallowed investment interest to be carried over under \u00a7 163(d)(2) included all investment interest that would have been \u201callowable as a deduction\u201d <em>but for </em>the limitation prescribed by \u00a7 163(d)(1). Conversely, items of investment interest that would not have been \u201callowable as a deduction\u201d for reasons other than \u00a7 163(d)(1) may not be carried over.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">The government admits that no other provision of the Code specifically prohibits the allowability as a deduction of investment interest exceeding taxable income in the loss year. Rather, according to the government\u2019s argument, such a limitation is basic to the tax law. The government asserts that investment interest that exceeded a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income in the loss year was not deducted in that year because \u201cthe annual principle of tax accounting had long dictated that interest expense in excess of taxable income would not confer any tax benefit even though it was, strictly speaking, \u2018deductible.\u2019 ... [T]he amount of tax due would be the same, whether taxable income was zero or whether it was less than zero.\u201d The government\u2019s argument continues, \u201conly the \u2018amount\u2019 of interest that is not <em>deducted solely </em>because of the Section 163(d)(1) limitation can be eligible for carryover to a subsequent taxable period. Since the amount of investment interest that exceeds a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income would not be <em>deducted </em>in that year <em>regardless </em>of Section 163(d), that amount simply does not fit within the description of the carryover amount (emphasis added).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">The government\u2019s reasoning avoids focus on the plain language of the statute itself. Resolution of the meaning of \u00a7 163(d)(2) turns on the words \u201camounts not allowable as a deduction solely by reason of the limitation in [\u00a7 163(d)(1)].\u201d The narrow question therefore is: but for \u00a7 163(d)(1), would investment interest in excess of taxable income be \u201callowable as a deduction\u201d? Since the only other \u201climitation\u201d relied upon by the government is the conclusion that items exceeding a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income <em>would not in fact be deducted </em>so as to produce a tax benefit, we must determine whether items exceeding a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income, and thus not actually deducted, are nonetheless \u201callowable as a deduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">The government does not seriously contest the meaning of the phrase \u201callowable as a deduction,\u201d and in oral argument before this court, conceded that \u201cif you focus solely on this word \u2018allowable\u2019 and do not look at the legislative history, I think we lose.\u201d We must focus on the word \u201callowable\u201d because it is the language of the statute; it is disposi-tive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">In common usage, the word \u201callowable\u201d means \u201cpermissible: not forbidden: not unlawful or improper.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986). Thus, a deduction is \u201callowable\u201d under the Code if some provision of the Code permits it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>taken as a deduction and no other provision of the Code acts to limit or forbid it as a deduction. <em>See Perrin v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 314, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979) (\u201cA fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d). An item may be an allowable deduction even though it provides no current tax benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Not only is such a construction consistent with the common meaning of the word, it is consistent with the usage of the word in the context of the IRC. In an opinion from the IRS General Counsel\u2019s office, the IRS acknowledged that all otherwise allowable deductions are \u201callowable\u201d as deductions and may be deducted even when they \u201cexceed adjusted gross income and, thereby provide no regular income tax benefit to the taxpayer.\u201d Gen.Coun.Mem. 37,879 (Mar. 13, 1979). Moreover, in a published ruling by the IRS during the administrative review of another taxpayer\u2019s case concerning the carryover provision at issue here, an illustrative example involving taxpayer \u201cA\u201d explained that \u201cA\u2019s <em>allowable </em>deductions ... in 1984 exceeded A\u2019s adjusted gross income for that year ... and resulted in no taxable income.\u201d Rev. Rui. 86-70 1986-1 C.B. 83 (emphasis added); <em>see also Virginian Hotel v. Helvering, </em>319 U.S. 523, 63 S.Ct. 1260, 87 L.Ed. 1561 (1943) (\u201cdepreciation basis is reduced by the amount \u2018allowable\u2019 each year whether or not it is claimed\u201d); 3 <em>Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 21.93, at 152 (1990) (in the context of depreciation, adjustment of basis is the amount of the deduction \u201c \u2018allowable\u2019 ... without regard to whether or not the deduction is actually taken, or if taken, to whether or not the deduction reduced income or diminished the tax burden [or whether or not] there was in past years no income against which the deduction for depreciation might have been charged\u201d). Thus, \u201callowable\u201d deductions are those deductions permitted and not otherwise forbidden or limited by the IRC, whether or not they are actually used and regardless of their lack of tax benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">No other provision of the Code specifically bars the deduction of investment interest in excess of taxable income. <em>Cf. </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 163(g) (explicitly cross-referencing specific sections of the Code that may disallow various deductions independently of subsection (d)(1)). Thus, investment interest is \u201callowable\u201d as a deduction without regard to taxable income. Because \u00a7 163(d)(1) was the only provision of the Code that prevented Sharp from taking a full current deduction for the investment interest he paid or accrued in the loss years 1984, 1985, and 1986, that full deduction was allowable but for \u00a7 163(d)(1). Since \u00a7 163(d)(2) permits the carryover of all investment interest that would be \u201callowable as a deduction\u201d in the absence of \u00a7 163(d)(1), Sharp\u2019s deduction may be carried over.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In further support of its position, the government explains that prior to 1969, the enactment date of the carryover provision, taxpayers could deduct investment interest expense against all taxable income, but any expense above the amount of taxable income did not confer a tax benefit and could not be deducted in a later year. Thus, the government argues, allowing taxpayers to carry over interest expense in excess of taxable income would be an expansion of interest deductibility not intended by Congress. We find this reasoning unsupported and unpersuasive against the force of the plain legislative text. While, as the government points out, it is a basic principle of tax accounting that \u201cthe tax benefit of any deductible amount that exceed[s] a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for a particular year [is] lost forever, barring some savings provision,\u201d \u00a7 163(d)(2) is such a savings provision. While the government complains that such a view \u201cabrogates\u201d this basic tax principle, that is exactly the purpose of a carryover provision \u2014 to permit an item of expense incurred in one year, but otherwise \u201clost,\u201d to be carried over to a subsequent year and confer a future tax benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">We also agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a carryover of investment interest that is unlimited by taxable income in the loss year is not inconsistent with Congress\u2019s objective in enacting the limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>investment interest deductions. Congress intended to prevent the use of investment interest deductions to shelter other income from taxation. When an investment \u201cproduces little current income, the effect of allowing a current deduction for investment interest is to produce a mismatching of the investment income and related expenses of earning that income.\u201d H.R. No. 413, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 72 (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>1986-3 C.B. 200, 245. \u201c[T]he excess interest, in effect, is used by the taxpayer to offset other income, such as his salary, from taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Fourth Circuit aptly reasoned when it decided the same question at issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">Tying the interest deductions to investment income prevents taxpayers from using the investment interest expense deduction as a tax shelter for non-investment income and encourages them to invest only in projects that will yield a profit aside from the tax benefits____ By contrast, the limitation urged by the Commissioner, based on earned income, arbitrarily prevents taxpayers with little earned income from reaping the benefit of the deduction for ventures profitable in the long run, but with a low initial payoff. While individuals may ultimately claim more deductions than would have been available prior to the enactment of the investment income limitation and carry-over provisions, they will only be able to do so if their investments generate sufficient income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-8\"><em>Beyer v. Commissioner, </em>916 F.2d 153, 155-56 (4th Cir.1990). We agree with Sharp that a limitation of his carryover to the loss year\u2019s taxable income would in fact frustrate the principle of matching by denying taxpayers the opportunity to match current interest expenses with their later-realized revenues and would discourage investments geared to the long term in favor of those which produce immediate returns, a result Congress has not endorsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The government also asserts that the \u201cnet operating loss\u201d provision of the Code, \u00a7 172, lends support to its position because \u00a7 172 limits a nonbusiness net operating loss deduction to the amount of gross income not derived from a trade or business. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 172(d)(4). Although the government agrees that \u00a7 172 is not directly at issue here, <em>see supra </em>n. 5, it urges that the net operating loss provision \u201cmirrors\u201d what should be the same result under \u00a7 163(d). Instead of lending support to the government\u2019s position, we conclude that the fact that Congress has provided an express limitation in \u00a7 172 but not in \u00a7 163 indicates that Congress was consciously discriminating in limiting carryovers. \u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another ..., it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d <em>Russello v. United States, </em>464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Finally, the government cites the legislative history of \u00a7 163(d) to suggest that Congress intended the carryover to be limited to only those unused interest deductions that did not exceed taxable income in the loss year. We need not resort to the legislative history, however, because the language of \u00a7 163(d) is clear and conclusive. \u201cWhile legislative history may aid our understanding of the function and purposes of [a] statute, and in cases of doubt assist in interpretation of the language, when the legislature has clearly spoken the law, the court\u2019s duty is to enforce it as written.\u201d <em>Telectronics Pacing Sys. Inc. v. Ventritex, Inc., </em>982 F.2d 1520, 1524 (Fed.Cir.1992) (citation omitted); <em>see also Burlington N.R.R. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>481 U.S. 454, 461, 107 S.Ct. 1855, 1860, 95 L.Ed.2d 404 (1987) (\u201cUnless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise, when the terms of a statute are unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete.\u201d). This case does not present exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision granting Sharp\u2019s motion and denying the United States\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-12\">.

With his 1987 tax return, Sharp paid taxes in the amount of $63,329. In 1989, Sharp filed an amended return for 1987, based on a change in his method of accounting for that year, requesting a refund of taxes paid plus interest. In 1991, the IRS disallowed Sharp\u2019s claim for refund and assessed unpaid taxes and penalties due of $34,-028, which Sharp paid. Here, Sharp demands the total tax and interest paid for 1987 ($97,357, consisting of the $63,329 paid with the 1987 retum plus the $34,028 of taxes and penalties assessed by the IRS and paid in 1991) less what Sharp claims actually was due for 1987 ($37,-621) = $59,736.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b893-21\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal Revenue Code in effect during the years 1983-86. Section 163(d) was originally passed in 1969 and amended in 1976 and 1986. The changes enacted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 took effect for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 1986. The version of \u00a7 163(d) applicable to Sharp for the tax years at issue is that in effect after the 1976 amendment and before the 1986 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b894-16\">. Although the amount of investment interest that Sharp paid in 1983 did not exceed his \u00a7 163(d)(1) limitation, he was entitled in 1983 to a carryover from 1982 of $58,543. The total of his 1983 investment interest and his carryover, $101,400, exceeded his \u00a7 163(d)(1) limitation for 1983 by $3,609.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b894-17\">. The government contended that the \u201cnet operating loss\" provision of the Code, \u00a7 172, forbids the carryover of non-business interest under \u00a7 163. The court disagreed, concluding that \u00a7 172 deals with entirely different categories of deductions, based upon entirely different theories. Before this court, the government does not argue that \u00a7 172 is directly applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b894-22\">. At least three other courts have permitted carryovers in excess of taxable income for a loss year. <em>See Beyer </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>916 F.2d 153 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Lenz v.
