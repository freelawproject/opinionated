In support of this position, he cites Gov. Bar R. V(10)(e) which allows a mental illness suspension to be terminated by showing the removal of mental illness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find this rule, however, to be inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">In <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Roest </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 95 [8 O.O.3d 90], this court held that the mental illness provisions of Gov. Bar R. V(10) \u201c* * * obtain only in controversies wherein a respondent proves he is mentally ill <em>at the time of his disciplinary action. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, while the board may properly consider respondent\u2019s mental illness at the time of the alleged misconduct as a mitigating factor in determining what sanction should be imposed, the mental illness provisions of Gov. Bar R. V(10) are not intended to be used by a respondent in a disciplinary action to avoid suspension on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Accordingly, we concur with the board\u2019s recommendation that respondent\u2019s violations of the disciplinary rules merit a one-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and J. P. Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-13\"> Gov. Bar R. V(10)(e) reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">\u201cAny suspension under this section may be terminated on Respondent\u2019s application to the Board and a showing of removal of the cause for the suspension, which is certified by the Board to, and affirmed by, the Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
