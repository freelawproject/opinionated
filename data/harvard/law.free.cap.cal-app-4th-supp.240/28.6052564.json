Defendant contends the judgment should be reversed because the trial court improperly deprived him of defenses based on the breach of the rental agreement not being material. He also contends reversal is warranted because the court did not allow him to defend the case based on plaintiff\u2019s waiver. As discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 31\">*Supp. 31</page-number>Regarding defendant\u2019s compliance with the terms of the parties\u2019 rental agreement, the agreement provided that \u201cany failure of compliance or performance by Renter shall allow Owner to forfeit this agreement and terminate Renter\u2019s right to possession.\u201d It was undisputed defendant breached the agreement by failing to timely obtain renter\u2019s insurance after being given notice and an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">In the published portion of the opinion we hold that, because defendant did not contend the agreement constituted a contract of adhesion or that its enforcement was unconscionable, the trial court correctly determined the materiality of the breach was irrelevant. Under the facts of the present case, reversal is not warranted based on the court determining defendant\u2019s substantial compliance with the agreement, plaintiff\u2019s purported retaliatory motive, and its alleged lack of good faith and fair dealing, were inappropriate defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we hold defendant failed to establish reversal is warranted due to the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to defend the action based on plaintiff\u2019s waiver. Defendant\u2019s motion to amend to assert the defense was noncompliant with the California Rules of Court, and he did not adequately develop an argument on appeal regarding how plaintiff waived the rental agreement\u2019s anti-waiver clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-7\">II. <em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">On February 26, 2014, plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer action based on defendant\u2019s failure to perform covenants in the rental agreement, as described in an attached three-day notice. The notice listed three covenants that were violated, but plaintiff elected to proceed at trial on only one: defendant\u2019s failure to obtain and pay for renter\u2019s insurance, as required by paragraph 11 of the rental agreement. The notice informed defendant that if he failed to comply with the rental agreement within the three-day period, plaintiff would declare forfeiture of the agreement. The complaint alleged the notice period expired, and defendant did not comply and remained in possession of the property. Defendant filed an answer, generally denying the allegations in the complaint and asserting numerous affirmative defenses. The case was subsequently set for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">Prior to trial, defendant and plaintiff each filed in limine motions and trial briefs, and plaintiff filed objections to defendant\u2019s special verdict questions. The trial court considered the motions, briefs, and plaintiff\u2019s objections on April 11, 2014, and allowed the parties to restate their arguments at a hearing on April 15, 2014, which was transcribed and subsequently reported. At the April 15, 2014 hearing, the main issue concerned whether defendant substantially complied with the three-day notice by obtaining insurance one week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 32\">*Supp. 32</page-number>after being given notice, and if, in any event, failure to obtain insurance was a material breach of the rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Plaintiff argued, consistent with its written in limine motions and trial brief, that defendant should not be allowed to present evidence, have the jury instructed, or ask the jury to render special verdicts based on substantial compliance or the materiality of the breach. Plaintiff relied on paragraph 11 of the rental agreement, which provided, \u201cInsurance: Owner does not insure Renter for any personal injury or property damage including, but not limited to, that caused by the act or omission of any other renter or third party, or by any criminal act or activity, war, riot, insurrection, fire or act of God. Renter shall obtain and pay for any insurance coverage necessary to protect Renter or Renter\u2019s property from any loss or expense that may be caused by such persons or events.\u201d Plaintiff also relied on one of the opening clauses of the rental agreement, which provided, in relevant part, \u201cOwner and Renter agree that Renter\u2019s performance of and compliance with each of the terms thereof, . . . constitute a condition on Renter\u2019s right to occupy the Premises and any failure of compliance or performance by Renter shall allow Owner to forfeit this agreement and terminate Renter\u2019s right to possession.\u201d Plaintiff argued that since, pursuant to this forfeiture clause, \u201cany failure of compliance or performance\u201d by defendant constituted grounds for eviction, the materiality of the breach or defendant\u2019s substantial performance with the agreement was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Defendant, in turn, consistent with his written in limine motion and trial brief, argued plaintiff should not be allowed to argue to the jury or present evidence concerning the forfeiture clause. Defendant argued that this clause did not override other provisions of law which require a breach to be material in order to warrant rescission of a contract. Defendant also argued he substantially complied with the rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">The trial court determined the forfeiture clause rendered all breaches of the agreement to be material. Therefore, evidence regarding whether the breach of paragraph 11 constituted a substantial breach of an important obligation under the agreement was irrelevant, and jury instructions and verdict forms which related to the materiality of the breach would not be allowed. The court further ruled, as a consequence of its determination on the impact of the forfeiture clause, that other evidence, such as that related to the affirmative defenses of substantial compliance, retaliation, and. good faith and fair dealing, was irrelevant, and that instructions and verdict forms based on the other evidence would also not be permitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 33\">*Supp. 33</page-number>Following the court\u2019s ruling, the parties waived their right to a jury trial and stipulated to the facts of the case, and the court rendered judgment at a court trial based on the stipulated facts. The parties stipulated they entered into the rental agreement in 1999 and defendant had occupied an apartment on the property ever since. The property was subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles (LARSO) (L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 151.00 et seq.). The three-day notice was served on defendant on February 14, 2014, and defendant failed to comply with the notice\u2019s requirement that he obtain and pay for renter\u2019s insurance by its expiration on February 18, 2014. Based on the stipulated facts, the court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Because the issues in this case pertain to statutory construction, undisputed facts, and interpretation of the parties\u2019 rental agreement, we exercise de novo review. (See <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>Western Digital Corp. </em>(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1543-1544 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 897] [statutory construction is reviewed de novo]; <em>Cohn v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 523, 527 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 401] [\u201cWhen an appeal presents a pure question of law, the appellate court exercises its independent judgment, giving no deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d]; <em>Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center </em>v. <em>Bonta' </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 237, 245 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 9] [contractual interpretation is subject to de novo review when the issue does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">We address each of defendant\u2019s contentions separately in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">A. <em>Materiality of Breach</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">Defendant contends the judgment should be reversed because he should have been allowed to present evidence that his breach of paragraph 11 of the agreement was not material. He further contends that, had the case proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 34\">*Supp. 34</page-number>to jury trial, jury instructions and special verdict forms pertaining to materiality and substantial compliance should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The unlawful detainer action in the present case was based on Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision 3., due to defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to perform . . . conditions or covenants of the lease or agreement under which the property is held . . . .\u201d Even though not specifically provided by this section, case law requires that a breach be material in order to justify an unlawful detainer action. (See <em>NIVO 1 LLC </em>v. <em>Antunez </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 5 [159 Cal.Rptr.3d 922] [collecting cases].) Thus, \u201c[w]hether a particular breach will give a plaintiff landlord the right to declare a forfeiture is based on whether the breach is material. \u2018The law sensibly recognizes that although every instance of noncompliance with a contract\u2019s terms constitutes a breach, not every breach justifies treating the contract as terminated. [Citations.] Following the lead of the Restatements of Contracts, California courts allow termination only if the breach can be classified as \u201cmaterial,\u201d \u201csubstantial,\u201d or \u201ctotal.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">Nonetheless, \u201cit is a general rule a party is bound by contract provisions\u201d <em>(Williams v. California Physicians\u2019 Service </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 722, 739 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 497]), and \u201c[i]f contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs . . . [citation]\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]). Even a contract of adhesion, \u201c \u2018a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it . . .\u2019 [citation]\u201d <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Scissor-Tail, Inc. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 807, 817 [171 Cal.Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165]), \u201cis fully enforceable according to its terms [citations] unless certain other factors are present which, under established legal rules \u2014 legislative or judicial \u2014 operate to render it otherwise\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 819-820, fns. omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">In the present case, paragraph 11 of the parties\u2019 agreement required that defendant obtain renter\u2019s insurance. If there had been no other provision regarding the materiality of breaches in the agreement, the question of whether the breach was material would have been one for the trier of fact to decide. (See <em>NIVO 1 LLC </em>v. <em>Antunez, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. Supp. 4.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 35\">*Supp. 35</page-number>But, the relevant part of the forfeiture clause in the parties\u2019 agreement provided, \u201cOwner and Renter agree that Renter\u2019s performance of and compliance with each of the terms thereof, . . . constitute a condition on Renter\u2019s right to occupy the Premises and <em>any failure </em>of compliance or performance by Renter shall allow Owner to forfeit this agreement and terminate Renter\u2019s right to possession.\u201d (Italics added.) The clear and unambiguous terms of this clause permitted forfeiture of the agreement and termination of defendant\u2019s right to possession based on any breach, regardless of the breach\u2019s importance in relation to the entire agreement. Pursuant to the clause, evidence concerning the breach\u2019s materiality was irrelevant; hence there was no need for a jury to be instructed on the issue, or have it render special verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Cases cited by defendant for the proposition that a breach\u2019s materiality may be used to defend against an eviction are not on point because none discuss the applicability of a forfeiture clause. (See, e.g., <em>Superior Motels, Inc. v. Rinn Motor Hotels, Inc. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1032, 1051 [241 Cal.Rptr. 487].) We are also not persuaded <em>Foundation Dev. Corp. v. Loehmann\u2019s </em>(1990) 163 Ariz. 438 [788 P.2d 1189] <em>(Loehmann\u2019s) </em>warrants reversing the judgment in favor of plaintiff. <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>considered portions of a lease which required that a tenant pay a common area charge within a specified amount of time or be subject to eviction. The court held that, notwithstanding the lease\u2019s forfeiture clause, which provided any breach would justify eviction, \u201ca material provision of a lease may be breached in such a trivial manner that to enforce a forfeiture would be unconscionable and inequitable. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>788 P.2d at p. 1197.) We are not bound by <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>(see <em>Amerigraphics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1538, 1553 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 307]), but, more importantly, as previously discussed, defendant has not contended, and we do not consider, whether the forfeiture clause, or its enforcement, in the case <em>sub judice </em>was unconscionable. Further, <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>stated \u201can overwhelming majority of courts has concluded, without reference to a specific statutory provision, that a lease may not be forfeited for a trivial or technical breach even where the parties have specifically agreed that \u2018any breach\u2019 gives rise to the right of termination.\u201d <em>(Loehmann\u2019s, supra, </em>788 P.2d at p. 1196.) But, none of the cases cited analyzed the enforceability of a clearly worded forfeiture clause in a residential lease, as in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Defendant further contends the forfeiture clause was invalid because it violated public policy. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1667 [\u201cThat is not lawful which is: [\u00b6] 1. Contrary to an express provision of law; [\u00b6] 2. Contrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited; or, [\u00b6] 3. Otherwise contrary to good morals.\u201d].) Defendant argues the forfeiture clause violates public policy because it would allow evictions based on breaches regardless of their severity, meaning tenants could be evicted for violating covenants such as annoying other tenants (see rental agreement, par. 12 [\u201cRenter shall not. . . in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 36\">*Supp. 36</page-number>any way annoy any other renter.\u201d]). Defendant claims allowing evictions for annoying conduct such as having a crying newborn or playing \u201cdispleasing music\u201d would violate public policy, rendering the forfeiture clause invalid. The clause is not invalid as against public policy. The present case did not involve a breach of the character or magnitude as those propounded by defendant. In evictions based on three-day notices to perform or quit, as in the present case, breaches would only constitute valid grounds for eviction if they were not cured within the notice period, meaning tenants could not be evicted based on single incidents of annoying their neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Defendant further points out that LARSO only permits evictions based on breaches of <em>lawful </em>obligations or covenants of a tenancy, and argues that permitting evictions based on <em>any </em>breaches under the forfeiture clause would undermine LARSO. However, the breach at issue in the present case was for failure to obtain renter\u2019s insurance, and defendant does not maintain such a breach cannot constitute a lawful obligation of tenancy. (See L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 151.09A.2 [a valid basis for eviction under LARSO includes when \u201c[t]he tenant has violated a lawful obligation or covenant of the tenancy and h\u00e1s failed to cure the violation after having received written notice from the landlord . . .\u201d].) Further, because the eviction here did not concern an incurable breach (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1161, subd. 4.), and defendant was given three days to comply with the covenant, the purpose of LARSO that an eviction be based on an enumerated ground was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">B. <em>Elimination of Defenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">1. <em>Substantial compliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">Defendant argued in the trial court that he substantially complied with paragraph ll\u2019s requirement he obtain and pay for renter\u2019s insurance by obtaining the insurance seven days after he was served with the three-day notice. The trial court excluded evidence and a verdict form on the defense of substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Substantial compliance has been approved as a defense to a notice to quit based on an incurable breach of a rental agreement. (See <em>Roth v. Morton\u2019s Chefs Services, Inc. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 380, 385, 387 [218 Cal.Rptr. 684].) But the eviction in this case was based on a three-day notice to perform or quit under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision 3. (5) Given the statutory basis of unlawful detainer law, parties must comply with the statutes, including the time periods specified therein, with exactitude. (See <em>Kwok v. Bergren </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 596, 599-600 [181 Cal.Rptr. 795].) Defendant has cited no authority which would excuse his failure to comply with the statute\u2019s three-day notice provision by performing within seven days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 37\">*Supp. 37</page-number>2. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Defendant maintained in the trial court that he should be allowed to present the defense of retaliatory eviction. The court refused to instruct the jury on retaliatory eviction and ruled that a corresponding verdict form would not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Retaliatory eviction is a defense based on state statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> LARSO,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the common law. (See <em>Barela v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 244, 249-250 [178 Cal.Rptr. 618, 636 P.2d 582].) \u201c \u2018It is settled that a landlord may be precluded from evicting a tenant in retaliation for certain kinds of lawful activities of the tenant. As a landlord has no right to possession when he seeks it for such an invalid reason, a tenant may raise the defense of retaliatory eviction in an unlawful detainer proceeding. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] The retaliatory eviction doctrine is founded on the premise that \u2018[a] landlord may normally evict a tenant for any reason or for no reason at all, but he may not evict for an improper reason . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 249; see L.A. Mun. Code, \u00a7 151.09B.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">We do not decide whether the forfeiture clause rendered the retaliatory eviction defense inapplicable. Even assuming the court erred in determining retaliatory eviction was not a valid defense, reversal is unwarranted due to defendant\u2019s failure to establish he was prejudiced by the error. \u201c \u2018Prejudice is not presumed, and the burden is on the appealing party to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.\u2019 [Citation.] To establish prejudice, an appellant must show a reasonable probability exists that, in the absence of the error, he or she would have obtained a more favorable result. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People ex rel. City of Santa Monica v. Gabriel </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 882, 887 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">Defendant had the burden to prove the retaliation defense at trial, and thus had the burden of producing evidence of retaliation. (See Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant (The Rutter Group 2015) \u00b6 7:367, p. 7-177.) The record on appeal does not indicate what evidence defendant was going to use to support his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 38\">*Supp. 38</page-number>Defendant asserted the defense of retaliatory eviction by checking off boxes in his form answer. Defendant indicated the notice to perform or quit and the unlawful detainer action were \u201cfiled to retaliate against the tenant for having done the following: [\u00b6] Complaining to the landlord or landlord\u2019s agent concerning tenantability. . . . [\u00b6] Otherwise asserting tenant\u2019s legal rights.\u201d But defendant did not otherwise indicate what evidence supported the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Plaintiff moved in one of its in limine motions to bar the use of defendant\u2019s special verdict regarding retaliation. Although the proposed special verdict itself is not part of the record, plaintiff in its motion quoted the proposed verdict: \u201cIn seeking to evict [defendant] is [plaintiff\u2019s] dominant intent retaliation against [defendant] for exercising his rights as a tenant?\u201d This question appeared to be based on LARSO\u2019s retaliatory eviction defense, which required proof of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdominant intent,\u201d but the motion failed to indicate what evidence supported the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Further, in none of the arguments at the hearing on the in limine motions did defendant make an offer of proof regarding what evidence supported the defense. Moreover, the court, in refusing to provide the proposed special verdict concerning the defense, and in refusing to give the pattern jury instruction on the defense (CACI No. 4321), also did not indicate what evidence supported the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Because the record does not show what evidence supported the defense of retaliatory eviction, we cannot find there was a reasonable probability that, had the defense been presented, defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">3. <em>Good faith and fair dealing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Defendant requested the court provide the jury with an instruction titled \u201cAffirmative Defense, Equitable Considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court refused to give the instruction, and defendant on appeal contends the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on plaintiff\u2019s \u201cduty to act in good faith by not seeking to entrap [defendant] into a technical breach of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cEvery contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Acree v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 385, 393 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 99].) However, as pointed out by plaintiff, a leading treatise on landlord-tenant law states \u201cno reported case to date recognizes the covenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 39\">*Supp. 39</page-number>of good faith and fair dealing as an independent affirmative defense to an unlawful detainer. [Citation.]\u201d (Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 8:384, p. 8-139.) Defendant cites two cases in support of his contention that a defense of good faith and fair dealing applied in this case. <em>Sunstone Behavioral Health, Inc. v. Alameda County Medical Center </em>(E.D.Cal., June 19, 2008, No. S-06-2664 FCD DAD) 2008 U.S.Dist.

Union Oil Co. </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 78 [198 P.2d 347] found a tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent within a three-day notice period was excused because the landlord acted in bad faith in avoiding the tenant\u2019s attempts to pay within the period. The present case does not involve plaintiff making it more difficult for defendant to obtain and pay for insurance within the three-day notice period. Defendant has not shown the court erred in refusing to give an instruction on good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">C. <em>Waiver</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">IV. <em>DISPOSITION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">The judgment is affirmed.

San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 956 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 78]), we reject defendant\u2019s contention we should reverse because the trial court improperly consulted unpublished appellate opinions in deciding how to rule on the legal issues presented. We also reject defendant\u2019s contention reversal is warranted because the court improperly used in limine rulings, rather than statutory motions such as for judgment on the pleadings, to exclude evidence and eliminate instructions and special verdicts. The court correctly exercised its statutory and inherent powers to manage the case by deciding evidentiary and legal issues in advance of trial through the in limine motions. (See Code Civ.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApU\">Dissenting. \u2014 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">The trial court erred by ruling that, solely because the lease allowed for forfeiture based on \u201cany\u201d breach, it was unnecessary for the landlord to prove the breach was material in order to prevail on his unlawful detainer action. The court\u2019s error was prejudicial because, if a trier of fact had applied the law defining a \u201cmaterial breach\u201d to the undisputed facts of the case, it is reasonably probable, and indeed quite likely, a trier of fact would have determined the breach was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">The law governing contractual breaches is settled. \u201c[Although every instance of noncompliance with a contract\u2019s terms constitutes a breach, not every breach justifies treating the contract as terminated. [Citations.] Following the lead of the Restatements of Contracts, California courts allow termination only if the breach can be classified as \u2018material,\u2019 \u2018substantial,\u2019 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 40\">*Supp. 40</page-number>\u2018total.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Superior Motels, Inc. v.

Horton &amp; Converse </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 411, 433 [132 P.2d 457] [a breach of a contractual right in a trivial or inappreciable respect will not justify rescission of the agreement by the party entitled to the benefit in question]; <em>Strom v.

In determining the trial court\u2019s ruling was proper, the majority holds it is appropriate to circumvent the requirement that contractual forfeiture must be triggered by a <em>material </em>breach where, as in this case, a lease specifies that the failure to comply with a term will allow the landlord to forfeit the agreement and terminate the tenant\u2019s right to possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The rule created by the majority is contrary to decades of jurisprudence requiring a breach to be material in order to justify contractual forfeiture. Neither the majority nor the landlord cite any published authority in California or any other state standing for the proposition that a lease is properly subject to forfeiture upon an immaterial breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">In fact, a plethora of published authority has held to the contrary. In deciding forfeiture for a trivial breach of a lease should not be enforced, the Arizona Supreme Court recognized as much:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2\u201c[A]n overwhelming majority of courts<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> has concluded, without reference to a specific statutory provision, that a lease may not be forfeited for a trivial or technical breach even where the parties have specifically agreed that \u2018any breach\u2019 gives rise to the right of termination. [Citation.] These courts note the sophistication and complexity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 41\">*Supp. 41</page-number>of most business interactions and are concerned, therefore, that the possibilities for breach of a modem commercial lease are virtually limitless. In their view, the parties to the lease did not intend that every minor or technical failure to adhere to complicated lease provisions could cause forfeiture. Accordingly, nearly all courts hold that, regardless of the language of the lease, to justify forfeiture, the breach must be \u2018material,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Loehmann\u2019s, supra, </em>788 P.2d at p. 1196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">The majority seem to distinguish <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>on the ground that the tenant in <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>argued the breached term of the contract was unconscionable. The majority is mistaken as unconscionability was not the dispute in <em>Loehmann\u2019s. </em>The Arizona Supreme Court characterized the issue before it as follows: \u201cThe trial court ruled that Loehmann\u2019s delay in paying a common area charge was a trivial breach of its lease and therefore refused to permit the landlord, Foundation Development Corporation (Foundation), to re-enter and take possession of the leased premises. The court of appeals reversed. We granted review to clarify the law dealing with triviality of breach as a defense to a forfeiture of a tenant\u2019s interest in a commercial lease. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Loehmann\u2019s, supra, </em>788 P.2d at p. 1190.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">In pertinent part, the Arizona Supreme Court summed up its holding as follows: \u201c[W]e decline to hold that any breach, no matter how trivial or insignificant, can justify a forfeiture. Nor do we believe such a rule could long survive. Trivial or not, the delay in paying the rent here was at most three days. What if the breach had been three hours instead of three days or the check had been lost in the mail and came at three minutes after midnight? The questions almost answer themselves. Therefore, we now join the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that hold the landlord\u2019s right to terminate is not unlimited. We believe a court\u2019s decision to permit termination must be tempered by notions of equity and common sense. We thus hold a forfeiture for a trivial or immaterial breach of a commercial lease should not be enforced.\u201d <em>(Loehmann\u2019s, supra, </em>788 P.2d at pp. 1196-1197, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">It is true that, in identifying the \u201c[standard for [e]valuating the [triviality of a [b]reach,\u201d <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>stated, \u201cwe believe a material provision of a lease may be breached in such a trivial manner that to enforce a forfeiture would be unconscionable and inequitable. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Loehmann\u2019s, supra, </em>788 P.2d at p. 1197.) But, the Arizona Supreme Court was not suggesting unconscionability was a defense asserted by Loehmann\u2019s. Rather, it was simply pointing out that forfeiture, based on trivial breaches, may be unconscionable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 42\">*Supp. 42</page-number>unreasonable. <em>Loehmann\u2019s </em>contains no discussion concerning the defense of unconscionability as such a defense was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">By ruling all breaches, regardless of materiality, warranted forfeiture of the lease, the trial court improperly removed the issue from the trial. The question then becomes whether the court\u2019s error was prejudicial. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13 [judgment cannot be reversed unless trial court error resulted in a miscarriage of justice]; <em>Pool v. City of Oakland </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1051, 1069 [232 Cal.Rptr. 528, 728 P.2d 1163] [prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error].) Given the undisputed facts, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">\u201cCardozo had occasion to examine the distinction between material and inconsequential breaches in his landmark decision regarding substantial performance of a construction contract. \u2018The courts never say that one who makes a contract fills the measure of his duty by less than full performance. They do say, however, that an omission, both trivial and innocent, will sometimes be atoned for by allowance of the resulting damage, and will not always be the breach of a condition to be followed by a forfeiture.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Where the line is to be drawn between the important and the trivial cannot be settled by a formula. . . . The question is one of degree, . . . We must weigh the purpose to be served, the desire to be gratified, the excuse for deviation from the letter, the cruelty of enforced adherence. . . . [The] law will be slow to impute the purpose, in the silence of the parties, where the significance of the default is grievously out of proportion to the oppression of the forfeiture.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Superior Motels, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1051, quoting <em>Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent </em>(1921) 230 N.Y. 239, 241, 243-244 [129 N.E. 889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Fifteen years after the lease was signed, the landlord demanded the tenant obtain renter\u2019s insurance. But, although said insurance was a term of the lease, the absence of it did not impact the landlord\u2019s profit margin or, in any way, increase the landlord\u2019s exposure to liability. Indeed, the purpose of the insurance was to protect the tenant, not the landlord.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">The landlord served the three-day notice by posting it on February 14, 2014 \u2014 a Friday. Given the following two days constituted a weekend, it is reasonable to conclude the options of open and available rental insurance companies were limited. In any event, the tenant\u2019s compliance was a mere four days after the three-day notice expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 43\">*Supp. 43</page-number>The tenant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s error because, based on the record, this was not a close case when it came to triviality. Setting aside what could have been the unseemly motives of the landlord, if any breach of a lease is immaterial, it appears to be the breach in this case. I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\"> \u201cDecisions of the courts of other states are regarded as persuasive in varying degrees, depending on the point involved.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal.
