Paden appeals, asserting that the district court erred in finding that the Government did not breach the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2004), and to withdraw the notice provided pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Paden claims on appeal that the Government refused to honor its obligations under the plea agreement because the Government believed that he breached the plea agreement by lying to law enforcement officers during a murder investigation and by failing a polygraph test. Even if a breach occurred, Paden asserts that it was not material. This court reviews for clear error a district court\u2019s decision not to compel the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073,1076 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Paden\u2019s plea agreement clearly stated that the decision whether to move for a departure based on substantial assistance lay within the sole discretion of the Government. The plea agreement also provided that, if Paden failed a polygraph examination, then the Government\u2019s obligation to move for a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 would be null and void. Because Paden violated the terms of his plea agreement by failing to pass a polygraph test to the Government\u2019s satisfaction, the district court concluded that Paden breached the terms of the plea agreement. Accordingly, the district court refused to compel the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. We find that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to compel the Government to move for a downward departure and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
