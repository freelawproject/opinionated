We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">1. There is legally sufficient evidence in the record of a causal connection between Zamora\u2019s decision to take leave under the Act and the County\u2019s decision to terminate Zamora\u2019s employment. There is also sufficient evidence that the County\u2019s given reason for terminating Zamora was pretextual. Faced with the inconsistencies in Ms. Cedillo\u2019s testimony and the conflicting and contrary testimony of advisory board members Casarez and Quintanilla, the jury was free to disbelieve the County\u2019s proffered explanation, and in the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>sence of that explanation to conclude that the only basis for Zamora\u2019s termination was the exercise of her rights under the Act. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2109, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (\u201ca plaintiffs prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">2. Fairly read, Zamora\u2019s First Amended Complaint included a claim of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">3. The jury\u2019s finding that the County did not act in good faith is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Nero v. Indus. Molding Corp., </em>167 F.3d 921, 928-29 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
