The only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in applying an eight-level offense level enhancement at sentencing based on its finding that Williams held a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 201.1(b)(2)(B) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s decision, and the parties\u2019 briefs. We conclude that Williams, the director of a halfway house, was an official holding a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, and thus the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. <em>See United States v. ReBrook, 58 </em>F.3d 961, 970 (4th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Reneslacis, </em>349 F.3d 412, 416 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Snell, </em>152 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
