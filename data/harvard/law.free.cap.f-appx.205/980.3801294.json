The district court properly required exhaustion of administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). Because Gereau-Bey did not demonstrate to the district court that he exhausted his administrative remedies or that such remedies were not available, the court\u2019s dismissal of the action was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order, which is modified to reflect that the dismissal was without prejudice to Gereau-Bey\u2019s right to refile once he has exhausted his administrative remedies. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
