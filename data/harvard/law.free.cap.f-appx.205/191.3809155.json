Because Traylor\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the legality of his sentence, Traylor had to show that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provided him with an inadequate or ineffective remedy. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he savings clause of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which established that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">Traylor argues that his sentence for his drug-conspiracy conviction is invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Contrary to Traylor\u2019s assertion, <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>305 F.3d 304, 310 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1007, 123 S.Ct. 1919, 155 L.Ed.2d 840 (2003). Even if it were, it does not establish that Traylor was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Accordingly, Traylor fails to qualify for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause provisions. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Traylor\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir.
