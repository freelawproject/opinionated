Singh was ordered removed in absentia when he failed to appear for his removal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Singh argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. Singh argues that the BIA erred in its factual finding that he understood the significance of the Notification Requirement Change of Address form. We have reviewed the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and have determined, in view of the substantial evidence, that Singh knowingly provided his address to the immigration court at the time of his release on bond. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
