Martin Barreneche arrived in the United States in December 2000 on an immigrant visa and remained beyond the expiration period. Luz Barreneehe and Jimena Velez arrived in the United States in March 2001 on immigrant visas and remained beyond the expiration period. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then issued notices to appear, charging petitioners with removability for having remained in the United States longer than permitted. Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). At the hearing, petitioners conceded removability, but requested asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In his asylum application, Hurtado alleged that he had been persecuted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) and that he feared he would be kidnaped and killed if he returned to Colombia because of his membership in the Liberal Party, his participation in political and community activities, and his position working for a public agency ensuring that employees were qualified and that guerillas who had infiltrated the agency were removed. Hurtado argued that as a result of his above activities, he and his father received threatening telephone calls, he decided to move to Bogota for a time and go into hiding, and, after he came to the United States, but before his family joined him, his farm in Colombia was visited by strange people who intimidated the caretaker, tied up the employees, and stole some items.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Although Hurtado was found credible, the IJ determined that there was no evidence to suggest that he was targeted by FARC because of his political opinions or because of his membership in the Liberal Party. The IJ found that the telephone calls Hurtado described were not sufficient to establish persecution on account of his political opinions. Furthermore, the IJ concluded that there was no nexus between the telephone calls and Hurtado\u2019s political opinions. The IJ also found that, although Hurtado had a subjective fear of future persecution, the fear was not objectively reasonable. Having considered that Hurtado experienced no trouble when he relocated to Bogota, the IJ found there was no evidence that the threat was country-wide. Finally, the IJ found that there was no evidence of torture. Accordingly, the IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT, but granted voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Petitioners appealed and the BIA affirmed, concluding that the telephone calls did not rise to the level of persecution and that there was no objectively reasonable fear of future persecution as there was no evidence FARC continued to seek out Hurtado. Petitioners then initiated this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">When the BIA issues a decision, this court reviews only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decisions were based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this court must affirm if the decision \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. The IJ\u2019s factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires this court to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the [IJ\u2019s] decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). This court \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). Thus, \u201ca finding of fact will be reversed only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229,1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">To establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected grounds, the applicant must establish with credible evidence (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>see also Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. If the applicant meets this burden, the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum and this determination \u201cshall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. Frist, Hurtado did not establish past persecution. As this court has explained, \u201c\u2018persecution\u2019 is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). After careful review of the record as a whole, we conclude that the harassment Hurtado suffered at the hands of the FARC does not rise to the level of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Second, Hurtado has not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. If an applicant can demonstrate past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). If the applicant cannot demonstrate past persecution, however, he or she must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). Even given Hurtado\u2019s credible testimony, after careful review of the record as a whole, we conclude that Hurtado has not shown past persecution or an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Finally, because Hurtado failed to satisfy the less stringent standard for asylum, his claim for withholding also fails. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-20\">. In his asylum application, Hurtado also requested relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. He does not appeal the IJ's and BIA\u2019s denials of this relief. Accordingly, he has abandoned the argument. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">.
