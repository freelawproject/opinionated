Kennedy appeals his conviction and sentence, arguing that the district court\u2019s failure to discuss his plea agreement at the Rule 11 hearing requires this court to reverse and set aside his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">Kennedy\u2019s plea agreement provided that should Kennedy cooperate pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement and if his cooperation was deemed by the Government as providing \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,\u201d the Government agreed to move for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">Prior to sentencing, the Government expected Kennedy to testify against his younger sister, who was one of the other individuals in the eighteen-defendant conspiracy in which he was charged and convicted. When Kennedy refused to testify truthfully against his younger sister, the Government informed him that it would not move for a downward departure on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">The district court ultimately sentenced Kennedy to 324 months in prison as to Count I, and sixty months in prison as to Count II, both terms to run concurrently; five years of supervised release as to Count I and two years of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>lease as to Count II, both terms to run concurrently for a total of five years of supervised release; and ordered payment of a $200 statutory assessment fee.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Kennedy\u2019s counsel appealed his conviction and sentence on the ground that the district court failed to comply with Fed. R. CrimP. 11 in accepting Kennedy\u2019s plea. While it is not disputed by Kennedy that the district court generally complied with the requirements of Rule 11, Kennedy claims that the parties\u2019 failure to disclose his plea agreement during the Rule 11 hearing is ground for having his conviction and sentence reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Kennedy did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, and his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is, therefore, reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 526 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find that the district court generally complied with Rule 11 in its acceptance of Kennedy\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We do find, and the Government concedes, that the parties failed to disclose Kennedy\u2019s plea agreement during the Rule 11 hearing, that this omission was error, and that the error was plain. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We conclude, however, that the error did not affect Kennedy\u2019s substantial rights. First, Kennedy does not allege that but for the Rule 11 error, he would not have pled guilty. Rather, Kennedy\u2019s counsel merely states that Kennedy \u201capparently relied on the agreement and potential for a downward departure as inducement for the plea.\u201d This assertion does not meet the standard set forth in <em>Martinez. See </em>277 F.3d at 532-33 (holding that, to prove that an error affected his substantial rights, the defendant must show that he would not have pled guilty but for that error).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">Moreover, the plea agreement specifically provided that Kennedy was required to cooperate with the Government in its prosecution of other persons and that the Government would only agree to move for a downward departure if, in its sole discretion, it determined Kennedy\u2019s assistance was \u201csubstantial.\u201d Even if the Government did agree to move for a downward departure, however, the matter of Kennedy\u2019s sentencing remained within the sole discretion of the district court. Accordingly, even assuming the Government had moved for a downward departure on Kennedy\u2019s behalf, whether the district court would have granted the motion is speculative, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Because Kennedy has not made the required showing under <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, we affirm Kennedy\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> The probation officer calculated a sentencing guideline range for Kennedy of 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment founded on a total o\u00edfense level of 41 and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
