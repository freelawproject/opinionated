The district court denied their motion for class certification, concluding that, because defendants\u2019 statuteof-limitations defense could not be resolved on a class-wide basis, issues common to the class did not predominate over individual ones. Appellants appealed the denial of certification, and we placed the case in abeyance pending resolution of <em>Thorn v. Jefferson-Pilot Life Ins. Co., </em>445 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.2006). The opinion in <em>Thorn </em>has now issued, holding on facts materially indistinguishable from those presented here, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification where the defendant\u2019s statute-of-limitations defense could not, for reasons identical to those relied upon by the district court here, be resolved on a class-wide basis. Because this case is controlled by <em>Thom, </em>and for the reasons stated therein, we grant the motion for summary affirmance, grant the motion to submit the appeal on the briefs, affirm the judgment of the district court, and remand for further proceedings on appellants\u2019 individual claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\"> In light of this disposition, we deny as moot the pending motions to expedite this appeal and to continue the previously scheduled oral argument date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
