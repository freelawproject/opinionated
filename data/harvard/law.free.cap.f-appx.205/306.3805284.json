Valera challenges only the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. He does not dispute the district court\u2019s statement of facts gleaned from his medical records and from the <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The evidence relied on by the district court supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Valera has not shown that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. <em>See Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </em>227 F.3d 316, 324 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). The evidence also supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Valera\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the Harris County Jail\u2019s policy of confiscating prescription medication upon intake, <em>see Meadowbriar Home For Children, Inc. v. Gunn, </em>81 F.3d 521, 532-33 (5th Cir.1996), and that Valera suffered no injury or loss of vision between the time his eye drops were confiscated and the time he was examined by physicians at the jail. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b333-22\"><em> Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
