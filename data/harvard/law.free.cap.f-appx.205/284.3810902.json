United States, </em>528 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. Gorton also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002), which held that no Sixth Amendment violation arises when a district court considers the nature of a prior conviction rather than presenting the question to a jury in sentencing the defendant under the Armed Career Criminal Act, and by <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir.2002), which held that under the law of the case doctrine, an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
