Mueller was sentenced to twenty-four months of imprisonment. On appeal, this court affirmed Mueller\u2019s convictions but remanded for re-sentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), finding that the enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(H) (2000) for intended loss based upon judicial fact-finding constituted plain error. <em>United States v. Turgeon, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 144 (4th Cir.2005). On remand, the district court imposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The probation officer assigned a guideline range of twenty-four to thirty months of imprisonment based on a total offense level of seventeen and a criminal history category of I. The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated $185,223 as the amount of loss attributed to Mueller. This figure included timber and land value for respective fraud victims. As a result of the PSR loss calculation, under USSG \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(H), a seven-level adjustment was applied to Mueller\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">On appeal, Mueller argues that the court erred in its calculation of loss under USSG \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(H). He essentially raises the same argument he did below, i.e., whether the court erred in including the value of the land in its loss determination. This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal conclusions, including its interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines, de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). The determination of loss attributable to a fraud scheme is a factual issue for resolution by the district court. <em>United States v. Godwin, </em>272 F.3d 659, 671 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">We have reviewed the briefs and material submitted in the joint appendix in light of Mueller\u2019s arguments and find no error in the application of the disputed enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm Mueller\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
