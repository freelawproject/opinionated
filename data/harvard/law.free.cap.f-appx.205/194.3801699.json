Hinton contends that he complied with two of the district court\u2019s orders to file a more definite statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint under Rule 41(b) was an abuse of discretion. He also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to be joined in a multidistrict action against Enron.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court did not err or abuse its discretion when it dismissed Hinton\u2019s complaint following his failure to respond to two orders for him to show cause. <em>See McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988); <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 792 (5th Cir.1988). The district court\u2019s denial of Hinton\u2019s motion to be joined in the multidistrict suit against Enron was also not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
