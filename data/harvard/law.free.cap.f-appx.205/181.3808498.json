Davis pled guilty to distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). He was sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence was imposed prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court granted Davis\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, in which Davis claimed his trial counsel failed to file a notice of appeal despite instructions to do so. Vacating the original criminal judgment, the district court noted \u201cthe sentence heretofore imposed is in all respects the same sentence the court would have imposed in light of <em>[Booker] </em>and the factors specified\u201d in <em>Booker. </em>The court then reentered judgment, imposing an identical term of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the top of the sentencing guidelines range. Davis appealed, contending the reentry of judgment violated <em>Booker </em>because it deprived him of the opportunity to be sentenced under an advisory sentencing guidelines regime. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-20\">Under <em>Booker, </em>when a defendant is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 224, 125 S.Ct. 738. Thus, error under the Sixth Amendment occurs when the district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), we held that a sentence that was imposed under the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory sentencing scheme and was enhanced based on facts found by the court, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, constitutes plain error. That error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and warrants reversal under <em>Booker </em>when the record does not disclose what discretionary sentence the district court would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In this case, the district court\u2019s post-<em>Booker </em>reentry of judgment clearly indicates what sentence it would have imposed under an advisory guideline scheme. Although we detect no Sixth Amendment error at Davis\u2019 original, <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing, any such error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 267 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 310, 166 L.Ed.2d 155 (2006). Further, the district court is presumed to have properly considered the 18 U.S.C.A \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) sentencing factors, as required by <em>Hughes, United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006), and <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054,164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). <em>See Shatley, </em>448 F.3d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Davis\u2019 sentence, which is below the statutory maximum and within the properly calculated guidelines range, \u201cis presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457 (citations omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
