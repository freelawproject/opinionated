The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas transferred Segovia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to this court. <em>See Jama v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 230, 232 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055,163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">Segovia argues that he is not subject to removal because the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) cannot constitutionally be applied to his deferred adjudication. Segovia\u2019s deferred adjudication falls clearly under the IIRIRA\u2019s definition of conviction, and the application of that definition does not violate his constitutional rights. <em>See Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 330 (5th Cir.2004); Moosa <em>v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1001-02 (5th Cir.1999); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Segovia\u2019s alternative argument that he is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief from removal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(b) is unavailing because Segovia was convicted of an aggravated felony, as that term was defined when his request for \u00a7 212(c) relief was adjudicated. <em>Salazar-Regino v. Trominski, </em>415 F.3d 436, 447 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 22, 2005) (No. 05-830); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-23\">Segovia\u2019s second alternative argument that his offense for simple possession, which was only a misdemeanor under federal law, is not a \u201cdrug-trafficking\u201d crime, and, therefore, not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) is also unavailing. Segovia\u2019s contention that the retroactive appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>cation of this court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) in <em>United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505 (5th Cir.2001), to define his state-court offense as a drug trafficking offense violates the Ex Post Facto, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses was squarely rejected by this court in <em>Salazar-Regino, </em>415 F.3d at 448-49, 451-52. One panel of this court may not overrule another. <em>See id. </em>at 448; <em>Williams v. Blazer Fin. Sens., Inc., </em>598 F.2d 1371,1374 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">This court has also rejected Segovia\u2019s argument that the deportation, resulting exile, and permanent separation from an alien\u2019s family violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). <em>See Martinez-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 500, 502-03 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Accordingly, Segovia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
