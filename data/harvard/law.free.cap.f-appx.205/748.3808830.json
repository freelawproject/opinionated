Parcelles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). On appeal, Keane argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred in (1) finding that the disability onset date was October 15, 1999; (2) finding that Parcelles\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal Listing 4.04(C); and (3) not considering the combined effect of all of Parcelles\u2019s impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">We review a social security case to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.... Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (quotation and citations omitted). In conducting this review, we do not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). With respect to the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions, however, our review is <em>de novo. Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329,1330 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">I. Finding of Disability Onset Date</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">An \u201conset date should be set on the date when it is most reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the impairment was sufficiently severe to prevent the individual from engaging in [substantial gainful activity] for a continuous period of at least 12 months or result in death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine the onset date for disabilities of nontraumatic origin, the individual\u2019s allegation, work history, and medical and other evidence should be considered. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he date alleged by the individual should be used if it is consistent with all the evidence available.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Although Parcelles came to revise his alleged onset date by approximately one year, October 15, 1999 was the onset date he originally and repeatedly submitted. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s affirmation that this date was, in fact, the onset date for Parcelles\u2019s disability. In addition to crediting Parcelles\u2019s own testimony that he stopped working in October 1999, the ALJ reviewed the medical evidence relating to the prior period and noted that Parcelles was engaging in gainful work activity. Though the medical record does indicate that Parcelles\u2019s diabetes was only intermittently under control, and that Parcelles was twice hospitalized for cardiac problems, the possibility that these impairments kept him from substantial gainful activity is not supported by enough record evidence to undermine the substantial evidence, summarized above, which supports the ALJ\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">II. No Finding of Ischemic Heart Disease Under Listing 4.04(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Social Security regulations provide a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining if a claimant has proven that he is disabled. See generally 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. At step three of the sequential evaluation process, a claimant has the burden of proving that an alleged medical problem meets or equals a listed impairment. <em>Barron v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 227, 229 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cTo \u2018meet\u2019 a Listing, a claimant must have a diagnosis included in the Listings and must provide medical reports documenting that the conditions meet the specific criteria of the Listings and the duration requirement.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cTo \u2018equal\u2019 a Listing, the medical findings must be \u2018at least equal in severity and duration to the listed findings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cWhile Appendix 1 must be considered in making a disability determination, it is not required that the [Commissioner] mechanically recite the evidence leading to her determination. There may be an implied finding that a claimant does not meet a listing.\u201d <em>Hutchison v. Bowen, </em>787 F.2d 1461, 1463 (11th Cir.1986). At the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision, Listing 4.04 stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">4.04 Ischemic heart disease, with chest discomfort associated with myocardial ischemia, as described in 4.00E3, while on a regimen of prescribed treatment. ... With one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">C. Coronary artery disease, demonstrated by angiography (obtained independent of Social Security disability evaluation), and an evaluating program physician, preferably one experienced in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease, has concluded that performance of exercise testing would present a significant risk to the individual, with both 1 and 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-9\">1. Angiographic evidence revealing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-10\">a. 50 percent or more narrowing of a nonbypassed left main coronary artery; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-11\">b. 70 percent or more narrowing of another nonbypassed coronary artery; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-12\">e. Total obstruction of a bypass graft vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-13\">2. Resulting in marked limitation of physical activity, as demonstrated by fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal discomfort on ordinary physical activity, even though the individual is comfortable at rest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 4.04 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s implicit decision that Parcelles did not establish that his impairment met or equaled Listing 4.04(C). The medical records from the pertinent period, October 15 through December 31, 1999 do not reveal any evidence that Parcelles was experiencing chest discomfort or had a \u201cmarked limitation of physical activity.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s failure to find that Parcelles met Listing 4.04(C) was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">III. Consideration of All Impairments in Combination</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">When a claimant alleges a multitude of impairments, \u201ca claim for social security benefits may he even though none of the impairments, considered individually, is disabling.\u201d <em>Walker v. Bowen, </em>826 F.2d 996,1001 (11th Cir.1987) (citation and quotation omitted). The ALJ has the duty to \u201cmake specific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments and to decide whether the combined impairments cause the claimant to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have held that the ALJ properly considered the claimant\u2019s impairments in combination when the ALJ stated that, \u201cbased upon a thorough consideration of all evidence, the ALJ concludes that appellant is not suffering from any impairment, or a combination of impairments of sufficient severity to prevent him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity for a period of at least twelve continuous months.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>784 F.2d 1073,1076 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The ALJ\u2019s decision in this case reflects full consideration of all of Parcelles\u2019s impairments, both individually and in combination. To the extent that plaintiffs argument is based on the ALJ\u2019s alleged failure to find additional severe impairments relating to the period from October 15 to December 31, 1999, there is substantial evidence in the record that supports the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">A claimant\u2019s impairment is determined to be severe or not severe in step two of the sequential evaluation process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(c). The regulations state that \u201c[a]n impairment or combination of impairments is not severe if it does not significantly limit [a claimant\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1521(a). \u201cBasic work activities\u201d include: (1) physical functions such as walking, standing, sitting, lifting, pushing, pulling, reaching, carrying, or handling; (2) capacities for seeing, hearing, and speaking; (3) understanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions; (4) use of judgment; (5) responding appropriately to supervision, co-workers and usual work situations; and (6) dealing with changes in a routine work setting. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1521(b)(l)-(6). We have explained that an \u201cimpairment is not severe only if the abnormality is so slight- and its effect so minimal that it would clearly not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education or work experience.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The ALJ found that Parcelles\u2019s severe impairments during this time were diabetes, obesity, and coronary artery disease, and he thoroughly discussed the substantial evidence supporting his conclusion that Parcelles\u2019s other alleged impairments \u2014 including obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d), asthma, and sleep apnea \u2014 were not so severe as to interfere with his ability to work during the relevant months of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Upon careful review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Because the ALJ\u2019s decision regarding the onset date, Listing 4.04(C), and the severi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ty of Parcelles\u2019s impairments from October 15, 1999, through December 31, 1999, properly considered all of Parcelles\u2019s impairments and was supported by substantial evidence, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-11\">.
