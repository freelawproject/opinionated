Mejia argues that a sentencing court must consider only reliable information in its departure decision and should not consider prior arrests alone, that the district court failed to give adequate reasons to support a departure, and that the district court overstated his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">The district court considered, not just Mejia\u2019s arrest record, but reliable information contained in the PSR. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>277 F.3d 721, 724 (5th Cir.2001). The district court was permitted to consider the numerous charges pending against Mejia. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(d). The district court also properly relied upon the convictions for serious dissimilar conduct which were not counted because they were outside the applicable time period. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3; 4A1.2, comment, (n.8).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">The district court could also consider dissimilar criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction. Section 4A1.3(e) permits consideration of \u201cprior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in conviction.\u201d Three other circuits, noting that \u00a7 4A1.3\u2019s factors are not exhaustive, have held that a district court may also rely, in certain instances, on the conduct underlying dissimilar unadjudicated offenses. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 146-47 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>127 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Schweihs, </em>971 F.2d 1302, 1319 (7th Cir.1992). The district court did not abuse its discretion by considering, to the extent that it did, the unadjudicated conduct outlined in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">Finally, the district court stated the specific reasons for the departure, complied with our instruction to consider each criminal history category above the guideline range as it determines the extent of the departure, and departed to a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>extent. <em>See United States v. Cade, </em>279 F.3d 265, 270 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 662-63 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
