Union Foundry Co., </em>281 F.3d 1229, 1233 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-25\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that UNUM fails to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying UNUM\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-26\">In <em>Waddell v. Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>329 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2003), we set forth the standards which govern the determination of motions made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(2) and (b)(3). In order to be entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(2), a movant must show that: \u201c(1) the evidence must be newly discovered since the trial; (2) due diligence on the part of the movant to discover the new evidence must be shown; (3) the evidence must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence must be material; and (5) the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>must be such that a new trial would probably produce a new result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the district court that relief is not warranted under Rule 60(b)(2) because the \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence would not have affected the outcome of this case. We also agree with the district court that relief was not warranted under Rule 60(b)(3) because the result was not obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. <em>See id. </em>(noting that to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(3), the movant must show by clear and convincing evidence that the adverse party obtained the verdict through fraud, misrepresentations, or other misconduct). Moreover, we conclude, as did the district court, that there are no extraordinary circumstances which would justify relief under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Finally, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denying UNUM\u2019s request for post-judgment discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying UNUM\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-19\">. In a companion case, <em>Billings v. UNUM Life Insurance Company of America, </em>459 F.3d 1088 (11th Cir.2006), we affirmed the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Billings and against UNUM on Billings's claim under the Employment Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>for wrongful denial of disability benefits due to obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
