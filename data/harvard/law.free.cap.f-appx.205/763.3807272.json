For the first time on appeal, Henry argues that the district court violated <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the Sixth Amendment by failing to consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), along with the advisory Guidelines range, and that her sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">We review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). However, because Henry failed to raise the instant argument in the district court, our review of her claim is for only plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). To prevail under this standard, Henry must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-16\">It is now well-settled that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324,1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Moreover, we have upheld a sentencing determination where express consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors could not change the result, and where the district court had already explicitly considered deterrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and punishment \u2014 two factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324,1328 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Here, we discern no plain error in the district court\u2019s sentencing scheme. First, contrary to Henry\u2019s argument that the record indicates the district court imposed a sentence pursuant to mandatory guidelines, the district court clearly stated during the plea colloquy that it understood the Guidelines were advisory. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2006), (\u201cSo long as the district court indicated that it understood the Guidelines to be advisory, no reversible error exists.\u201d). Second, at the sentencing hearing, although the district court did not explicitly state it was considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, our review of the record, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript and the PSI, makes <em>dear </em>that the court heard argument and received evidence on many of the factors listed in the statute, including: (1) \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; and (2) \u201cneed for the sentence imposed ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; [] to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and [ ] to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner[.]\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The court imposed a 24-month sentence, which it stated was \u201cappropriate,\u201d after it had considered arguments from both Henry and the government concerning her personal history and circumstances, mental health, and prior offenses, which the court found demonstrated Henry\u2019s propensity for violence. Finally, the court ordered Henry to undergo substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling and treatment while in prison, thus further demonstrating the court\u2019s consideration of Henry\u2019s personal circumstances, within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a). In short, the district court was not required to do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">We also conclude that Henry\u2019s 24-month sentence, which was at the midpoint of the 21 to 27 months\u2019 range that she faced, was reasonable. After <em>Booker, </em>the party challenging the sentence has the burden to establish that her sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record established below. <em>Talley, </em>431 <em>F.3d </em>at 788. While a sentence within the guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, it is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>In short, Henry has <em>not met </em>her burden here to show why her mid-point sentence is unreasonable within the meaning of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-13\">. <em>United States v.
