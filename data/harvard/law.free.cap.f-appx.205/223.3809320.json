He contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a term of imprisonment greater than necessary to meet the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The record reflects that the district court considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) when it determined that a 46-month term of imprisonment was a fair and reasonable sentence in Flores-Esparza\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Flores-Esparza\u2019s sentence fell at the lowest end of his properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Flores-Esparza has failed to rebut that presumption. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Flores-Esparza challenges 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Flores-Esparza\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Flores-Esparza contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Flores-Esparza acknowledges the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>but raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
