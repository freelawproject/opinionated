Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719,116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>MA v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-27\">The Board ruled that Kourouma did not establish that exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing before the immigration judge for a scheduled proceeding. We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Kourouma fails to show that the Board abused its discretion. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
