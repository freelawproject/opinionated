R.Civ.P. 59(e). We have reviewed the record and find that there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motions to appoint counsel and for reconsideration. Accordingly, we affirm those orders for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Chronister v. Metis, </em>No. 2:04-cv-22848-HMH (D.S.C. Feb. 15, 2005; Mar. 28, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-25\">Turning to the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denying \u00a7 1983 relief, we note that Chronister failed to challenge the bases for the district court\u2019s rejection of his claims in his informal appellate brief. Thus, he has waived appellate review of that order. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (\u201cThe Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d). We deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Chronister\u2019s motion to appoint counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
