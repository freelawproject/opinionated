We affirmed his conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). <em>See United States v. Stanback, </em>141 Fed.Appx. 114 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). On remand, the district court resentenced Stanback to four hundred and twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>months of imprisonment. Stanback again appeals, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. In determining a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>however, sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"ADn\">Here, the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory and properly calculated and considered the guideline range as well as the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a). Stanback\u2019s sentence is below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. Stanback contends that his sentence is unreasonably long because it is essentially a life sentence considering that his age at sentencing was thirty-eight and also considering that he had a minimal criminal history score. However, his claims are not adequate to rebut the presumption that the sentence, which was within the guideline range, is reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456-57. We conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Stanback\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
