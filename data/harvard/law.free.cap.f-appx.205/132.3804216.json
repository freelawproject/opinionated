Linder further requests that we overturn his conviction. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought and no other means to seek the requested relief. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Linder has not established he is entitled to the relief sought, as he fails to establish the requisite extraordinary circumstances. Further, mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). This court recently affirmed Linder\u2019s conviction and sentence, <em>see United States v. Linder, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 186 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished), and he may raise any additional challenges in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We will not consider the propriety of Linder\u2019s conviction in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
