Because we find that the district court did not impose unreasonable sentences, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">We review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). As an initial matter, the government argues that plain-error review should apply. We need not address this contention, however, because Nottage\u2019s argument fails even under a reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">Under that standard, the party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Some factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) are the: (1) \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; and (2) need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal activity, and protect the public from future crimes by the defendant. While a sentence within the guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, it is expected to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Moreover, a district court need not mention each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). We review the final sentence for reasonableness, as opposed to each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Nottage argues that her sentences are unreasonably high in light of her \u201cpersonal background, lack of criminal history, remorse, [ ] cooperation with authorities ... [and] the fact that [her] co-conspirators received substantially reduced sentences for similar conduct[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. Upon review of the record and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The district court calculated the guidelines correctly and imposed reasonable concurrent sentences after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court listened to Nottage\u2019s personal circumstances, including the needs of her daughter and her mother\u2019s medical condition and custody of four children. The court sustained Nottage\u2019s objection to an enhancement for being a leader or organizer of the criminal scheme, compared Nottage\u2019s conduct to her co-defendants\u2019 conduct, reduced the quantity of drugs for which she was responsible, and found that 121 months would appropriately meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, Nottage\u2019s sentences \u2014 at the low end of the guideline range \u2014 are reasonable in light of \u00a7 3553(a). See <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Accordingly, because the district court did not impose unreasonable sentences, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-5\">. As such, Nottage's arguments based on her lack of criminal history and co-conspirators\u2019 sentences, raised for the first time on appeal, must fail. Because the court was not required to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, <em>see Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30, it did not err in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>discuss Nottage\u2019s lack of criminal history or her co-conspirators\u2019 sentences. In fact, the court did reduce Nottage\u2019s role enhancement and the amount of Oxycontin prescriptions for which she was responsible after it made findings regarding the difference between Nottage\u2019s conduct and the conduct of one of her co-defendants. Thus, Nottage cannot prove error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (the burden rests with the defendant to prove unreasonableness).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
