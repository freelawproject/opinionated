He was sentenced to 300 months in prison. Owens now appeals, raising two issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">Stephanie Hargrove, David Owens\u2019 girlfriend, testified that he was a heroin dealer in North Carolina who obtained his heroin supply in Connecticut. She said that he had dealt heroin during the three years of their relationship. At Owens\u2019 direction, she rented a car in Wilmington, North Carolina, and drove to Connecticut, where she met Owens. Owens asked her to take a bag back to North Carolina with her. She suspected that the bag contained heroin, and declined his request. While she was away from the car, Owens packed the car. It was not until she was driving back to North Carolina and received a cell phone call from Owens inquiring about a bag that she realized Owens likely had placed a bag containing heroin in the car\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-21\">Hargrove was stopped for a traffic infraction in Henrico County, Virginia. She consented to a search of the car. During the search, Officer William Hueston discovered a bag containing what appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>be heroin. Hueston informed Hargrove what he had found and told her that he suspected she was transporting the heroin for someone else. Hueston told Hargrove that he would like her to cooperate with authorities so the dealer could be apprehended. Hargrove agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Officers devised a ruse in which Hargrove would tell Owens when he called that she had been in a traffic accident and was staying in a hotel in Virginia. Owens eventually arrived at the hotel, where he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">It was stipulated that the 1000 bags of heroin found in the trunk weighed 193 grams. An officer testified that, based on the packaging and amount of heroin, he believed the heroin was intended for distribution rather than personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Owens first claims that the district court erred when it denied his Fed. R. Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. In particular, Owens attempts to cast doubt on Hargrove\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 700 (4th Cir.2006). \"Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that evidence which a \u2018reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cardwell, </em>433 F.3d 378, 390 (4th Cir.2005) <em>(quoting United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1669, 164 L.Ed.2d 408 (2006). This court reviews both direct and circumstantial evidence and permits \u201cthe government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). \u201c[W]e do not review the credibility of witnesses and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">\u201cTo prove a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the government must prove (1) an agreement between two or more persons to engage in conduct that violates a federal drug law, (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy, and (3) the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 857. Here, there was ample evidence to support Owens\u2019 conviction. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence established that Owens was the leader of a criminal enterprise that violated the federal drug laws, and the enterprise involved at least one other person, Hargrove.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">Owens was sentenced as a career offender, and he never disputed that he satisfied the criteria for this designation. He contended, however, that his status as a career offender dramatically overstated his criminal past and resulted in a sentence far more severe than was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">At sentencing, the district court considered Owens\u2019 argument but rejected it. After describing Owens\u2019 criminal past, the court concluded that Owens\u2019 record showed him to be a \u201cclassic career offender.\u201d The court addressed the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>(West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), focusing on the nature of the instant offense and Owens\u2019 characteristics, including his criminal record. The court noted especially the amount of heroin involved in the offense and Owens\u2019 having used another person to facilitate the crime. The court concluded that a sentence within the properly calculated advisory guideline range of 262-327 months was appropriate and sentenced Owens to 300 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">On appeal, Owens again claims that his designation as a career offender significantly overstates his criminal history and that his sentence is far greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing. We review a sentence imposed after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to determine whether the sentence is \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range ... and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>- U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Here, Owens failed to rebut the presumption. At sentencing, the district court considered and rejected his contentions that his status as a career offender overstated his criminal past and that a lower sentence would serve the purposes of sentencing. The court concluded that Owens was a \u201cclassic career offender.\u201d Further, the court took the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account, focusing on the nature of the instant crime. We conclude that Owens\u2019 sentence is reasonable \u201c[bjecause the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range and adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">. Owens\u2019 sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range of five to forty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-26\">. Owens does not attack the calculation of the advisory guideline range. Nor would such an attack be successful, as our review of the record establishes that the range was correctly calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
