However, Crooms failed to request permission of the district court to file his petition, as he is required to do pursuant to this court\u2019s order in <em>Crooms v. Cockrell, </em>No. 01-21003 (5th Cir. March 28, 2002). Therefore, Crooms\u2019s application for leave to proceed is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Crooms\u2019s motions for leave to file a supplemental complaint and for a certificate of appealability are DENIED as having been improvidently filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">PERMISSION AND MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
