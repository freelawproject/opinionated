He was sentenced to twenty-seven months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release on the bank fraud charge and three years of supervised release on the access device and structuring charges. Upon his release from imprisonment, Holden fled to Canada. After he was captured, he pled guilty to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>grade C violations of supervised release. At his sentencing hearing, his advisory sentencing range was calculated as four to ten months of imprisonment under the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court sentenced Holden to the maximum sentence of three years incarceration for the violations noting that Holden \u201cdid not even give the supervising officer an opportunity to assist him in becoming law abiding and transitioning back to society.\u201d (J.A. 104). Holden timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">We note that the district court did not have the benefit of our opinion in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), to guide its imposition of Holden\u2019s revocation sentence. Nonetheless, we conclude that Holden\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable, and we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
