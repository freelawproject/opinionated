On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint and denied him \u201cdue and substantial process\u201d because of his status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant proceeding <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings' are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). The district court\u2019s \u201cpower to dismiss is an inherent aspect of its authority to enforce its orders and ensure prompt disposition of lawsuits.\u201d <em>Jones v. Graham, </em>709 F.2d 1457, 1458 (11th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). The court may dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>under Rule 41(b) for failure to prosecute or failure to obey a court order. Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>Lopez v. Aransas County Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>570 F.2d 541, 544 (5th Cir.1978). When a dismissal is without prejudice and plaintiff elects not to amend, for the purposes of appeal the order is a Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) adjudication on the merits. <em>Robinson v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortgage Ass\u2019n, </em>673 F.2d 1247, 1249 (11th Cir.1982). We review a Rule 41(b) dismissal without prejudice for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Communs., </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). Dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b) \u201cupon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of Brown\u2019s brief, we discern no reversible error. In this case, Brown was informed that failure to comply with the court\u2019s order could result in dismissal. The record indicates that Brown was given two opportunities to amend his complaint according to the court\u2019s specific instructions, and that he failed to do so. Brown failed to name individual defendants and failed to articulate specific claims against those defendants. Brown also failed to present his factual allegations in separate, numbered paragraphs and included numerous statements unrelated to the incident underlying his cause of action. Accordingly, because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>trict court dismissed Brown\u2019s complaint without prejudice, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Brown\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
