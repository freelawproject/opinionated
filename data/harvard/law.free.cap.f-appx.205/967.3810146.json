Thereafter, Romero filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the District of New Jersey, his district of confinement, alleging (a) that his indictment failed to charge a substantive offense; (b) a conspiracy to amend the indictment during the sentencing phase of the trial; and (c) unconstitutional sentencing enhancements. The District Court dismissed the petition, finding that Romero\u2019s claims could not be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">A \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge to his sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A \u00a7 2241 petition may not be entertained unless a motion under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner can not meet the stringent gate keeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant relief, <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Romero\u2019s claims fall within the purview of \u00a7 2255, and as found by the District Court Romero has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d Romero\u2019s reliance on the non-waiver of jurisdictional defects is misplaced. Neither the government\u2019s purported failure to charge a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) drug quantity in the indictment or its purported amendment of the indictment at sentencing raise a jurisdictional claim. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630-31, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (holding that indictment defects are not jurisdictional); <em>United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 286-87 (5th Cir.2002) (finding that claim of constructive amendment of indictment is not a jurisdictional claim). Also, Romero\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), for the proposition that pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), he is actually innocent lacks merit. Unlike the intervening change in law in <em>Dorsainvil </em>that potentially made the crime for which the petitioner was convicted non-criminal, <em>Booker </em>applies to sentencing and does not render Romero\u2019s offense of \u201cconviction non-criminal.\u201d <em>Cf. Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (finding \u00a7 2255 not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d, where successive petitioner sought to raise sentencing claim based on intervening decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Accordingly, as there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm. Third Circuit LAR 27.4; Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
