Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002), which held that no Sixth Amendment violation arises when a district court considers the nature of a prior conviction rather than presenting the question to a jury in sentencing the defendant under the Armed Career Criminal Act, and by <em>United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005), which held that the application of the remedial opinion of <em>United States v.
