On appeal, Sosa-Saucedo argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-28\">\u201c[We] review[ ] a district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of \u2018safety valve\u2019 relief for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Poyato, </em>454 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004)). The district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>The standards for reviewing the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>tion of the guidelines before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), continue to apply after <em>Booker </em>as well. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). The defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553,1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level reduction in the offense level for certain drug-related crimes if the defendant meets five criteria as set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7). The defendant must show: (1) he does not have more than one criminal history point; (2) he did not use violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon during the offense; (3) death or serious bodily injury did not occur to any person as a result of the offense; (4) he was not an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense\u201d and not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and (5) he truthfully provided the government with all information and evidence he has concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). The record supports, and the parties do not dispute, that Sosa-Saucedo meets the first four criteria. The point of contention lies with the fifth factor under \u00a7 501.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The fifth factor of the safety-valve requires truthful and complete disclosure of information known by the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 601.2(a)(5). \u201c[T]he defendant has an affirmative responsibility to \u2018truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302 (quoting <em>United States v. Yate, </em>176 F.3d 1309, 1310 (11th Cir.1999)). However, it is the responsibility of the district court to determine the truthfulness of the information the defendant provided to the government, and the court errs if it defers to the government on this issue. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\u201c[I]t is the offense for which the defendant is convicted that determines the scope of information which the defendant must disclose.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302. In <em>Cruz, </em>we held that the defendant, who was convicted of a drug-related conspiracy, was obligated to disclose \u201call the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error because Sosa-Saucedo failed to meet his burden of proof under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 601.2(a)(5). Sosa-Saucedo was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Accordingly, he was required to disclose information about buyers, suppliers, and anyone else he introduced into the conspiracy. However, the record does not demonstrate that Sosa-Saucedo disclosed such information even though he admitted to participating in other transactions. Specifically, he did not admit to introducing his brother into the cocaine distribution chain until after the government presented evidence of the intercepted phone calls. Later, in his allocution, he contradicted his attorney\u2019s representation and denied his brother\u2019s involvement in the intercepted phone call. Thus, Sosa-Saucedo has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding he failed to satisfy the fifth element of the safety-valve provision. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
