We previously remanded this case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether Graham satisfied the requirements for reopening the appeal period set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <em>See United, States v. Graham, </em>180 Fed. Appx. 429 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished). On remand, the district court found Graham did not satisfy these requirements. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United, States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-17\">The district court\u2019s order denying Graham\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was entered on the docket on May 12, 2005. The notice of appeal, which we previously construed as a motion to reopen the appeal period, was filed on November 15, 2005. On remand, the district court found Graham\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely, because he failed to file the motion to reopen within 180 days after the district court denied the Rule 59(e) motion, which was November 8, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(A) (providing a motion to reopen must be filed within 180 days after entry of the order or seven days after receiving notice of the entry, whichever is earlier). We agree. Because Graham failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain a permissible extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
