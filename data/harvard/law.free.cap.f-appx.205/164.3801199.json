The district court ordered that judgment should be entered without delay.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Although neither Legg, KLLM, nor Pierce has challenged the district court\u2019s apparent certification of this appeal under Rule 54(b), we must consider sua sponte the issue of whether the court\u2019s entry of final judgment was warranted because it involves the scope of our jurisdiction. <em>See Snowden v. Checkpoint Check Cashing, </em>290 F.3d 631, 635 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]hen our appellate jurisdiction is in doubt, we must <em>sua sponte </em>raise and address the matter.\u201d). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Certification pursuant to Rule 54(b) is disfavored in this circuit. <em>Braswell Shipyards, Inc. v. Beazer East, Inc., </em>2 F.3d 1331, 1335 (4th Cir.1993). In certifying an appeal, the district court must determine \u201cwhether there is no just reason for the delay in the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we have set forth factors a court should consider in making such determination, <em>id. </em>at 1335-36, the district court did not address any of those factors in its order. \u201cThe expression of clear and cogent findings of fact is crucial\u201d for appellate review of the court\u2019s certification decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Because the district court did not set forth its rationale in ordering that judgment against KLLM and Pierce be entered without delay, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 1335-36; <em>see also Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Corp., </em>446 U.S. 1, 10, 100 S.Ct. 1460, 64 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> Legg's action against the remaining defendants has been stayed by the district court pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
