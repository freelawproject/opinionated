We have reviewed the record and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
