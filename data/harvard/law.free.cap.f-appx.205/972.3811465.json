We previously granted a certificate of appealability on Coon\u2019s claim that his attorney failed to appeal these criminal convictions despite Coon\u2019s request that he do so.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we vacate the district court\u2019s order summarily denying relief on this claim, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-28\">\u201cUnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A hearing is required when a movant presents a colorable Sixth Amendment claim showing disputed material facts and a credibility determination is necessary to resolve the issue. <em>See United States v. Witherspoon, </em>231 F.3d 923, 925-27 (4th Cir.2000); <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000); <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">In its informal brief to this court, the Government concedes that \u201cthe record before the district court raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether trial counsel\u2019s performance was <em>per se </em>ineffective under <em>Peak. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of this claim without seeking an affidavit from trial counsel or resolving the dispute was in error.\u201d We agree. In light of Coon\u2019s claim, under penalty of perjury, that counsel faded to file an appeal after being requested to do so, we find that the district court erred in summarily dismissing this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion for leave to file its brief out of time, vacate the decision of the district court, and remand the case for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-19\"> In the same order, we denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Coon\u2019s appeal with respect to his other claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
