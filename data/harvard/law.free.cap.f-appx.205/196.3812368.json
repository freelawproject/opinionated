The district court sentenced Collins to consecutive prison terms of 168 months and 60 months and to concurrent supervised-release terms of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Collins contends that the district court erred in concluding that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the sentencing provision for his firearm offense, required the imposition of a five-year mandatory minimum prison term when he was subject to a greater mandatory minimum prison term for the predicate drug-trafficking offense. This argument is based on the initial \u201cexception\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), which states that, \u201c[ejxcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,\u201d a person who uses or carries a firearm, or possesses a firearm in furtherance of, a drug-trafficking offense or crime of violence, is subject to various mandatory minimum prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">\u201cThe appropriate starting point when interpreting any statute is its plain meaning,\u201d which may be ascertained by both the \u201cparticular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Elrawy, </em>448 F.3d 309, 315 (5th Cir.2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Three sister circuits have held that the \u201cexception\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not permit a distinct court to consider a sentence below the mandatory minimum simply because a defendant\u2019s predicate conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence greater than the mandatory minimum sentence that applies under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d 386, 387-89 (8th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Studifin, </em>240 F.3d 415, 421-23 (4th Cir.2001) (adopting analysis of <em>Alaniz), United States v. Jolivette, </em>257 F.3d 581, 586-87 (6th Cir.2001) (same). With respect to \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u2019s exception for a \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d prescribed by \u201cany other provision of law,\u201d the Fourth Circuit reasoned that such language \u201cprovides a safety valve that would preserve the applicability of any other provisions that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>impose an even greater mandatory minimum consecutive sentence for a violation of \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Studifin, </em>240 F.Sd at 423. The language was interpreted as \u201csimply reserving the possibility that another statute or provision might impose a greater minimum consecutive sentencing scheme for a \u00a7 924(c) violation, and not as negating the possibility of consecutive sentencing in\u201d circumstances in which a defendant faces a greater mandatory minimum sentence for a predicate drug-trafficking or crime-of-violence offense. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Alaniz </em>also pointed out that an interpretation like Collins\u2019s would be \u201cillogical\u201d because it \u201cwould punish those guilty of severe [predicate] offenses more leniently, and those guilty of less severe sentences more stringently.\u201d <em>Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We find the rationale of these decisions convincing. Although the exception for a \u201cgreater minimum sentence ... otherwise provided ... by any other provision of law\u201d is not a model of clarity, the rest of the sentence in which it appears refers to a person who has either used or carried a firearm during and in relation to, or possessed a firearm in furtherance of, a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime. In construing the \u201cexception\u201d clause in the context of the \u201clanguage and design of the statute as whole,\u201d <em>see Elrawy, </em>448 F.3d at 315, it is reasonable to read the phrase \u201cany other provision of law\u201d as referring to legal provisions outside the confines of \u00a7 924(c) that concern firearm possession in furtherance of a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime. Accordingly, we adopt the analysis of <em>Alaniz, Studifin, </em>and <em>Jolivette </em>and hold that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not permit a sentence below five years for that offense in the circumstances of Collins\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Collins contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for funds to hire mitigation investigators for sentencing purposes, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l). He maintains that further investigation would likely to have led to mitigating evidence that would have warranted a sentence below the guideline range, especially with respect to head trauma he had suffered as a child. We review the denial of a request for appointment of an expert or specialist under \u00a7 3006A(e)(l) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>437 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir.2006). Because most of the personal factors cited by Collins were discussed in his Presentenee Report, and because Collins has not demonstrated that the failure to grant funds for an investigator prejudiced him, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Bertling, </em>370 F.3d 818, 820 (8th Cir.2004), Collins has not shown that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Collins has not shown clear error with respect to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a two-level reduction based on Collins\u2019s alleged \u201cminor\u201d offense role under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005). Although Collins\u2019s coconspirators may have been involved with greater quantities of methamphetamine than he was, his possession of four ounces of methamphetamine, as well as of a firearm and other drugs, reflected that he was not \u201cperipheral\u201d to the advancement of the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Collins contends that the sentence was \u201cunreasonable\u201d because the district court should have considered a prison term of less than five years for the \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) offense (because of the \u201cexception\u201d clause in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)) and because the denial of funds for a mitigation investigator prevented the district court from giving due consideration to mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ing evidence that would have warranted a sentence outside the guideline range. Because those two contentions are meritless, Collins has not rebutted the presumption that the sentence, which was within the guideline range, was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
