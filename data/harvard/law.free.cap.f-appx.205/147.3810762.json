To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Wang fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be-fox*e the court and ax'gument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
