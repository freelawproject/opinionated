The district court thereafter sentenced Lyons to a 240-month term of imprisonment. On appeal, Lyons seeks resentencing based on her contention that (1) the Government breached her plea agreement, (2) her sentencing counsel provided ineffective assistance, and (3) her sentence is unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-19\">Pertinent to this appeal, Lyons agreed in the plea agreement to waive \u201call rights, conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, to appeal whatever sentence is imposed, including any issues that relate to the establishment of the Guideline range, reserving only the right to appeal from an upward departure from the Guideline range that is established at sentencing----\u201d J.A. 13. Lyons also agreed \u201cto disclose fully and truthfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>in interviews with Government agents, concerning all conduct related to the Information and any other crimes of which [she] has knowledge.\u201d J.A. 15. For its part, the Government agreed to \u201cmake known to the Court at sentencing the full extent of [Lyons\u2019] cooperation,\u201d but it was \u201cnot promising to move for departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.\u201d J.A. 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government also reserved the right to make a sentence recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated Lyons\u2019 total guideline offense level at 41. Because Lyons had a criminal history category of VI, her advisory guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment. Lyons initially objected to the PSR on several grounds, but upon the Government\u2019s filing of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, she withdrew her objections. Accordingly, without objection, the district court accepted the PSR calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">During the sentencing hearing, the Government presented its \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The Government informed the district court that Lyons\u2019 trial testimony in a federal case in Florida helped convict Andre Dougan, who was a large-scale drug dealer. The Government also noted that Lyons had been sent to Florida to testify against another drug defendant (Carey Williams), but because the prosecuting attorney did not find her credible, the Government did not use her at that trial. The Government then stated that although its normal policy was to recommend a 50% sentencing reduction, it was only requesting a 25% reduction, or a sentence of 270 months, for Lyons. Explaining this recommendation, the Government pointed out that despite Lyons\u2019 extensive criminal activity and local criminal connections, she did not provide assistance in North Carolina. According to the Government, Lyons \u201cpicked and chose\u201d where and when she would provide information, and she was not truthful and forthcoming about certain people (\u201cthe local drug dealers\u201d) who later implicated her as their drug supplier. J.A. 79. Moreover, even when confronted with information that the local drug dealers had implicated her, Lyons \u201cminimized\u201d her involvement with them. J.A. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In response to the Government\u2019s discussion of her assistance, Lyons\u2019 attorney (Deborah L. Newton) pointed to Lyons\u2019 testimony against Dougan and her willingness to testify against Williams. Referring to the local drug dealers, Newton also stated that she had \u201cthree pages worth of ... other people that [Lyons] has provided information for prosecution against,\u201d J.A. 90, and she named several of them. Newton explained Lyons\u2019 asserted lack of cooperation regarding the local drug dealers by noting that although it was \u201chard\u201d for Lyons to talk about them in her initial debriefings, she later was \u201cvery forthcoming.\u201d J.A. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">In an apparent attempt to rebut Newton\u2019s statement regarding Lyons\u2019 cooperation, the Government offered to call as a witness one of the law enforcement officers who had interviewed Lyons. The district court dissuaded the Government from calling this witness, and it then granted the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and sentenced Lyons to a 240-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Lyons first argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201cmake known to the Court at sentencing the full extent of [her] cooperation....\u201d J.A. 18. According to Lyons, the Government informed the district court about some, but not all, of her cooperation. Although Lyons presented additional information about her purported cooperation during the sentencing hearing, she did not argue in the district court that the Government breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Because of Lyons\u2019 failure to object to the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement during sentencing, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 65-66 (4th Cir.1997). Generally, under plain error review, we may notice an error that was not preserved by timely objection only if the defendant can demonstrate that: (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error was material or affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even when these three conditions are met, we will correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. In the specific context of plain error review of an alleged plea agreement breach, we have explained that the ultimate question is whether the alleged breach is \u201cso obvious and substantial that failure to notice and correct it\u201d affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>McQueen, </em>108 F.3d at 66 (citation and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Having carefully reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing, we find that Lyons has failed to establish any error, much less one that is plain. As noted, although not obligated to do so, the Government moved for a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 for Lyons\u2019 substantial assistance, and in support of the motion it informed the district court of Lyons\u2019 testimony against Dougan. Based on the Government\u2019s motion and presentation, the district court departed from the guideline range of 360 months to life and sentenced Lyons to a 240-month term of imprisonment. Thus, Lyons obtained a significant benefit by virtue of the Government\u2019s representation to the district court that she provided substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Notwithstanding this fact, Lyons argues that the plea agreement required more from the Government. Specifically, pointing to the local drug dealers, Lyons contends that the Government was obligated both to inform the district court about them and to explain her cooperation with respect to them. We believe that Lyons overstates the Government\u2019s obligation under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">To be sure, the Government agreed to inform the district court about the \u201cfull extent\u201d of Lyons\u2019 \u201ccooperation,\u201d and \u201ccooperation\u201d under the terms of this plea agreement arguably may be something different (albeit lesser) than \u201csubstantial assistance.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, what Lyons fails to grasp in any event is that the Government did not find her to be cooperative as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>local drug dealers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, as the Government explained to the district court at sentencing, Lyons was not initially truthful and forthcoming about the local drug dealers; she \u201cpicked and chose where and when she would provide information,\u201d J.A. 79, and she minimized her involvement with them even after being told that they had implicated her. Although Newton asserted that Lyons ultimately was forthcoming, she nonetheless implicitly acknowledged much of the Government\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In <em>Snow, </em>we considered a claim that the Government breached a plea agreement by failing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure motion where the agreement provided that the Government would make such a motion in exchange for the defendant\u2019s \u201ctruthful and thorough cooperation\u201d with law enforcement. 234 F.3d at 189. At the defendant\u2019s sentencing, the Government declined to file the motion based on its determination that the defendant did not truthfully and thoroughly cooperate, and the district court upheld the Government\u2019s decision. In affirming the sentence, we held that where \u201ca plea agreement contemplates that the Government will make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if the defendant provides truthful cooperation, the Government remains the appropriate party to assess whether the defendant has performed that condition adequately.\u201d 234 F.3d at 190. We further held that \u201cthe Government is entitled to have that evaluation reviewed only for bad faith or unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Although we decided <em>Snow </em>in the slightly different context of the Government\u2019s refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, we find its reasoning to be applicable here. Because Lyons has not shown any basis to suggest that the Government acted in bad faith or with an unconstitutional motive, we have no occasion to disregard the Government\u2019s determination that she did not cooperate regarding the local drug dealers. Accordingly, we find that the Government did not breach the plea agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Lyons next argues that Newton provided ineffective assistance because she (1) failed to object to the Government\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement and (2) procured Lyons\u2019 agreement to withdraw her objections to the PSR without obtain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ing any benefit from the Government in return. \u201cWe may consider an ineffective assistance claim in the first instance on direct appeal only if it conclusively appears from the record that counsel was constitutionally ineffective.\u201d <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 688 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1925, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006). Because our review of the record reveals that Lyons has failed to meet the high burden necessary to raise this claim on direct appeal, we decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Finally, Lyons argues that her sentence is unreasonable. The Government argues that Lyons has waived this issue by virtue of the appeal waiver in the plea agreement. We agree. As we have noted, Lyons agreed to waive (with one inapplicable exception) \u201call rights\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 \u201cto appeal whatever sentence is imposed.\u201d J.A. 13. This waiver, which we find to be valid and enforceable, bars Lyons\u2019 challenge to the reasonableness of her sentence. <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 167-69 (discussing enforceability of appeal waivers). Therefore, we dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\">. As we discuss below, the Government argues that the appeal waiver in Lyons\u2019 plea agreement bars her claim on appeal that her sentence is unreasonable. However, the Government does not argue that the appeal waiver bars Lyons\u2019 other claims. <em>See generally United. States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that we will enforce an otherwise valid appeal waiver when the Government seeks to enforce it and when there is no claim that the Government breached its obligations under the plea agreement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">. Section 5K1.1 permits the district court, on motion of the Government, to depart downward from the sentencing guideline range when the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed a criminal offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. Although the plea agreement uses the term \"cooperation,\u201d it does not mention \"substantial assistance\" specifically. Instead, the plea agreement simply refers to the Government's reservation of its right to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Because the Government\u2019s obligation to inform the district court about Lyons' \"cooperation\u201d appears in the same provision as the Government\u2019s reservation of its right to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, it is arguable that \u201ccooperation\u201d is in fact synonymous with \"substantial assistance.\u201d See <em>United States v. Atwood, </em>963 F.2d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding the terms \"substantial assistance\u201d and \"cooperation\u201d to be synonymous).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">. A defendant alleging that the Government breached a plea agreement bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence both the breach and his fulfillment of his own obligations under the agreement. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 &amp; n. 2 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, in the context of this case, Lyons must show that she provided the degree of cooperation contemplated by the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Conner, </em>930 F.2d 1073, 1076 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. In any event, even if the Government breached the plea agreement by not providing more detail about Lyons\u2019 \"cooperation\" as to the local drug dealers, we find that the purported breach would not warrant our correction of the error. As noted, during the sentencing hearing Newton informed the district court about Lyons' alleged cooperation; thus, the district court was aware that Lyons had done something more than simply testify against Dougan. In light of the significant downward departure Lyons received, we do not believe that the Government\u2019s alleged breach was \"so obvious and substantial\u201d that failure to notice and correct it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>McQueen, </em>108 F.3d at 66; <em>see also United States v. Salazar, </em>453 F.3d 911, 915 (7th Cir.2006) (\"Reversal on the basis of plain-error review is justifiable only when the reviewing court is convinced that it is necessary in order to avert an actual miscarriage of justice. A defendant wishing to establish plain error must show that but for the breach of the plea agreement his sentence would have been different.\u201d) (citation and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
