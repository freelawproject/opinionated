In support of this argument, he contends only that he \u201cfiled several grievances and Rule Violation Reports) appeals to defendant Larry Hardy who rejected them or ignored them pursuant to Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-5-801, MDOC policy 20-08-01. See <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>et al. No. GC71-CV-6-S-D, Order dated February 15, 1994.\u201d Taylor further asserts that \u201c[t]he rejection and ignoring of Taylor\u2019s grievances and rule violation report appeals has satisfied the exhaustion requirement under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).\u201d Taylor does not give any specifics concerning his \u201crejected\u201d or \u201cignored\u201d grievances, nor does he explain how he exhausted administrative remedies by filing those grievances. Therefore, he has abandoned the only issue before this court. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Taylor\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we DISMISS his appeal as frivolous. 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
