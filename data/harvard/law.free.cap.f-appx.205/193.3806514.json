The district court referred Page\u2019s action to Magistrate Judge Nancy K. Johnson. The VA moved for summary judgment on April 10, 2003 and Page filed a reply to the VA\u2019s motion. On July 7, the magistrate judge issued a comprehensive 19-page Memorandum and Recommendation proposing that the district court grant the VA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all grounds. Page filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and on July 23, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation in full. Page now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">After having carefully reviewed the briefs, record excerpts and relevant portions of the record itself, we agree with the district court that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation properly addresses the legal and factual issues raised by Page. For the reasons stated by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court, we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor the VA.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
