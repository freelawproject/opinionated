See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">Tony Allen Adams, Jr. pled guilty to one count of assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6) (2000), and one count of intimidation of a witness, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) (2000). On appeal, he claims the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Because we do not find an abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Withdrawal of a guilty plea is not a matter of right. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991)). The defendant bears the burden of showing a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of his guilty plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). \u201c[A] \u2018fair and just\u2019 reason ... is one that essentially challenges ... the fairness of the Rule 11 proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992) (en banc). An appropriately conducted Rule 11 proceeding, however, raises a strong presumption that the guilty plea is final and binding. <em>Id. </em>Courts consider six factors in determining whether to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or otherwise involuntary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">(2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence; (3) whether there has been a delay between entry of the plea and filing of the motion; (4) whether the defendant has had close assistance of counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-18\">(5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government; and (6) whether withdrawal will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-19\"><em>Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d at 424 (citing <em>Moore, </em>931 F.2d at 248) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-20\">Because the Rule 11 proceeding was appropriately conducted, there is a presumption that Adams\u2019 guilty plea was final and binding. Adams failed to show his plea was anything but knowing and voluntary. He also failed to show he was actually innocent of the offenses or that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
