Zuniga-Hernandez challenges his conviction based on <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) and a defective indictment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Zuniga-Hernandez asserts that his challenge to his \u00a7 924(c) conviction falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Zuniga-Hernandez pleaded guilty to using and carrying firearms and machineguns during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of \u00a7 924(c). <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Hernandez, </em>18 F.3d 1254,1257,1259 (5th Cir.1994). <em>Bailey </em>did nothing to affect Zuniga-Hernandez\u2019s conviction for carrying firearms and machine-guns. <em>See United States v. Rivas, </em>85 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.1996). Zuniga-Hernandez therefore cannot show that he \u201cmay have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Additionally, with regard to his indictment claim, Zuniga-Hernandez has not shown that there is \u201ca retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Therefore, Zuniga-Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the indictment does not fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
