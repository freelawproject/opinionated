Anthony challenged his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Because Anthony\u2019s claims relate to errors that allegedly occurred at or prior to sentencing, his claims could not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Moreover, Anthony has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. <em>See ReyesRequena, </em>243 F.3d at 901, 904. Anthony\u2019s argument that the restrictions on obtaining relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 constitute a violation of the Suspension Clause is without merit. <em>See id. </em>at 901 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">As Anthony does not address the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his motion under \u00a7 2255, any challenge to that finding has been abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b232-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
