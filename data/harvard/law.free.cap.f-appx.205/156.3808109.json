We have reviewed the record and conclude that Smith has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appeala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>bility and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Smith also appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his claims that the court erred in relying on prior convictions to enhance his sentence without first providing the notice required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000), and that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. In this order, the district court also granted relief under <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39 (4th Cir.1993), on Smith\u2019s claim that counsel failed to file a notice of appeal from the criminal judgment after being directed to do so, vacated the criminal judgment, and reinstated the judgment to afford Smith an opportunity to file a direct appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We note that Smith\u2019s direct appeal currently is pending before this court. Because the sentencing claims on which the district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief on the merits may be raised in the reinstated direct appeal, we grant a certificate of appealability, modify the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s sentencing claims to be without prejudice, and affirm the dismissal as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-23\"> Smith does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s grant of relief under <em>Peak.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
