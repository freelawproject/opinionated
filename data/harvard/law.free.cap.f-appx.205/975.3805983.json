Pursuant to the Government\u2019s filing of a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information listing a prior felony drug conviction, Jordan was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). Jordan timely appealed, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">Jordan\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but suggesting the district court erred at sentencing and Jordan received ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to his guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jordan filed a pro se supplemental brief, alleging the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. The Government elected not to file a responsive brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Counsel suggests the district court erroneously amended the \u00a7 851 information, erroneously sentenced Jordan pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and impermissibly enhanced Jordan\u2019s sentence based on a prior conviction not alleged in the indictment. Because these contentions were not raised in the district court, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770,123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The record indicates the district court corrected a clerical error in the \u00a7 851 information, which is permissible prior to sentencing. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (2000). The district court provided Jordan \u201cwith a full and fair opportunity to establish that he is not the previously convicted individual or that the conviction is an inappropriate basis for enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593, 599 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>980 F.2d 245, 252 (4th Cir.1992)). Jordan acknowledged the prior felony drug conviction. Clearly, he cannot prove the \u201c[clerical] error \u2018actually affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>326 F.3d at 599 (quoting <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">Counsel contends Jordan pled guilty to a violation of \u00a7 846 instead of a dismissed count alleging a violation of \u00a7 841, to which he contends the \u00a7 851 information applied. However, \u00a7 846 adopts the penalty provisions of \u00a7 841. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (\u201cAny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Moreover, although the prior felony drug conviction was not alleged in the indictment, the district court permissibly enhanced Jordan\u2019s sentence on the basis of this prior conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005) (concluding predicate convictions did not have to be charged in the indictment or submitted to a jury so long as no facts extraneous to those necessary to support the enhancement need be decided to invoke the enhancement), <em>cert. </em>denied,U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>544 U.S. 13, 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding Sixth Amendment protections apply only to disputed facts about a prior conviction that are not evident from \u201cthe conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Jordan alleges the district court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>The record plainly rebuts this allegation. However, the district court possessed no discretion to sentence Jordan below 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, because <em>\u201cBooker </em>did nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Jordan\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Jordan, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jordan requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from further representation. Any such motion filed by counsel must state that a copy thereof was served on Jordan. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">. This claim is not cognizable on direct appeal, as the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir. 1997). Instead, if Jordan wishes to raise an ineffective assistance claim, he must do so in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">. The plea agreement contained a provision in which Jordan agreed to waive his right to contest his conviction and sentence, either on appeal or in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, except for: (1) claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; (2) prosecutorial misconduct; or (3) the sentence, but only to the extent sentencing calculations were inconsistent with the plea agreement\u2019s stipulations. However, the Government has not asserted the waiver provision precludes review of Jordan\u2019s conviction or sentence on appeal. Thus, we decline to enforce the appellate waiver. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005) (stating that where Government expressly elects not to raise waiver, this court may decline to consider it) (citing <em>United States v. Brock, </em>211 F.3d 88, 90 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1003-17\">. In fact, Jordan acknowledged the existence of this prior conviction at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
