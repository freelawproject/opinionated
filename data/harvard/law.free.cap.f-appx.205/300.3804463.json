He seeks review of the BIA\u2019s removal order and denial of his waiver-of-removal and cancellation-of-removal applications under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Under the REAL ID Act, because Veloz-Ramirez\u2019s 1993 conviction was a firearm offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), our jurisdiction is limited by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to review of his constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 40, 166 L.Ed.2d 18 (2006). We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent it was influenced by the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Although we review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law, we defer to its interpretation of immigration regulations if such interpretation is reasonable. Herna<em>ndez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">Veloz-Ramirez first contends the BIA erred in finding him ineligible for waiver of removal under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Veloz-Ramirez was charged with being removable based on his 1993 conviction, which, in addition to constituting a \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C) firearm offense, constituted a crime involving moral turpitude under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). Because there was a directly comparable ground of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a), Veloz-Ramirez was eligible for former \u00a7 1182(c) waiver of removability for his crime as involving moral turpitude. Nevertheless, he was <em>not </em>similarly eligible <em>for his crime as a firearm offense </em>because there was no such directly comparable inadmissibility ground. <em>Chow v. INS, </em>12 <em>F.3d </em>34, 38 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Veloz-Ramirez next maintains the BIA erred in finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). He maintains the BIA erred in retroactively applying the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act\u2019s \u201cstop-time\u201d provision to pretermit his application. As noted, VelozRamirez\u2019s 1993 conviction was a \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae moral-turpitude crime, which is referred to in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2). Therefore, when Veloz-Ramirez committed the underlying aggravated assault on 1 January 1992, his period of continuous United States residence terminated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). At that time, he had not yet accrued the seven years of continuous United States residence required for \u00a7 1229b(a) cancellation-of-removal eligibility. Further, retroactive application of the stop-time rule does <em>not </em>violate aliens\u2019 due process rights. <em>See Gonzalez-Torres v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2000). Therefore, Veloz-Ramirez has again failed to show BIA error.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
