It appears that respondent Leon S. Wilson (counsel), a member of the bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of this State, was designated by a judge of the Municipal Court of the Town of West Orange to represent, and did represent, Catherine Anen (defendant), an indigent, on two disorderly persons charges which were pending against her in that court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tried in the municipal court on these charges this defendant was acquitted on one of the charges but found guilty on the other. On the conviction she was required to pay a fine of $100 and costs of $10. No custodial term was imposed. Counsel then applied to the Law Division for appointment to represent her therein on her appeal from the conviction. Counsel also asked that provision be made for payment to him \u201cof reasonable attorneys fees for services rendered in connection therewith.\u201d An order was entered on the application appointing counsel to represent defendant on the appeal and requiring that counsel \u201cbe compensated by the County of Essex for services rendered in connection with such appeal on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis.\u201d The order also required counsel to submit with his invoice for payment \u201ca form of agreement duly executed by the defendant herein by which she shall agree to reimburse the County of Essex for the reasonable value of the legal services rendered in such amount and at such time as she shall in the future be able to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On review in the Law Division, defendant\u2019s conviction in the municipal court was reversed. Thereafter, counsel sought an award of counsel fees in the amount of $1,075. The trial judge in the Law Division awarded him a counsel fee of $1,000 and $12.50 for disbursements, \u201cto be paid by the County of Essex.\u201d He also ordered the entry of judgment \u201cagainst Catherine F. Anen in favor of the County of Essex in the amount of $1,012.50 in accordance with the ten (10) year limitation afforded the Public Defender pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-17.\u201d This appeal by the county followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The county contends that (1) counsel appointed for an indigent defendant \u201cin a non-indictable \u2018petty\u2019 offense is not entitled to payment of a fee by the County,\u201d the appointment being \u201can obligation of the bar,\u201d and (2) this \u201cis not an appropriate case in which to extend the <em>Rush [State v. Rush, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>399 (1966)] formula to a new area [of] coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no statute, decisional law or rule of court which would authorize an award of a counsel fee in a matter of this kind and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-5.2 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">The Public Defender shall in the manner prescribed by P.L.1967, c. 43 (C.2A:158A-1 et seq.) provide for the legal representation of any person charged with a disorderly persons offense or with the violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of a penal nature where there is a likelihood that the persons so charged, if convicted, will be subject to imprisonment or, in the opinion of the court, any other consequence of magnitude. [L.1974, e. 33, \u00a7 3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The statute, by requiring as it does provision for legal representation \u201cin the manner prescribed\u201d by the legislation creating the Office of the Public Defender, obviously encompasses within its scope not only the initial representation by the Public Defender in the municipal court, but also his continued representation, on the <em>de novo </em>review in the Law Division, of the indigent defendant who seeks to appeal from a conviction in the local court. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A -5, which requires the Public Defender to provide for the legal representation of any indigent defendant formally charged with commission of an indictable offense, specifying that such representation \u201cshall include any direct appeal from conviction.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">However, as noted by this court in <em>In re Spann Contempt, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62 (App.Div.1982), since the Legislature has not appropriated funds necessary to implement the provisions of <em>N.J. S.A. </em>2A:158A-5.2, the Public Defender has not assumed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>responsibility thereunder. Accordingly, until the necessary appropriations are made, counsel will be assigned to represent indigent defendants in matters falling within the purview of the statute, whether in the municipal court or on appeal in the Law Division,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without compensation. While we recognize that this will entail some burden upon members of the bar, there is no suggestion that the burden would be unreasonable or likely to become so in the immediate future. If it should, our Supreme Court \u201cis available to act.\u201d <em>State In Interest of Anthony Antini, Jr., </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>488, 495 (1969). <em>And see In re Spann Contempt, supra; Crist v. Youth &amp; Family Services Div., </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 577 (App.Div.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The second and third ordering provisions of the order of April 10, 1980 under review, are reversed. And, the order and judgment of December 23, 1980 under review is, in its entirety, reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Counsel explained that defendant was initially \u201ccharged with two indictable offenses, both of which were downgraded [and referred] to the Municipal Court for disposition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Prior to oral argument of this appeal the court was Informed that the parties were willing to settle the matter by the county paying counsel for the indigent defendant a fee in the amount of one-half of the award. The court, however, ordered the appeal to go forward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\">We note that by <em>R. </em>3:27-2, as amended July 14, 1972, effective September 5, 1972, representation by counsel assigned to represent the indigent defendant at the trial level does not, in the event of a conviction, include representation on the appeal unless, as here, \u201cfurther assigned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
