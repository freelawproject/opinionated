Summary Judgment as to the Non-Constitutional Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the trial court erred by granting the Board's and the Trust Defendants' motions for summary judgment regarding the non-constitutional claims. Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2005). \"In ruling on such motion, the trial court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, taking the non-movant's asserted facts as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Glenn-Robinson v.

Plaintiffs additionally contend that their claim is within this monetary range and included in the broad wording of the Trust Agreement, which provides coverage for:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   all or part of a Claim made or any civil judgment entered against any of its members . . . when such Claim is made or such judgment is rendered as Damages on account of any act done or omission made . . . in the scope of their duties as members of the local board of education or as employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Board responds the trial court properly granted summary judgment because Exclusion Number 18 in the Coverage Agreement excludes coverage for \"any Claim arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of any Automobile\" and Nicole was hit by a gate\n   while driving an automobile. Plaintiffs contend, however, that the malfunctioning of the gate could have occurred even if Nicole had not been driving a car and the gate would have injured her even if she had been walking or riding a bicycle. We agree with plaintiffs and reverse because the forecast of evidence leaves no material dispute over the fact that plaintiffs' injuries did not \"arise out of\" the use of an automobile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Our Supreme Court has held that \"the standard of causation applicable to the ambiguous `arising out of' language . . . is one of proximate cause.\"\n   <em>\n    State Capital Ins.

North Carolina R.R.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8627040\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/253/746/#p750\">\n    253 N.C. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n    117 S.E.2d 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (1961). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendants, no material dispute exists as to the proximate cause of plaintiffs' injury. Although defendants argue that plaintiff traveled in a car at the time of the incident, they have failed to show an automobile proximate cause, i.e., any action or omission by plaintiffs' automobile that would have resulted in a person of ordinary prudence foreseeing plaintiffs' injuries. Since there is no automobile proximate cause on these facts, plaintiffs' injury did not fall within the language of Exclusion 18, and we reverse the summary judgment in favor of the Board and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Likewise, because the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in the Board's favor, it also erred in granting summary judgment in the Trust Defendants' favor, whose liability is derivative to the Board's liability. Accordingly, we reverse summary judgment in favor of the Trust Defendants and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. Judgment on the Pleadings as to the Constitutional Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants regarding the state constitutional claims and United States constitutional claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The granting of judgment on the pleadings is proper when there does not exist a genuine issue of material fact, and the only issues to be resolved are issues of law.

Plaintiffs' claims are based on their contentions that: (1) the Board has a \"policy and custom of paying some claims but not paying others, when immunity could be raised in each one,\" and (2) the Board has \"paid the property damage, but [has] asserted immunity in the remaining portion of Plaintiff's claim[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   They also seek to remedy these alleged deprivations directly under our state constitution, which states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No person shall be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the law of the land.

Upon information and belief, in the past, the Association, Trust Defendants, and The Johnston County Board of Education could have raised the doctrine of immunity on many tort claims, but chose instead, for various reasons that will be proven at trial, to pay claims even in light of the immunity defense. Upon information and belief, the Association and Trust Defendants, in conjunction with The Johnston County Board of Education, would examine each claim to see if the immunity doctrine could be raised . . . but thereafter some claims were nevertheless paid. This disparate treatment of claimholders is prohibited by the United States and North Carolina Constitutions, as well as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   44.

[Defendants'] policy and custom of paying some claims but not paying others, when immunity could be raised in each one, has played a part in the violation of federal and state law. Additionally, the Defendants' conduct in this case, of paying the property damage, and assuming liability for the claim, and then refusing to pay the personal injury and medical expense portion of the claim, is a violation of Plaintiffs' federal and state constitutional rights, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   47.

Const. art. IX, \u00a7 1. Our forefathers further provided: \"The General Assembly shall provide by taxation and otherwise for a general and uniform system of free public schools, which shall be maintained at least nine months in every year, and wherein equal opportunities shall be provided for all students.\" N.C.

Local boards of education responsibilities include the duty \"to provide adequate school systems within their respective local school administrative units.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-47(1). By statute, local boards are corporate bodies that can sue and be sued. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-40. Yet, the fact that our local school boards are corporate bodies \"does not mean that the Legislature has waived immunity from liability for torts for such boards.\"\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

It is noteworthy, however, that whether an entity has sovereign immunity under state law is not determinative of whether that entity is part of the State for purposes of federal law.

Our General Assembly propounded a state policy \"to provide from State revenue sources the instructional expenses for current operations of the public school system as defined in the standard course of study.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-408 (2005). Another constitutional provision provides that the General Assembly has authority to require local governments to contribute to the costs of education. N.C. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 2(2). In accordance with this Constitutional provision, our legislature has said, \"It is the policy of the State of North Carolina that the facilities requirements for a public education system will be met by county governments.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-408. Moreover, local school boards have authority to have taxes \"levied on [their] behalf as a school supplemental tax\" by the county. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-511.

Rather, the local school board is a corporate entity that can sue and be sued, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 115C-40, and our legislature has empowered local boards to waive sovereign immunity by obtaining insurance, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 115C-42 (2005), which the Johnston County board has done in this case. Moreover, as to the issue of maintaining the integrity of North Carolina within the federal system, we are convinced that suit against a local school board that performs \"very important, though purely local functions,\"\n   <em>\n    see Turner, supra,\n   </em>\n   and that is its own corporate body separately liable from the State will not hinder our State's integrity within the federal system.

Plaintiffs seek to remedy the injury incurred by the alleged arbitrary and unequal application of the Board's immunity. There is no adequate remedy for such conduct in a negligence action or in any other state law cause of action. Accordingly, we hold that plaintiffs have no adequate state remedy and may proceed directly under the State constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having determined that a local school board is a person within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 and that plaintiffs have no adequate state remedy preventing them from proceeding under the State constitution, we consider whether judgment on the pleadings was otherwise appropriate. In\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska v.

The opinion in\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   sets out a comprehensive legal \"roadmap\" for review of constitutional claims based on a governmental unit's settlement policies and practices. Although (1) the instant case involves a Rule 12(c) motion while\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   reviewed the trial court's ruling on a motion for JNOV, and (2) different facts are present in each case, I conclude that\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   resolves certain\n   <em>\n    legal issues\n   </em>\n   raised in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   allegations, considered singly or together, in conjunction with inferences logically drawn from these facts, do not state a claim for relief. Plaintiffs assert in paragraph No. 15 that defendants examined each claim to determine if the defense of governmental immunity would be available. Plaintiffs allege, in paragraphs Nos. 15, 45, and 46, that plaintiffs have paid damages to certain tort claimants, but would not pay plaintiffs' claim. And, in paragraphs Nos. 45 and 46, plaintiffs allege that defendants paid\n   part of their claim, but did not pay all of it. These factual allegations, taken as true, do not give rise to liability as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that by settling some claims defendants thereby \"waived\" the defense of governmental immunity, and that by refusing to offer plaintiffs a settlement, defendants were \"raising\" the defense of governmental immunity. Plaintiffs' characterization of defendants' actions is a\n   <em>\n    conclusion of law,\n   </em>\n   which the court is not required to accept as true, and is, in any event, simply an\n   <em>\n    erroneous\n   </em>\n   conclusion of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   observed that, as an affirmative defense, \"governmental immunity cannot, by definition, be raised until there is a lawsuit to defend against.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 449,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On this basis,\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   held that \"the execution of settlement contracts between a municipality and tort claimants do not constitute waivers of the affirmative defense of governmental immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This reasoning is applicable to the instant case. Accordingly, plaintiffs' allegation, that defendants may have compensated other tort claimants, does not support an inference that defendants raised the defense of immunity in response to a lawsuit, nor that they subsequently waived the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs herein also state that defendants have \"unbridled discretion\" to decide whether to settle claims. In other words, plaintiffs complain that defendants' authority over tort claims is not subject to regulation, and is constrained only by state and federal constitutional prohibitions on discrimination. Plaintiffs further assert that defendants' \"unbridled discretion\" violates their constitutional right to substantive and procedural due process. Again, this is not a statement of fact, but is a legal conclusion that need not be accepted at face value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs' position, that defendants' freedom to decide when to compensate claimants violates their constitutional rights, rests on the premise that there is a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to recover damages that cannot be abrogated without procedural due process, and that such right must be administered according to definite objective criteria. \"However, \u00a7 1983 does not create constitutional rights, and is available only to enforce constitutional rights whose source may be identified[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 452,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, plaintiffs' statement that defendants enjoy the discretion to decide when to settle claims does not support recovery unless plaintiffs also allege facts supporting an inference that they have a constitutionally protected legal right at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As discussed in\n   <em>\n    Branson,\n   </em>\n   the right to procedural due process arises only upon the existence of a constitutionally protected property right and, absent a valid waiver of governmental immunity, a plaintiff has no \"right\" to recover damages from a governmental defendant. Therefore, plaintiffs clearly have no protected property right that would give rise to procedural due process rights:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff herein claims a constitutionally protected property interest in his right to recover damages from the city. .... As discussed above, absent a waiver of governmental immunity by the purchase of liability insurance, plaintiff is barred from maintaining a lawsuit against the city. As plaintiff has no right to maintain a suit against the city, under the facts set forth in this opinion, he cannot have a \"constitutionally protected\" property right to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 453,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Inasmuch as plaintiffs have no constitutionally protected right to recover from defendants, and therefore have no procedural due process rights, defendants' freedom to exercise discretion does not support an inference that plaintiffs rights to procedural due process are being violated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [I]t is undisputed that settlement offers, if any, are in the discretion of the city.

Accordingly, the city's discretion to choose whether to settle with a claimant is not a constitutional violation of procedural due process[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Moreover, defendants' payment of damages to certain tort claimants does not constitute the granting of a \"right\" akin to a person's\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   a license issued by a\n   government zoning board or the receipt of welfare benefits. In each of these circumstances a governmental unit, although not constitutionally required to do so, has extended a right to its citizens, subject to conditions\n   <em>\n    articulated by statute or ordinance.\n   </em>\n   However, in the present case, no \"right\" to compensation is identified.

However,\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska did not hold\n   </em>\n   that, whenever a state or local governmental employee takes any action, makes a decision, or compensates a citizen for any loss, that a new \"right\" is thereby established, or that such decisions are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional if they are discretionary decisions by a government employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In the instant case, I conclude that plaintiffs failed to allege facts that would support an inference that they enjoyed a constitutionally protected right to compensation by defendants. The factual allegations of plaintiffs' complaint, reduced to their essentials, are that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   1. Defendants examine tort claims against them to ascertain the applicability of the affirmative defense of governmental immunity to the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2. Defendants customarily pay damages to some tort claimants, but not to all of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   3. Defendants have the power to decide if and how they will offer a settlement to a tort claimant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   4. Defendants paid part of the damages asserted by plaintiffs, but not the whole claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   These facts do not give rise to liability, and the remaining paragraphs from plaintiffs' complaint cited above consist of unwarranted legal conclusions that plaintiffs attempt to draw from these facts. For example, plaintiffs make the conclusory statements that defendants' conduct violates their rights to substantive due process, and that defendants violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause by denying their claim but paying damages to \"similarly situated\" claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It is true that appropriate factual allegations can support a claim of violation of Equal Protection rights, based on disparate treatment of similarly situated individuals:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [M]ost laws differentiate in some fashion between classes of persons. The Equal Protection Clause ... simply keeps governmental decision-makers from treating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Branson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9005872\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/170/438/\">\n    170 N.C.App. at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632933\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/613/259/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nordlinger v.
