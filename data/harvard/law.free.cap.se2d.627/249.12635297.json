Beginning in 1996 or 1997, plaintiff entered into an agreement with Burch Farms, Inc. (\"defendant\"), under the terms of which plaintiff would harvest his crop of sweet potatoes, and bring the crop to defendant. Thereafter, defendant would store the sweet potatoes for plaintiff, and many other farmers, and then run them through a process known as grading and packing. This process separates the potatoes based on type and quality, after which defendant would then sell the potatoes to various grocery store chains or other customers. After defendant sold what it could of plaintiff's crop, it would account to plaintiff with the proceeds from the sale, minus the administrative costs of storing and processing the produce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fall of 2000, plaintiff farmed fifty acres of sweet potatoes, and entered into an agreement with defendant as he had in prior years. In November 2000, plaintiff delivered ten thousand two hundred (10,200) bushels of sweet potatoes, which defendant stored at a leased facility in Smithfield. Plaintiff stated at trial that all of these potatoes were of good quality and were freshly harvested at the time of shipment to defendant. Defendant's primary packing and storing facility is located in Faison, North Carolina, and at the\n   time of plaintiff's shipment to defendant, the Faison facility was full. In May 2001, plaintiff shipped an additional three thousand three hundred (3,300) bushels of sweet potatoes to defendant's Faison facility. Both parties agreed upon inspection of the May 2001 shipment, that this shipment was not of marketable quality and was of no use to either party. This shipment was then \"dumped\" by defendant with plaintiff's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As defendant ran plaintiff's and other farmer's sweet potatoes through the grading and packing process, unmarketable and rotten potatoes were removed from the bushels and discarded, or \"dumped.\" Defendant regularly dumped plaintiff's and other farmer's produce if it began to rot or sprout roots while in storage, and before it could be graded and packed. Both plaintiff and Ted Burch (\"Burch\"), supervisor of defendant's packing house, testified that it was common practice in the industry for the broker, or defendant in this case, to notify the farmer if something was wrong with his crop, so that the farmer could come and look at the crop and retrieve it if he wanted to do so, prior to the broker's dumping the crop. During plaintiff's and defendant's previous dealings, defendant regularly dumped unmarketable and rotten bushels of plaintiff's sweet potato crops, with plaintiff's consent and without prior notification to plaintiff. At no time during the parties' dealings together had defendant ever had to dump plaintiff's entire sweet potato crop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the summer of 2001, defendant transported plaintiff's sweet potatoes being stored in Smithfield, to the Faison facility. Upon arrival of the potatoes, Burch testified that he immediately saw problems with the crop. Plaintiff testified that defendant informed him that the sweet potatoes would be processed shortly after their arrival at the Faison facility. In September 2001, plaintiff contacted defendant for an accounting of the ten thousand two hundred bushels of potatoes that originally had been stored in Smithfield. At this time, plaintiff was informed that defendant had dumped all of plaintiff's sweet potatoes approximately one month prior, due to the potatoes' being unmarketable and of poor quality. At no time prior to defendant's dumping plaintiff's potatoes was plaintiff notified that there was a problem with his crop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant provided a letter to plaintiff stating that plaintiff's crop of sweet potatoes for the year 2000 was of poor quality as a result of weather conditions, and therefore plaintiff's potatoes were unmarketable and were dumped by defendant. With this letter, plaintiff submitted an application to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), for compensation through the Quality Loss Program, which was designed to compensate farmers for cases in which their crop yield was low or unmarketable. Plaintiff received twenty-three thousand four hundred and eighty-four dollars ($23,484.00) in compensation from the USDA, representing compensation for only a portion of plaintiff's entire 2000 sweet potato crop, at only a fraction of the usual market price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 30 August 2002, plaintiff filed a complaint in Richmond County Superior Court alleging various claims against defendant. Plaintiff's complaint alleged claims for breach of contract and negligence on the part of a bailee. At trial, both parties testified along with several other farmers and employees of defendant. At the close of plaintiff's evidence, defendant made a motion for directed verdict on both of plaintiff's claims. The trial court denied defendant's motion as to the breach of contract claim, and granted the motion on the bailment claim, thereby dismissing plaintiff's bailment claim. The jury returned a verdict finding that defendant had breached its oral contract with plaintiff, and awarded plaintiff damages in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). The trial court then made findings of fact regarding the compensation plaintiff received from the federal government, and proceeded to grant defendant a set-off against plaintiff's damages award in the total amount of twenty-one thousand six hundred fifteen dollars and thirty cents ($21,615.30). From the jury verdict and award of damages to the plaintiff, defendant appeals. Plaintiff cross appeals on the trial court's dismissal of the bailment claim and the reduction of the damages awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's first assignment of error concerns the trial court's instructions to the jury\n   regarding the requirements of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\"PACA\") for dumping perishable agricultural commodities. Defendant contends the instruction on PACA's requirements constituted reversible error in that PACA was not applicable in the present case, as plaintiff's case was one in state court for a breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record demonstrates that before the trial court instructed the jury, a charge conference was held with the attorneys representing both parties. At the charge conference, the court advised the attorneys as to how and what it was going to instruct the jury on the issue of PACA and dumping. Defendant objected to the proposed instruction on PACA's requirements, and his objection was denied. After the jury was instructed, the trial court asked both parties, outside the presence of the jury, if either of them had any objections or requests for additional instructions. Neither party objected to the instructions as they were given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"`Rule 10(b)(2) of our Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring objection to the charge before the jury retires is mandatory and not merely directory.'\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank v.

On appeal, plaintiff now contends that defendant failed to preserve his right to appeal on the instructions to the jury, as defendant failed to object to the instructions before the jury retired to deliberate. Our Supreme Court has held, and we reiterate, that when a party has objected to proposed jury instructions during a charge conference, and the trial court has considered and denied the request, that the party need not repeat its objections after the jury charge is given.\n   <em>\n    Wall v.

Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when it has no commercial value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A clear and complete record shall be maintained showing justification for dumping of produce received on consignment if any portion of such produce cannot be sold due to poor condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the foregoing, if five percent or more of a shipment is dumped,\n   an official certificate or other adequate evidence shall be obtained to prove the produce is actually without commercial value, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The language used in the trial court's instruction was taken directly from PACA regulations found at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(3) (2005), 7 C.F.R. 46.22 (2005), and 7 C.F.R. 46.23 (2005). At trial, defendant testified that he was required to abide by the regulations and requirements of PACA, and that he was a licensed and bonded broker. During the charge conference, the trial court stated that it recognized that the requirements of PACA essentially were accounting procedures, however, the trial court confirmed that defendant still had obligations to plaintiff through PACA in that 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499e of PACA states that \"[i]f any broker violates any provision of section 2 [of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b regarding unfair conduct and unreasonable rejection of the perishable agricultural commodity], he shall be liable to the person thereby injured for the full amount of damages.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(a) (2005). Based on this section of PACA, the trial court determined that the jury was entitled to be instructed on defendant's obligations under the federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In reviewing the jury instruction in its entirety, we can see that the trial court instructed the jury fully and completely on defendant's obligations to plaintiff under both the federal law and the oral contract between the parties. The trial court instructed the jury not only on the requirements of PACA, but also on the issues of course of performance and course of dealings between the parties. The court instructed the jury that the parties had stipulated to the fact that an oral contract existed between the parties, and the court also fully instructed the jury regarding what constitutes a breach of a contract. It was therefore properly left to the jury to determine whether defendant satisfied its contractual duties with plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Therefore, we hold the trial court's instruction on the requirements of PACA, when considered in the context of the entire jury charge, did not serve to mislead the jury, and was a proper explanation of the applicable law. There was sufficient evidence presented to support the jury's finding that defendant breached its contract with plaintiff, and thus the trial court's instruction did not adversely affect the jury's verdict or mislead the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant next contends the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict on plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, the standard of review on a motion for directed verdict \"is whether, `upon examination of all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and that party being given the benefit of every reasonable inference drawn therefrom, the evidence is sufficient to be submitted to the jury.'\"\n   <em>\n    Stamm v.

Instead, plaintiff's breach of contract claim is based upon defendant's failure to notify and account to plaintiff prior to dumping plaintiff's entire sweet potato crop, and denying plaintiff the opportunity to retrieve his crop and mitigate his damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, we hold there was sufficient evidence to take plaintiff's breach of\n   contract claim to the jury. The testimony and evidence presented at trial showed that plaintiff delivered three thousand three hundred (3,300) bushels of sweet potatoes to defendant, which both parties agreed were unmarketable. Plaintiff also delivered an additional ten thousand two hundred (10,200) bushels which plaintiff testified were marketable at the time of delivery to defendant. These ten thousand two hundred bushels were dumped by defendant, without notice or an accounting to plaintiff prior to the dumping. Both plaintiff and Ted Burch, supervisor of defendant's warehouse and packing process, testified concerning the oral agreement between the parties. Both testified that the oral agreement was that defendant would provide storage for plaintiff's sweet potato crop, and would pack and sell the potatoes that were of marketable quality. Both parties also testified that the standard procedure in the industry was that a pack house, such as defendant, would notify the farmer if there was something wrong with their produce, giving the farmer the opportunity to come and retrieve his produce before it was dumped. Both parties also testified that in their past course of dealing, defendant would dump plaintiff's unmarketable produce without first notifying plaintiff and with plaintiff's consent. However, never before had defendant had to dump plaintiff's entire sweet potato crop. There was conflicting testimony from plaintiff's and defendant's witnesses regarding the quality of plaintiff's sweet potatoes at the time they were delivered to defendant's storage facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The evidence presented by both parties creates an issue of fact concerning the terms of the parties' contract and the marketability of plaintiff's crop, which are questions properly left for the jury to determine.\n   <em>\n    See Goeckel v.

This rule is punitive in nature, and is intended to prevent the tortfeasor from a windfall when a portion of the plaintiff's damages have been paid by a collateral source. In this State, and many others, the collateral source rule typically is applied only in actions arising under tort law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff's compensation through the Quality Loss Program was for the damage done to his crop and his lost yield, as a result of the drought, while his claim against defendant was for the destruction of his potatoes. The USDA Quality Loss Program was enacted with the purpose of compensating farmers who suffered yield or quality loss due to weather-related disasters. Since the USDA payments and the jury's verdict were compensation for different losses suffered by plaintiff, we hold the collateral source rule is inapplicable in the instant case, and the trial court should not have allowed a set-off from the damages plaintiff was awarded. The payment plaintiff received from the Quality Loss Program compensated plaintiff for an entirely different loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff alleged defendant dumped plaintiff's sweet potatoes without notifying him, in breach of their contract. After hearing evidence, over plaintiff's objection, of the Quality Loss payment to plaintiff, the jury agreed that defendant breached the contract and awarded plaintiff fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). As the compensation provided to plaintiff under the Quality Loss Program was compensation for a different loss than that found by the jury, we hold the trial court erred when it granted defendant a set-off for the compensation plaintiff received from the USDA Quality Loss Program. Our holding in the instant case is limited to the unique facts presented by this case, and therefore we decline to address the issue of whether the collateral source rule should apply generally to a breach of contract situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for directed\n   verdict and dismissing plaintiff's bailment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our Supreme Court has held that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [t]he standard of review for a motion for directed verdict is whether the evidence, considered in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, is sufficient to be submitted to the jury.

Defendant contends that plaintiff expected an accounting of the sweet potatoes, or the proceeds from their sale, and thus the specific property\n   was not to be returned to plaintiff.
