Gen.Stat. \u00a7 113A-50\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (1999). HRA disputed the penalty and filed a contested case petition on 3 April 2000. In October 2000, the North Carolina Shellfish Growers Association (\"Shellfish Growers\") and the North Carolina Coastal Federation (\"Coastal Federation\") moved to intervene. In November 2000, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") granted the motion to intervene, over HRA's objection. On 20 December 2001, the ALJ affirmed a reduced penalty and on 29 April 2002, DENR adopted the ALJ's recommended decision as its final agency decision. HRA appealed in Superior Court in New Hanover County. On 5 September 2003, the court affirmed DENR's final agency decision. HRA appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case involves 1262 acres of land in Onslow County owned by HRA (\"the tract\"). The tract fronts on and adjoins the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (\"AIWW\") near Stump Sound. The tract drains directly to the AIWW and to Cypress Branch, a stream that forms the southern boundary of much of the tract. Cypress Branch, a perennial stream and tributary of Batts Mill Creek, flows into the AIWW. The tract, which is located on the mainland across the AIWW and Stump Sound from the resort community\n   of Topsail Island, is largely forested and contains substantial wetlands acreage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the 1950's, Edgar Yow assembled the tract and owned a 50% interest, with the remaining interest divided equally between two other individuals. During the 1960's and 70's, the owners constructed a lake on the property and converted some of the agricultural fields to forest. Small stands of timber were cut, some to clear land for the lake, and proceeds from the timber harvesting were used to pay for the lake and dam construction, as well as for property taxes and other expenses associated with owning the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1983, Westminster Company, a Weyerhauser subsidiary devoted to developing residential subdivisions, purchased the tract. In 1986, Lionel Yow (Edgar Yow's son), Henry E. Miller, Jr., and Weyerhauser entered into a joint venture agreement to acquire the tract and \"maintain[], operat[e], and develop[] thereon a resort residential community.\" The joint venturers formed HRA, a partnership, \"to acquire, manage, maintain and develop\" the tract. In 1986, HRA had development layouts prepared for the tract, depicting potential residential and recreational development of the entire tract. HRA used the layouts as a sales tool with prospective buyers. Mr. Yow participated in numerous other development projects in nearby coastal communities during the late 1980's and early 1990's. In 1995, he requested that an engineering firm send copies of the 1986 development drawings to a potential buyer. In 1996, Hurricanes Bertha and Fran struck the North Carolina coast in the vicinity of the tract, damaging timber and washing out unpaved roads on the property. At the suggestion of Corbett Lumber Company, HRA engaged Corbett to remove damaged timber from the tract in 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 1997, HRA hired regulatory and environmental consultants to plan and execute a ditch excavation project. Neither consultant had any forestry experience and did not provide clients with advice or expertise concerning timber management. By November 1998, the tract had 17 major ditches or systems of ditches, comprising approximately 8 miles over a 34-acre area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 1999, after receiving a report of potential violations from the North Carolina Division of Water Quality, two Division of Land Resources (\"DLR\") employees inspected the tract. They found numerous violations of the SPCA, including inadequate erosion control devices for the steep ditches. On 3 March 1999, DENR issued a notice of violation of the SPCA. The NOV specified corrective actions necessary to bring the tract into compliance and warned that civil penalties could be assessed if the violations were not corrected within 30 days. On 23 April 1999, DLR returned to the site for a follow-up inspection and observed the same violations as before. DENR issued a notice of continuing violations on 28 April 1999. On 9 July 1999, having still received no submission of the required and previously requested erosion and sedimentation control plan, and having received no notice from HRA that the other violations had been corrected, DENR assessed a penalty of $32,100 for the following violations: failure to submit an erosion and sedimentation control plan for the project, failure to take reasonable measures to protect from damage by land-disturbing activities (not taking measures to control erosion and retain sediment), exposed slopes too steep to maintain ground cover and without other adequate erosion control devices, and failure within fifteen days of grading to have ground cover or other sufficient erosion control devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, HRA submitted an erosion and sedimentation control plan which was ultimately disapproved due to deficiencies. On 10 November 1999, after another inspection, DENR sent HRA a notice of additional violations, which described new, as well as continuing, violations. After another inspection, DENR sent HRA a notice of continuing violations on 5 January 2000, as the earlier violations had not been corrected. On 5 March 2000, DENR assessed further civil penalties totaling $118,000 for violations of the SPCA. In its contested case petition, HRA claimed that its activities were exempt from the SPCA pursuant to a forestry exception. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 113A-52.01 (1999). Before, during and after the excavation and agency enforcement process, HRA had not claimed that the ditching was being carried\n   out for forestry purposes; it made this assertion for the first time in its petition for contested case hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") applies to this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Watkins v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As HRA contends legal error, we conclude that the superior court correctly chose to apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review. Thus, we must determine whether the court did so properly. HRA argues that there are three requirements for intervening as a party here: standing, Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\") Rule 3.0117, and Civil Procedure Rule 24. As our legislature has provided explicit statutory provisions governing intervention in a contested case petition, we conclude that this case must be analyzed pursuant to these provisions, rather than under the more general rules governing civil procedure. \"The Rules of Civil Procedure as contained in G.S. 1A-1 . . . shall apply in contested cases in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH)\n   <em>\n    unless another specific statute or rule of the Office of Administrative Hearings provides otherwise.\"\n   </em>\n   26 N.C.A.C. 3.0101() (emphasis added). N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-23(d) (1999) governs intervention in a contested case petition:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Any person may petition to become a party by filing a motion to intervene in the manner provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 24. In addition,\n   <em>\n    any person interested in a contested case may intervene and participate in that proceeding to the extent deemed appropriate by the administrative law judge.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20S.E.2d%20272\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The N.C. Supreme Court has interpreted N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-23(d) as granting \"discretionary intervention [] without limitation. . . and . . . provid[ing] intervention broader than the permissive intervention under Rule 24.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8562668\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/300/460/#p468\">\n    300 N.C. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=269%20S.E.2d%20538\">\n    269 S.E.2d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (1980).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   HRA propounds a strained interpretation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-23(d), asserting that the first and second sentences of\n   the statute should be read separately and that the discretion of the second sentence applies only to persons intervening with rights less than those of non-parties, but not to persons who intervene as a \"party\" under the first sentence. Here, intervenors were granted intervention as parties. HRA contends that those intervening as parties, under the first sentence of the statute, are subject to the all of the requirements of Rule 24. We find nothing in the plain language of the statute to suggest that our legislature intended such a reading. Although the first sentence mentions Rule 24, it states only that parties must file \"in the manner\" of Rule 24, which plainly refers to procedural, not substantive, requirements. As the Court did in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau,\n   </em>\n   we conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 150B-23(d) gives OAH broad discretion to allow intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, while discretionary intervention under section 150B-23(d) is broader than that under Rule 24, OAH Rule 3.0117 imposes requirements for intervention in contested cases similar to those in Rule 24, including the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) Any person not named in the notice of hearing who desires to intervene in a contested case as a party shall file a timely motion to intervene and shall serve the motion upon all existing parties. Timeliness will be determined by the administrative law judge in each case based on circumstances at the time of filing. The motion\n   <em>\n    shall show how the movant's rights, duties, or privileges may be determined or affected by the contested case; shall show how the movant may be directly affected by the outcome\n   </em>\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (d) The administrative law judge\n   <em>\n    shall allow intervention upon a proper showing under this Rule, unless the administrative law judge finds that the movant's interest is adequately represented by one or more parties participating in the case\n   </em>\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   26 N.C.A.C. 3.0117 (1999) (emphasis added). HRA asserts that intervenors' interests are no more than \"an interest common to all persons,\" and are not separate from the interests of DENR. HRA also argues that intervenors have no interest in a civil penalty assessment against it. But as HRA claimed exemption from the erosion control requirements of the SPCA in its contested case petition, the issue of whether HRA would be exempt from SPCA was also at issue here. Indeed, in their motion to intervene, intervenors stressed that the important issue to them was whether HRA would qualify for the forestry exemption of the SPCA. The superior court found that the following findings made in the recommended decision adequately described the intervening parties:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3. The Respondent-Intervenor North Carolina Shellfish Growers Association (\"NCSGA\") is a private, non-profit association founded in 1995 to represent the interests of the many North Carolinians involved in the shellfish industry. NCSGA has 82 members who include shellfish farmers, hatchery operators, seafood dealers, educators and researchers.\n   <em>\n    Members of NCSGA own and maintain shellfish production leases in Stump Sound and surrounding coastal waters, including in the vicinity of the Holly Ridge tract. Jim Swartzenberg, President of NCSGA, along with his wife, Bonnie, leases 37 acres of waters in Stump Sound for oyster production and assists in management and production of oysters from over 100 additional acres in Stump Sound.\n   </em>\n   (Affidavit of Jim Swartzenberg, submitted with Motion to Intervene). NCSGA is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against HRA arising out of the same facts and circumstances as this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   4. Respondent-Intervenor North Carolina Coastal Federation is a non-profit tax-exempt organization dedicated to the promotion of better stewardship of coastal resources. The Coastal Federation was founded in 1982 and\n   <em>\n    has approximately 5,000 members who live near, shellfish or fish in, or regularly visit, Stump Sound and nearby coastal waters.\n   </em>\n   The Coastal Federation has worked to protect water quality in Stump Sound and in the vicinity of the Holly Ridge tract and has investigated, documented, publicized, and sought government enforcement of violations of state and federal sedimentation, stormwater, water quality, and wetlands laws in connection with ditch excavation which occurred\n   in southeastern North Carolina during 1998 and 1999, including at the Morris Landing tract. (Affidavit of Todd Miller).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (emphasis added). These findings, and the superior court's decision to adopt them, were not challenged on appeal and thus are conclusive.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. N.C.

Furthermore, in his affidavit which was submitted with the motion to intervene, Jim Swartzenberg, president of Shellfish Growers, stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   10. Ditching and draining of tracts of land located in close proximity to shellfish waters can, if sediment controls are not fully implemented, result in excessive turbidity and sediment being transported by surface water and stormwater to shellfish waters, jeopardizing those waters and causing the waters to be closed to the taking of shellfish for human consumption. Additionally, the silting-in of the oyster beds can lead to mortality of planted oysters prior to their reaching market size. Waters that contain excessive silt can also affect the propagation of oysters and interfere with the natural spatfall causing a reduction of naturally set oysters. (Spatfall is the process by which the young oyster attaches itself to stable substances on the bottom). Reduction of spatfall can have a devastating effect on the production of lease-raised oysters because leaseholders regularly plant cultch (oyster shells and marl) to recruit wild spat into their leases. Similarly, inadequately controlled stormwater runoff from ditched and drained coastal properties can transmit excessive levels of fecal coliform bacteria to shellfishing waters, resulting in closure of those waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   11. Stump Sound select oysters raised in shellfish leases in the vicinity of the Holly Ridge tract traditionally command a premium price because of their superior fullness and flavor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that intervenors' interests may be directly affected by the outcome of the contested case here. We further conclude that intervenors' interests in having the SPCA erosion requirements apply to HRA are separate from the penalties assessed against HRA by DENR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Empire Power Co. v.

Then, on 25 July 2001, four business days before the scheduled hearing, DENR delivered supplemental discovery responses, including designation of two witnesses and 102 pages of documents. The new witnesses were both employees of DENR's Division of Forest Resources (\"DFR\") and the documents were related to their involvement in evaluating the tract. HRA asserts that the ALJ should not have allowed respondents to submit this supplemental discovery because it was untimely. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-33 gives an ALJ power to rule on all objections to discovery and to \"regulate the course of the hearing, including discovery.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-33(b)(3) &amp; (4) (1999). The OAH rule governing discovery provides that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (e) All discovery shall be completed\n   <em>\n    no later than the first day of the contested case hearing.\n   </em>\n   An administrative law judge\n   <em>\n    may shorten or lengthen the period for discovery\n   </em>\n   and adjust hearing dates accordingly and, when necessary,\n   <em>\n    allow discovery during the pendency of the contested case hearing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   26 N.C.A.C. 3.0112 (emphasis added).

We conclude that as HRA asserted that it was exempt from the SPCA because of forestry practices, and there was a history of DFR's involvement in investigating HRA's claims, of which HRA was aware, DENR did not present a new theory which unfairly surprised HRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   HRA also contends that the ALJ improperly permitted intervenors to present evidence jointly with DENR because the ALJ thus improperly considered evidence admitted through the testimony of witnesses called by the intervenors in determining whether respondents met their burden of proof. HRA asserts that this was both an error of law, and arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the superior court reviewed the issue regarding the burden of proof\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and the question of the arbitrariness and capriciousness of the ALJ's regulation of the course of the hearing under the whole record test. Our review of the law and the record indicates that the superior court correctly affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, the parties attended a pretrial conference pursuant to OAH Rule 3.0108, and stipulated that \"Respondent and Respondent-Intervenors shall present evidence first.\" Another paragraph in the pretrial order, regarding witnesses, states that, \"Respondent and Respondent-Intervenors will call witnesses jointly.\" On appeal, HRA contends that they only stipulated that both parties would be permitted to introduce evidence. However, the pretrial order was signed by all parties after the first day of trial, when respondents and intervenors had already begun to present evidence jointly. Moreover, respondents' and intervenors' counsel stated at the outset of the hearing that they intended to put on a joint case. The transcript further reflects that the joint presentation of evidence proceeded for three days before HRA objected. Thus, we conclude that by stipulating to this procedure, and by participating in it for three days without complaint, HRA waived this objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   HRA also asserts that the ALJ and superior court improperly based their decisions on a \"substantial evidence\" standard and that the ALJ failed to weigh the evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We first conclude that the superior court here properly chose to review this matter\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   as the standard of review or proof is a matter of law. We must now determine whether the superior court exercised this review correctly. The ALJ concluded that \"[t]he applicable version of the Administrative Procedure Act directs that the decision in this contested case must be supported by substantial evidence,\" and that \"[s]ubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" In the applicable version of the APA, a final agency decision \"shall be supported by substantial evidence.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-36(b) (1999). Thus, when the ALJ stated this as the law, it was a correct statement. HRA contends, though, that the ALJ improperly applied this substantial evidence standard of review rather than applying an appropriate standard of proof. It argues that the \"substantial evidence\" standard governs review of the\n   <em>\n    agency\n   </em>\n   decision, not the ALJ's, and that the ALJ was required to apply a weighing standard of proof. \"Our Supreme Court has stated that the standard of proof in administrative matters is by the greater weight of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillingham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239996\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/132/704/#p708\">\n    132 N.C.App. at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20S.E.2d%20823\">\n    513 S.E.2d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, we conclude that there is no conflict between the application of an evidentiary standard requiring that a decision be based on substantial evidence and a requirement that a party must persuade the fact-finder by the greater weight of the evidence. Furthermore, our careful review of the record reveals that the ALJ considered and carefully weighed the evidence, making unusually detailed findings of fact, specific credibility determinations, and addressing petitioner's contentions. Thus, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   HRA next argues that the superior court erred in affirming the ALJ and Agency decisions because the burden of proof was improperly placed upon HRA, the statutory exemption for forestry activities was misread, and DENR was not required to adhere to its own interagency policies. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The SPCA does not apply to \"[a]ctivities undertaken on forestland for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products,\" as long as they are conducted in compliance with DENR best management practices. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 113A-52.01 (2) (1999). The ALJ required HRA to prove that this exception applied and HRA contends that this was legal error. The superior court thus properly reviewed this argument\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   We conclude that it did so correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   HRA contends that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 113A-64(a)(1) (1999) allocates the burden of proof to DENR to prove both that the SPCA applies and that there was a violation. N.C.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 150B-23(a). Accordingly, we overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   HRA argues next that the ALJ and superior court misinterpreted the SPCA forestry exemption. Because this involved a question of law, the Superior Court correctly reviewed it\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   HRA challenges conclusion of law 15 of the recommended decision:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In assessing whether land-disturbing activities undertaken on forestland were undertaken `for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products,' the purposes for which the activities were conducted and the objective nature of those activities must be evaluated. The fact that a landowner may have a history of management activities and uses of the land involving timber production is not by itself determinative, nor is the fact that timber may have been cut in connection with the land-disturbing activities. Land-disturbing activities undertaken on forestland to prepare the property for development, to improve the marketability of the property for development, or\n   <em>\n    to generally improve drainage of the property are not activities which qualify for the SPCA's forestry exemption.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (emphasis added). HRA contends that the italicized language above added a limitation to the exemption which is not supported by the statute, as the assertion that activities undertaken to \"generally improve drainage,\" could refer to those undertaken to improve timber production and operations. We disagree. The SPCA forestry exemption, on its face, applies to activities specifically undertaken \"for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products,\" not to drainage activities for other purposes, such as general improvement of drainage. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 113A-52.01(2) (1999). We overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, HRA argues that the ALJ erred in concluding that DENR was not required to follow its written memoranda on forestry operations. HRA asserts that this was legal error. Accordingly, the Superior Court reviewed the matter\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   and we conclude that it did so correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   DLR and DFR, both subdivisions of DENR, entered into Memoranda of Agreement in 1989 and 1992, in which they agreed to a joint approach in implementing the forestry exemption of the SPCA. DLR agreed to refer potential violations of forestry activity to DFR and DFR stated that it would attempt to mitigate and correct the problems with the responsible party and to take no further action if the violation was cured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   HRA contends that these policies are rules, and that DENR was thus required to follow them. We disagree. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-2 (1999) states that the following are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   rules:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   a.

They do not attempt to define statutory language, to impose additional obligations upon landowners, or to alter the terms of the exemption in any way. Rather, they describe internal agency procedures for applying the forestry exemption, and, as such, are not rules.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Ford v. State, Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-2 (8a)(c) and (g), and was not a rule). Furthermore, it is undisputed that these documents were not promulgated as rules. Accordingly, they are not enforceable by HRA, or by the agencies, as rules. We overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   HRA also contends that even if the memoranda do not constitute rules, DENR's failure to follow them was arbitrary and capricious. The Superior Court correctly reviewed this argument under the whole record test and concluded that the ALJ and agency correctly decided that even though the memoranda did not constitute rules, the agencies substantially complied with the memoranda. Our review also indicates that the agency's conclusions regarding this matter are supported by substantial evidence of record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-84\">\n   JACKSON, Judge, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons stated below, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Initially, Petitioner argues that it was legal error for the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") to allow the North Carolina Shellfish Growers Association (\"Shellfish Growers\") and the North Carolina Coastal Federation (\"Coastal Federation\")to intervene in this matter.

In the case of a state agency's imposition of a civil penalty, I believe that it is not. Further, my research has disclosed no case law in this State nor in any other state jurisdiction allowing intervention by a private individual or entity in a matter involving imposition of a civil penalty by a state.\n   <em>\n    But see Sanders et al. v.
