Krispen Culbertson, Attorney (\"defendant\") appeals from order and admonition of the Disciplinary Hearing Committee of the North Carolina State Bar (\"DHC\") admonishing him for using false or misleading communications in violation of the North Carolina Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is a duly licensed and practicing attorney in Greensboro and was admitted to practice as a member of the North Carolina State Bar (\"State Bar\") in 1991. In November 2004, the State Bar filed a complaint against defendant alleging he violated the North Carolina Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. The complaint alleged defendant's law office letterhead contained an asterisk beside his name. Below defendant's name is printed another asterisk and the phrase, \"Published in Federal Reports, 3d Series\" surrounded by parentheses. The complaint also alleged defendant is described on the firm's website as \"also one of the elite percentage of attorneys to be published in Federal Law Reports - the large law books that contain the controlling caselaw [sic] of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This matter was heard before the DHC on 27 January 2005. The DHC concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Culbertson's conduct, as set out above, constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 84-28(a) &amp; (b)(2) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) By using letterhead stationery that indicates that he is published in Federal Reports, 3d Series when only opinions issued by the Court are published in the Federal Reports, Culbertson used letterhead that made a false or misleading communication about the lawyer in violation of Revised Rules 7.1 and 7.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) By maintaining a website that states that \"[he] is also\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     one of the elite percentage of attorneys to be published in Federal Law Reports\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   - the large law books that contain the controlling caselaw [sic] of the United States\" when only opinions of the Court are published in the Federal Reports, Culbertson maintained a website that made a false or misleading communication about the lawyer in violation of Revised Rules 7.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The DHC concluded and ordered, \"Culbertson's conduct warrants discipline because Culbertson's choice of the misleading language on his letterhead and website was intentional. However, because Culbertson's violation of the rules was a minor violation, it warrants only an admonition.\" Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues the DHC erred by: (1) concluding his statements that he was \"published in Federal Law Reports, 3d Series\" were false or misleading; and (2) issuing an admonition rather than a less serious sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    III.

First, defendant's statement professes he is a member of an \"elite percentage\" of attorneys who have been \"published\" in the Federal Reporter. Admission to practice before the United States Courts of Appeal does not depend upon a licensed attorney's ability. Any licensed attorney who is in good standing may move to be admitted upon application to appear before these courts. Fed. R.App. P. 46(a) (2005) (\"An attorney is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of appeals if that attorney is of good moral and professional character and is admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States, the highest court of a state, another United States court of appeals, or a United States district court[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, defendant's statement on his website states that the Federal Reporters are \"the large law books that contain the controlling caselaw [sic] of the United States.\" The opinions of a federal Court of Appeals are controlling precedent on the cases before it and on the cases heard within the Circuit in which the Court sits, but are not the \"controlling caselaw [sic] of the United States.\" The Supreme Court of the United States routinely reviews and decides cases reaching conflicting interpretations of the law from the United States Courts of Appeal.\n   <em>\n    See, e. g., Dooley v.
