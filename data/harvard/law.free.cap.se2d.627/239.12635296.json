For the reasons set forth below, we (1) affirm the adjudication order in part, reverse in part, and remand in part for further findings; and (2) we vacate and remand the commitment order and the order denying release of the juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Juvenile petitions were filed on 14 July 2004 alleging that J.L.B.M. (the juvenile) was delinquent in that he committed the following acts: (1) set fire to, burned, or caused to be burned a government building in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-59; (2) damaged real property in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-127; (3) resisted, delayed, and obstructed an officer in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-223; and (4) carried a concealed weapon in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-269(a1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Evidence at the hearing tended to show the following: While on patrol at approximately 6:00 p.m. on 6 July 2004, Officer D.H. Henderson (Officer Henderson) responded to a police dispatch of a \"suspicious person\" at an Exxon gas station in Burlington, North Carolina. The only description given of the person was \"Hispanic male.\" Officer Henderson saw a person in the gas station parking lot, later identified as the juvenile, who fit the description of the person. When the juvenile saw Officer Henderson, he walked over to a vehicle in the parking lot, spoke to someone, and then began walking away from Officer Henderson's patrol car. Officer Henderson pulled up beside the juvenile in an adjoining restaurant parking lot and stopped the juvenile. Upon getting out of the patrol car and speaking with the juvenile, Officer Henderson noticed a bulge in the juvenile's pocket. Officer Henderson patted down the juvenile for weapons. Officer Henderson found and seized a dark blue, half-empty spray can of paint and a box cutter with an open blade. In response to being asked his name, the juvenile replied, \"Oscar Lopez.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Henderson transported the juvenile to a nearby shopping center where graffiti had recently been sprayed. Officer Henderson testified that the graffiti, which was blue, read: \"Sir 13, Mr. Puppet 213.\" Officer Henderson testified that the juvenile\n   initially said that \"Mr. Puppet\" had done the graffiti, and that the juvenile later identified himself as \"Mr. Puppet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Henderson drove the juvenile to the police station, again patted him down, and found fireworks in the juvenile's pocket. Officer Henderson let the juvenile keep the fireworks. The juvenile was placed in an interview room, where several officers questioned him about his name. The juvenile continued to give the name \"Oscar Lopez.\" Officer Wendy P. Jordan (Officer Jordan) recognized the juvenile's face and called him by his real name, \"J____.\" The juvenile replied, \"[M]y name is J____ L____ mother f____ M____. You found me out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The juvenile was eventually left alone in the interview room with the door ajar. Officer R.V. Marsh (Officer Marsh) testified that he noticed the room \"got real quiet,\" and he looked into the room. Officer Marsh saw the juvenile trying to light something with a lighter, then saw a two to three-foot flame come out of the floor and up the wall. Officer Jordan testified that she saw sparks flying. The fireworks left black soot on the floor and wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The juvenile presented no evidence. At the close of the hearing, the juvenile made a motion to dismiss, which was denied by the trial court. The trial court adjudicated the juvenile delinquent and entered a disposition committing the juvenile to a period of indefinite commitment. The juvenile appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The juvenile argues more than a dozen assignments of error on appeal, which we will discuss as four issues: whether the trial court erred by (I) denying the juvenile's motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of the juvenile; (II) denying the juvenile's motion to dismiss each allegation; (III) failing to include a maximum term of commitment in the written order of commitment; and (IV) failing to state in writing the compelling reasons for denying the juvenile's release pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We note that at the same time as the trial court entered its disposition order on the four offenses discussed herein, it revoked the juvenile's probation for three prior offenses. Arguably, the juvenile assigned error to this order, but failed to argue it in his brief. As such, it is deemed abandoned. N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The juvenile first argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained after the juvenile was stopped and searched by Officer Henderson. The juvenile contends there were insufficient grounds for stopping the juvenile, and therefore any evidence obtained as a result of the stop was inadmissible and should have been suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A trial court's findings of fact made after a suppression hearing are binding on the appellate courts if supported by competent evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Officer Henderson, a 27 year veteran of the Burlington Police Dept. had received a call of a suspicious activity at Coy's Exxon on the corner of Graham-Hopedale Rd. and N. Church St. That location has had numerous calls for shoplifting[,] fights[,] and other activity. Also there is numerous gang and graffiti activity at that end of town. The call was for a suspicious person being a Hispanic male. The officer went specifically to that location and the juvenile matches the description of being a Hispanic male[,] and[,] according to the officer's testimony, he was wearing gang attire, large baggy clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We uphold the trial court's findings, with the exception of the finding that the dispatch call was about \"suspicious activity,\" because Officer Henderson testified that the dispatch was about a \"suspicious person\" at the Exxon gas station. Officer Henderson testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A[T]he [dispatch] call was a suspicious person at the [Exxon] station at the\n   corner of Graham-Hopedale and Church Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Q What time of the day or night was that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A It was right before 6 o'clock p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A ...

Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Q And nothing [criminal] in particular with [regard to] [the juvenile] that you know of?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A Other than he was wearing gang attire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Q What kind of attire was that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A Large baggy clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Q Is that it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A I guess that's it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The trial court further found there was a \"reasonable, [articulable] suspicion that some criminal activity may have taken place\" and distinguished the present case from\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree. We have held that the stop of the juvenile was unreasonable and that evidence obtained as a result of the illegal stop should have been suppressed by the trial court. Such evidence includes the box cutter found by Officer Henderson in the juvenile's pants pocket. Other than the illegally obtained box cutter, and Officer Henderson's testimony about its seizure, the State presented no evidence to support the allegation of carrying a concealed weapon. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the juvenile's motion to dismiss this allegation, as there was insufficient admissible evidence that the juvenile was carrying a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The juvenile also challenges the sufficiency of the State's evidence of the allegation of injury to real property. This argument has some merit. At trial, the State presented evidence of a spray can of paint obtained by Officer Henderson during his stop of the juvenile. We have held that\n   Officer Henderson's stop of the juvenile was unreasonable. Therefore, the spray can of paint should have been suppressed by the trial court, and cannot be used to support this allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Along with the spray can of paint, the State introduced evidence of the juvenile's statement that \"Mr. Puppet\" had sprayed the graffiti, and evidence of the juvenile's confession that he was in fact \"Mr. Puppet.\" Officer Henderson testified that at the scene of the graffiti, he \"had a conversation with\" the juvenile, and the juvenile stated that \"Mr. Puppet\" had sprayed the graffiti.

[the juvenile] admitted that he was Mr. Puppet.\" Moreover, there is insufficient evidence in the record on this issue, with no testimony as to whether the juvenile was in custody or being interrogated when he allegedly stated that \"Mr. Puppet\" had painted the graffiti. There is no testimony as to when exactly the juvenile admitted to being \"Mr. Puppet,\" or under what circumstances he made such an admission. The only evidence of the juvenile's admission is the testimony of Officer Henderson that during a \"conversation\" about the graffiti, the juvenile told him \"Mr. Puppet\" had done it, and \"[l]ater at the police department, [the juvenile] identified himself as Mr. Puppet.\" Accordingly, we cannot discern whether the juvenile's admissions were made in response to custodial interrogation in violation of the juvenile's constitutional and statutory rights.

In the present case, the petition alleged that the juvenile resisted, delayed, and obstructed Officer Henderson by giving a false name at the time Officer Henderson was conducting an investigation. The trial court found that by insisting his name was \"Oscar Lopez,\" the juvenile delayed Officer Henderson's investigation of the offenses of injury to real property and carrying a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The juvenile argues that since Officer Henderson's stop was invalid, the juvenile was within his right to give a false name. We disagree and hold that the invalid stop did not give the juvenile license to subsequently lie about his identity to Officer Henderson.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v. Miller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8568083\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/282/633/#p641\">\n    282 N.C. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=194%20S.E.2d%20353\">\n    194 S.E.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358 (1973) (holding that a defendant was not excused for his subsequent criminal behavior even though police entered the premises on an invalid search warrant). The juvenile argues the well-established rule that a person has the right to resist an illegal arrest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., State v. McGowan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8625534\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/243/431/\">\n    243 N.C. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20S.E.2d%20703\">\n    90 S.E.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956);\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the facts of the present case are distinguishable from the line of cases dealing with illegal arrest. In\n   <em>\n    Hewson,\n   </em>\n   for example, this Court held that a motion to dismiss a charge of resisting arrest should have been granted where the underlying arrest was illegal, because a lawful arrest was a necessary element of the charge.\n   <em>\n    Hewson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357903\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/88/128/\">\n    88 N.C.App. at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20S.E.2d%20574\">\n    362 S.E.2d at 576-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the State presented substantial evidence of each element of the allegation of resisting, delaying, or obstructing an investigation. In giving Officer Henderson a false name, the juvenile delayed the officer's investigation, including any attempt to contact the juvenile's parent or guardian. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's denial of the juvenile's motion to dismiss this allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   By his next assignment of error, the juvenile argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the allegation of burning a public building. Under the facts of this case, in order to survive the juvenile's motion to dismiss, the State must have presented substantial evidence of each of the following elements: (1) the juvenile wantonly and willfully; (2) set fire to the police station; and (3) the building was owned or occupied by an incorporated city or town.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-59\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The juvenile first challenges the sufficiency of the State's evidence on the \"wanton and willful\" element of the offense. To be wanton and willful, \"it must be shown that [an] act was done intentionally, without legal excuse or justification, and with knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe that the act would endanger the rights or safety of others.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Payne,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9128585\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/149/421/#p424\">\n    149 N.C.App. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=561%20S.E.2d%20507\">\n    561 S.E.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 (2002). In the present case, the State did not introduce any direct evidence that the juvenile set off fireworks with knowledge of or reasonable\n   grounds to believe that the act would endanger the rights or safety of others. However, it is well-established that \"[i]ntent is a mental attitude seldom provable by direct evidence. It must ordinarily be proved by circumstances from which it may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8569924\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/285/746/#p750\">\n    285 N.C. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20S.E.2d%20506\">\n    208 S.E.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (1974). Officer Marsh testified that the juvenile laughed when Officer Marsh attempted to put out the fireworks. Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, this evidence is sufficient to give rise to an inference that the juvenile's act was wanton and willful. Accordingly, this element of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59 is supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The juvenile also challenges the sufficiency of the State's evidence on the \"setting fire\" element of the offense. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59 refers to four acts which constitute the operative element of the offense: (1) set fire to; (2) burn; (3) cause to be burned; or (4) aid, counsel or procure the burning of the building. The trial court found that the juvenile's act of setting off fireworks ignited a flame approximately two to three feet high, which caused \"black markings on the floor and white markings on the wall\" of the interview room. The trial court found that \"this is not burning\" but noted that \"burning is not required to meet the elements [of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59] but setting fire does meet the elements.\" Therefore, in order to find the juvenile in violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59, we must uphold the trial court's conclusion that the juvenile's act of igniting fireworks constituted \"setting fire\" to the police department building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We note that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59 does not define the act of setting fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 14-59. Nor has North Carolina case law interpreted what act is necessary to constitute setting fire to a government building under this statute. However, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11274726\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/93/571/\">\n    93 N.C. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1885), our Supreme Court held that \"set fire to\" is distinct and different from \"burn.\" The Court reasoned that \"it is certainly possible to set fire to some articles which, by reason of the sudden extinction of the fire, may fail to change by charring even the material to which it has been applied, so that the defendant may have done the act imputed and yet not\n   <em>\n    burned\n   </em>\n   it within the meaning of the act [of 1875.]\"\n   <em>\n    Hall,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11274726\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/93/571/\">\n    93 N.C. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Avery,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4715685\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/315/1/\">\n    315 N.C. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20S.E.2d%20786\">\n    337 S.E.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), our Supreme Court held that where a defendant ignited a fire bomb in a building, which caused blackening of the tile floor, a steel cabinet, and an office partition, the act of igniting the fire bomb was sufficient to support a conviction for the lesser included offense of attempting to set fire to or burn a building under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-67.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-67.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State was not required to prove a \"burning\" in order to prove an attempt to burn or set fire.\n   <em>\n    Avery,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4715685\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/315/1/\">\n    315 N.C. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 S.E.2d at 799. We note that, unlike the facts of\n   <em>\n    Avery,\n   </em>\n   the juvenile in the present case did not set off a fire bomb, but rather set off fireworks. While this factual distinction may be significant under different facts, the facts here are that the juvenile set off fireworks \"near the wall\" of the interview room. Given the proximity of the fireworks to the wall and the resulting flame and damage, we infer an intent to set fire with the fireworks.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Grigsby,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155828\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/351/454/#p457\">\n    351 N.C. 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20S.E.2d%20460\">\n    526 S.E.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462 (2000) (holding that an individual is presumed to intend the natural consequences of the individual's actions). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the juvenile's motion to dismiss this allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The juvenile next argues the trial court erred in omitting from the commitment order the maximum term of commitment, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-2513(a), which requires a trial court to determine the maximum period of time for which a juvenile may remain committed and to notify the juvenile of that determination. The State concedes the error. While the trial court made the proper finding orally that commitment would not exceed the juvenile's eighteenth birthday, this term was omitted from the written order. Once the record on appeal has been filed with an appellate court, the trial court is divested of jurisdiction to correct a clerical error.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Dixon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496701\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/139/332/#p337\">\n    139 N.C.App. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20S.E.2d%20297\">\n    533 S.E.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301 (2000). Accordingly, we remand to the trial court with instructions to correct the clerical error on the commitment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The juvenile's final argument is that the trial court erred in not stating its compelling reasons for denying the release of the juvenile pending appeal, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2605. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7B-2605 (2005) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Pending disposition of an appeal, the release of the juvenile, with or without conditions, should issue in every case unless the court orders otherwise. For compelling reasons which must be stated in writing, the court may enter a temporary order affecting the custody or placement of the juvenile as the court finds to be in the best interests of the juvenile or the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The State concedes the error. Accordingly, we vacate the order denying the juvenile's release pending appeal and remand the matter to the trial court for findings as to the compelling reasons for denying release. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    In re Lineberry,\n   </em>\n   \"we are aware of the likelihood that the passage of time may have rendered the issue of [the] juvenile's custody pending appeal moot.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249618\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/154/246/#p256\">\n    154 N.C.App. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=572%20S.E.2d%20229\">\n    572 S.E.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (2002),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1511240,1511185,1511322,1511443\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/356/672/\">\n    356 N.C. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=577%20S.E.2d%20624\">\n    577 S.E.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).
