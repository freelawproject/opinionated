Under this initiative provision a proposed ordinance regulating the charges of telephone companies was submitted to popular vote and received a majority.

That no person, firm, corporation, receiver or lessee operating a telephone system in the city of Dallas, shall charge sub' 'seribers more than $5.00 per month per phone for unlimited single line business service, or charge more than $2.00 per month per phone for unlimited single line residence service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201c\u2018Section 2. That bills for such telephone service shall become due and shall be presented on the first day of the month following the rendering of the service, and such bills shall be subject to a discount of ten percent if paid on or before the 10th day of said month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201c\u2018Section 3. That any person, firm, corporation, receiver or lessee operating a telephone system in the city of Dallas, who- shall violate any of the provisions of this ordinance, shall be fined $200 upon conviction in the Corporation Court of the city of Dallas.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Paragraph 27 of section 8, article 2 of the charter of the city of Dallas declares that the power therein conferred shall be exercised by ordinance, and paragraph 7 of the same section directs that such ordinances shall be enacted by the Board of Commissioners of the said city. There can be no doubt that the authority to so regulate the business named in the said sections may be exercised by the Board of \u2018Commissioners. The question in this ease is, had the voters the right, also, by the method of initiation prescribed, to present the ordinance in question to the Board of Commissioners for submission to the qualified voters of the city,</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The method by which an ordinance may be submitted is prescribed in paragraph 1 of article 8. The language is: \u201cAny proposed ordinance may be submitted to the Board of Commissioners by a petition signed by registered electors of the city, equal in number to the percentages hereinafter required,\u201d etc. Counsel for the city seem to understand this language to mean that an ordinance on any subject of legislation mentioned in the charter may be presented under this method of initiation to the Board of Commissioners and that such presentation precludes action by the Board of Commissioners. We are of opinion that the language, \u201cany proposed ordinance,\u201d means that an ordinance upon any subject to which the initiatory method is applicable may be presented in the manner prescribed to. the Commissioners. It does not mean that all ordinances upon any subject of legislation mentioned in the charter may be enacted in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Paragraph 27 of section 8 prescribes that the authority to regulate such business as that involved in this litigation shall be exercised by ordinance, but it does not provide by what department the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>shall be enacted, whether by the Board of Commissioners on their own initiative, or by the voters of the city by the initiatory method prescribed in paragraph 1 of article 8 of the charter. Paragraph 7 of the same section and article reads: \u201cThe right is hereby delegated to the city of Dallas, acting through its Board of Commissioners, to determine, fix and regulate the charges,\u201d etc., after a fair hearing on the reasonableness of such rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">In the exercise of the power to regulate and fix rates, etc., there must be a body who can hear evidence and decide upon the reasonableness and unreasonableness of the rate or regulation, and if that can not be done by the initiative\u2014the popular vote\u2014then, the authority can not be exercised in that manner. Can it be necessary to offer argument to show to any man that such hearing as the law provides could not be had in a campaign before the electorate of the city? It is too manifest for controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Can it be supposed that a Legislature would require a Board of Commissioners to secure a fair hearing to the party to be affected and yet would not permit some unknown party to draft an ordinance, specifying rates and regulations, without the knowledge of any facts, and submit such ordinance to the popular vote where there can neither be an investigation nor any character of ascertainment of the facts? That would be to place upon the language of the charter an unreasonable construction. If the charter provided for the submission of such issues to the voters at large, its validity would, at least, be questionable. In Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, 211 U. S., 280, that question was raised and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201cThe charter of the city also contains a provision that upon petition of fifteen percent of the voters of the city any ordinance proposed must be submitted to the people and may be by them adopted. It is said, therefore, that the power of rate regulation might be, in this manner, exercised directly by the electorate at large. It may well be doubted whether such a result was contemplated by the Legislature. There are certainly grave objections to the exercise of such a power, requiring a careful and minute investigation of facts and figures, by the general body of the people, however intelligent and right-minded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The charter of a city is to its citizens and officers the measure of their authority over persons and property. That charter secured to the plaintiff in error \u201ca fair hearing,\u201d and, as such hearing was not and could not be had in the adoption of this ordinance, it was not enacted in accordance with the charter and is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">There is no conflict between paragraph 1 of article 3 and paragraph 27 of section 8 herein copied. They refer to different subjects of legislation and each can be sustained and applied to its subjects. There is nothing in our Constitution which forbids the Legislature to submit proper subjects to the voters of a city by the initiative. The authority of the Legislature in creating municipal corporations is ample for such purpose. Brown v.
