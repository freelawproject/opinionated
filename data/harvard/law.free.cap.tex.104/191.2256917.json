(Act of April 20, 1909, Laws, 31sit Leg., p. 323.) Under this Act the Attorney-General, in December, 1910, made a contract in writing, with the written approval of the Governor, for the employment of and payment of a monthly salary to an attorney, for a period of eight months, to render professional services unuer the direction of the Attorney-General in enforcing any and all laws of the State, and to represent the State as special counsel in prosecuting twenty-one enumerated cases then -pending for the recovery of public lands by the State, and other suits to be filed by the Attorney-General. In January, 1911, the Governor\u2019s elected successor entered on his office, and the Attorney-General, who was reelected, entered upon a new term. The special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>counsel was paid for services under such contract to the end of January, 1911; but the Treasurer refused payment of the warrant for services rendered in February, 1911, drawn by the Comptroller upon a voucher approved by the Attorney-General, because the expenditure had not been approved by the Governor then in office.

For the month of February, 1911, relator received his voucher, approved by the Attorney-General, and warrant was duly issued by the Comptroller, but, upon presentation to the Respondent Sparks, it was refused payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">Many questions have been presented and ably discussed by counsel on either side of this case, which we do not deem necessary to decide. We shall confine ourselves to the questions which we think are important in the determination of this particular case..</p>\n<p id=\"b216-18\">We are of the opinion that the Act of the Thirty-First Legislature which is copied above is sufficiently specific in making the appropriation therein mentioned and is not violative of section 6, article YIII of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-19\">The following questions of law, in our judgment, lay at the \u2022 foundation of this case and are sufficient to determine the issues here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-22\">1. Does the agreement between Terrell and the Attorney-General Lightfoot confer upon Terrell the official character of Assistant Attorney-General? If the effect of that agreement is to constitute Terrell an officer of the State, then his appointment and continuance in office would depend upon the continuance of the term of the Attorney-General, who appointed him, and his authority terminated when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Attorney-General qualified for his succeeding term and Governor Campbell went out of office by reason of the succession of the present Governor. Hord v. The State, 79 N. W., 906. The case cited rests upon the proposition of law above stated and we think it was correctly decided.' We recur to the question, does the agreement between Light-foot and Terrell confer upon the latter the office of Assistant Attorney-General? We find in the instrument no words appropriate to the appointment of an official Assistant Attorney-General. The language expresses a contract of employment by the Attorney-General and the undertaking of Terrell is that of special counsel for a specific work. In the case of Hord v. The State, cited above, the Attorney-General first appointed Hord Assistant Attorney-General and then entered into a contract with him for compensation to be paid for the discharge of duties imposed by law upon that officer. In this case it is true that the duties to be performed are those which appertain to the office of Attorney-General, but the terms of the instrument by which Terrell is engaged are specific in placing him in the attitude of special counsel to assist the Attorney-General in the certain named cases and in other matters which may arise, limiting that employment to a time less than the official term. It does not appear that he took any oath of office or in any way did anything which would be required in order to qualify one for such position. We are of opinion that Terrell had no official relation to Lightfoot and that his contract did not terminate with the expiration of the term of office of the Governor and the Attorney-General.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><em>2. </em>We now come to the question, does the instrument before us constitute a contract between Terrell and the State,? The language of the instrument is appropriate for expressing contractual relations and is inconsistent with any other. It mentions a definite consideration which is to be paid by the State for services to be rendered by Terrell to the State in a number of specified cases and also in other matters which might arise in the future. We conclude that the instrument here in controversy constitutes and embodies a contract between the relator and the State \"of Texas and is binding upon the State if authorized by the statute. 36 Cyc., 872, 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">3. The next important question that arises in the case is, had Governor Campbell and Attorney-General Lightfoot authority under the statute to employ Terrell as special counsel to assist the Attorney-General in the prosecution of the cases named and other cases which might arise? The power to make the contract must be derived from the statute itself, therefore, we must construe its terms to ascertain whether or not that authority is given. For the rule of construction by which, we are to be governed we copy from Sutherland on Statutory Construction, section 341, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cWhenever a power is given by statute, everything necessary to make it effectual or requisite to attain the end is implied. It is a well established principle that statutes containing grants of power are to be construed so as to include the authority to do all things necessary to accomplish the object of the grant. The grant of an express power carries with it by necessary implication every other power necessary and proper to the execution of the power expressly granted. Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the law commands anything to be done it authorizes the performance of whatever may be necessary for executing its commands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">By the terms of the statute of the Thirty-First Legislature, before copied, the duty is imposed upon the Attorney-General and the power is conferred upon him to prosecute suits against those who are unlawfully claiming the public lands of the State, for it is evident from the terms of the Aot that it was in the mind of the Legislature when it enacted this law that conditions required a vigorous prosecution of the State\u2019s claims against those who were infringing upon the rights in the public lands of the State. In view of this duty the language, \u201cand for the purpose of paying any and all necessary expenses in bringing suits or paying expenses in prosecuting same,\u201d empowers the Attorney-General, with the concurrence of the Governor, to expend the sum appropriated or so much thereof as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose specified in the Act and the cost of whatever might be necessary in the discharge of the duties thus imposed upon him is included in the term, expense. The second section of the Act shows that in the mind of the Legislature there was an immediate necessity for the Attorney-General to make application of this fund to the protection of the public lands of the State. Suits were authorized to be brought by the language, to pay the expense of bringing suits and also in prosecuting the same. Out of this requirement there arose the necessity and the power of said officers to do the things that were required to be done in order to institute and to \u25a0 prosecute those suits and it requires no argument to show that the service of attorneys were necessary to the performance of this duty. It is true that the Attorney-General was charged with the performance of these duties by the Constitution and laws of the State, but the declaration of the emergency clause shows that the Legislature regarded it as impossible for him to perform this vast amount of professional work. The Governor and the Attorney-General were authorized to determine the necessity of employing special counsel to assist the Attorney-General and also to provide for the payment of his fees, therefore, the necessity for such counsel and the propriety of his employment are not before this court; those questions are concluded by the decision of those to whom the Legislature committed them. The method by which the payment should be made was a matter of discretion with the Governor and the Attorney-General. Would they pay fees for each case? or secure the services of an attorney by the month for a specified time? was submitted to them. That contract provided for services in twenty-one law suits then pending, besides other services which might be called for in suits to be instituted, and the term of employment being eight months, the sum to be paid is not apparently exorbitant; it may have been the most economical and satisfactory method of conducting the litigation, and that question was likewise committed to those officers and their decision of it must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The statute under review contains this language: \u201c. . . to be expended under the direction of the Attorney-General by and with the approval of the Governor, and to <em>be </em>paid upon warrants drawn by the Comptroller of Public Accounts on vouchers approved by the Attorney-General.\u201d ' Applying the law to the facts of this case, the making of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the contract with Terrell required the approval of the Governor, which was given by writing and was an approval of the expenditure of the fund as provided in that agreement. The payment of the money was provided for distinctly by the language, \u201cto be paid upon warrants drawn by the Comptroller of Public Accounts on vouchers approved by the Attorney-General.\u201d This language is plain and distinctly defines the duties of, the Governor. Neither the voucher nor the warrant required the approval of the Governor. The warrant drawn in this case ivas regular and the treasurer had no discretion in the matter, he should have paid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The mandamus will be issued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
