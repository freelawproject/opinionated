Bank, 117 S. W., 476; Elmore v. Rugely, 48 Texas Civ. App., 456, 107 S. W., 151; De Steaguer v. Pittman, 117 S. W., 481; Nat\u2019l Bank v. Campbell, 114 S. W., 887 and Dunovant\u2019s Est. v. Stafford, 36 Texas Civ. App., 33, 81 S. W., 101.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cIn this connection we may call the court\u2019s attention to the case of Adams v. Bartell, 46 Texas Civ. App., 349, 102 S. W., 779, in which your honorable court refused a writ of error, but prior to decisions above mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cQuestion. Was this court in error in rendering judgment for ten percent attorney\u2019s fee as provided in said clause of the note, in the absence of testimony that plaintiff contracted to pay its attorney ten percent for his services?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">We think the provisions for attorney\u2019s fees as contained in notes are to be treated as partaking, in important respects, of the nature of contracts of indemnity, and that such undertakings to pay attorney\u2019s fees are not to be accepted or enforced, under all circumstances, as fixing a penalty, or to be regarded as constituting liquidated damages. It seems to us that the particular provision contained in the note sued on in this case, \u201cand further hereby agree that if this note is not paid when due, to pay all costs necessary for collection, including ten percent attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d clearly stamps the contract as one possessing the qualities of indemnity only. \u201cClearly it seems to us by the terms of the note that the provision for attorney\u2019s fees is treated and by the parties considered as in the nature of costs and such promise to pay attorney\u2019s fees is fixed as a contract of indemnity. So considered, it contains an obligation of the maker of the note to pay the cost of collection and at the same time fixes the amount thereof at ten percent of such obligation. In such case, in the absence of plea and proof that such a percent is unreasonable and unconscionable, the court is authorized to act upon the amount of such fees as agreed upon by the parties and enter judgment accordingly. Whether this rule should apply where the holder of the note had in fact in the institution and prosecution of the suit contracted with his counsel to pay less than the amount named in the note, or whether his contract should inure to the benefit of his debtor, and whether, if, on a proper showing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>amount of the attorney\u2019s fees stipulated to be paid was found to be unreasonable and unconscionable, such contract would be relieved against, we need not now determine. In the instant case no issue is made of the reasonableness of the amount agreed to be paid. The record shows that suit had been instituted on the note and the same contains a clear statement of the amount agreed by the parties to be paid and no other or further proof was required.\u201d Under the statement made by the Court of Civil Appeals it did not, we think, err in rendering judgment for the attorney\u2019s fees claimed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
