The allegations were not so vague, conclusory, or patently frivolous so as to warrant summary dismissal of the petition. <em>Blackledge </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 75-6, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1629-1630, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Nor do we accept the state\u2019s invitation to affirm dismissal on the ground that the rationale of <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), a Fourth Amendment case, extends to preclude reexamination of Fifth Amendment claims in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Indeed, the rationale of <em>Stone v. Powell has not been so </em>extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Even if we view the district court\u2019s order as a denial of the petition on the merits, we cannot affirm because of the incompleteness of the court\u2019s findings and conclusions. <em>Rhinehart v. Gunn, </em>598 F.2d 557 (9th Cir. 1979). In reviewing the petition, the district court must determine whether the state court findings are substantially supported by the record and whether the state court applied the proper legal standard. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Taylor v. Cardwell, </em>579 F.2d 1380, 1382-83 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The judgment is vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
