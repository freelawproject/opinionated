Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the MDA found in his automobile was denied by the district court following a hearing. The point for reversal pressed by Kimak is that his automobile was subjected to an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">On August 6, 1979, DEA Agent Robert Prezioso was told by an informant that one Henry Shernoff was going to sell him a pound of MDA the following day. Accordingly, Prezioso and several other agents went the next day to the informant\u2019s address on Market Street in San Francisco, and Prezioso went inside to await Sher-noff\u2019s arrival. Shortly thereafter, the additional agents who were parked outside observed Shernoff arrive in appellant Kimak\u2019s car. Shernoff had asked Kimak to give him a lift to Market Street and to wait for him in the car while he was inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">Before concluding a sale of one pound of MDA to Prezioso and the informant for $6,100, Shernoff told Prezioso that he would have to deliver the money from the sale to his \u201cman\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his \u201cman,\u201d said Shernoff, was waiting outside to drive him home. The agent agreed to buy the pound of MDA that Shernoff had brought with him that day, and then promptly arrested him for the sale of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">During this period, which lasted about one-half hour, Kimak remained in his car, parked directly behind the surveilling agents. Just as he left the car to call his wife from a public telephone across 16th Street, the agents outside were alerted to Shernoff\u2019s arrest. Kimak had almost completed crossing the street when Agent Low-rey Leong pulled up in his car and arrested Kimak. The agents then took Kimak\u2019s car keys from him, handcuffed him, and placed him in Agent Leong\u2019s car. Both suspects were given their <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-20\">\n<em>The Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b984-21\">Kimak was then informed that his car was being seized for forfeiture pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One of the agents opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the trunk of Kimak\u2019s car at the scene, but closed it without seizing anything when another agent advised him to await transportation of the car to DEA\u2019s garage. Nevertheless, Kimak believed that the agent must have smelled the strong odor of Colombian marijuana, which he knew to be contained in plastic bags secreted in cardboard boxes in the trunk. Thus, when asked by the agents about the contents of his ear, Kimak admitted that there were five pounds of marijuana in the trunk that he had sold to Shernoff, as well as a small amount of white powder (which was MDA) in a plastic bag with a map on the driver\u2019s side of the front seat area \u2014 a gift from Shernoff for giving him a lift to the informant\u2019s address. At the DEA garage and in Kimak\u2019s presence, but without a warrant and without Kimak\u2019s permission, the agents searched the vehicle and found a clear plastic bag containing 1.88 grams of MDA where Ki-mak had said it would be, as well as ten pounds of marijuana in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The district court denied the motion to suppress the MDA found in the defendant\u2019s automobile. Although Justice Rehnquist observed in <em>Cady v. Dombroski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 440, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2527, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), that the law governing warrantless searches and seizures, especially those involving automobiles, \u201cis something less than a seamless web,\u201d a decision in this case does not require that we weave any new threads into the web to fill the interstices that may exist. It cannot be seriously questioned that the government agents who seized the defendant\u2019s automobile not only had probable cause to believe, <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but knew that the automobile had been used to transport the MDA. It is settled that \u201c[A] vehicle may be seized [for forfeiture] even in the absence of probable cause to believe it contains contraband <em>if there is nonetheless probable cause to believe that it was used </em>\u2018to facilitate the <em>transfer of contraband.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>572 F.2d 227, 234 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 907, 98 S.Ct. 3097, 57 L.Ed.2d 1137 (1978) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. LaVecchia, </em>513 F.2d 1210, 1216 (2d Cir. 1975)). The defendant relies upon <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>502 F.2d 281, 287 (9th Cir. 1974). That was a case where the seizure of McCormick\u2019s car was not made until two and one-half months after the agents had probable cause to believe that it had been used illegally. It is clearly distinguishable. Here the seizure of the defendant\u2019s car occurred within minutes after the agents obtained knowledge of its illegal use, and substantially contemporaneously with his arrest. Indeed, at the time of the seizure, the automobile was on the street and not only had been, but was still being used to facilitate the completion of the sale of MDA. The seizure of the defendant\u2019s automobile at that time was valid under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d announced in <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1945). <em>See United States v. McCormick, supra, </em>at 286-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">\n<em>The Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">The next question is whether evidence obtained as the fruit of a subsequent search was admissible in the criminal proceedings against the defendant. Since the possession of the defendant\u2019s automobile was legally obtained, its search was lawful. The ruling of the Court in <em>Cooper v. California, </em>386 U.S. 58, 62, 87 S.Ct. 788, 791, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (1967) that \u201cwe cannot hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment the examination or search of a car validly held by officers for use as evidence in a forfeiture proceeding\u201d has not been impaired. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 232. It was also said in the plurality opinion in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 463, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2036, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), that \u201cwhere the police may stop and search an automobile . . they may also seize it and search it later at the police station.\u201d The agents were not required to make the search on the public street where it was seized; they were entitled to take it and the defendant to the DEA garage where a search could safely be made. <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 52 n. 10, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1981, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). <em>See also United States v. Johnson, supra, </em>at 233 (quoting <em>United States v. McCormick, supra, </em>at 284 (\u201cWe do not doubt that, if the seizure of the car . was valid, the later search . . . was also valid.\u201d));<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Arias, </em>453 F.2d 641, 643 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Karp, </em>508 F.2d 1122, 1124 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Zaicek, </em>519 F.2d 412, 414 (2d Cir. 1975). We see no reason to depart from that rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">In summary, we hold that the seizure of the defendant\u2019s automobile and its later search which resulted in the seizure of the MDA did not deprive the defendant of his fourth amendment rights. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-11\">. Prezioso averred that \u201c[b]ased upon my experience and knowledge as a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration and its predecessor agency narcotics dealers utilize the word \u2018man\u2019 when referring to their source of supply for illicit drugs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-12\">.

Although a divided panel in <em>United States v. McCormick, supra, </em>held that probable cause would not justify a seizure which did not occur immediately after cause arose but rather a month and one-half later, 562 F.2d at 287, all members of the panel did agree that \u201cif the seizure of the car . . . was valid, the later search . . . was also valid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 284; <em>id. </em>at 290 (Wallace, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
