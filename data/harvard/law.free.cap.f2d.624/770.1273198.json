The Board found that Topinka\u2019s violated sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to adhere to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to which it was a party. Topinka\u2019s contends that the sale of all of the corporation stock, accompanied by the transfer of the corporation\u2019s Michigan liquor license, makes the corporation a new employer which is not bound by the collective bargaining agreement executed before the stock transfer. Upon due consideration, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"A_n\">IT IS ORDERED that the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of its order be and it is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
