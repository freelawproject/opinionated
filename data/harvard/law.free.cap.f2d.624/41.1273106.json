The Interstate Commerce Commission disagreed; it permitted an increase to take effect on July 12/25, but ruled that a May 15 through July 12/25 increase was unlawful. It also ordered Bureau members to notify shippers of the possibility of refunds for shipments made between May 15 and July 12/25. We agree with the Commission that the rate increase is effective from July 12/25 only, and uphold the Commission\u2019s authority to compel notice of the overcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-27\">The Bureau is an association of common carriers engaged in interstate and foreign transportation of household goods. It acts as a rate bureau for its members; among other tasks, it publishes tariffs and seeks tariff increases. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10706(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>10762(a)(1), 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1307.21-1307.50 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In April 1976, the Bureau sought a five percent rate increase for the transportation of household goods. It filed new rate schedules with the Commission pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(b)(3). Absent any action by the Commission, the five percent increase would have gone into effect on May 15. The Defense Department, however, protested the increase and asked the Commission to suspend and investigate the new rates. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10708. The Commission issued an investigation and suspension order on May 14, 1976. It read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV6\">It is further ordered, that the operation of the said schedules be and is hereby suspended, and that the use thereof on interstate and foreign commerce be deferred to and including December 14, 1976, unless otherwise ordered by this Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">After listing the pertinent tariffs, however, the order also stated that it suspended \u201call matter therein insofar as it would increase present rates by more than three (3) percent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The last quoted phrase created the confusion this suit was brought to resolve. The Bureau interpreted the order to mean that a three percent tariff increase had been approved, and would be effective on May 15 without the necessity of further action. The Bureau sent shippers a copy of the order, announced a three percent increase, and provided shippers with a \u201cconversion chart\u201d that they could use to calculate the rate at a tariff increased by three percent rather than at the published tariff of five percent. The chart was not filed with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">A shippers\u2019 association, The Aerospace Industries Association of America, Inc., challenged the Bureau\u2019s announcement of a three percent increase by asking the Commission whether the Bureau\u2019s chart met the statutory requirement that all tariffs be filed and state rates in money of the United States. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(a)(2). The Bureau petitioned for review of the order insofar as it suspended the requested five percent increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">On June 30, the Commission\u2019s Division 2 denied the Bureau\u2019s petition for review, and clarified its suspension order. The Commission struck the offending phrase \u201call matters therein insofar as it would increase present rates and charges by more than three (3) percent\u201d. Instead, it said the earlier order had suspended the \u201cfive (5) percent increase without prejudice to the filing of schedules providing an increase in rates and charges of no more than three (3) percent to be applied in the same manner as the suspended schedules\u201d. In response to the clarified order, the Bureau filed on July 9 tariffs effective July 12 and 25,1976, with three percent increases. On August 27, the Commission ended the rate investigation and acceded to the three percent increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">In September, the Defense Department sought a declaratory order that Bureau members had overcharged shippers by collecting the three percent increase during the May 15 though July 12/25 period before the Bureau had filed tariff schedules setting out the three percent increase. The Commission ruled that the increases charged during this period were overcharges within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11705(b)(1) because there were no formal tariffs on file that clearly stated the rates actually charged, in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762. The conversion chart that the Bureau supplied to shippers was not lawfully filed and did not support the collection of higher rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The Bureau petitioned for reconsideration, and the General Services Administration requested that the Commission order Bureau members to identify overcharged shippers and notify them of the possibility of refunds for the overcharges. Division 2 denied the Bureau\u2019s petition and adopted the GSA\u2019s suggestion. It ordered Bureau members to identify and notify each shipper paying overcharges and to provide them with claim forms. The Bureau challenged the Commission\u2019s authority to issue the notification order. The full Commission, noting that the order did not force carriers to issue refunds but \u201csimply aid[ed] shippers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>in the discovery of claims\u201d, found statutory authority in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10321, which empowers the Commission \u201cto carry out\u201d the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We need not look far to discover that no tariff increase was effective between May 15 and July 12/25. The Interstate Commerce Act sets out a series of steps a carrier must follow to effect an increase. They were not followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">A carrier must observe reasonable rates, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10702, and file its published tariff with the Commission at least thirty days prior to its effective date, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(c)(3). Carriers must also post tariffs in their offices, and transmit them to all subscribers. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(aX2); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1307.44(h), 1307.48. Those tariffs must be \u201cclearly and explicitly stated in cents or in dollars and cents . . ..\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1307.28(a)(1). <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(b)(1). The Commission lias authority to reject any tariff that violates the Act or Commission regulations, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(e), and to suspend a tariff for up to 7 months while investigating it, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10708. While a tariff is suspended, the prior tariff remains in effect. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1307.13; <em>Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific R.R. Co. v. Alouette Peat Products, </em>9 Cir. 1957, 253 F.2d 449, 456. The Commission\u2019s regulations require that when a new tariff is suspended, a carrier notify its subscribers of the suspension, and note the tariffs that will apply during the suspension. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1307.34(a)(1). In addition, when the Commission rejects a tariff as unreasonable, it may point to an appropriate one. <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>1978, 436 U.S. 631, 653-54, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 2065-66, 56 L.Ed.2d 591. This option avoids, as Justice Brennan put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">A pointless charade in which carriers . are required to submit and resubmit tariffs until one finally goes below an undisclosed maximum point of reasonableness and is allowed to take effect. The administrative process, after all, is not modeled on \u201cThe Price Is Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">436 U.S. at 653, 98 S.Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">The Commission, however, has no statutory authority, in rejecting a tariff, to implement a different one. It may allow a tariff to take effect, suspend it, or suspend it with the proviso that some other tariff will, if filed, go into effect without the ordinary thirty-day waiting period. <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Cases, </em>1978, 436 U.S. 631, 651-54, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 2065-66, 56 L.Ed.2d 591. <em>United States v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>1977, 426 U.S. 500, 511-15, 96 S.Ct. 2318, 2324-26, 49 L.Ed.2d 14. In all cases, tariffs must be filed with the Commission before they can apply, and it is up to the carrier to file them. This result is mandated by the Act\u2019s \u201cimperative requirements\u201d that there always be tariffs lawfully on file that are explicit and uncomplicated. <em>Davis v. Portland Seed Co., </em>1924, 264 U.S. 403, 424-25, 44 S.Ct. 380, 384-85, 68 L.Ed. 762. Justice Hughes\u2019s ancient statement is still the law: \u201cunder the Interstate Commerce Act, the rate of the carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge\u201d. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Maxwell, </em>1915, 237 U.S. 94, 97, 35 S.Ct. 494, 495, 59 L.Ed. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">When the Commission considered the Bureau\u2019s new schedules on May 14, it had before it only two published and filed tariffs: the old one, and the proposed five percent increase. No three percent increase had been filed. The Commission could therefore approve none. That the Bureau was confused about the effect of the Commission\u2019s suspension order \u2014 and it was regrettably clumsy \u2014 cannot increase the Commission\u2019s statutory authority. The Commission cannot approve a tariff that has not been filed. Here, the original suspension order suspended the five percent increase. As the Commission made clear, by its order of June 30, it intended to say, by the language \u201call matter therein [is suspended] insofar as it would increase present rates by more than three (3) percent\u201d, that it would approve a three percent increase. But it did not by the suspension order approve such an increase. On July 9, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Bureau submitted a three percent increase to take effect on July 12/25, and the Commission allowed it to take effect. No three percent increase had been submitted before July 9, and none could be in force before the effective date of that tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We turn to the question whether the Commission had authority to order Bureau members to notify shippers of the possibility of a refund for increases charged before July 12/25. Courts have blessed the Commission\u2019s creative use of suspension orders to accomplish statutory goals. The Supreme Court has done so twice recently. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co., </em>1976, 426 U.S. 500, 96 S.Ct. 2318, 49 L.Ed.2d 14, the Court approved the Commission\u2019s order conditioning the termination of a rate suspension on the railroad\u2019s investing part of the rate increase in capital expenses. And in the <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>1978, 436 U.S. 631, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 56 L.Ed.2d 591, the Court approved the Commission\u2019s order conditioning the termination of a rate suspension on the carrier\u2019s promise to refund any sums eventually found to have been unlawfully charged.. The Court held that \u201cthe Commission does have powers \u2018ancillary\u2019 to its suspension power which do not depend on an express statutory grant of authority\u201d. 436 U.S. at 654, 98 S.Ct. at 2066. The refund conditions were permissible because they were \u201ca necessary and \u2018directly related\u2019 . . means of discharging the Commission\u2019s . . . mandate to protect the public pending a more complete determination of the reasonableness of the . rates\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 98 S.Ct. at 2067. <em>See also Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n v. B &amp; T Transp. Co., </em>1 Cir. 1980, 613 F.2d 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The notice that the Commission prescribed in this case meets both the \u201cdirectly related\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d tests. The notice requirement was directly related to the suspension order: It was an attempt to correct the tariff overcharges that resulted from the Bureau\u2019s misunderstanding of the Commission\u2019s order. And it was necessary because, as the GSA observed in its petition, the Bureau carriers were \u201cthe only group that [could] readily identify affected individuals\u201d. The order goes no further than it has to; it leaves the filing and payment of claims to shippers and carriers, in accord with the statutory scheme. We find nothing in the Act to preclude such an order to provide notice. On the contrary, the order is consistent with the Act\u2019s purpose of providing and maintaining reasonable rates for transportation. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10101 (a)(4), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission are AFFIRMED and the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
