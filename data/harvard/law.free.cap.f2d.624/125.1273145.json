Appellee Smith instituted an individual and class action against appellant, alleging sex discrimination under Title VII. After discovery was completed the trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit. Appellant then moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). After a hearing the trial court denied the motion. The issue on appeal is whether the lower court abused its discretion in denying appellant an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The standard governing the award of section 2000e-5(k) attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing defendants is clear. In construing section 2000e-5(k) the Supreme Court held: \u201c[A] plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648. The provision in section 2000e-5(k) for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party discourages filing frivolous or unreasonable suits by making the unreasonable plaintiff liable for the defendant\u2019s fees. At the same time it encourages plaintiffs who have a bona fide cause of action to proceed by providing for an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a plaintiff should he prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We recently applied the <em>Christiansburg </em>standard in <em>EEOC v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>609 F.2d 434 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 2944, 65 L.Ed.2d - (1980). There we held the lower court\u2019s finding that the EEOC had instituted a frivolous suit was unsupported by the record, and vacated the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In this case the trial judge was well aware of <em>Christiansburg </em>and applied it to the facts. As to the institution of the suit an investigation by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, according to his affidavit, revealed that Jos-ten\u2019s laid off female employees before similarly situated male employees; that female employees were not allowed to smoke on the job while the men were; that the women could use a telephone at work only with permission of their supervisor while men had no such rule; and various other alleged discriminations. As a result of this investigation a complaint was filed which alleged sex discrimination in employment. After the suit was filed the plaintiff disappeared. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel said nothing about the disappearance to the court or defendant for five months, and then when faced with an order to show cause why the suit should not be dismissed. The trial court had misgivings about the attorney\u2019s handling and investigation of the case. Nevertheless, the court was \u201cunable to say with the requisite certainty that counsel instituted the individual suit precipitously and with the knowledge it was groundless.\u201d We have reviewed the record. The trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous and should therefore be sustained. The commencement of this suit was not frivolous, groundless, or unreasonable within the meaning of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Christiansburg </em>decision. <em>See also Bowers v. Kraft Foods Corp., </em>606 F.2d 816, 818 (8th Cir.) (vacating an award to defendant where \u201cthe evidence, while weak, was sufficient to conceivably have influenced Bowers to believe that she had a stronger case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Appellant also contends the discovery process revealed the frivolity or unreasonableness of continuing this suit. The argument, in effect, is that appellee\u2019s counsel should have sought or acquiesced in a dismissal of his client\u2019s suit. In a recent case the First Circuit responded to this argument as follows: \u201c[Vjoluntary dismissal is, except in unusual circumstances, almost alien to our adversary system. Once a law suit has been commenced, it is the rare attorney who will voluntarily throw in the towel.\u201d <em>Olitsky v. O\u2019Malley, </em>597 F.2d 303, 306 (1st Cir.). It affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the prevailing defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. In our case the trial judge considered the continuation issue raised by appellant. In the face of confusing and conflicting evidence the trial judge ruled against appellant. Again, our review of the record persuades us the lower court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous and should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>We hold the lower court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for an award of section 2000e-5(k) attorney\u2019s fees was not an abuse of its discretion and was proper on the facts. We therefore do not reach the question raised in the briefs whether or under what circumstances plaintiff\u2019s attorney may be made liable for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant. <em>See, e. g., Monk v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1378 (5th Cir.). <em>aff\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d-(1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
