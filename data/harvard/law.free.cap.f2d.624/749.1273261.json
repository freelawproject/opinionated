(Kiewit) to recover damages to an old 1908 dilapidated waterfront dock no longer used for its original purposes, a portion of which Kiewit had been using for a short time for loading purposes under a lease arrangement with the City. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">The case was tried before a jury which returned a verdict in the amount of $350,-000 plus costs which was the full amount prayed for and judgment was entered therefor. Kiewit filed a motion for judgment n. o. v. or for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">Portions of the old dock collapsed sometime after the termination of the lease arrangement with the City when Kiewit was not in possession and the collapses occurred not only in the area which had been leased to Kiewit but in areas some distance away therefrom. It was the theory of the defense that the dock collapses resulted from old age of the dock and lack of repair over the years and were not caused or contributed to by Kiewit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-17\">The District Court, in ruling on the motion for a new trial, ordered a 50 percent remittitur in the amount of $175,000 on the ground that the verdict was grossly excessive and that the jury had not followed its instructions on betterment which would result in the reconstruction of a practically new dock when all the City was entitled to recover, if liability existed, was damages to the old dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">The City declined to accept the remittitur and the court granted a new trial but only on the issue of damages. Kiewit contends that the new trial should also be granted on the issue of liability for two reasons, namely, (1) the court held that the jury did not follow the court\u2019s instructions on betterment and (2) misconduct of counsel for the City in making deliberate and persistent appeals to passion and prejudice including that Kiewit is a \u201clarge, international corporation, with headquarters in Omaha and New Jersey\u201d; that it has \u201ca multi-million dollar contract with the Corps of Engineers\u201d; \u201cthat it has insurance coverage and can pay any judgment which is awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>against it\u201d; that the taxpayers of Cleveland should not have to pay the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Objections to the misconduct were repeatedly made and sustained and the court continually admonished and finally reprimanded counsel but he paid no attention to the admonitions or reprimand and made prejudicial remarks in his closing argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Kiewit appealed from the judgment before the court ruled on its motion for judgment n. o. v. or for a new trial. While the case was pending in this court on appeal the trial court denied the motion for judgment n. o. v. and ordered the remittitur and when it was not accepted granted a new trial only on the issue of damages. The court then at our suggestion, certified the appeal to this court under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) and we allowed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">For the reasons hereafter stated, we reverse for misconduct of counsel for the City and remanded for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Dock 34, the dock in question, was originally constructed in the year 1908. In recent years, because of its deterioration and lack of repair, it was no longer used for its original purpose and only a small portion of which was being used chiefly as a parking lot for nearby sporting events, and for the mooring of a schoolship and a pleasure boat. In 1973, Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Co., a contracting firm headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska (and incorporated in that state), was engaged in performing dike construction and dike modification at another place in the Cleveland Harbor, pursuant to a contract with the Corps of Engineers. Kiewit entered into the permit agreement with the City whereby Kiewit was permitted to use a portion of the dock to load blast furnace slag on barges to be transported to the dike project. Under the agreement, Kiewit was permitted to occupy and use a 100 X 400 foot portion of the southwest corner of the dock from July 9, 1973, to and including October 12,1973 (except for six days in late July when the area would be occupied by a carnival). Kiewit agreed to pay the City therefor $2,000 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Kiewit actually occupied the dock site from July 16 to and including October 6 (except for the period from July 21 through July 30 when it was used by the carnival); the dock was used for the slag loading operation from August 1 to October 6. The slag loading operation consisted of trucking slag to the dock, where the slag was piled and then loaded onto barges for transportation to the breakwall some distance away. The operations were concluded, and Kiewit vacated the dock on October 8, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">On October 24, 1973, after Kiewit had surrendered possession to the City, portions of the dock collapsed. The portion that collapsed included only a small section of the area which had been leased to Kiewit; the major portion of the area which collapsed was not within the section that had been leased to and used by Kiewit.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">The City of Cleveland filed suit against Kiewit in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County in a three-count complaint. The three causes of action alleged reflected different theories of law under which the plaintiff sought to impose liability on defendant for the collapses of the dock. The action was removed on the basis of diversity of citizenship to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on August 28, 1974. The City sought recovery of $350,000 in compensatory damages plus interest. Following a November 1976 trial which lasted six days, the jury <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> returned a general verdict in favor of the City and against Kiewit in the amount of $350,000. Judgment was entered thereon plus costs. Kiewit then filed a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial, alleging misconduct of counsel for the City as one of the three grounds that \u201cthe remarks, argument and questioning of wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>nesses by plaintiff\u2019s counsel regarding liability insurance and defendant\u2019s financial resources, considered in total, were prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The District Judge ordered a remittitur of $175,000, and stated that, if the remitti-tur were not accepted within thirty days, he would grant a new trial on the issue of damages. In his November 15, 1977 memorandum opinion, Judge Green stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">As to the question of liability, the Court is satisfied that the record is sufficient to support a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">While defendant\u2019s arguments regarding plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and conduct are founded on evidence in the record and might be sufficient to convince the Court, as trier of fact, that plaintiff should not recover . . . , in the Court\u2019s opinion, the evidence presented enough contested questions of fact that the jury\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s defenses predicated upon waiver and contributory negligence cannot be set aside as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">. the Court is convinced that the verdict is grossly excessive, and believes <em>that the amount of the verdict may have been influenced in that regard by conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">While the Court recognizes that the mention of insurance was inevitable in the course of the trial by reason of the fact that matters of insurance coverage were included in the contracts between the parties, in the Court\u2019s opinion plaintiff\u2019s counsel went beyond the bounds of necessity and propriety in certain questions and comments on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\"><em>While . . . whenever the subject of insurance was improperly approached, the Court sustained defendant\u2019s objections, the import of the questioning cannot be eradicated from the jury\u2019s consciousness. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-14\">Similarly, while there was a tenable argument that defendant\u2019s size was relevant to the question of its expertise which in turn could be relevant to its knowledge of conditions pertaining to the dock, it was not necessary to make mention of defendant\u2019s status as a leader in the field of marine engineering in the manner and with the frequency that plaintiff\u2019s counsel did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-15\"><em>It is the Court\u2019s belief that the foregoing course of conduct may have well influenced the jury\u2019s determination on damages </em>... . (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">The City thereafter advised the District Court that it would decline to accept the remittitur, and would instead proceed to a new trial on the issue of damages. The court then ordered a new trial solely on the issue of damages, with the trial date to be set following this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">The comments which are at issue here began early in the City\u2019s opening statement to the jury, when Nick DeVito, an Assistant Law Director of the City, stated that \u201cthe defendant is Peter Kiewit and Sons, a corporation whose headquarters are in Omaha, Nebraska . . . Peter Kiewit is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the largest construction corporations.\u201d Counsel for Kiewit promptly objected; the Court explained that \u201cif they (plaintiff) can prove that in their evidence, I will overrule the objection, but if they can\u2019t, I will then admonish the jury to disregard it.\u201d Mr. DeVito then proceeded to tell the jury that \u201cPeter Kiewit Co. is one of the largest construction corporations in the United States ... it has international operations throughout the world. Its marine division is headquartered in New Jersey, and . you will have . . . testimony . . from some of its executives from that part of the country.\u201d Mr. DeVito then stated that Kiewit, in 1973, \u201cwas awarded approximately a $9 million contract with the United States Corps of Army Engineers.\u201d Kiewit\u2019s attorney objected, but was overruled by the court. Counsel for the City then repeated his statement about the $9 million contract. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s opening statement, the court admonished the jury as to Mr. DeVito\u2019s remarks that Kiewit was one of the nation\u2019s largest construction companies, and that the defendant had a $9 million contract with the Corps. The court instructed the jury that \u201cthese two statements standing by themselves are not to be considered in your deliberations the fact that they were large or that they had a large monetary contract with the United States government has no bearing on the case whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">During direct examination of Robert Jones, a witness for the City, Mr. DeVito, referring to Kiewit, inquired \u201cHow big a company is that?\u201d Counsel for Kiewit promptly objected, but the Court permitted Jones to answer that defendant had \u201ca rather large, good credit rating\u201d and was a large corporation. Mr. DeVito asked where Kiewit was headquartered, and Jones responded \u201cOmaha, Nebraska.\u201d Mr. DeVito also inquired whether Kiewit had a marine division, and where it was headquartered; Jones replied that defendant\u2019s marine division headquarters was located in Tenafly, New Jersey. Counsel for the City then asked: \u201cDo you know the size of the contract that they had with the federal government?\u201d Kiewit\u2019s attorney objected immediately, and was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">During cross-examination of William Bo-gas, a witness for the City, the attorney representing Kiewit asked several questions concerning a provision of the permit agreement, under the terms of which Kiewit was obligated to take out a general public liability insurance policy in the amount of $300,-000 and $100,000. The witness acknowledged that the City was named as an additional insured, so that the insurance protected the City as well as Kiewit from liability to third persons. The witness testified that he did not know whether the City had made any claims under the policy for damage to the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Later, on redirect, the following exchange between Mr. DeVito and witness Bogas transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">Q: Are you aware of the contract between Peter Kiewit and the Corps of Engineers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">Q: Do you know approximately the amount of that contract?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Counsel for Kiewit immediately objected, and the court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Jack Frakes, a Kiewit employee who testified on behalf of the defendant, was asked on direct examination about the permit agreement\u2019s insurance provisions. Frakes acknowledged that the City had drafted the provisions, calling for a general public liability insurance policy with $100,000 and $300,000 limits, and, further, that Kiewit complied with the provisions and obtained said insurance which, as required by the contract, named the City as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">On cross-examination, DeVito asked Frakes whether Kiewit \u201cis a pretty big corporation?\u201d Frakes answered: \u201cIt is a fair-sized corporation.\u201d DeVito then inquired \u201chow large\u201d Kiewit was in the field of marine engineering. The trial court permitted the witness to answer over objection. DeVito persisted in asking \u201chow big\u201d the defendant was, and finally the court interrupted: \u201cI have already admonished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the jury that the largeness of the company doesn\u2019t make any difference as far as the verdict is concerned in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Subsequently during the cross-examination of Frakes, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">Q: You talked about insurance. You did take out insurance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">Q: And you did have the City of Cleveland as an additional insured?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">Q: And wasn\u2019t that in relation to claims from third parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">A: Yes, sir, liability insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-11\">Keenen (counsel for Kiewit): Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-12\">Court: Are you talking about liability insurance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-13\">DeVito: Yes. I mean, Mr. Keenen represents an insurance company, doesn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-14\">Keenen: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-15\">Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-16\">DeVito: Well, you tell me: Is there insurance involved in this particular case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-17\">Keenen: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-18\">Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-19\">Keenen: I think that is highly prejudicial, your Honor, He asked three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-20\">Court: I will ask the jury to disregard that. Whether there is or not has no bearing on this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-21\">DeVito: Now, Peter Kiewit has many claims against it in various places throughout the world?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-22\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-23\">Keenen: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-24\">Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-25\">DeVito: Are you familiar with various claims and lawsuits against Peter Kiewit Co.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-26\">Keenen: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-27\">Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-28\">During cross-examination of defense witness Saada, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-29\">DeVito: Now, you talked about insurance just briefly. You said that you can only get insurance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-30\">Court: Just one minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-31\">Denny (counsel for Kiewit): Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-32\">Court: I don\u2019t recall anything about insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-33\">Keenen: I can\u2019t recall anything about it. It is prejudicial at this point anyway. This is the third or fourth time he has done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-34\">Court: I am going to sustain the objection, and I am going to admonish counsel that he is not to talk about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-35\">DeVito: I would like to approach the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-36\">Court: No. You can take exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-37\">DeVito: I am not talking about insurance in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-38\">Court: I am not going to permit you to ask these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-39\">Q: You have talked about buildings and you talked about buildings having a useful life; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-40\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-41\">Q: And you also talked about the limit to which someone could acquire insurance on a building, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-42\">A: The limits. My statement went something like that. I doubt very much anybody would give you insurance for something built for more than 50 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-43\">DeVito: Your Honor, if I may and I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Court, this is something he testified to earlier, and this is what I was going to ask him about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-44\">Court: That you may do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-45\">During his closing argument, Mr. DeVito again mentioned that Kiewit had undertaken a \u201cseven or eight million dollar job, whatever it was that they were doing for the Corps of Engineers.\u201d Counsel for Kiewit promptly objected to the mention of said contract, which had not been admitted into evidence, and the Court admonished Mr. DeVito \u201cnot to comment on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-46\">During his summation, Mr. Keenen, representing Kiewit, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>As far as the insurance permit that opposing counsel says is in the contract, read it for yourself. You will find that the City is the named insured, so that if there is any coverage under that contract for Peter Kiewit, the same coverage belongs to the City, and they could collect fully the limit in that policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">DeVito: Your Honor, I am going to object. That insurance was for third\u2014 Court: I will sustain the objection. The insurance in the contract, so there will be no misunderstanding, is with reference to third party liability, and not as between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">DeVito: That insurance does not extend between Peter Kiewit and the City, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">Court: They can read the contract for themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">In his rebuttal, Mr. DeVito stated that Kiewit was \u201ca $75 million corporation in the marine engineering field.\u201d Mr. Keenen objected, and the Court, in sustaining the objection, admonished DeVito: \u201cNow, you have done this before, Mr. DeVito, and I am going to have to reprimand you. I have said the size of the corporation makes no difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Finally, in concluding his summation, Mr. DeVito told the Jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">I respectfully request that you discharge your responsibility in your own conscience as best you can and that you find for the City of Cleveland and that you make us whole and hold Peter Kiewit responsible for the damage that they have caused to the taxpayers of the City of Cleveland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADkJ\">In his charge to the jury, Judge Green instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">This case should be considered and decided by you as an action between persons of equal standing in the community, of equal worth, and holding the same or similar stations in life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">Both the plaintiff, a municipal corporation, and the defendant, a private corporation, stand equal before the law, and are to be dealt with as equals in a court of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">Kiewit was entitled to a fair trial but, as we have pointed out, did not receive it because of the pervasive misconduct of counsel for the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">It is Kiewit\u2019s position that counsel for the City was attempting to influence the jury that Kiewit was a huge corporation, protected by insurance, playing on the prejudices of the jurors as taxpayers of Cleveland, against the interests of a large out-of-state corporation. Kiewit acknowledges that the court made every reasonable effort short of mistrial and contempt to negate the effect of the improper comments. Kiewit contends that it is impossible to eradicate from the minds of jurors and thoughts which are planted there and the prejudices thus aroused. Kiewit emphasizes that the alleged misconduct was not isolated but rather permeated the entire trial from the beginning to the end. Kiewit urges that the excessive verdict (as indicated by the fact that the remittitur was one half of the jury\u2019s verdict), combined with the inflammatory comments by trial counsel for the City, demonstrates that prejudice was inherent. Kiewit argues that the District Court is not entitled to undue deference in determining the prejudicial effect, for the demeanor and veracity of witnesses are not at issue here. Finally, stressing that, the District Judge, in his memorandum opinion, concluded that counsel\u2019s misconduct may well have influenced the jury\u2019s determination on damages, Kiewit asserts that it is thus impossible to say that the influence did not spill over into the jury\u2019s consideration of liability as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">In response, the City maintains that the topic of insurance was first raised by Kiew-it\u2019s attorney. (Appellant disputes this, arguing that its reference to insurance related to a public liability policy designed to protect both Kiewit and the City in the event of third-party claims, which policy was part of the permit agreement and did not serve to protect Kiewit if the City asserted a claim against it.) Pointing out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>that Kiewit had conceded that the jury was properly instructed, the City emphasizes that, in each instance where Kiewit objected to a question about the size of the company or the existence of insurance coverage, the trial court made a prompt ruling which precluded answer, or appropriately admonished the jury. Claiming that the mention of insurance in a case of this length and complexity would have no effect on the outcome of the verdict, the City insists that the practice of carrying insurance, particularly by construction contractors, is common knowledge. The City asserts that its questions about Kiewit\u2019s size concerned the issue of due care in the negligence count, and were intended to elicit Kiewit\u2019s level of knowledge about the dock, as well as Kiewit\u2019s ability to obtain additional information through its own testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The City argues that any potential prejudice was dissipated by objection and the court\u2019s instructions, and suggests that the impact of the comments was blunted by the six-day trial. Finally, the City contends that the trial court is in a far better position than an appellate court, to judge the effect of alleged trial misconduct. This argument is not persuasive in a case like this where the misconduct is so pervasive as to require action of an appellate court in the proper performance of its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">This Court agrees that \u201cthe determination of the extent of permissible comment and argument by counsel rests primarily in the judicial discretion of the lower court.\u201d <em>Twachtman v. Connelly, </em>106 F.2d 501, 509 (6th Cir. 1939). See also <em>Draper v. Airco, Inc., </em>580 F.2d 91, 94 (3rd Cir. 1978). Indeed, \u201cwhether misconduct in a trial of a cause of action is of such a nature that a fair or impartial verdict cannot be reached is in the first instance for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Travelers Fire Ins. Co. v. Ranney-Davis Mercantile Co., </em>173 F.2d 844, 851 (10th Cir. 1949). \u201cThe trial court is, of necessity, clothed with a great deal of discretion in determining whether an objectionable question is so prejudicial as to require a retrial . . . The trial court is in a far better position to measure the effect of an improper question on the jury than an appellate court which reviews only the cold record.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., </em>527 F.2d 528, 531 (8th Cir. 1975). See also <em>Travelers Fire Ins. Co., supra </em>at 851. It is for this reason that this Court has declared that \u201cthe power to set aside verdict for misconduct of counsel should be sparingly exercised on appeal.\u201d <em>Twacht-man, supra </em>at 509. Yet, although appellate courts \u201care always reluctant to grant a mistrial because of counsel\u2019s prejudicial statements when the (trial) court has declined to do so,\u201d <em>Draper, supra </em>at 97; see also <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Harrington, </em>274 F.2d 323, 327 (5th Cir. 1960), it is nevertheless clear that \u201ccounsel should not introduce extraneous matters before a jury or, by questions or remarks, endeavor to bring before it unrelated subjects, and, where there is a reasonable probability that the verdict of a jury has been influenced by such conduct, it should be set aside.\u201d <em>Twachtman, supra </em>at 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">In determining whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the verdict of a jury has been influenced\u201d by improper conduct, warranting that the verdict be set aside, a court must examine, on a case-by-case basis, the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the comments, their frequency, their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury, the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments, the strength of the case (e. g. whether it is a close case), and the verdict itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">In the case at bar, counsel for the City almost continuously sought to plant the seed in the minds of the jurors that Kiewit was a very large corporation with international operations. In addition to the comments recounted above, Mr. DeVito made several other remarks, and asked other questions designed to convey to the jury the image of the defendant as a giant in the field of marine engineering. For example, plaintiff\u2019s trial counsel managed to inform the jury that defendant\u2019s headquarters was located at \u201c1000 Kiewit Plaza\u201d leaving it for the jurors to draw the inevitable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ence that defendant was a huge corporation. Similarly, Mr. DeVito suggested that Kiewit employed several attorneys at its headquarters. Since the Kiewit name is not, among the general public, synonymous with a \u201ccorporate giant,\u201d as, for example, IBM or General Motors would be, it is unlikely that the jurors would have been aware of defendant\u2019s size had Mr. DeVito not strived to so inform them at every opportunity. It was obviously an appeal to passion and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The City has advanced the contention that its comments about Kiewit\u2019s stature were intended to show that defendant\u2019s ability and experience would enable it to determine the condition of the dock in advance of entering the agreement and beginning operations. Indeed, the court below noted that \u201cthere was a tenable argument that defendant\u2019s size was relevant to the question of its expertise which in turn could be relevant to its knowledge of conditions pertaining to the dock.\u201d Yet, the trial court emphasized that \u201cit was not necessary to make mention of defendant\u2019s status as a leader in the field of marine engineering in the manner and with the frequency that plaintiff\u2019s counsel did.\u201d It seems clear that plaintiff could have demonstrated defendant\u2019s knowledge and expertise in a much less prejudicial (and perhaps an even more direct and effective) manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">This court has said, in a diversity case governed by Ohio law, that \u201cevidence as to the poverty or wealth of a party to an action is inadmissible in a negligence action.\u201d <em>Eisenhauer v. Burger, </em>431 F.2d 833, 837 (6th Cir. 1970). \u201cAppealing to the sympathy of jurors through references to financial disparity is improper.\u201d <em>Draper v. Airco, Inc., </em>580 F.2d 91, 95 (3rd Cir. 1978). The Third Circuit in <em>Draper </em>explained that: The cumulative thrust of plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument . . . was that be-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">cause the defendants were rich (giants of the industrial world) and because the plaintiff was poor, the jury should base its verdict in favor of plaintiff on this financial disparity. But justice is not dependent upon the wealth or poverty of the parties and a jury should not be urged to predicate its verdict on a prejudice against bigness or wealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">In <em>Draper, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel repeatedly referred to a $7 million contract between defendant Aireo and U. S. Steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">In Ohio, a \u201cgreat number of cases . have condemned arguments of counsel contrasting the wealth and poverty or strength and weakness, of the opposing litigants, appealing to prejudice against a party to an action because it is a corporation, or corporation of a particular class . . . \u201d 53 Ohio Jur.2d Section 270, pp. 185-186. The Supreme Court of Ohio articulated the general rule in <em>Hudock v. Ry. Co., </em>164 Ohio St. 493, 498-499, 132 N.E.2d 108 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-12\">in damage actions in which compensatory damages only are recoverable, evidence is not admissible, directly or indirectly, to show the wealth or financial standing of either the plaintiff or the defendant, except in those exceptional cases, such as actions for defamation or injury to reputation, where the position or wealth of the parties is necessarily involved in determining the damages sustained. It has ever been the theory of our government and a cardinal principle of our jurisprudence that the rich and poor stand alike in courts of justice and that neither the wealth of one nor the poverty of the other shall be permitted to affect the administration of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">See <em>Book </em>v. <em>Erskine &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>154 Ohio St. 391, 399-401, 96 N.E.2d 289, 293 (1951) (statements relating to the poverty of one of the parties or the wealth of the other \u201care clearly calculated to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the need of an injured party for compensation rather than the real issues in the case\u201d and have been held to be prejudicial error).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">Counsel for the City, as noted above, also made several comments, and asked several questions, which were intended to inform and emphasize that Kiewit had its corporate \u201cresidence in another state.\u201d <em>Smith v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em>438 F.2d 373, 375 (6th Cir.) <em>cert. den. </em>404 U.S. 832, 92 S.Ct. 79, 30 L.Ed.2d 62 (1971). Here, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number><em>Smith, </em>\u201c[T]he remarks were . . . obviously designed to prejudice the jurors. Taken alone the statements may well have been prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The other topic about which counsel for the City made improper and prejudicial references was insurance. Although it is true that it was counsel for Kiewit who first brought up the subject of insurance, the insurance to which he referred was the general public liability insurance policy required under the permit agreement with the City, which protected both Kiewit and the City from claims by third parties. The Court below correctly observed that this \u201cmention of insurance was inevitable in the course of the trial by reason of the fact that matters of insurance coverage were included in the contracts between the parties.\u201d However, it was counsel for the plaintiff who interjected the subject of <em>another </em>insurance policy \u2014 one covering Kiewit in the instant litigation, and one under which Mr. Keenen was allegedly representing Kiewit at trial. See generally <em>Messinger v. Neipling, </em>20 Ohio L.Abs. 610 (6th District Court of Appeals 1935). Counsel for plaintiff asked three times whether there was \u201cinsurance in this case right now,\u201d and whether \u201cMr. Keenen represents an insurance company.\u201d Thus, while mention of the contractually-mandated insurance may have been inevitable, it was prejudicial error for counsel for the City to inject into the trial the idea that Kiewit had insurance which would cover any damages the defendant would be obliged to pay. Indeed, \u201cthe impropriety of surreptiously giving to the jury in negligence actions the idea that a verdict for the plaintiff will, in the last instance, fall upon a liability insurance company rather than upon the nominal defendant is widely recognized.\u201d 53 Ohio Jur.2d Section 270, p. 187. \u201cKnowledge of defendant\u2019s insurance has traditionally been treated as fruit of the forbidden tree.\u201d <em>Stehura v. Short </em>(1974) 39 Ohio App.2d 68, 70, 315 N.E.2d 492. Without question, \u201ca trial lawyer is treading on dangerous ground and always approaches grounds for a mistrial by the mere mention of insurance when same is not at issue.\u201d <em>White v. Standard Oil Co., </em>116 Ohio App. 212, 220, 187 N.E.2d 504, 509 (Court of Appeals for Marion County, 1962). See also <em>Vega, Admr. v. Evans, </em>128 Ohio St. 535, 191 N.E. 757 (1934). This is not a case where disclosure of insurance was accidental, inadvertent, or an ambiguous or oblique reference, or incidentally interjected by a witness into an unresponsive answer. <em>Heuss v. Rockwell Standard Corp., </em>495 F.2d 1207, 1209-1210 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Smith v. Boggia, </em>200 F.2d 604, 605 (2nd Cir. 1952); <em>Gleaton v. Green, </em>156 F.2d 459, 461 (4th Cir. 1946); <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Southern Bakeries Company, </em>247 F.Supp. 782, 788 (D.S.C.1965). Instead, here, the subject of insurance coverage for defendant in this action was pointedly, unambiguously, repeatedly, and \u201cdeliberately brought out by counsel,\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>for the City. \u201cThe general principle that the voluntary or intentional introduction into evidence, either directly or indirectly, by the plaintiff of the fact that a defendant in a tort action is protected by liability insurance, is prejudicial error and grounds for a mistrial, is well settled.\u201d <em>Gleaton, supra. </em>As the Court in <em>Radinsky v. Ellis, </em>167 F.2d 745, 746 (D.C.Cir. 1948), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">In a case such as this, when the existence of insurance protection in favor of the defendant is shown to the jury, a mistrial should be declared forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">It is not necessary for this court to \u201crely on any of the individual instances or types of impropriety.\u201d <em>Draper, supra </em>at 97. This, as alluded to previously, was not a case of a single, isolated, or inadvertent comment. Rather, the improprieties permeated the entire trial, from opening statement through closing argument, in \u201ca continuing pattern of misconduct.\u201d <em>Harris, supra </em>at 532. The remarks \u201cwere persistently made over the recurring and almost constant objection of counsel for the appellant,\u201d <em>Book, supra, </em>154 Ohio St. at 397, 96 N.E.2d at 292, and were repeated even though Judge Green sustained the objections and admonished the jury. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s counsel even persisted after the trial court explicitly reprimanded him for his misconduct. The cumulative effect of counsel\u2019s remarks undoubtedly served to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>leave the intended, indelible impression upon the minds of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Counsel\u2019s comments are even more significant when viewed in light of the close nature of this case. As the Supreme Court of Ohio was wisely cautioned, \u201cin a case where the factual questions to be determined are so apparently in near equipoise the incidents of a trial which tend to arouse passion or prejudice should be closely scrutinized.\u201d <em>Book, supra </em>at 403, 96 N.E.2d at 295. In the case at bar, the factual question of causality is particularly troublesome, for there was no direct proof that Kiewit\u2019s actions in any way caused or contributed to the collapse of the dock. The collapses occurred on October 24, yet Kiewit had completed the slag loading operation on October 6 and had vacated the dock on October 8. Moreover, the portion that collapsed included only a small section of the area which had been leased to Kiewit; the major portion of the area that collapsed was not within the section which Kiewit had earlier occupied. In light of the age of Dock 34, it may very well have simply collapsed of its own weight. The doctrine of res ipsa loqui-tur certainly did not apply. Finally, Judge Green said that \u201cdefendant\u2019s arguments regarding plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and conduct are founded on evidence in the record and might be sufficient to convince the Court, as trier of fact, that plaintiff should not recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In light of the foregoing, the curative instructions which the trial court eventually chose to give were plainly, \u201cnot sufficient to remove the probability of prejudice.\u201d <em>Draper, supra </em>at 97. As the Fifth Circuit has so accurately observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">the bench and bar are both aware that cautionary instructions are effective only up to a certain point. There must be a line drawn in any trial where, after repeated exposure of a jury to prejudicial information, . . . cautionary instructions will have little, if any, effect in eliminating the prejudicial harm. <em>O\u2019Rear </em>v. <em>Fruehauf Corp., </em>554 F.2d 1304, 1309 (5th Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Furthermore, the excessive size of the verdict demonstrates the prejudicial effect of counsel\u2019s comments. See <em>Hudock, supra, </em>164 Ohio St. at 500, 132 N.E.2d 108; <em>Book, supra, </em>154 Ohio St. at 404, 96 N.E.2d 289; <em>Cleve. Ry. Co. v. Crooks, </em>130 Ohio St. 255, 257,198 N.E. 867 (1935); <em>Gibbons v. B. &amp; O. Rd. Co., </em>92 Ohio App. 87, 98, 109 N.E.2d 511 (Court of Appeals for Lucas County 1952). The jury awarded a verdict of $350,000 plus interest. Plaintiff\u2019s own expert witnesses estimated the cost of repair to be $310,000 or $470,000, respectively. Yet, when repaired, Dock 34, which had no useful commercial life as early as 1968, would have an estimated useful commercial life of fifty years. Thus, thanks to the jury\u2019s verdict, the City would, in effect, receive a new dock, something which the City did not have prior to the collapse. The trial court was \u201cconvinced that the verdict is grossly excessive\u201d, indicating \u201cthat the amount of the verdict may have been influenced in that regard by conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel,\u201d and so ordered a remittitur upon the verdict to $175,000. The Supreme Court of Ohio declared in <em>Hudock, supra, </em>164 Ohio St. at 499, 132 N.E.2d at 112, that, \u201cif the jury was influenced by this incompetent testimony appealing to its sympathy, the remittitur did not erase the prejudicial error.\u201d This Court is likewise of the opinion that the remittitur ordered below does not, and cannot, erase the prejudicial error deliberately injected by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. In <em>Draper, supra </em>... at 97, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">A jury which is prejudiced with respect to its finding of liability is not likely to be free from prejudice in awarding damages. Because there is a substantial probability that the error which affected the liability verdict also affected the determination of damages, the new trial must deal with both liability and damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">This Court believes that the spillover of prejudice discussed in <em>Draper </em>may also occur in a case such as this: since the jury was prejudiced with respect to its award of damages, it cannot be said that its finding of liability was free from prejudice. Thus, on remand, \u201cthe new trial must deal with both liability and damages.\u201d It should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>noted that here, a new trial on liability may not create as many inconveniences as might otherwise occur, since the court below has already ordered a new trial on damages, which would very likely involve many of the same witnesses who would testify as to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The record discloses that the District Court had infinite patience in conducting the trial and dealing with the flagrant misconduct of counsel for the City. It made every reasonable endeavor to provide a fair trial for Kiewit short of declaring a mistrial and punishing offending counsel for contempt, but it was to no avail because the misconduct was so pervasive that it made a lasting impression on the jury which was not erased, as is evidenced by the amount of the verdict, and the fact, as found by the court, that the jury did not follow its instructions on betterment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">\u201cThe remarks of counsel here so far exceed the bounds of proper argument that we are bound to reverse the district court.\u201d <em>Draper, supra </em>at 94; see <em>Ayoub v. Spencer, </em>550 F.2d 164, 170 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. den. </em>432 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2952, 53 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1977). Since the prejudicial error here cannot be corrected by re-mittitur, this Court reverses and remands for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">. Of the six members of the jury, three were residents of the City of Cleveland, and the other three resided in Cuyahoga County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\">. During the interval when the City was to consider whether it would accept the remitti-tur, Kiewit took an appeal from the judgment based upon the jury\u2019s verdict and the judgment thereon. Neither party raised or questioned the appealability of said judgment, despite the fact that, later, the district court, upon learning that the City would not accept remittitur, had ordered a new trial solely on the issue of damages. At oral argument before this Court, it was suggested that, in order to obviate the necessity of a determination as to the appeala-bility of the aforementioned judgment, the parties apply to the trial court for certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), that the district court\u2019s order involved a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion, and that an immediate appeal from it might materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. The parties subsequently filed a joint motion to that effect in the district court, which granted the motion. This Court then granted leave to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
