Under surveillance, they proceeded to a Denver motel and checked in, changing rooms later that afternoon. Still later they began entering and leaving room 1014 of the motel and observing the parking lot through that room\u2019s curtains. About 8:00 that evening a white Ford Pinto arrived and Britt Reynolds emerged and entered room 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-27\">In addition to its outside entrance, room 1014 contained a door leading into the motel\u2019s hallway. While Reynolds met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Burns and Andrade, Special Agent Ralph Lockridge was positioned outside the hallway door. Agent Lockridge heard the outside door open and someone say, \u201cHey, Britt, what\u2019s happening?\u201d Subsequently, he heard \u201cunwrapping of plastic,\u201d then \u201csniffing, snorting-type sounds,\u201d and references to \u201cit\u201d as being \u201creally good\u201d and \u201cthe third eye.\u201d He also heard remarks about money.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Reynolds left with a brown paper sack, drove off in the Pinto and promptly was arrested. Burns and Andrade were arrested emerging into the motel hallway. An-drade was carrying a flight bag and the same style of briefcase Burns had possessed at the airport. Burns was carrying a suit-ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A police dog trained to detect with his sense of smell various narcotics, including cocaine, was brought to the room, where his reactions indicated the presence of narcotics in the briefcase and suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">A warrant was procured authorizing searches of the Pinto and room 1014. A brown paper sack situated on the front passenger\u2019s seat of the automobile contained $13,430.00. The briefcase in the motel room contained a plastic bag filled with a white substance later determined to be 100 percent cocaine, and the suitcase\u2019s contents included a triple beam scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Burns, Andrade and Reynolds were indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. A superseding indictment further alleged actual distribution. At the conclusion of the trial\u2019s evidence, the court removed the distribution charge from the jury\u2019s consideration, on grounds that the government\u2019s proof failed thereon as a matter of law. All three defendants were found guilty of possession with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">On appeal, the legality of the warrant underlying the searches of room 1014 and Reynolds\u2019 Pinto is challenged. Other issues raised involve the admissibility of the currency found in Reynolds\u2019 car, certain jury instructions, and the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">To be constitutional, a search warrant must issue only upon probable cause. This requires more than mere suspicion but less evidence than is necessary to convict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brinklow, </em>560 F.2d 1003 (10th Cir. 1977). Sufficient facts are required for a reasonably prudent person to believe that a search of the described premises would uncover evidence of a crime. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>500 F.2d 305 (10th Cir. 1974). Probability of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause. <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S.Ct. 584, 590, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The facts presented to the issuing judge in this case satisfied that standard. The agent\u2019s \u201caffidavit for search warrant\u201d was detailed and persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">It stated that \u201ca reliable informant . reliable on numerous occasions in the past, dating back to 1972,\u201d whose assistance had \u201cresulted in seizures of narcotics and arrests,\u201d alerted San Diego drug enforcement agents that Burns and Andrade would be traveling to Denver, Colorado, on July 28, 1978, with $30,000 to $50,000 for purposes of buying cocaine. It recited that this and other information provided by the informant, as to the two men\u2019s flight number and their physical appearances, were relayed to agents in Denver. The affidavit also detailed surveillance of Burns and An-drade from their arrival in Denver to their arrest, including Britt Reynolds\u2019 visit to room 1014 and Agent Lockridge\u2019s account of remarks overheard at that time. The affidavit described the arrests of all three appellants and the police dog\u2019s subsequent role, and briefly related the dog\u2019s training and qualifications. The affidavit was more than ample in providing probable cause to believe that an illicit drug transaction had occurred in room 1014 and that evidence thereof could be found both in room 1014 and Reynolds\u2019 Pinto.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Appellants assert that such information was inadequate because the informant\u2019s identity and reliability were not established and the assertion that Burns and Andrade would leave the Denver airport and drive to Colorado Springs was discredited by police surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>We need not consider only the informant\u2019s story. A tip insufficient in itself may still be a factor in the magistrate\u2019s determination. <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>supra, 393 U.S. at 418, 89 S.Ct. at 590. It may be buttressed by independent observations substantiating its details or by observations of activity reasonably arousing suspicion itself. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>556 F.2d 1312 (5th Cir. 1977). The sum total of information in the affidavit provides the basis for determining probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Here, the informant\u2019s contribution was not inconsequential. The past reliability of the informant was presented in the affidavit, a significant fact in assessing credibility. <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). Also, the accuracy of much of his information was independently corroborated by Denver agents and bolstered by the general character of appellants\u2019 activities during the eight hours preceding their arrests. When all available factors are considered, including agent Lockridge\u2019s perceptions of the transaction in room 1014 and the subsequent reactions of the trained police dog to appellants\u2019 baggage, the issuing judge\u2019s determination is not subject to reasonable challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Appellants assert that agent Lock-ridge\u2019s eavesdropping was unconstitutional and that the search warrant\u2019s products were illegal fruits. They rely upon <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), in which warrantless electronic eavesdropping on a telephone booth was proscribed. The court emphasized therein the Fourth Amendment\u2019s concern with people, rather than places, and condemned the invasion of the phone booth occupant\u2019s justifiable expectations of privacy. Nothing in that court\u2019s ruling would have served to suppress testimony of the phone conversation from one standing by the telephone booth. In <em>Katz, </em>the phone booth user \u201cspoke under circumstances in which a reasonable person would assume that uninvited ears were not listening.\u201d Mr. Justice White concurring, <em>Katz v. United States, </em>supra, at 363, 88 S.Ct. at 518. This was because the unimpaired vision that attends use of a transparent phone booth afforded him the reasonable conclusion that no listener was in the vicinity. Legitimate privacy expectations cannot be separated from a conversation\u2019s context. Bedroom whispers in the middle of a large house on a large, private tract of land carry quite different expectations of privacy, reasonably speaking, than does a boisterous conversation occurring in a crowded supermarket or subway. Expectations attaching to a motel conversation must fall somewhere in between. Motel occupants possess the justifiable expectation that if their conversation is conducted in a manner undetectable outside their room by the electronically unaided ear, that it will go unintercepted. Contrarily, to the extent they converse in a fashion insensitive to the public, or semi-public, nature of walkways adjoining such rooms, reasonable expectations of privacy are correspondingly lessened. <em>United States v. Fisch, </em>474 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">What a person knowingly exposes is not constitutionally protected from observation. <em>Katz v. United States, </em>supra. Neither are activities or objects which are exposed, regardless of subjective intent, in a manner inconsistent with reasonable expectations of privacy. <em>United States v. Bruneau, </em>594 F.2d 1190 (8th Cir. 1979). Thus, it is not a \u201csearch\u201d to observe that which occurs openly in public. <em>Trujillo v. United States, </em>294 F.2d 583 (10th Cir. 1961). Nor is it a search when a law enforcement officer makes visual observations from a vantage point he rightfully occupies. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orozco, </em>590 F.2d 789 (9th Cir. 1979). This applies also to perceptions derived from hearing or smelling. See <em>Cuevas-Ortega v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>588 F.2d 1274 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Agent Lockridge\u2019s eavesdropping was not illegal, and the results thereof were proper and competent evidence. <em>United States v. Fisch, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Appellants also challenge the arresting officer\u2019s use of Smokey, the drug-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>detecting police dog, prior to procurement of a search warrant. Generally, a limited, warrantless search of a motel room incident to the lawful arrest of its occupants is permissible. See <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>466 F.2d 1, 4 (10th Cir. 1972). This principle applies where, as here, the arrest occurs at an entrance way. Additionally, the officers reasonably used the room to secure their prisoners and to maintain temporary custody. Thus, their presence was justifiable. It is well settled that the olfactory activities of a trained police dog legitimately on the premises do not constitute a search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Venema, </em>563 F.2d 1003 (10th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">As stated in a similar case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cIf the police officers here had detected the aroma of the drug through their olfactory senses, there could be no serious contention that their sniffing in the area of the bags would be tantamount to an unlawful search, [citations omitted] We fail to understand how the detection of the odoriferous drug by the use of the sensitive and schooled canine senses here employed alters the situation and renders the police procedure constitutionally suspect.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bronstein, 521 </em>F.2d 459 (2nd Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As of the time of their arrest, appellants\u2019 legitimate expectations with regard to the locked briefcase were that it would remain unopened absent warrant authorization. The dog\u2019s mere sniffing of such did not offend constitutional guarantees. <em>United States v. Venema, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As applied to Reynolds\u2019 automobile, the warrant is attacked for its failure to list currency as the item sought. Appellant Reynolds argues that this failure created a \u201cgeneral search\u201d in violation of Fourth Amendment requirements enunciated in <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U.S. 192, 195, 48 S.Ct. 74, 75, 72 L.Ed. 1016 (1927). The fundamental \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201ctruthfulness\u201d of the warrant\u2019s underlying affidavit is also challenged based on this same omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">A single search warrant was issued as to room 1014 and the Pinto. The objects of the searches, as detailed in the warrant, were \u201cnarcotic drugs,\u201d (defined in the warrant so as to include cocaine), \u201cimplements . used in connection with the manufacture, production, storage, or dispensing of such drugs,\u201d \u201cpersonal property tending to establish the identity of persons in control of contraband,\u201d and \u201crelated paraphernalia consisting in part and including, but not limited to utility company receipts, rent receipts, cancelled mail envelopes, photographs and keys.\u201d We discern, and the record reveals, no lack of good faith or other infirmity as to the warrant\u2019s particularity. When the warrant was issued, probable cause existed to believe that an illicit drug transaction had recently transpired in room 1014 and that evidence thereof could be found both in the room and in the car of the participant who had departed. Items integral to that transaction were being sought. Their exact nature and their location either as to the room or the car were not clear. This rendered neither the warrant nor the search defective. Probable cause for the search existed and was presented to the issuing judge, and the warrant\u2019s language was sufficiently specific to avoid the evils of a \u201cgeneral search,\u201d yet sufficiently flexible to allow seizure of all evidence integral to the crime. Constitutional requirements were met. <em>See Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627, (1976). Ideally, the warrant\u2019s list should have included \u201ccurrency.\u201d However, the seizure of the unlisted money represented no undue exercise of police discretion and no abuse of Fourth Amendment safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Next, Burns and Andrade assert that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain their convictions as to the essential element of \u201cintent to distribute.\u201d They argue that the only evidence as to intent was a chemist\u2019s testimony that the seized cocaine was 100 percent pure, and that due to a complete absence of expert testimony as to that fact\u2019s relevance, no sufficient basis was presented for finding intent to distribute. This represents an overly restrictive view both of the evidence and the jury\u2019s function. In reviewing the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>dence\u2019s sufficiency, an appellate court must view the evidence, and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, in determining whether the record discloses substantial evidence supportive of the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellants\u2019 guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Brinklow, </em>560 F.2d 1008 (10th Cir. 1977). From this perspective, the following scenario emerges.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Burns and Andrade flew from San Diego to Denver, rented a car, and drove to a Denver motel where a room had been reserved for the express purpose of conducting a drug purchase. Reynolds arrived at the room later that evening with the cocaine, a sale was completed using weighing scales carried from California for that purpose, and Reynolds departed after being paid more than $13,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Frequently, juries are instructed, and correctly so, that they are permitted to draw from facts which they find have been proved such reasonable inferences as are justified in the light of experience. See, for example, Devitt and Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, \u00a7 11.11 (3rd ed. 1977). Even absent explicit instruction, this function is integral to their deliberations. It was by no means unreasonable to infer, as the jury did, that Burns and Andrade intended to distribute the cocaine, rather than personally consume it. The jurors had an opportunity to view and examine the quantity involved and to infer that it had been sold for over $13,000. The drug\u2019s purity and the general circumstances surrounding the sale, including the trip from San Diego to Denver, the rented motel room, and the weighing equipment employed, all tended to demonstrate a sophisticated and expensive operation with larger designs than provision for Burns and Andrade\u2019s personal use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Doubtless the government\u2019s proof could have been more expansive on this issue. Nonetheless, to challenge the reasonableness of the jury\u2019s verdict on this point is to impute to them an unwarranted naivet\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">This discussion of the evidentiary significance of the cash recovered from Reynolds\u2019 car disposes, ipso facto, of the contention that the money\u2019s irrelevance rendered it inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Appellants contend that they were entitled to have the jury consider the \u201clesser included offense\u201d of mere possession (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844), which carried a less severe penalty than did possession \u201cwith intent to distribute.\u201d Rule 31 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the defendant may be found guilty of \u201can offense necessarily included in the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">\u201cAlthough the lesser included offense doctrine developed at common law to assist the prosecution in cases where the evidence failed to establish some element of the offense originally charged, it is now beyond dispute that the defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find him guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.\u201d <em>Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1995, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">In <em>Larson v. United States, </em>296 F.2d 80, 81 (10th Cir. 1961), the defendant was convicted of stealing property with a value in excess of $100 (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661) and he appealed the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on the lesser offense of theft of government property without regard to value, which was a misdemeanor. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">\u201cAn essential element and, indeed, the gravamen of the offense charged under \u00a7 661, is the theft of property. Proof of this element, regardless of the value of the thing stolen, establishes no less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the misdemeanor set forth in the statute. Subsequent proof that the thing stolen had a value in excess of $100.00 bears only upon the penalty which may be imposed. Stated differently, the crime of stealing property valued in excess of $100.00 necessarily includes, as an integral step in its commission, a theft of property. This theft, standing alone, is a lesser offense, necessarily included in the offense charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In reversing the conviction, the court held that the failure to accede to a timely and appropriate request for submission to the jury of a lesser offense, \u201cwithdraws from the jury a measure of defense to which the defendant is entitled.\u201d <em>Larson v. United States, </em>supra, at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">In <em>Larson, </em>the court relied upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Berra v. United States, </em>351 U.S. 131, 76 S.Ct. 685, 100 L.Ed. 1013 (1956), which reviewed a conviction for willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes by filing \u201cfalse and fraudulent\u201d tax returns in violation of 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) \u00a7 145(b). The defendant appealed the trial judge\u2019s refusal to submit for jury consideration the \u201clesser crime\u201d under 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) \u00a7 3616(a), of delivering to the Internal Revenue Service \u201cany false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made . . . .\u201d The charged offense was a felony, whereas the latter crime was a misdemeanor. The court upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal because the facts necessary to prove each crime were identical, and thus, submitting the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction to the jury \u201cwould not have added any other issue [of fact] for the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Berra </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 135, 76 S.Ct. at 688. Application of the misdemeanor statute did not invoke a \u201clesser crime\u201d because its elements were coextensive with those of the charged offense. Significantly, however, the court observed: \u201cIn a case <em>where some of the elements </em>of the crime charged themselves <em>constitute a lesser crime, </em>the defendant, if the evidence justified it, would no doubt be entitled to an instruction which would permit a finding of guilt of the lesser offense.\u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>Berra v. United States, </em>supra at 134, 76 S.Ct. at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Certain commonly recognized prerequisites attend a defendant\u2019s right to a \u201clesser offense\u201d instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">1. The defendant must properly and timely request such an instruction. <em>Larson v. United States, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>526 F.2d 764 (10th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">2. A \u201clesser offense\u201d must apply, comprised of some, but not all, of the essential elements of the offense charged. Rule 31, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; <em>Berra v. United States, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">3. The evidence must permit a jury rationally to convict of the lesser offense, but acquit of the offense charged. <em>Keeb-le v. United States, </em>supra; <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">In <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>supra, an inmate at Leavenworth penitentiary charged with first degree murder requested that the jury be allowed to consider lesser degrees of homicide. The government\u2019s evidence tended to show that Coppola contracted with certain other inmates to have another inmate killed. Coppola argued that he did not participate in the killing in any fashion. At issue was Coppola\u2019s involvement, not whether such involvement constituted some lesser degree of homicide than first degree murder. The jury could not rationally have acquitted on the charged offense, but convicted on a lesser offense. Thus, the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct as requested was upheld on appeal. If no evidentiary controversy focuses on elements of the offense charged which are not part of the \u201clesser offense,\u201d then no \u201clesser offense\u201d instruction is appropriate. <em>United States v. Coppola, </em>supra; <em>Sansone v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 343, 350, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 1009, 13 L.Ed.2d 882 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">In <em>United States v. Brischetto, </em>538 F.2d 208 (8th Cir. 1976), a conviction for possession of marijuana \u201cwith intent to distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ute\u201d was reversed because of the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction on mere possession. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201cAn essential element of the offense covered by the indictment is proof of intent to distribute. Such proof is not required for a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 covered by the requested instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">A careful review of the entire record satisfies us that there is substantial evidence to support a conviction on either charge. The evidence in support of the simple possession charge is stronger than that on the intent to distribute charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">* * sjs Jfc sf: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">The Government also relied upon the permissible inference of intent to distribute that can arise from the possession of a large quantity of a controlled substance. Such an inference may be made by the jury, but the jury is not compelled to make the inference, [citations omitted] The possession of the quantity of marijuana here involved is sufficient to permit an inference by the jury of an intent to distribute. However, the jury, on the basis of the evidence before us, was free to determine whether or not to draw the inference. We hold that a dispute in the evidence exists with respect to the issue of defendant\u2019s intent to distribute. Such dispute requires resolution by the jury. A rational basis exists for the jury to convict the defendant on the possession charge and acquit him on the intent to distribute charge. The court erred in denying defendant\u2019s requested instruction.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brischetto, </em>supra, at 209-210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Possession of a controlled substance, relative to the crime of possession of such with intent to distribute, is a prototyp-ai \u201clesser included offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Brischetto, </em>supra; see also <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>497 F.2d 408 (10th Cir. 1974). Burns and Andrade were arrested while in possession of cocaine, but previous to any distribution. We have herein held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s inference that these appellants possessed cocaine with an intent to distribute, but the jury was free also not to draw such inference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Burns and Andrade were entitled to jury consideration of the offense of simple possession (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844). Reynolds\u2019 conviction, on the other hand, necessarily was predicated on the determination that Bums and Andrade came into possession through distribution from Reynolds. Thus, no rational basis existed for concluding that Reynolds was guilty of possession, but without any intent to distribute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">The indictment under which appellants were tried charged distribution as well as possession with intent to distribute, but only the \u201cpossession with intent\u201d charge was tendered for the jury\u2019s consideration. Appellants challenge this occurrence, emphasizing that the jury was presented with the entire indictment, but was never explicitly directed to disregard the distribution charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">It is clear that a court may withdraw from jury consideration indictment counts unsupported by evidence. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>536 F.2d 313 (10th Cir. 1976). The fact that here the court withdrew one of two charges contained in a single count is inconsequential. The controlling principle is that \u201c \u2018. . . a portion of an indictment that the evidence does not support may be withdrawn from the jury, and this is not an impermissible amendment, provided nothing is thereby added to the indictment, and that the remaining allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tions charge an offense.\u2019 (C. Wright, 1 Federal Practice and Procedure 274-75 (1969).)\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>516 F.2d 796 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">A specific caveat to disregard the distribution charge would have been preferable. Nonetheless, the sufficiency of the instructions is not determined by giving or not giving particular instructions, but rather by viewing the instructions as a whole. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beitscher, </em>467 F.2d 269 (10th Cir. 1972). Generally, the court satisfies its duty by giving instructions which sufficiently cover the case and which are correct. <em>United States v. Gurule, </em>437 F.2d 239 (10th Cir. 1970). The court instructed the jury on the essential elements of the offense submitted to them in a clear and correct fashion. No reversible error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Additionally, \u201cpossession\u201d is a \u201cleaser offense\u201d of \u201cdistribution.\u201d See <em>United States v. Klugman, </em>506 F.2d 1378 (8th Cir. 1974). Because the offense of \u201cdistribution\u201d must occur \u201cknowingly or intentionally\u201d [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)], \u201cpossession with intent to distribute\u201d is also a lesser included offense of distribution. Thus, in accordance with our earlier analysis, a finding of guilt as to distribution necessarily establishes the jury\u2019s belief that appellants possessed the cocaine with an intent to distribute. \u201cTo be \u2018necessarily included\u2019 within the meaning of the Rule, the lesser offense must be such that it is impossible to commit the greater without having first committed the lesser.\u201d <em>Larson v. United States, </em>supra, at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The judgment of conviction of Britt Reynolds is affirmed. Those of Michael Burns and Vincent Andrade are reversed and remanded. Based on the analysis contained in <em>United States v. Whitaker, </em>447 F.2d 314, 322 (D.C. Cir. 1971), we hold that the District court may, after hearing all parties and obtaining the government\u2019s consent, set aside the convictions of Burns and Andrade and enter a judgment of conviction for the included offense of mere possession (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844). Alternatively, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ATY\">jg go ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. Evidence of price or quantity of a narcotic possessed is generally relevant to intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Palmere, </em>578 F.2d 105, 108 (5th Cir. 1978). Also, it is a reasonable inference that the purer the drug the more likely it is that it will be \u201ccut\u201d or diluted and resold before being consumed. This is often a matter of common knowledge to television viewers of police dramatizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">. In its brief the government remarks: \u201cWhile obviously the jury was not compelled to draw the inference from [the] evidence that Burns and Andrade had a specific intent to distribute cocaine, sufficient evidence was before them that would allow them to do so.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\">. Appellants stress the trial court\u2019s decision that insufficient evidence was presented to allow the jury to consider the charge of actual distribution. This was certainly true as to Burns and Andrade. However, as to Reynolds the jury obviously concluded that he had distributed the drug because the evidence showed no possession at all by him at the time of his arrest. This conclusion was within the jury\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
