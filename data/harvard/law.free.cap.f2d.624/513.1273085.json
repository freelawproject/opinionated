After consideration of the stipulated facts and an evi-dentiary hearing, the district court held that Audio, the employer, was entitled to excess funds in the plan after its termination. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Audio instituted a benefit pension plan on July 1, 1966, to provide employees, meeting age and service requirements, with monthly benefits upon retirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plan provided for the purchase of individual insurance contracts for the participants and for an auxiliary fund.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It required Audio to pay to the trustees or its insurance carrier, Equitable Life Assurance Company, sufficient funds to finance the plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Audio\u2019s annual contribution was determined by the insurance carrier. The plan qualified for favorable tax treatment from its inception under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, and it was amended in 1975 to comply with ERISA requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">The plan became financially burdensome, so Audio terminated it on June 30, 1976. A subsequent audit disclosed that its assets exceeded the value of the participants\u2019 accrued pension benefits under Article IV by approximately $43,000. Section 11.2 is the critical provision of the plan governing disbursement of its assets upon termination. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-18\">Upon such termination, the Trustees shall transfer to each Participant, by suit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>able instrument of transfer and delivery thereof, all Contracts for his benefit then in the Trustees\u2019 possession, together with an amount equal to the amount received by the Trustees because of the change in the form of insurance policies, if any, as provided for in this Amendment and thereafter the Trustees shall have no further right, title or interest in and to such Contracts. <em>Any funds or other assets held by the Trustees or subsequently reverting to the Trustees from the Auxiliary Fund shall, after deducting estimated expenses for distribution thereof, be distributed among the Participants in an equitable manner. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">This section is complemented by \u00a7 18.4 which prohibits diverting any part of the corpus or income of the trust to purposes other than for the \u201cexclusive benefit\u201d of participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">After receipt of the audit, Audio amended the plan. The amendment was made seven months after its termination, retroactive to the date of termination. The amendment was designed to authorize the trustees to pay Audio the remaining assets by providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">Article 11.2 is deleted and the following substituted in lieu thereof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">11.2\u2014 Upon such termination, the Participants\u2019 rights under the Trust shall be fully vested and such vested interest shall be converted to cash and paid to or for the benefit of the Participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">11.3\u2014 No funds or other assets held or received by the Trustees shall be used for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities to such Participants as provided in Article 11.2. Upon the satisfaction of all liabilities to such Participants, any remaining assets of the Trust shall be repaid to the Employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">18.4\u2014 No part of the corpus or income hereunder shall ever be used or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants, Retirement Participants, and Terminated Participants, or their Beneficiaries prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities to such persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Pension Benefit disapproved the proposed distribution of any of the fund\u2019s assets to Audio. Audio then brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment validating the distribution. Pension Benefit filed a counterclaim asking for distribution of all the assets to the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The district court found for Audio on three grounds. First, it considered the excess payments to the plan to have been a mistake based on \u201cactuarial error.\u201d Further, the district court accepted the amendment as valid. It held that since the excess funds were paid by mistake, the amendment would have no effect on benefits properly accrued to the participants. Alternatively, the court ruled that if the amendment were not valid, it could reform the plan to provide for the terms of the amendment. Finally, the court found that the distribution of excess funds would unjustly enrich the participants at the expense of Audio because the plan fully compensated the employees by paying them the value of their accrued benefits as set forth in Article IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Audio\u2019s pension plan must comply with the statutory requirements of ERISA. Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(c)(1) provides that \u201cthe assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants . . . .\u201d The only relevant exception to this mandate is \u00a7 1344(dXl) on which Audio relies. In plans which are fully funded, the employer is entitled to \u201cresidual assets\u201d if \u201cthe plan provides for such a distribution\u201d without contravening any law. Audio sought to conform the pension plan to this exception by its amendment after termination arguing that ERISA has no prohibition against retroactive amendments. Quoting \u00a7 10.2 of the plan, Audio asserts that it may amend the plan \u201cat any time to any extent it may deem advisable\u201d so long as it does not interfere with the participants\u2019 accrued benefits under Article IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Contrary to Audio\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 10.2 does not allow any amendment to the plan at the employer\u2019s will. Indeed, the power to amend which Audio seeks to exercise is limited by the prefatory clause, \u201cExcept as herein limited . . . Pertinent limitations are set forth in \u00a7 10.2 subsections (b), \u201cno amendment shall have the effect of vesting in the Employer any interest in or control over any Contracts . or any other property subject to the terms of this Trust,\u201d and (d), \u201cno amendment shall have the effect of depriving any then Terminated Participant of the benefits to which he is entitled under this Trust.\u201d Audio therefore had no authority by the terms of the plan to recapture through retroactive amendment funds that it had dedicated to the trust. As we have previously noted, \u00a7 11.2, before its amendment, specifically provided that upon termination such funds would be distributed equitably among the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Furthermore, ERISA afforded Audio no basis for altering the substantive terms of the plan after its termination. Even though the money was held in trust and the trust continued after the contributions ended, authority to vary the participants\u2019 interests ended on June 30, 1976. <em>In re Del Chemical Corp., </em>No. 79-C-250 (E.D. Wis.1979). On the date of termination, Audio no longer was obligated to make contributions, and the participants no longer were entitled to accrue additional benefits. The rights of both parties became fixed, and substantive modifications to the plan altering these rights were precluded. <em>Cf. Rochester Corp. v. Rochester, </em>450 F.2d 118, 120-22 (4th Cir. 1971). The scheme established by ERISA relies upon the provisions of each plan at the time of termination. It would defeat congressional intent and render \u00a7\u00a7 1103(c)(1) and 1344(d)(1) nugatory if retroactive amendments after termination could alter substantive rights of the pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Audio\u2019s reliance on <em>In re </em>C. <em>D. Moyer Co. Trust Fund, </em>441 F.Supp. 1128 (E.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff\u2019d. without opinion, </em>582 F.2d 1273 (3d Cir. 1978), is misplaced. There an amendment providing for the employers recoupment of excess funds was made before termination. Moreover, the <em>Moyer </em>court found: \u201c[The plan\u2019s] elaborate scheme of priorities in the event of revocation or termination . . . makes no provision for the allocation of any remaining funds after all the obligations to the participants have been fulfilled.\u201d From this the court concluded: \u201cA reading of the Plan as a whole convinces me that the parties did not contemplate that at the time of termination there would be an excess due to overfund-ing.\u201d 441 F.Supp. at 1132. In contrast, the Audio plan provides for the creation of an auxiliary fund \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing additional annuities at retirement to provide the retirement benefits.\u201d Also, unlike the <em>Moyer </em>plan, the Audio plan expressly provides for the distribution of assets among the participants upon termination. <em>Moyer, </em>consequently, does not sustain Audio\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Alternatively, Audio seeks affirmance of the district court\u2019s reformation of the plan on the grounds of mistake and unjust enrichment. It relies on the testimony of its president to the effect that \u201cAudio did not intend, nor contemplate, making payments in excess of what was required\u201d to fund the pensions described in Article IV. Pension Benefit objected to the admission of this testimony because it violated the parol evidence rule. Audio, in response, relies on the principle that a court of equity may reform a contract which because of a mistake does not conform to the intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">We conclude that Pension Benefit\u2019s objection to the admissability of this evidence was sound. The plan was a contract between Audio and its employees. <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, </em>438 U.S. 234, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727 (1978). Its terms are clear and unambiguous. In addition to the purchase of the Article IV pensions, it provided for an auxiliary fund and for the distribution upon termination of all funds and assets to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>participants in addition to their pension contracts. Oral testimony is inadmissible to vary its unambiguous written terms. <em>Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp. v. Wertz, </em>282 F.2d 208 (4th Cir. 1960). Of course, as Audio points out, a court of equity can reform a contract to correct a mistake disclosed by oral proof. But the mistake must be mutual, or if unilateral, it must be accompanied by fraud on the part of the other contracting party. <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>88 Va. 251, 13 S.E. 457, 458 (1891). <em>See </em>4 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 631 (3d ed. 1961). Audio has satisfied neither of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Audio\u2019s claim that its employees would be unjustly enriched by receiving their equitable share of the fund\u2019s assets is foreclosed by <em>Rochester Corp. v. Rochester, </em>450 F.2d 118, 121 (4th Cir. 1971). There, referring to a pension plan, Judge Russell wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">By rendering service for the period required under the plan, the employee\u2019s rights to benefits under the plan are \u201cearned no less than the salary paid to him (the employee) each pay period\u201d and are \u201cin the nature of delayed compensation for former years of faithful service.\u201d Whether the plan be contributory or noncontributory, the benefits, thus earned, are not gratuities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The evidence disclosed that Audio\u2019s plan was available for inspection by the participants. Some, in fact, examined it. Examination would reveal that in return for their services participants were entitled on termination of the plan not only to the pensions purchased for their benefit but also to their ratable share of the plan\u2019s assets after the payment of expenses. Payment of these sums will not unjustly enrich the participants. It will simply discharge Audio\u2019s contractual obligation for which tne participants have rendered service.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of a decree consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. Article IV of the plan provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">4.1 The normal retirement benefit to be provided for every Participant shall be a monthly pension commencing on his Normal Retirement Date and continuing for life. In the event of the death of the Participant prior to completion of one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments, such monthly payments shall be continued to the Participant\u2019s designated Beneficiary until the monthly payments made to the Participant and to such Beneficiary shall total one hundred twenty (120).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\">. Article II of the plan defines \u201cauxiliary fund\u201d as follows: \u201cA fund established for the purpose of purchasing additional annuities at retirement to provide the retirement benefits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b595-12\">. Section 6.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">The Employer shall pay over to the Trustees from time to time such sums of money as the Trustees shall certify to the Employer to be necessary to provide the benefits specified herein. Payment of such sums of money may be made to the Trustees or directly to the Insurance Company issuing contracts hereunder. In addition, the Employer shall pay over to the Trustees from time to time the sums required, computed on such assumptions as the Trustees shall deem appropriate, to be deposited in the Auxiliary Fund for the purpose of purchasing any additional annuity permitted under the terms of the Contracts and the rules of the insurance company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">Section 5.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-21\">On and after the effective date of this amendment, the Trustees shall use the funds of the Trust from time to time (1) to purchase Contracts on the lives of Participants issued by Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and (2) to make deposits into the Auxiliary Fund.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
