Defendant has not demonstrated any \u201creal prejudice\u201d as a result of being tried with his codefendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>610 F.2d 521, 525-26 (8th Cir. 1979). He merely argues that the codefendant testified that defendant Watkins was using drugs, and concludes that \u201cthe prejudice [from such testimony] is obvious.\u201d Without a showing of clear prejudice and an abuse of discretion by the trial court, defendant cannot prevail with his argument. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>549 F.2d 517, 523 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 985, 97 S.Ct. 1682, 52 L.Ed.2d 379 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Defendant next argues that he was deprived of due process by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about defendant\u2019s drug dealings and philandering. As the government points out, defendant testified on his own behalf and thus made his truthfulness an issue. The government\u2019s rebuttal argument was an effort to point out some parts of defendant\u2019s testimony that were not truthful. We reject defendant\u2019s argument that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-26\">.
