The Government asserts that a prisoner who is given a consecutive sentence of life imprisonment as an adult offender while he is serving a Federal Youth Corrections Act (\u201cYCA\u201d) sentence need not serve the remainder of the YCA sentence at a special YCA facility but may be returned to the general prison population. Because we conclude that under the circumstances of this case the YCA should not be construed to mandate completion of the YCA sentence in a YCA facility, we will reverse the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">Appellee Richard Thompson was convicted in federal court in 1974 for assault with intent to rape on a federal reservation. Thompson was seventeen years old when convicted. He received an eight year sentence pursuant to section 5010(c) of the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c), and was initially committed to the Federal Correctional Institution at Ashland, Kentucky. On June 27, 1977, while he was incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution in Lompoc, California, Thompson was convicted of first degree murder as a result of his participation in the murder of a fellow inmate who was stabbed by several other inmates while Thompson guarded against intrusion. Thompson, who was twenty years old at the time, was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Central District of California to a consecutive adult term of life imprisonment. The sentencing judge made a specific finding that Thompson would \u201cnot derive benefit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) or (c) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act as a Youth Offender.\u201d Thereafter in July, 1977, Thompson was transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania where he was held without segregation from adult prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">Thompson\u2019s record manifests a history of assaults and other offenses committed while he was serving his YCA sentence. In January, 1975, while at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Michigan, he assaulted another inmate. He received incident reports while at Milan for, <em>inter alia, </em>threatening a staff member with bodily harm, assault, and disruptive conduct. In April, 1975, Thompson was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno, Oklahoma, \u201cfor adjustment purposes\u201d but there received additional incident reports, including one for making a sharpened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>weapon. In September, 1975, while being transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc, California, Thompson was involved in a fight with another person. His participation in the murder of the fellow Lompoc inmate occurred in February, 1976. In May, 1977, Thompson was sentenced to a concurrent jail term of one year by a California state court for assaulting a Los Angeles County corrections officer while being processed into the Los Angeles County Jail. The officer suffered a fractured nose and concussion. Even after his transfer to Lewisburg, Thompson has received incident reports for his actions including the assault of a staff member, threatening another staff member with bodily harm, and inciting other inmates to riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">While at Lewisburg, Thompson filed a petition for habeas corpus alleging that his confinement there was illegal because he was entitled to be segregated from adult offenders until the completion of his YCA sentence in June, 1981, when the consecutive life sentence will begin. His petition was referred to a United States Magistrate. The magistrate\u2019s report, issued on January 19, 1979, contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">The magistrate feels that there is merit to the Government\u2019s argument that little purpose would <em>now </em>be served in confining petitioner in a youth institution, particularly when in the not too distant future he will be committed to a regular adult facility to serve his life sentence. The magistrate also believes that there is merit to the Government\u2019s argument that petitioner, with the type of behavior that he has exhibited which resulted in both his YCA sentence and his consecutive life sentence, together with his sorry history of behavior while incarcerated, would not benefit from youth confinement and, indeed, petitioner could well be a disruptive influence on those who have been receptive to YCA treatment, (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Nonetheless, the magistrate held that Thompson was entitled to be segregated from adult inmates because of this court\u2019s interpretation of the YCA in <em>United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d 107 (3d Cir. 1978), and the subsequent district court opinion in <em>Micklus v. Carlson, </em>No. 77-1070 (M.D.Pa. Mar. 14,1978), <em>appeal dismissed as moot, </em>591 F.2d 1336 (3d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The district court adopted the recommendations of the magistrate. It also interpreted the <em>Dancy </em>decision as mandating that an individual sentenced to consecutive youth and adult terms be incarcerated in a YCA facility during service of the YCA sentence. It held that Thompson\u2019s difficulties as a prisoner could be handled by the provision of the YCA permitting segregation of classes of committed youth offenders. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011. Therefore, the district court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">On appeal, the Government argues that because there has been an intervening judicial determination that the prisoner would not derive benefit from YCA treatment during the service of his consecutive sentence, the YCA should be construed to allow the Bureau of Prisons to exercise its discretion in selecting an institution for the confinement of the prisoner during the remainder of his YCA sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\n<em>The Federal Youth Corrections Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">The YCA has been described by the Supreme Court as \u201cthe most comprehensive federal statute concerned with sentencing.\u201d <em>Dorzynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 432, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 3047, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). Its provisions are designed to \u201cmake available for the discretionary use of the Federal judges a system for the sentencing and treatment of persons under the age of 22 years . . . that will promote the rehabilitation of those who show promise of becoming useful citizens, and so will avoid the degenerative and needless transformation of many of these young persons into habitual criminals.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1950), <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] U.S.Code Cong. Service p. 3983 (hereinafter \u201cH.R.Rep.No. 2979\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Under the statute, a judge sentencing a youth offender, defined as \u201ca person under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(d), must determine whether the youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under the YCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Dorzynski v. United States, supra, </em>the Court held that the statute requires an explicit finding of \u201cno benefit\u201d as a condition precedent to sentencing an eligible offender as an adult, but also held that the sentencing judge need not accompany such a finding by supporting reasons. When the sentencing court does find that the youth offender could derive benefit from the YCA, the Act provides the sentencing court with options additional to those ordinarily available. 418 U.S. at 441-42, 94 S.Ct. at 3051-52. In the <em>Dorzynski </em>case, the Supreme Court reviewed in detail the history of the Act and described the options of treatment and probation made available to the federal sentencing court under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">It noted that the purpose of the Act was \u201cto provide a better method for treating young offenders convicted in federal courts in [the] vulnerable age bracket [between 16 and 22 years of age], to rehabilitate them and restore normal behavior patterns.\u201d 418 U.S. at 433, 94 S.Ct. at 3048.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">To accomplish this objective, federal district judges were given two new alternatives to add to the array of sentencing options previously available to them . . . first, they were enabled to commit an eligible offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) and (c). Second, if they believed an offender did not need commitment, they were authorized to place him on probation under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). If the sentencing court chose the first alternative, the youth offender would be committed to the program of treatment created by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\n<em>Id</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>2</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">If a youth offender has been sentenced to institutional treatment, the statute gives the Parole Commission (formerly the Parole Board) power to order conditional release at any time under supervision of federal probation officers. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5006, 5017, 5019. The Commission also has the discretion to order the unconditional discharge of committed persons before the time that their unconditional discharge is mandated by the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(b). When such early discharge is effected, the conviction upon which the sentence rests is auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>matically set aside. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, youth offenders who receive an unconditional discharge from a sentence of probation prior to the expiration of their maximum sentence will have their convictions set aside. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The statutory section which describes the institutional treatment to which YCA offenders can be committed provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">Committed youth offenders not conditionally released shall undergo treatment in institutions of maximum security, medium security, or minimum security types, including training schools, hospitals, farms, forestry and other camps, and other agencies that will provide the essential varieties of treatment. The Director shall from time to time designate, set aside, and adapt institutions and agencies under the control of the Department of Justice for treatment. Insofar as practical, such institutions and agencies shall be used only for treatment of committed youth offenders, and such youth offenders shall be segregated from other offenders, and classes of committed youth offenders shall be segregated according to their needs for treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In <em>United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d 107 (3d Cir. 1978), we construed that section to require that youth offenders sentenced under the YCA must be segregated from adult prisoners. We rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201c[ijnsofar as practical\u201d required segregation of youth offenders from adult prisoners only insofar as segregation is practical. Instead we held that language referred only to the provision that institutions for the treatment of youth offenders should be used solely for that purpose. Although we recognized that the language of the statute is capable of more than one interpretation, <em>id. </em>at 110, we interpreted congressional intent to be \u201cthat the segregation of committed youth offenders from adult offenders was to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The Government contends that <em>Dancy </em>is inapplicable to this case because Thompson has been convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to a regular adult term, even though he was eligible for sentencing under the Youth Corrections Act, and because the sentencing court determined that he would not benefit from the treatment under the Act in serving the adult sentence. The district court rejected the Government\u2019s distinction, and decided \u201cthat the holding of <em>Dancy </em>that Youth offenders cannot consistent with the Act\u2019s rehabilitative purposes, be placed in contact with adult offenders is applicable to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">All of the parties agree that this is a case of first impression.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also apparent that the issue presented by this factual situation was not in the contemplation of Congress when it enacted the YCA, and that, however we rule, we will be required to fill in the interstices of the statute. Although we believe the issue is not free from doubt, we hold that under the facts of this case, the Bureau of Prisons was not required to continue to hold Thompson under the conditions prescribed by the YCA for the remainder of his YCA sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>1. The overriding purpose of the YCA is directed to the rehabilitation of the youth offender. The Congressional history indicates that the statute was designed to provide treatment during commitment for youth offenders in preparation for their eventual release following the YCA commitment. The statute was designed for those persons who \u201cshow promise of becoming useful citizens.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 2979 at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] U.S.Code Cong. Service at 3983. Congress was concerned because \u201c[a] large percentage of <em>those released </em>from our reformatories and penal institutions return to antisocial conduct and ultimately become hardened criminals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] U.S.Code Cong. Service at 3985 (emphasis added). The House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">Most of the causes which contribute to antisocial conduct of youth offenders in the period between adolescence and maturity disappear when the youth reaches full maturity. The problem is to provide a successful method and means for treatment of young men between the ages of 16 and 22 who stand convicted in our Federal courts and are not fit subjects for supervised probation \u2014 a method and means <em>that will effect rehabilitation and restore normality, </em>rather than develop recidivists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>[1950] U.S.Code Cong. Service, at 3985 (emphasis added). Neither the Congressional history nor the statute made any provision for the possibility that the treatment provided would be so unsuccessful that the committed YCA offender might commit a serious crime during a YCA sentence and thereby be required to serve a subsequent adult sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">2. The interpretation of the YCA given in the <em>Dancy </em>decision was predicated on a fact pattern in which there was the expectation that the youth offender would be released from commitment following completion of the YCA prescribed course of treatment. This court construed the statute to require segregation of youth offenders from the adult prisoner population in contemplation of the subsequent release of such youth offenders. We noted \u201cthe Act was designed <em>to spare youth offenders </em>the corruptive influence of prison life and <em>association with adult criminals . </em>.\u201d 572 F.2d at 112 (emphasis added). Patently, a prisoner who is destined to serve a subsequent prolonged adult sentence will not be spared association with adult criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">3. The decision whether to invoke the provisions of the YCA is exclusively judicial. It is the sentencing court which must make a judgment as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under the YCA. If the court desires additional information, it can order a study from the appropriate classification center or agency, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e), which considers, <em>inter alia, </em>the offender\u2019s personal traits, capabilities, school circumstances, family life, previous delinquency or criminal experience, and any mental or physical defect or other factor contributing to delinquency. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5014. Presumably, these are also the type of factors considered by the sentencing court in determining whether the youth offender can benefit from YCA treatment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the Bureau of Prisons is given considerable discretion under the Act, that discretion involves decisions such as whether to assign the youth offender to treatment in an institution or an agency, selection of the facility to which the offender will be committed, transfer of the offender from one institution or agency, and the conditions under which the committed youth offender should be confined or treated \u201cbest designed for the protection of the public.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5015. There is no language in the act authorizing the court to delegate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Bureau of Prisons the discretion to make the determination required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from YCA treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">4. In this case, the Government asks us to construe the statute \u201cso as to permit the Bureau of Prisons to exercise its informed judgment as to the institution and conditions of confinement best suited for prisoners serving YCA sentences who also have regular adult sentences yet to be served.\u201d If we were to so construe the statute, we would expand considerably the power given to the Bureau of Prisons by vesting in it that which Congress has given exclusively to the judiciary, <em>i. </em>e., the determination whether the offender can benefit under the YCA. We find no statutory basis or policy reason for such a construction. Despite the control given the Bureau of Prisons over many aspects of the commitment of the youth offender, Congress has not given it either the power to invoke or the power to revoke the application of the statute to a committed youth offender. Even in the case of prisoners who have manifested serious adjustment difficulties after commitment, the Bureau of Prisons is limited to designation of an appropriate institution or, as we noted in <em>Dancy, </em>segregation of committed youth offenders according to their needs for treatment. 572 F.2d at 113 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">5. There is only one circumstance in which the subsequent behavior of a committed youth offender can bring before the court the issue whether there is any benefit to the youth offender of <em>continued </em>treatment under the YCA. That arises when the youth offender, while still serving part of a YCA sentence, commits and is convicted of another crime. At the time of the second sentencing, that judge must repeat the process of determining whether the prisoner can benefit from the YCA. That judgment must then be made in light of the additional information available about the offender\u2019s adaptation to the YCA commitment and the commission of the subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The second sentencing judge has the choice to impose a YCA sentence, an adult sentence to run concurrently, or an adult sentence to run consecutively. Although the Ninth Circuit has held that it would be inconsistent to impose <em>simultaneously </em>a YCA sentence and a consecutive adult sentence, <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>513 F.2d 198, 199 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 843, 96 S.Ct. 78, 46 L.Ed.2d 64 (1975), <em>see also Burks v. United States, </em>496 F.2d 24, 25 (6th Cir. 1974), the Tenth Circuit has held that a <em>subsequently imposed </em>adult sentence on a YCA offender does not create a statutory or constitutional conflict. <em>Roddy v. United States, </em>509 F.2d 1145 (10th Cir. 1975); <em>Nast v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 338 (10th Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court recognized that \u201cthe rehabilitative potential afforded by commitment to a youth corrections center might be lessened by a subsequently imposed consecutive sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 340, but noted that the second sentencing court was not required to give effect to the previously imposed indeterminate youth sentence. <em>Roddy v. United States, supra </em>at 1147. Those cases preceded the <em>Dancy </em>decision and therefore the opinions did not discuss the effect of the imposition of the second sentence on the terms and conditions of commitment under the original YCA sentence. However, the YCA statute itself expressly recognizes that there can be judicial reevaluation during the service of a YCA sentence. It provides that nothing in the Act \u201cshall limit or affect the power of any court to suspend the imposition or execution of any sentence and place a youth offender on probation\u201d, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5023. Also, the statute was amended in 1961 to extend the benefit of a certificate setting aside the conviction to offenders sentenced to probation under \u00a7 5010(a) when the court unconditionally discharges the offender prior to expiration of the sentence of probation imposed. See <em>Durst v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 542, 548, 98 S.Ct. 849, 852, 55 L.Ed.2d 14 (1978). Thus, it would not be inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>with the statutory scheme to hold that a judicial reevaluation of the continued benefit of commitment as a YCA offender is permissible when such a reevaluation is triggered by the offender\u2019s own commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">That, of course, is the fact situation <em>sub judice. </em>Here, after having made a specific finding that Thompson could not benefit from YCA treatment, the second sentencing judge imposed an adult sentence to run consecutive to the YCA sentence. Imposition of a consecutive sentence is traditionally imposed as a more severe punishment than a concurrent sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the judicial determination that Thompson could not benefit from the YCA, and must therefore serve the second sentence as an adult prisoner, was a finding that <em>continued </em>service of the original sentence under YCA conditions is no longer beneficial. Because that represented a judicial reevaluation in light of currently available information, we hold that Thompson can be returned to an adult prisoner population for the remainder of the YCA sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">6. We recognize that a result of this holding is to permit the transfer of Thompson to commitment under conditions of confinement which he finds substantially less favorable than those under which he was previously committed. Since that transfer followed a judicial determination made after a full due process trial which was precipitated by the offender\u2019s commission of the crime. We do not confront the issue which faced the Court in <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2582, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) and <em>Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">7. A contrary construction of the YCA, which would mandate that Thompson complete the service of his original sentence under YCA terms until its conclusion, would lead to a futile result. As noted <em>infra, </em>all youth offenders who are committed under the YCA and who are not unconditionally discharged before such a discharge is mandated must be conditionally discharged for at least 2 years before the end of their sentence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(b) and (e). That would be patently impossible in Thompson\u2019s case because the imposition of the life sentence means that Thompson will not be eligible for release until he has served ten years of that life sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(a). This provides further indication that the concern of the statute is toward those prisoners who will be released following the YCA sentence. Therefore, the purpose of the YCA treatment under segregation is inapplicable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>For these reasons, we will reverse the order of the district court and remand with instructions that the court deny the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-5\">. A YCA sentence may be given to a defendant who is over twenty-two and not yet twenty-six years of age at the time of conviction, if the sentencing court affirmatively \u201cfinds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\">. If a youth offender is sentenced to probation under section 5010(a) the court may impose a fine as a condition of probation. <em>Durst v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 542, 553, 98 S.Ct. 849, 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 14 (1978). If a youth offender is sentenced under section 5010(b) for an indefinite sentence, s/he may be released under supervision at any time, must be released under supervision within 4 years from the date of conviction, and must be unconditionally discharged within 6 years from the date of conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(a) and (c). If the youth offender is sentenced under section 5010(c), s/he may be sentenced for a time longer than 6 years, but for no longer than authorized by law for the particular offense for which s/he is convicted. Youth offenders sentenced under that section may be released under supervision at any time, must be released under supervision not later than 2 years before expiration of the term imposed by the court, and must be unconditionally discharged on or before expiration of the maximum term imposed. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Although sentences under section 5010(b) may cause some youth offenders to spend more time in YCA commitment than they could have been sentenced to under traditional adult sentencing, the constitutionality of section 5010(b) has been upheld on the theory that \u201crehabilitation may be regarded as comprising the <em>quid pro quo </em>for a longer confinement but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo in an ordinary prison.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>306 F.2d 283, 285 (D.C.Cir. 1962) (Warren E. Burger, Cir. J.). <em>See also Caldwell v. United States, </em>435 F.2d 1079, 1081 (10th Cir. 1970); <em>Brisco v.

In particular, youth offenders serving a YCA sentence \u201c[are] at all times to be confined away from the corruptive influence of adult criminals,\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d 107, 113 (1978). Nevertheless, the majority decides on this appeal that the Bureau of Prisons is not bound to comply with the Act\u2019s mandate in the case of a youth offender who receives a consecutive adult sentence while serving his YCA sentence. Because I perceive no justification for this judicially-fashioned amendment to the Act, and because I believe that the result reached by the majority is contrary to both the purpose of the Act and traditional sentencing doctrine, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In 1974, Richard Thompson, at the age of seventeen, was convicted in federal court of assault with intent to rape on a federal reservation. The trial judge imposed on Thompson an eight year sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5010(c) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act (YCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c). \u00a7 5011 of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011, expressly provides that committed youth offenders \u201cshall undergo treatment in [secure] institutions . . . [which] shall be used only for treatment of committed youth offenders.\u201d For reasons that are unclear, however, Thompson was not confined in such an institution nor did he receive the type of treatment prescribed by the Act. Three years later, in 1977, while incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution at Lompoc, California, he was convicted in federal court of first degree murder and sentenced as an adult to serve a term of life imprisonment upon completion of his YCA sentence. Thompson was immediately transferred to the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was incarcerated in the general adult prisoner population.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Thompson thereupon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In it, he alleged that he was entitled to youth offender treatment until the completion of his YCA sentence, at which time his consecutive adult sentence would begin, and, therefore, that his imprisonment in the general adult population at Lewisburg was illegal. Adopting the report of a United States Magistrate, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted Thompson\u2019s petition and ordered him transferred to an institution where he would receive the kind of treatment prescribed by the Act, for the duration of his YCA sentence. Appellants, Norman Carlson, Director, United States Bureau of Prisons, and Charles Fenton, Warden, United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, appealed from the order of the district court. The majority now reverses that order and holds that the Bureau of Prisons may confine Thompson in an adult prisoner population for the duration of his YCA sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">The YCA was specially designed to improve the treatment of youths convicted in federal courts between the vulnerable ages of 16 and 22, a time \u201cwhen special factors operate[] to produce habitual criminals.\u201d <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 433, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 3048, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). The ultimate goal of the Act, according to the Supreme Court, is the rehabilitation of youth offenders. <em>Id. </em>To this end, the Act provides the sentencing judge with \u201ca wide variety of sentencing options to ensure that youth offenders receive treatment commensurate with their individual needs for correction and rehabilitation and society\u2019s need for protection from antisocial youths.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d at 110 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>If the sentencing judge is of the opinion that commitment is unnecessary, he may place the youth offender on probation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). Alternatively, the court may, in lieu of the penalty otherwise provided by law, sentence a youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision for not more than four years, with an additional period of probation, or until discharged by the United States Parole Commission, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b), 5017(c). If the court finds that the youth offender may not be able to derive maximum benefit from such treatment within this time, it may sentence the offender for any further period authorized by law for the offense in question, or until discharged by the Commission, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(c), 5017(c). \u201cThe decision whether a youth convicted of a crime should be accorded YCA treatment or sentenced as an adult,\u201d as we observed in <em>United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d at 110 (1978), \u201cis placed ultimately in the hands of the sentencing judge.\u201d If the sentencing judge expressly finds that the youth offender will not derive benefit from the treatment contemplated by the YCA, he then may sentence the offender under any other applicable penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">An important feature of the regime established by the Act is that once a youth offender is committed for treatment, execution of sentence is to fit the person, not the crime for which the offender is convicted. <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 434, 94 S.Ct. at 3048. As a result, youth offenders may in some circumstances be sentenced under the YCA to a longer term of confinement than could an adult convicted of the same offense. We have joined other courts of appeals in upholding the constitutionality of permitting youths to receive YCA sentences that are longer than those to which adults would be subject, however, on the ground that a sentence to the custody of the Attorney General for YCA supervision and treatment is essentially and significantly different from an ordinary prison sentence. <em>See Brisco v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 214, 215 (3d Cir. 1966); <em>Rogers v. United States, </em>326 F.2d 56 (10th Cir. 1963); <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>United States, </em>256 F.2d 467, 472 (5th Cir. 1958). As we declared in <em>Dancy, </em>\u201cthe basic theory of the Act is rehabilitation and in a sense this rehabilitation may be regarded as comprising the <em>quid pro quo </em>for a longer confinement but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo in an ordinary prison.\u201d 572 F.2d at 111 (quoting <em>Carter v. United States, </em>306 F.2d 283, 285 (opinion of Burger, J.) (D.C.Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The only sentence presently being served by Richard Thompson was imposed pursuant to the YCA. Section 5011 of that statute clearly provides that youth offenders sentenced and confined pursuant to the Act \u201cshall be segregated from other offenders\u201d in \u201cinstitutions . . . that will provide the essential varieties of treatment\u201d contemplated by the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011. <em>See United States ex rel. Dancy v. Arnold, </em>572 F.2d at 107. The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that \u201c[t]he starting point in every case involving the construction of a statute is the language itself,\u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 558, 99 S.Ct. 790, 795, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979) (quoting <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 726, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1920, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) (Powell, J. concurring)). And, as the majority recognizes, nothing in either the YCA\u2019s provisions or its legislative history suggests that the imposition of a consecutive sentence could supply the predicate for modifying the terms of an offender\u2019s prior commitment under the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, again as the majority itself points out, the Supreme Court has described the YCA as \u201cthe most comprehensive federal statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>concerned with sentencing,\u201d <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 432, 94 S.Ct. at 3047.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Despite all this, the majority declines to affirm the order directing that Thompson be confined apart from adult prisoners, in accordance with the treatment prescribed under the Act, for the duration of his YCA sentence. Contending that \u201cthe issue presented by this factual situation was not in the contemplation of Congress when it enacted the YCA,\u201d the majority professes not to be bound by the plain directive of \u00a7 5011. Then, having elected to \u201cfill in the interstices\u201d that it perceives to exist in this most comprehensive statute, the majority concludes instead that the Bureau of Prisons is not required to confine youth offenders in accordance with the terms of their YCA sentences once they have received a regular adult sentence that is to be served consecutively. In support of this decision, the majority advances what appear to be two separate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The more extensive of these arguments contains three essential steps. First, the majority asserts that \u201cit would not be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to hold that a judicial reevaluation of the continued benefit of commitment as a YCA offender is permissible when such a re-evaluation is triggered by the offender\u2019s own commission of a crime.\u201d Next, it assumes that the second sentencing judge\u2019s finding \u2014 that Thompson would not benefit from YCA treatment \u2014 also constituted a judicial determination that Thompson would derive no benefit from continued service of his original YCA sentence under the prescribed conditions of treatment. Then, on the basis of this purported \u201cjudicial reevaluation in light of currently available information\u201d by the second sentencing judge, the majority concludes that the Bureau of Prisons can return Thompson to an adult prison for the remainder of his YCA sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">As I see it, this line of reasoning contains a number of serious flaws. To begin with, there is nothing in the record to support the suggestion that the second sentencing judge\u2019s determination \u2014 that Thompson would not benefit from YCA treatment\u2014 was also a finding that continued service of the original sentence under the YCA conditions is no longer beneficial. On the contrary, the second sentencing judge made no reference whatsoever to the fact that Thompson was, at the time of sentencing, serving a separate and previously imposed YCA sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And although it is reasonable to assume that the second sentencing judge was aware that Thompson was then serving a YCA sentence, it also is likely that the judge\u2019s attention was focused on the question whether, upon completion of this YCA sentence, Thompson would derive benefit from further YCA treatment. This is so, since this was the precise question before the second judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Even if it is assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the second sentencing judge did make a finding regarding the continued benefit to Thompson of YCA treatment during his initial sentence, however, there is absolutely no statutory basis for permitting a second sentencing judge to reevaluate the continued benefit to a youth offender of treatment under a YCA sentence imposed previously by a different trial judge for an entirely separate offense. The majority argues in support of this conclusion that \u201cthe YCA statute itself expressly recognized that there can be judicial reevaluation during the service of a YCA sentence.\u201d To buttress this assertion, the majority relies on the statutory provision that \u201c[njothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the power of any court to suspend the imposition or execution of any sentence . . ,\u201d 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 5023. But this provision simply makes clear that the YCA was not meant to limit or affect any already existing power of a court regarding suspended sentences and probation. There is not a word in the legislation about augmenting sentences or about having a second judge in any way change them. Indeed, the majority\u2019s construction of the Act is devoid of support in either the statutory provisions or the legislative history. As a result, the only justification the majority can muster for the type of judicial reevaluation it condones is that the YCA does not specifically prohibit such a scheme. I think it may fairly be presumed, however, that if Congress \u2014 in enacting \u201cthe most comprehensive federal statute concerned with sentencing\u201d \u2014 had intended this sort of reconsideration of YCA sentences, it would have said so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Not only is the majority\u2019s construction unsupported by any language in the statute, it is also at variance with traditional sentencing doctrine, clear congressional intent, and the opinion of the Supreme Court in <em>Dorszynski. </em>As the Court specifically determined, \u201c[t]he intent of Congress [in enacting the YCA] was in accord with long-established authority in the United States vesting the sentencing function exclusively in the trial court,\u201d 418 U.S. at 440, 94 S.Ct. at 3051. Noting that, because the Act was the product of studies made by a committee of federal judges, the views of the Act\u2019s sponsors were \u201cof particular importance\u201d with regard to the Act\u2019s effect on the sentencing discretion of trial judges, the Court concluded that \u201cthey uniformly support the view that the Act was intended to preserve the unfettered sentencing discretion of federal district judges,\u201d 418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held \u201cthat the discretion vested in a district judge under [the Act] is essentially the same as the traditional discretion vested in the [sentencing] court,\u201d 418 U.S. at 442, 94 S.Ct. at 3052.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The Supreme Court then pointed out that it is a firmly settled rule of federal criminal practice that no other judicial body may review or exercise control over a sentence imposed by a trial court, so long as that sentence is within the limits allowed by statute and the Constitution, 418 U.S. at 440-41, 94 S.Ct. at 3051.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion, absent an abuse, is not subject to challenge. And, quite clearly in the view of the Supreme Court at least, \u201cthe Act was meant to enlarge, not restrict, the sentencing options of federal trial courts in order to \u2018promote the rehabilitation of [youth offenders] who <em>in the opinion of the sentencing judge, </em>show promise of becoming useful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>citizens . . 418 U.S. at 436, 94 S.Ct. at 3049, (quoting in part, with emphasis added) H.R.Rep.No. 2979, Cong.Sess. 1. The conclusion that the imposition of an adult sentence by one judge would preclude YCA treatment under the sentence of another, however, as the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has recently declared, is \u201cclearly inconsistent with the purpose of the Act \u2018to add to the array of sentencing options previously available\u2019 to sentencing judges,\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>391 A.2d 1383, 1384 (1978) (quoting in part <em>Dorszyn-ski, </em>418 U.S. at 433, 94 S.Ct. at 3048). Indeed, the majority\u2019s approach effectively denies what that court called \u201can essential prerequisite\u201d to the sentencing judge\u2019s determination whether a defendant will benefit from YCA treatment: namely, \u201cthat each sentencing judge exercise his own discretion, a discretion which cannot be delegated,\u201d 391 A.2d 1383, 1384 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Like the Supreme Court, but unlike the majority, I do not believe we should \u201cassume Congress to have intended such a departure from well-established doctrine without a clear expression to disavow it,\u201d <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 441, 94 S.Ct. at 3052.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Of additional concern, the majority\u2019s construction of the YCA raises serious constitutional questions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As already indicated, constitutional challenges to the practice of permitting youth offenders to be confined under the YCA for longer periods than they would otherwise be subject to have been rejected repeatedly because \u201csuch confinement cannot be equated with incarceration in an ordinary prison,\u201d <em>Carter v. United States, </em>306 F.2d at 285. But under the majority\u2019s interpretation, youth offenders in some cases possibly will be subject to incarceration <em>in an ordinary prison </em>for longer periods than those to which adult offenders convicted of the same offense would be subject. Equally serious, although the question has not been raised by the appel-lee, the majority\u2019s decision appears to pose an issue of double jeopardy. For its effect is to permit a second judge \u2014 one who happens to be imposing a subsequent sentence on the offender for an entirely separate offense \u2014 to substitute a different and more severe sentence for the prior sentence imposed by the youth offender\u2019s first trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">The second principal argument advanced by the majority in support of its decision is less elaborate. Essentially, the majority asserts that Thompson\u2019s completion of his original YCA sentence under the conditions prescribed by the YCA \u201cwould lead to a futile result.\u201d Inasmuch as a youth offender \u201cdestined to serve a subsequent adult sentence will not be spared association with adult criminals,\u201d the majority reasons, no useful purpose would be served by the continued segregation of such an offender from the general prison population. As a result, the majority concludes that once a youth offender serving a YCA sentence receives an adult sentence to be served consecutively, the Bureau of Prisons can confine him within the general population of a federal penitentiary for the duration of his YCA sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">It is of course true, as the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has recognized in rejecting an argument similar to the majority\u2019s, that \u201cthe rehabilitative potential afforded by commitment to a youth corrections center might be lessened by a subsequently imposed consecutive sentence,\u201d <em>Nast v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 338, 340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>(10th Cir. 1969). On the other hand, it may be that a youth who goes through a period of treatment in a youth correction center would be less susceptible to the influences of hardened criminals during his subsequent confinement than one not so treated. This might be so if one accepts the motivating assumption, which was central to the enactment of the statute, that an offender is more susceptible to corrective treatment and rehabilitation as a \u201cyouth\u201d than in later years, <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 432-33, 94 S.Ct. at 3047-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In any event, \u201c[T]hese are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\u201d <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 442, 94 S.Ct. at 3052 (quoting <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958)). Accordingly, whatever the relative merits of such arguments, I agree with the Tenth Circuit that \u201cthe problem raised by appellant is for such legislative consideration as it might enlist, rather than one to be solved as appellant presses upon this court,\u201d <em>Nast v. United States, </em>415 F.2d at 340. If, as the majority believes, the statute as drafted is thought inadequate or unwise, \u201cthe remedy,\u201d to quote the Supreme Court, \u201cmust be afforded by act of Congress, not by judicial legislation under the guise of construction,\u201d <em>Dorszynski, </em>418 U.S. at 442, 94 S.Ct. at 3052 (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 305, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In sum, I am unpersuaded that the arguments advanced by the majority justify the conclusion that the Bureau of Prisons is not bound to comply with the YCA\u2019s mandate in the case of a youth offender who receives a consecutive adult sentence while serving his YCA sentence. In the absence of any indication to the contrary, in either the statutory language or the legislative history, I would affirm the judgment of the district court ordering that Thompson be treated in accordance with YCA for the duration of his sentence under that Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-5\">. Indeed, as the Tenth Circuit has expressly held, the imposition of a consecutive sentence for a separate and subsequent and entirely separate offense is entirely consistent with an earlier commitment under the YCA: \u201cNeither is in statutory or constitutional conflict with the other.\u201d <em>Nast v. United States, </em>415 F.2d 338, 340 (10th Cir. 1969); <em>see Roddy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>509 F.2d 1145, 1147 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. The entire sentencing order of the second judge provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">The Court finds that the defendant was 20 years of age at the date of conviction, but will not derive benefit under 18 U.S.C. 5010(b) or (c) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act as a Youth Offender, accordingly, IT IS ADJUDGED that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative for imprisonment for the period of his natural life, i. e., life imprisonment, and said sentence shall be and run consecutively to all other sentences the defendant is now serving.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\">. As the majority recognizes, the interpretation of the YCA it adopts today is significantly different from that urged by the appellants in this case. They requested that we construe the Act \u201cso as to permit the Bureau of Prisons to exercise its discretion regarding the institution and conditions of confinement best suited for prisoners serving YCA sentences who also have regular adult sentences yet to be served.\u201d The majority feels constrained to reject this argument specifically because \u201cthere is no language in the Act authorizing\u201d such a practice and thus no statutory basis for it. But then, despite the similar absence of any language in the Act authorizing a judicial reevaluation of the continued benefit to a youth offender from YCA treatment, the majority establishes such a procedure on the ground that \u201cit would not be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\u201d Given the comprehensive nature of the statute in question, however, the absence of such a provision does not support, indeed it argues against, the exception to the Act fashioned by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\">.
