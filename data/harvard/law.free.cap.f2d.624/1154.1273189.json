The conspiracy allegedly ran from October 18 to October 21, 1977. After a four-day jury trial Keller was found guilty and sentenced to a term of three years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal,. Keller attacks the ruling of the trial court permitting cross-examination of Keller as to his participation in drug transactions which took place subsequent to October 21,1977 and for which Keller had previously been tried and acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-21\">At the trial which is the subject of this appeal, the Government presented evidence that on or about October 18,1977 one of the co-defendants telephoned John Anderson, a Government informant, from New York, seeking two pounds of PCP from Anderson, who lived in Atglen, Pennsylvania. Appellant Keller, along with another co-defendant, delivered the PCP to Anderson on October 20, 1977. On October 21, 1977, two other co-defendants arrived at Anderson\u2019s home in Atglen and picked up the PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-22\">Appellant did not deny his participation in the conspiracy. Rather, his defense was entrapment. Keller testified that Anderson had been a good friend of his for several years and that he was concerned about Anderson\u2019s medical and serious financial problems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Keller testified it was Anderson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>who first mentioned the possibility of selling PCP so that Anderson \u201ccould make money to help pay his bills.\u201d Keller testified he did not agree to Anderson\u2019s suggestion the first time it was made, and \u201cnot the first couple of times he mentioned it.\u201d He testified that he finally agreed to participate after Anderson once again said \u201cthat he could really use the money.\u201d It was then that Keller brought the PCP to Anderson\u2019s house. Keller also testified that \u201cI told [Anderson] that I didn\u2019t want anything [money] out of it and [Anderson] said that he could make approximately $2000 out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The Government attempted to undermine Keller\u2019s entrapment defense by proving that Keller was involved in other instances of drug dealing. The Government questioned Keller about a drug conviction involving a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine to which Keller pled guilty in 1977. That evidence is not challenged in this appeal. The Government also questioned Keller about drug transactions that took place after the events charged in the indictment. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection that the questioning was not limited in its reference to a time period, Keller was asked about his involvement in deliveries of methamphetamine. In response, Keller testified he delivered the drugs to Anderson on two or three occasions, and on four occasions he delivered them to a third party \u201cto help Mr. Anderson\u201d . . . \u201c[b]ecause he got the money from it.\u201d The issue was further pursued by the Government in the course of its cross-examination of Keller, and when the defendant repeated that these transactions took place six or seven months after October 20, 1977, defense counsel objected. The objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">The transactions which were the subject of this cross-examination were the basis of a prior federal prosecution of Keller in which he was charged with distributing methamphetamines to Anderson and another individual on approximately five occasions in 1978. In that case, as in this one, Keller testified, admitted the distribution, and pleaded entrapment as a defense, claiming he was induced by Anderson, acting as a Government agent, to commit the crime. He was acquitted of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-14\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in allowing into evidence his allegedly criminal conduct which occurred subsequent to the period covered by the indictment. He bases his claim of error on three grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-15\">1) Although appellant recognizes that when a defendant raises an entrapment defense, defendant\u2019s prior conduct and character become relevant to the issue of predisposition, <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 451, 53 S.Ct. 210, 216, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932), he claims that subsequent acts are inadmissible to show predisposition or intent. Appellant relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>595 F.2d 120 (3d Cir. 1978). There we held the Government could not rebut an anticipated entrapment defense by showing prior predisposition and intent through evidence of defendant\u2019s subsequent criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-16\">2) Appellant claims the evidence is inadmissible because the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars the evidentiary use of conduct for which defendant had been acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>3) Appellant contends the court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence because it was virtually irrelevant, since it led to an acquittal, and hence was far more prejudicial than probative. He claims that, therefore, it should have been excluded pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-4\">We hold that the evidence was barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Accordingly, we need not reach appellant\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel \u201chas the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.\u201d <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). Although first developed in civil litigation, it has been an established rule of federal criminal law since at least 1916. <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970) (citing <em>United States v. Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85, 37 S.Ct. 68, 61 L.Ed. 161 (1916)). As the Court explained, the need for the application of collateral estoppel in criminal cases arose primarily because of the recent proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 445, n. 10, 90 S.Ct. at 1195. In <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>the Court found a constitutional basis for the collateral es-toppel doctrine in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy, and thus applied the doctrine to the states for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">In this court, the doctrine of collateral estoppel as applied in criminal cases has been used to bar not only reprosecution, which we use here as encompassing multiple or fragmented prosecutions, but also evidence of crimes of which the defendant had been acquitted in prior prosecutions. In <em>United States v. Simon, </em>225 F.2d 260 (3d Cir. 1955), defendant had originally been acquitted on a count of having received stolen goods (turkeys). On retrial of a charge of guilty possession of stolen goods (the same turkeys), we held the acquittal precluded introduction of evidence by the admitted thief that he had delivered the turkeys to defendant. We viewed the case as presenting a simple problem of re-litigation of decided facts, and held that \u201cthe Government is estopped from relitigating in a second trial facts already determined in the first.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. This holding followed this court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>United States v. DeAngelo, </em>138 F.2d 466, 468 (3d Cir. 1943) where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-13\">The conclusiveness of a fact which has been competently adjudicated by a criminal trial is not confined to such matter only as is sufficient to support a plea of double jeopardy. Even though there has been no former acquittal of the particular offense on trial, a prior judgment of acquittal on related matters has been said to be conclusive as to all that the judgment determined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">We recognize that not all of the courts have followed the interpretation of collateral estoppel as enunciated by this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue was avoided by the approach followed by the Seventh Circuit which, on facts similar to those presented in the case <em>sub judice, </em>held that the evidence of a July 14 sale of heroin, for which defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>acquitted, should not have been admitted in a trial on the charge of selling heroin on July 17. The court did not rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel but instead held that the evidence lost most of its relevance when the acquittal was taken into account. The trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence was an abuse of discretion because a balancing of the relevance of the proffered evidence against its potentially unduly prejudicial effect required exclusion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>401 F.2d 301 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>incorporating collateral estoppel into the constitutional protection against double jeopardy raises the question whether double jeopardy precludes the evidentiary use of crimes for which there has been a prior acquittal or applies only in situations of reprosecution. The fact paradigm of <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>presented only the latter situation. In that case, the defendant was originally prosecuted and acquitted for robbing one of a group of poker players. Thereafter, he was prosecuted and convicted for robbing another of the poker players during the same robbery. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, noting that the jury necessarily found in the first trial that the petitioner had not participated in the robbery. Therefore, the Government was precluded from relitigating that issue in a subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">In this case the doctrine of collateral estoppel is raised not because of a prosecutorial attempt to fragment offenses but because of the evidentiary use of matters determined in the original proceeding. The rationale for the incorporation of collateral estoppel into the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment is based on the \u201cwell-established policy against harassment of an individual.\u201d <em>United States v. Standefer, </em>610 F.2d 1076, 1092 (3d Cir. 1979) (en banc), <em>cert. granted, </em>444 U.S. 1011, 100 S.Ct. 658, 62 L.Ed.2d 640 (1980). We have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeh-dedup-0\">The justification for such an application grows out of the fifth amendment itself, which has as one of its objectives the protection of citizens from repetitive and harassing lawsuits brought by the government. Accordingly, the prosecution may not seek, through the device of separate trials on each count brought against a particular defendant, to repeat litigating the same basic issues until it is ultimately successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">It might be possible to read <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>as incorporating within the double jeopardy clause only that anti-harassment aspect of collateral estoppel which bars re-prosecution since there is a qualitative difference between reprosecution and the broader scope of collateral estoppel as applied to the evidentiary use of prior acquittals in prosecutions involving different offenses. Note, <em>Expanding Double Jeopardy: Collateral Estoppel and the Evidentiary Use of Prior Claims of Which the Defendant Has Been Acquitted, </em>2 Fla.State U.L.Rev. 511, 525 (1974). As long as the subsequent prosecution is not precluded by the double jeopardy clause, the anti-harassment function of collateral estoppel may lose much of its relevance since it is the requirement of standing trial which constitutes the forbidden harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">The distinction between the constitutional scope of collateral estoppel and its doctrinal scope was alluded to in our decision in <em>United States v. Venable, </em>585 F.2d 71 (3d Cir. 1978). In that case defendant had been tried originally on an indictment alleging three counts of extortion and two counts of perjury. Defendant was found not guilty of the extortion counts but was found guilty of the perjury counts, on which the court granted a new trial because of the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments. Defendant\u2019s plea that the retrial was barred on the ground of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel was rejected by this court because there was no inconsistency between the earlier acquittal and the perjury charges being retried.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>discussion we indicated that the constitutional scope of collateral estoppel was not necessarily coextensive with the collateral estoppel defense. In considering the effect of the constitutional doctrine of collateral estoppel as enunciated in <em>Ashe </em>on our earlier cases applying the collateral estoppel defense, we stated that <em>\u201cAshe </em>would entirely bar a retrial, when collateral estoppel effect is given to facts established in favor of the defendant which are necessary to sustain a conviction in a second prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. Without the protection of the double jeopardy safeguard, \u201cthe defendant would be vulnerable to multiple prosecutions by a strategic severance of related counts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. We indicated, however, that collateral estoppel in the broad scope previously enunciated in the earlier decisions of <em>United States v. DeAngelo, </em>138 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1943), and <em>United States v. Simon, </em>225 F.2d 260 (3d Cir. 1955), continues to apply in appropriate cases. \u201c[The <em>DeAngelo </em>and <em>Simon </em>cases] retain their vitality, however, to the extent that they would allow the <em>defense </em>of collateral estoppel to be raised in a second proceeding as to facts previously established but not <em>necessary </em>to sustain the conviction sought at retrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Two circuits which have considered whether the constitutional scope of double jeopardy now incorporates a prohibition against the evidentiary use of crimes for which the defendant was previously acquitted have held that it does. In <em>Wingate v. Wainwright, </em>464 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1972), the court declined to limit the scope of the double jeopardy clause to situations of re-prosecutions or multiple punishment. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-8\">We do not perceive any meaningful difference in the quality of \u201cjeopardy\u201d to which a defendant is again subjected when the state attempts to prove his guilt by relitigating a settled fact issue which depends upon whether the reliti-gated issue is one of \u201cultimate\u201d fact or merely an \u201cevidentiary\u201d fact in the second prosecution. In both instances the state is attempting to prove the defendant guilty of an offense other than the one of which he was acquitted. In both instances the relitigated proof is offered to prove some element of the second offense. In both instances the defendant is forced to defend again against charges or factual allegations which he overcame in the earlier trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">The Second Circuit has now followed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis, holding also that in a subsequent trial the state must be precluded from evidentiary use of the prior conduct which was the subject of the prior acquittal. <em>United States v. Mespoulede, </em>597 F.2d 329 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">Although there are intimations in the <em>Ashe </em>opinion that constitutional incorporation of collateral estoppel is not limited to instances of reprosecution or multiple prosecution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we believe it is unnecessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>decide this constitutional issue under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For even if <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>were limited to a holding that the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution incorporates collateral estoppel only insofar as it applies to reprosecution, there has been no suggestion that the decision would in any way curtail the use of the collateral estoppel doctrine as previously applied in criminal cases. Since this court has consistently applied that doctrine to bar the evi-dentiary use of crimes for which a defendant had been acquitted, application of collateral estoppel in this broader context would still mandate reversal in this case because the evidence of conduct which was the subject of Keller\u2019s prior acquittal was introduced in violation of that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">The Government argues, however, that this case is distinguishable from the situations previously before this court because Keller did not deny the fact of his participation in the drug distributions but claimed that he was excused from criminal prosecution because he was entrapped. The Government contends that collateral estop-pel is inapplicable because \u201c[i]t is not the <em>result </em>of the prior case that was material, but rather the <em>facts </em>which were undisputed.\u201d Government Brief, page 11. Thus, the Government would have us hold that the prior conduct is admissible notwithstanding the determination by the earlier fact finder that the defendant\u2019s state of knowledge and level of participation did not satisfy the requirement of the criminal law. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>401 F.2d at 305. We decline to so hold since that would eviscerate the effect of the prior acquittal. We agree with the Fifth Circuit that \u201c[i]t is fundamentally unfair and totally incongruous with our basic concepts of justice to permit the sovereign to offer proof that a defendant committed a specific crime which a jury of that sovereign has concluded he did not commit.\u201d <em>Wingate v. Wainwright, </em>464 F.2d at 215. The Government position \u201cplaces an unjust burden on a defendant to require him to relitigate the very issue a jury decided in his favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Mespoulede, </em>597 F.2d at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1235-12\">.
