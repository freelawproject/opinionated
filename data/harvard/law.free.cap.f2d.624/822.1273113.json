Great Lakes Carbon Corp., </em>September 24, 1979. A motion for rehearing was granted, and this decision follows argument to the court en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-15\">The Railway Co. originally sued Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, (GLC), for additional freight charges, claiming it had undercharged GLC because a higher, specific commodity rate should apply to petroleum coke that GLC shipped. GLC urged a lower freight-all-kinds rate applied. It also counterclaimed for overcharges on another shipment. On the parties\u2019 joint motion, the district court referred interpretation of tariff items and their reasonableness to the Interstate Commerce Commission, (ICC), and held the lawsuit in abeyance. The ICC affirmed an administrative law judge\u2019s decision that generally sustained the Railway Co.\u2019s tariff interpretation. However, it held it would be unjust and unreasonable for the Railway Co. to collect the full tariff for the shipment upon which its complaint was based. Under the ICC decision, the Railway Co. would have recovered a reduced amount and GLC would not have recovered anything on its counterclaim. Each party then filed for summary judgment in the district court. The court entered judgment for the Railway Co. on its complaint for $29,898.32 plus interest, in accord with the ICC decision. However, the court held it was not bound by the ICC decision, and therefore granted GLC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim, entering judgment on its behalf for $129,026.47 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">The Railway Co. did not appeal within 30 days as required by Rule 4(a) of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Rules of Appellate Procedure. After its motion for an extension of time was denied, it attempted to resurrect a judgment for appeal by petitioning this court for a writ of mandamus that would order the district court to rule on its motion for summary judgment. We dismissed the petition, stating that the Railway Co.\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to GLC\u2019s counterclaim had been ruled upon and we viewed the petition as an attempt to file an untimely appeal. <em>Kansas City Southern Railway v. Wangelin, </em>582 F.2d 1288 (8th Cir. 1978) <em>(mem.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The Railway Co. then filed a motion in district court, asserting that under Rule 60(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the judgment should be set aside as void. It argued the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because it did not follow the procedure set forth in chapter 157 of title 28, sections 2321-23, for review of an ICC order, namely joinder of the United States as a defendant. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322. The district court denied relief, stating it had considered the basic issues raised in its earlier opinion, from which no appeal had been taken. The Railway Co. appealed, and a panel of this court reversed the district court, holding <em>inter alia, </em>that the original judgment was void and could be set aside under Rule 60(b)(4). The court acting en banc now vacates that decision and enters judgment affirming the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">In this appeal we assume, without deciding, that under the jurisdictional facts presented the United States was required to be joined as a party defendant pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322 once GLC sought review of the ICC decision by motion for summary judgment. The fundamental question presented here is whether Rule 60(b)(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may serve as the procedural vehicle to attack the judgment on the ground that it is a nullity because of the absence of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">In <em>Schwartz v. Bowman, </em>244 F.Supp. 51, 65-69 (S.D.N.Y.1965), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Annenberg v. Alleghany Corp., </em>360 F.2d 211 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 921, 87 S.Ct. 230, 17 L.Ed.2d 145 (1966), the court held an ICC order could not be attacked indirectly under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-l et seq.; it held chapter 157 of title 28, the Urgent Deficiencies Act, is the exclusive method for enforcement or review of ICC orders. As the claim had not been brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act and none of its procedural requirements had been met, including joinder of the United States, the court held it lacked jurisdiction. This holding only serves to obscure the question presented in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>suming the district court erred here in finding jurisdiction despite the absence of the United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the question upon which relief hinges is whether that error, never presented on appeal from the judgment, may nevertheless be corrected in a Rule 60(b)(4) proceeding on the ground that it renders the judgment void. We conclude that the judgment is not void within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(4), and any jurisdictional defect caused by nonjoinder may not now be challenged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Absence of subject matter jurisdiction may, in certain cases, render a judgment void. <em>See e.g., Kalb v. Feuerstein, </em>308 U.S. 433, 60 S.Ct. 343, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940). However, this occurs only where there is a plain usurpation of power, when a court wrongfully extends its jurisdiction beyond the scope of its authority. <em>Stoll v. Gottlieb, </em>305 U.S. 165, 171, 59 S.Ct. 134, 137, 83 L.Ed. 104 (1938); <em>see Coalition of Black Leadership </em>v. <em>Cianci, </em>570 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1978) (quoting <em>Lubben v. Selective Service System, </em>453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972)); <em>Ben Sager Chemicals v. E. Targosz &amp; Co., </em>560 F.2d 805, 812 (7th Cir. 1977); 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 160.25[2] at 302-3 (2d ed. 1979). Stated another way, such plain usurpation of power occurs when there is a \u201ctotal want of jurisdiction\u201d as distinguished from \u201can error in the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Lubben v. Selective Service System, </em>453 F.2d at 649. Since federal courts have \u201cjurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,\u201d that is, \u201cpower to interpret the language of the jurisdictional instrument and its application to an issue by the court,\u201d <em>Stoll v. Gottlieb, </em>305 U.S. at 171, 59 S.Ct. at 137, error in interpreting a statutory grant of jurisdiction is not equivalent to acting with total want of jurisdiction. Such an erroneous interpretation does not render the judgment a complete nullity. <em>See Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 376-77, 60 S.Ct. 317, 319-320, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940); <em>Moore\u2019s, supra </em>\u00b6 60.-25[2], at 296-97. A void judgment, as opposed to an erroneous one, is one which from its inception was legally ineffective. <em>See Williams v. North Carolina, </em>325 U.S. 226, 65 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed. 1577 (1945); <em>Jordan v. Gilligan, </em>500 F.2d 701, 710 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1996, 44 L.Ed.2d 481 (1975); <em>Lubben v. Selective Service System, </em>453 F.2d at 649; 7 Moore\u2019s, <em>supra </em>\u00b6 60.25[2].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">In the present ease, even assuming the district court erred in construing its statutory grant of authority by not joining the United States, we hold such jurisdictional error does not render the judgment void within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">We reach this conclusion because the court was vested with power to deal with this type of case and had acquired jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>tion over the parties before it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is clear that the district court had original jurisdiction to decide GLC\u2019s and the Railway Co.\u2019s claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a); it also had jurisdiction to review the ICC order entered upon referral under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It had jurisdiction over the general subject matter and accordingly could decide whether the United States should be joined and whether its nonjoinder was a jurisdictional defect. Even assuming the district court erred, the error has no bearing on its power to decide those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The district court implicitly decided whether joinder of the United States, a prerequisite for review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321(a), 2342, was also required for it to review an order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336(b). With jurisdiction over the type of case and over the parties, the court could enter a judgment for money damages. In doing so, it could determine whether it had jurisdiction to entertain the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment and for this purpose construe and apply the statutes under which it was requested to grant relief. An erroneous decision on the interpretation and applicability of sections 1336(b) and 2322 would not deprive it of power to decide. As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">Whatever the contention as to jurisdiction may be, whether it is that the boundaries of a valid statute have been transgressed, or that the statute itself is invalid, the question of jurisdiction is still one for judicial determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-9\"><em>Chicot County Drainage District </em>v. <em>Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 377, 60 S.Ct. 317, 320, 84 L.Ed.2d 329 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Under the circumstances, the judgment may not be vacated under Rule 60(b)(4). <em>Marshall v. Board of Education, </em>575 F.2d 417, 422 (3rd Cir. 1978); <em>Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, </em>570 F.2d at 15-16 (by implication); <em>Ben Sager Chemicals v. E. Targosz &amp; Co., </em>560 F.2d at 812; <em>cf. Jackson v. Irving Trust Co., </em>311 U.S. 494, 61 S.Ct. 326, 85 L.Ed. 297 (1941) (motion to set aside, prior to promulgation of Rule 60(b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Competing policies are at stake in setting aside a federal court judgment as void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction: observation of limits on federal jurisdiction and need for judgments that are final. However, when the challenge is to an erroneous interpretation of a statutory grant of jurisdiction and the judgment is not appealed, thus becoming final, the policy favoring certainty in judicial resolution of controversies prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The panel opinion is ordered vacated and the district court judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-5\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-6\">(b) <em>Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. </em>On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . (4) the judgment is void; .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. The court did not hold that the United States was an indispensable party, nor that its absence alone deprived the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Even if the United States is deemed an indispensable party, its absence may not be a jurisdictional defect. Some cases have used language indicating dismissal for nonjoinder of an indispensable party is dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Agrashell, Inc. v. Ham-mons Prods. Co., </em>352 F.2d 443, 447 (8th Cir. 1965). The weight of authority is against this characterization. <em>See, e.g., Mallow v. Hinde, </em>25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 193, 196, 6 L.Ed. 599 (1827); <em>Clarkson Co. v. Shaheen, </em>544 F.2d 624, 628 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Tryforos v. Icarian Dev.

Stauffer, </em>19 F.2d 922 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>275 U.S. 551, 48 S.Ct. 114, 72 L.Ed. 421 (1927); <em>Agrashell Inc. v.

These authorities rely upon the history of the indispensable party doctrine in equity and the emphasis on equitable considerations in Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. This reasoning may be less persuasive when the joinder of party requirement is imposed by a statutory grant of jurisdiction. <em>See Noland v. United States Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>544 F.2d 333, 334 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-5\">. In granting relief, the district court not only had to implicitly decide whether the United States was a necessary or indispensable party under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-23, but also whether the ICC order was in effect one for payment of money, which would be statutorily exempted from the requirement of joinder of the United States, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2321(b), and whether join-der was not necessary because the ICC order was advisory only.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We note that the statutory exemption from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-23 procedures, section 2321(b), does not encompass GLC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim. GLC sought to avoid the effect of the ICC order, and section 2321(b) applies only to actions brought in district court to <em>enforce </em>an ICC payment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\">. It is basic that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) is not a substitute for appeal. <em>Horace v. St. Louis </em>S.W. <em>R.R., </em>489 F.2d 632, 633 (8th Cir. 1974). If a judgment is not void, but rather rests upon an erroneous jurisdictional determination, Rule 60(b)(4) is not properly invoked to extend time for appeal that has already expired. <em>See id.; Hoffman v. Celebrezze, </em>405 F.2d 833, 837 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\">. The concept of a void judgment is extremely limited. <em>V.T.A., Inc. v. Airco, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 220, 225 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, </em>570 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1978) (quoting <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Service System, </em>453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972)); <em>Ben Sager Chemicals v. E. Targosz &amp; Co., </em>560 F.2d 805, 812 (7th Cir. 1977). Professor Moore indicates the concept is so narrowly restricted that, although seemingly incongruous, a federal court judgment is almost never void because of lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>7 Moore\u2019s, <em>supra </em>fl 60.25[2], at 305-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940) (federal statute that was basis for decree subsequently ruled unconstitutional, nevertheless court has jurisdiction over parties and could pass implicitly on its jurisdiction over the claim or statute\u2019s constitutionality, even if its holding were erroneous); <em>Stoll v. Gottlieb, </em>305 U.S. 165, 171, 59 S.Ct. 134, 137, 83 L.Ed. 104 (1938) (no jurisdiction in federal bankruptcy court over subject matter of order, court with jurisdiction of parties nevertheless could erroneously decide there was); <em>Marshall v. Board of Educ., </em>575 F.2d 417, 422-23 (3d Cir. 1978) (application of statute to certain defendants later held to be unconstitutional, nevertheless judgment was not void since the court had jurisdiction to erroneously pass on the issue); 7 Moore\u2019s, <em>supra </em>\u00b6 60.25[2], at 302 (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Often determination of subject matter jurisdiction rests upon a finding of jurisdictional fact, rather than, as in this case, construing a statutory grant \u00f3f jurisdiction. When facts must be proven before a court will exercise its jurisdiction, voidness often turns upon the distinction between essential jurisdictional facts such as service of process or location of the res, and quasi-jurisdictional facts such as diversity of citizenship or amount in controversy. <em>See Noble v. Union River Logging R.R., </em>147 U.S. 165, 173-74, 13 S.Ct. 271, 273, 37 L.Ed. 123 (1893); <em>see, e.g., Lubben v.

I believe that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-23 was meant to apply to appeals to our court from an order of the ICC, not to appeals to our court from a district court case involving an action \u201cfor the payment of money.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b907-5\">MeMILLIAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJTz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"AD9\">After carefully considering the majority opinion and the concurring opinion, I continue to adhere to the general analysis set forth in the panel decision and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">To the extent relief under Rule 60(b)(4) enables a party to evade the doctrine of finality of judgments and to in effect appeal indirectly from a final judgment, I think this is the function of Rule 60(b)(4). In my view, the judgment of the district court is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, as is apparent from the face of the record, the United States was not a party to the proceedings below. In the present case, the failure to join the United States is a \u201cfatal\u201d jurisdictional defect. <em>See Schwartz v. Bowman, </em>244 F.Supp. 51, 69 (S.D.N.Y.1965), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom.

United States, </em>363 U.S. 202, 205, 80 S.Ct. 1131, 1133, 4 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1960) (the holding in this case prompted the amendment of \u00a7 1336). The action was initially filed in district court by the carrier to recover undercharges; the shipper filed a counterclaim for overcharges. Because the action raised questions within the primary jurisdiction of the ICC, the district court correctly referred the issues to the ICC. <em>E. g., United States v. Western Pacific R.R., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 164-65, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956). \u201cWhen that occurs, the court ordering the reference of such issues to the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, set aside, or annul a Commission order arising out of the referral . . . .\u201d <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 580, 86 S.Ct. at 1004. In addition, as noted by the concurring opinion, the ICC order at issue was basically an order for the payment of money and as such subject to judicial review by the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336(a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. ICC, </em>337 U.S. 426, 442, 69 S.Ct. 1410, 1419, 93 L.Ed. 1451 (1949); <em>Aluminum Co. of America v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 1268, 1269-70 (D.C.Cir. 1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">In my view, however, the shipper\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the district court, was either an action to set aside the ICC order finding that the higher specific commodity rates, as modified by the ICC, were applicable to the shipments at issue or an action challenging the adequacy of the reparations award (to the extent the carrier recovered less than it demanded). In either case, judicial review was available only in a direct review proceeding (under old \u00a7 17(9) or new \u00a7 17(10) of the Act), and not in an action for enforcement under \u00a7 16(2). In the absence of a reparations award, there is nothing upon which to base an enforcement action, <em>see Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 587, 86 S.Ct. at 1007; <em>United States v. ICC, supra, </em>337 U.S. at 439-41, 69 S.Ct. at 1417-18, and a shipper cannot challenge the adequacy of a reparations award in an enforcement action, <em>see Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 587, 86 S.Ct. at 1007, <em>citing Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. v. Brady, </em>288 U.S. 448, 457-58, 53 S.Ct. 441, 443, 77 L.Ed. 888 (1933); <em>D. L. Piazza Co. v. West Coast Line, </em>210 F.2d 947, 949 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 839, 75 S.Ct. 42, 99 L.Ed. 661 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The characterization of the action below as a direct review proceeding and not an enforcement action is critical because, although both involve \u201corders for the payment of money,\u201d only \u00a7 16(2) actions for the <em>enforcement </em>of orders for the payment of money are brought as ordinary civil actions. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(2); <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 585, 86 S.Ct. at 1006. In contrast, direct review proceedings are distinct proceedings for judicial review and have special procedural requirements, in particular that such actions be brought by or against the United States, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322. Originally, injunc-tive relief required a three-judge district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325, with direct review to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. However, \u00a7\u00a7 2324-25 were repealed in 1975, Act of Jan. 2, 1975, \u00a7 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Pub.L. No. 93-584, 88 Stat. 1918, and judicial review of orders other than for the payment of money or to enforce ICC orders is now in the courts of appeal, like review of other administrative agencies, with discretionary review by writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254 (writ of certiorari), 2341 <em>et seq. </em>(Judicial Review Act of 1950 (Hobbs Act)); <em>see generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 93-1569, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 7025, 7034-36 (report of Department of Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The action below was, in my opinion, a direct review proceeding to review an adverse reparations order. The fact that the ICC order under attack was one relating to the payment of money and thus in substance one for the payment of money meant that the order was \u201cnot of sufficient public importance to justify the accelerated judicial review procedure [the three-judge district court and direct review by the Supreme Court].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>ICC, supra, </em>337 U.S. at 442, 69 S.Ct. at 1419. \u201cThus, though the procedures set out in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-25 (1964 ed.) otherwise govern \u00a7 17(9) proceedings to review such orders, \u00a7 2325 is not applicable and the matter may be adjudicated by a single judge.\u201d <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 585, 86 S.Ct. at 1007. The provision requiring a three-judge district court (now repealed, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra) </em>does not apply to judicial review of adverse reparations orders, but the other provisions, including that requiring the action be brought against the United States, are applicable. Moreover, a reviewing court \u201cmay not formally set aside the Commission\u2019s order in an action in which neither the Commission nor the United States is a party.\u201d <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 599, 86 S.Ct. at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">In response to the argument that an action to set aside an order for the payment of money should be treated exactly like an action to enforce an order for the payment of money, I note that the Supreme Court in the <em>Atlantic </em>case addressed a similar argument. In that case the ICC resisted allowing a carrier to bring a direct review proceeding as a cross-action to the shipper\u2019s enforcement action. The ICC argued that \u201creparation orders respecting past rates are not of sufficient general importance to require their defense by the United States and the Commission, and the direct review proceeding should not be permitted regardless of the court in which it is brought.\u201d <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 605, 86 S.Ct. at 1017. The Supreme Court stated that this was apparently not the view of Congress and cited the 1964 amendments which placed jurisdiction and venue of the direct review proceeding following reference to the ICC under the primary jurisdiction doctrine in the referring court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336(b), 1398(b), in the referring court and not as an incident of the original action. <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 605-06, 86 S.Ct. at 1017. Thus, an action for direct review of an ICC order, which must be brought against the United States, may involve an order \u201cfor the payment of money.\u201d Apparently only actions to enforce an order for the payment of money pursuant to \u00a7 16(2) of the Act do not require the United States as a party to the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>As noted by the Supreme Court, the statutory provisions controlling the availability of judicial review in this case are \u201can historical patchwork subject to more than one interpretation.\u201d <em>Atlantic, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 586 n. 4, 86 S.Ct. at 1007 n. 4. Nonetheless, because the proceeding below was a direct review proceeding to set aside an ICC order for the payment of money and as such should have been brought against the United States, but was not, I would find that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and would reverse the denial of the Rule 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(10) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-7\">Judicial relief from decisions, etc., upon denial or other disposition of application for rehearing etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-8\">When an application for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of any decision, order, or requirement of a division, an individual Commission, or a board with respect to any matter or referred to him or it shall have been made and shall have been denied, or after rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration otherwise disposed of, by the Commission or an appellate division, a suit to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside such a decision, order, or requirement, in whole or in part, may be brought in a court of the United States under those provisions of law applicable in the case of suits to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside orders of the Commission, but not otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">This section was formerly numbered \u00a7 17(9) and was added to the Interstate Commerce Act in 1940 by the Transportation Act of 1940, ch. 722, \u00a7 12, 54 Stat. 916.

When the case was returned to the district court, the shipper moved for a summary judgment on its counterclaim, seeking a construction of the tariff inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s ruling. That motion triggered the statutory procedures for review of an ICC order, which require that the United States be joined. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322 (1976). The statutes preclude a federal trial judge from making a tariff interpretation without complying with the procedures mandated by Congress; thus, such ruling amounts to a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In <em>Schwartz v.

The jurisdictional issue did not surface until the Railway Co. brought its motion for relief from a void judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4).
