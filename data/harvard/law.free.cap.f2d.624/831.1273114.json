HANSON, Senior United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b912-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America (union) petition for review of a decision and order of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB found that the intervenor-respondent, O\u2019Sullivan, Muckle, Kron Mortuary (O\u2019Sullivan), was not a joint employer of funeral vehicle drivers. Therefore, O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement did not violate section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Intervenor-respondent, O\u2019Sullivan, operates a funeral home and employs embalmers and other general employees. However, O\u2019Sullivan has never employed permanent funeral vehicle drivers but instead obtains these services from other mortuaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">O\u2019Sullivan is also a member of The Funeral Directors of Greater St. Louis, Inc. (the association). The association has for several years negotiated and entered into collective bargaining agreements with two units of employees, embalmers and drivers. O\u2019Sullivan has in the past become an individual signatory to agreements involving both employee units. But upon the reopening of negotiations in the spring of 1978, O\u2019Sullivan refused to become an individual signatory to the contract applicable to drivers. Past and present collective bargaining agreements have required that signatories contact service companies, in this case Albert H. Hoppe, Inc. (Hoppe), for funeral vehicle services prior to contacting other mortuaries. O\u2019Sullivan now uses both association and nonassociation funeral vehicle services.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">O\u2019Sullivan obtains vehicles and drivers from Hoppe by placing an order by phone. Vehicles and drivers are then dispatched by Hoppe to the location specified by the mortuary. Duties of the drivers depend on the particular service provided, including driving hearses, flower wagons, body pickup vans or other vehicles. Duties may vary somewhat depending on the desires of the mortuary\u2019s funeral director or family members. Hoppe pays its drivers a weekly salary and bills the mortuary for a flat amount for the vehicle and driver. Hoppe is solely responsible for the hiring, assignment, disciplining and discharging of its drivers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>There is no financial management interchange between O\u2019Sullivan and Hoppe.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The union filed a complaint with the NLRB regarding O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s refusal to sign the collective bargaining agreement. The Administrative Law Judge (AU) found that O\u2019Sullivan was a joint employer of the drivers and therefore was obligated to execute the collective bargaining agreement reached by the multiemployer bargaining unit. However, upon review of the AU\u2019s decision, the NLRB found that the \u201cminimal amount of control in the context of the entire relationship between [O\u2019Sullivan] and Hoppe\u201d does not \u201cwarrant the conclusion that [O\u2019Sullivan] is a joint employer of these drivers.\u201d The union has petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The record shows that O\u2019Sullivan is not involved in the hiring, disciplining or discharging of drivers and has never recommended such action be taken by Hoppe. Also, O\u2019Sullivan has no control over the wages paid to the drivers and in fact drivers are paid a flat weekly salary as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement. The Board also notes that \u201c[m]ere membership in the Association proves nothing with respect to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s relationship to Hoppe or Hoppe\u2019s employees since the Association also represents members in negotiations for a unit of embalmers. O\u2019Sullivan * * * actively participated in the contract covering the embalmers\u2019 unit and signed that contract.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan and Hoppe are not jointly owned or managed nor have they entered into written or oral contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The Board\u2019s order indicates that \u201c \u2018the critical factor in determining whether a joint employer relationship exists is the control which one party exercises over the labor relations policy of the other.\u2019 \u201d Citing, <em>The Southland Corporation, d/b/a Speedee 7-Eleven, </em>170 N.L.R.B. 1332, 1334 (1968). The Board argues that this test should be used to evaluate a joint employer claim rather than the test cited in <em>Pulitzer Publishing Co. v. NLRB, </em>618 F.2d 1275, (8th Cir. 1980). In <em>Pulitzer </em>the test applied was whether the total relationship of two nominally separate businesses reveals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">(1) some functional interrelation of operations, (2) centralized control of labor relations, (3) common management, and (4) common ownership or financial control. While none of these factors, separately viewed, have been held controlling, stress has normally been laid upon the first three factors which reveal functional integration with particular reference to whether there is centralized control of labor relations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-9\"><em>Pulitzer, </em>at 1279, citing, <em>Parklane Hosiery Co., </em>203 N.L.R.B. 597, 612, <em>amended on other grounds, </em>207 N.L.R.B. 999 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We decline the Board\u2019s invitation to modify the <em>Pulitzer </em>test but note that under either test the facts recited would clearly not establish a joint employer relationship. Therefore, we deny the union\u2019s petition for review of the order of the Board dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
