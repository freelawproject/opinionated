Thomas Shaughnessy et al., </em>601 F.2d 670 (2nd Cir. 1979) and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, </em>444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-22\">As shown in our June 29, 1979 opinion, this case came before us on the petition of Walter Tantzen, Inc. [Tantzen] and its insurer for review of the December 29, 1978 order of the Benefits Review Board [BRB], United States Department of Labor, awarding Shaughnessy compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act [LHWCA], as amended in 1972, 86 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>1251, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>The briefs presented the sole question whether Shaughnessy was an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3).\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In our June 29,1979 opinion, 601 F.2d 670 (2nd Cir., 1979), we did not pass upon that contention, but ruled that the award had to be set aside on the ground that there was no proof that the employer had any employee \u201cemployed in maritime employment,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 2(4) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In our then view \u201cmaritime employment\u201d was an exclusively geographic term, referring to employment on navigable water, and there being no proof that the claimant or any other of Tantzen\u2019s employees was employed on navigable waters, we held that the Act did not impose any liability upon Tantzen.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On November 27, 1979 in <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co. v. Ford, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that as used in \u00a7 2(3) and \u00a7 2(4) of the LHWCA \u201cmaritime employment\u201d refers to occupational status.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Inasmuch as we were mistaken in giving to the term \u201cmaritime employment\u201d as used in \u00a7 2(4) a geographic meaning, we must now direct our attention to the question which we did not previously decide: that is, whether the <em>claimant </em>was an employee within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The Administrative Law Judge [ALJ] found that after longshoremen had unloaded bales of rubber from the ship and placed them inside the pier, Tantzen\u2019s personnel \u201cmove the commodity in position to be weighed, after which the bale is opened by means of pry bars and a cutting instrument to be inspected. The container is reclosed by Employer\u2019s [i. e. Tantzen\u2019s] men, and then the commodity is moved by longshoremen to its ultimate destination to be accepted by the consignee.\u201d On that finding the ALJ concluded that the claimant was engaged in maritime employment, and the ALJ entered a compensation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Upon appeal, the BRB held that the claimant was engaged in longshoring operations which were a type of maritime employment within the meaning of \u00a7 2(3) of the LHWCA, and upheld the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">When this case was previously before us we, without deciding the question, expressed a doubt as to whether on the record as it stood we could affirm the BRB\u2019s conclusion that Shaughnessy was engaged in longshoring operations. <em>Walter Tantzen, Inc. v. Shaughnessy, </em>601 F.2d 670, 672-673, footnote 5 (2nd Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Our doubts have now been set at rest by the method followed by the Supreme Court in affirming an LHWCA compensation award in <em>P. C. Pfeiffer Co., Inc. v. Ford, supra. </em>There the critical question was whether \u201clongshoremen . . would fasten military vehicles onto railroad flat cars if those vehicles went directly from a ship to the railroad cars,\u201d 444 U.S. 82, 100 S.Ct. 337. If that were the case, Ford would be entitled to have been regarded as engaged in maritime employment when he fastened to railroad cars at the warehouse vehicles which had been delivered to the port by ship, taken to the warehouse for storage, and there loaded onto flat cars which were to take the vehicles to their inland destination, 444 U.S. 69, 100 S.Ct. 328, 62 L.Ed.2d 225. The Supreme Court in deciding that longshoremen would ordinarily fasten military vehicles onto railroad cars if those vehicles went directly from ship to railroad cars seems not to have relied upon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>or required the BRB to have had, any specific evidence as to the issue. See footnotes 16,1, and 2 at 444 U.S. 82, 72, 73, 100 S.Ct. 337, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Following a like approach we conclude that Shaughnessy\u2019s activities in checking and inspecting cargo were longshoring operations, or their functional equivalent. Cf. <em>Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, </em>432 U.S. 249, 270-271, 97 S.Ct. 2348, 2360-2361, 53 L.Ed.2d 320 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We have an additional reason for affirming the BRB\u2019s order. The definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in \u00a7 2(3) of the LHWCA refers to \u201cany person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations . . .\u201d Hence to come within \u00a7 2(3) a claimant need not be \u201cengaged in longshoring operations.\u201d It is sufficient if he is in a \u201cmaritime employment\u201d <em>ejusdem generis. </em>Surely Shaughnessy\u2019s activities are of the same generic type as the activities of a land-based longshoreman, inasmuch as in both cases the activities involve the physical handling of cargo on the pier after it has been discharged from the vessel and before it is delivered to the consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>Petition denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. The relevant statutory section defining \u201cemployee,\u201d with emphasis indicating the material added to the original statute by 1972 amendments, 86 Stat. 1251, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3) (1970 ed. Supp. V) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">The term \u2018employee\u2019 <em>means any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor-worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker, but such term </em>does not include a master or member of a crew of any vessel, or any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-16\">. \u201cEmployer\u201d was defined in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-18\">The term \u2018employer\u2019 means an employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States [including any dry dock].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
