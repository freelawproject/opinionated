Cash, Jerry W. Heflin, and Philip H. Parsons, alleging that they had violated the registration and antifraud provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 5(a), (c) and 17(a), of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a), (c) and 77q(a), and the antifraud provision, \u00a7 10(b), of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. Prior to trial, Parsons accepted a consent judgment, and the district court dismissed as moot the case against Southwest Coal, following that corporation\u2019s dissolution. On July 19,1977 the court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of the SEC on the \u00a7 5(a), (c) registration violation question and, accordingly, granted a permanent injunction against further violations of that section by Cash and Heflin. Finally, after a trial to the bench, the court on November 9, 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>found that Cash and Heflin had contravened one of the antifraud provisions, \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the 1933 Act, and permanently enjoined them from committing any further violations. 439 F.Supp. 820, 826-27 (W.D. La.1977). The court held, however, that the SEC had failed to prove that Cash and Heflin had acted with the scienter requisite to violations of \u00a7 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act, \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act and rule 10b-5, and, therefore, declined to enter an injunction relating to future violations of these provisions. Each party appeals that aspect of the decision adverse to him. We affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to its disposition of the fraud issues under \u00a7\u00a7 17(a) and 10(b) and rule 10b-5, but reverse the judgment on the alleged \u00a7 5 registration violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">Southwest Coal &amp; Energy Company, a Texas corporation, was formed by Cash, Heflin and Parsons on August 26, 1974 for the purpose of selling undivided interests in oil and gas leases pursuant to Schedule D of the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 provided in Regulation B, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.-300-.346 (1979). <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(b) (statute under which regulation was promulgated). Each man owned one-third of the common stock of Southwest and served as a director. Parsons acted as its president, maintaining the company\u2019s principal place of business in Shreveport, Louisiana, and overseeing its day-to-day sales operations. Cash and Heflin maintained offices in Dallas, Texas, from which they acquired leases and supervised the drilling and completion of all of Southwest\u2019s wells. They also were responsible for preparing the Schedule D offering sheets, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.326 (1979), under which the interests were marketed. Between November 4, 1974 and November 20, 1975, Southwest filed 15 such offerings with the SEC, though it withdrew two and sold only 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">In addition to their interests in Southwest, Cash and Heflin, either directly or through a holding company, together controlled several other oil and gas drilling companies whose principal business similarly included the sale of Schedule D securities. In numerous instances, these affiliated companies held leases adjacent to Southwest\u2019s. Maps accompanying Southwest\u2019s offering sheets depicted these leases and wells surrounding the Southwest lease in which interests were being offered, but did not disclose that these adjoining leases belonged to affiliated companies. Moreover, Southwest occasionally acquired leases from these commonly controlled enterprises, and, while the offering sheets relating to such leases indicated that they had been purchased from other drilling companies, the offering sheets did not disclose that the sellers were also Cash and Heflin companies. The off\u00e9ring sheets also did not indicate that Cash and Heflin, who made the decision whether to \u201ccomplete\u201d any given well, received what was essentially a commission from the money solicited from investors for well completion once that determination had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">It was on the basis of these material omissions that the district court subsequently based its finding that Cash and Heflin had violated one of the antifraud provisions, \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The court reasoned, for example, that the illustration of the other companies\u2019 leases and wells adjacent to those in which Southwest was marketing interests, without the disclosure that these companies were affiliated with Southwest, could mislead an investor to believe that several independent companies had investigated the area and decided to drill there. 439 F.Supp. at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">On November 25, 1975 the State of Texas brought suit in two state courts against Cash, Heflin and a number of their companies \u2014 not including Southwest \u2014 for alleged violations of the registration and brokers\u2019 licensing provisions of the Texas Securities Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. arts. 581\u2014 7(A)(1), 581-12 (Vernon 1964 &amp; Supp.1980). Temporary restraining orders precluding further improper sales of securities, dated that same day, were entered against all defendants and, after the actions were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>solidated and a hearing held, a similar temporary injunction issued on December 18, 1975. Southwest, nonetheless, continued to sell a few Schedule D interests, but did not disclose to investors the existence of the injunction or the litigation. Finally on January 20, 1976, due to the injunctions entered against two of Southwest\u2019s directors and controlling shareholders and several affiliate corporations, the SEC formally suspended all Regulation B exemptions under which Southwest had been marketing its interests, and all sales ceased..</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\">II. REGISTRATION VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">A. <em>\u201cUnavailability\u201d of Regulation B Exemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">The district court based its summary judgment determination that \u00a7 5(a), (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had been violated on the notion that, since the entry of the injunction against Southwest\u2019s directors and affiliates had rendered the Regulation B exemption \u201cunavailable\u201d to Southwest under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.-306(a)(2) (1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the exemptions under which it had been operating were automatically rendered ineffective upon the issuance of that injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, those few sales executed after the entry of the injunction were held to have been without benefit of exemption (or, of course, registration) and, therefore, to have been in violation of \u00a7 5(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-17\">There is no dispute that the issuance of the injunction here made the Regulation B exemption \u201cunavailable\u201d to Southwest pursuant to \u00a7 230.306(a)(2). All parties further acknowledge that this made Southwest ineligible to qualify for a Regulation B exemption for any subsequent offering<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that it furnished adequate grounds for the January 20, 1976 formal suspension of the exemptions covering all of Southwest\u2019s existing offerings. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.334(a)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>(1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Tabby\u2019s International, Inc. v. SEC, </em>479 F.2d 1080 (5th Cir. 1973) (post-filing occurrence of contingency making exemption unavailable is ground for suspension of exemption under analogous provisions of Regulation A, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.-251-.263 (1979)); 3 L. Loss, Securities Regulation 626 (2d ed. 1961). Cash and Heflin part company with the SEC and the district court, however, as to the independent effect of \u201cunavailability\u201d on exemptions previously secured for Southwest\u2019s outstanding offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Cash and Heflin contend that when an exemption is secured for a particular qualified offering of securities by the filing of the requisite materials with the SEC<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and a post-filing <em>event </em>\u2014 viz., the issuance of the injunction here \u2014 transpires that admittedly would have precluded the offeror from qualifying his offering for the exemption had the event occurred before the filing or use of the Regulation B materials, this occurrence does not automatically render ineffective the exemption previously secured for the offering then outstanding. The occurrence or contingency only furnishes a ground for formal suspension of these outstanding exemptions. The criteria for \u201cavailability\u201d and \u201cunavailability,\u201d Cash and Heflin argue \u2014 aside from the express adoption in \u00a7 230.334(a)(1) of \u201cunavailability\u201d as a ground for formal suspension \u2014 pertain only to the <em>eligibility </em>of an offeror to qualify a given offering for the exemption at the outset. \u201cAvailability\u201d does not relate to the continued vitality of an exemption once secured; this is relegated solely to the formal suspension mechanism. We agree and, therefore, reject the district court\u2019s ruling on this point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">That the \u201cavailability\u201d or \u201cunavailability\u201d of an exemption under \u00a7 230.306(a) relates only to the threshold eligibility of an offeror to obtain an exemption for a new offering is demonstrated by the language of the pertinent provisions and the overall structure of Regulation B. First, \u00a7 230.-306(a)(l)-(6), \u25a0 which delineates the various situations in which an exemption will not be available, speaks only to disqualifying events that occur within specific periods <em>\u201cprior to </em>the filing or use of such offering sheet.\u201d (Emphasis added). Similarly, \u00a7 230.306(c) further provides that even if one of these disqualifying contingencies has occurred, the offering may still proceed if the offeror can demonstrate that it is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors \u201cthat the exemption be denied\u201d for this offering. The language of these provisions thus focuses solely on the period prior to the attainment of an exemption for a given offering and the commencement of the offering thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-10\">More importantly, the SEC interpretation of \u201cavailability,\u201d adopted by the district <em>court </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that the post-filing occurrence of one of the disqualifying contingencies enumerated in \u00a7 230.306(a) automatically dissolves all extant exemptions for out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>standing offerings in addition to barring qualification for new ones \u2014 is inconsistent with the overall structure of Regulation B. In addition to their role in establishing threshold eligibility for new Regulation B exemptions, the concept of \u201cunavailability\u201d and its criteria are expressly incorporated into \u00a7 230.334(a)(1) as grounds for the formal suspension of outstanding exemptions. To infer, additionally, from the post-filing occurrence of one of those contingencies for \u201cunavailability\u201d the automatic revocation of all extant exemptions would circumvent and render essentially superfluous this formal suspension mechanism expressly provided for such contingencies \u2014 certainly not the intention of the drafters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, such a result would directly conflict with the implication of \u00a7 230.338(a), which provides that when a suspension order is entered, an offering sheet that has become \u201ceffective shall no longer be effective ..\u201d This section plainly contemplates the active divesting of an exemption by the suspension order itself, rather than the mere confirmation of an earlier, automatic dissolution of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">In the analogous context of the Regulation A exemption, the SEC recently presented essentially this same automatic suspension argument to the Ninth Circuit in <em>SEC v. Blazon Corp., </em>609 F.2d 960, 968-69 (9th Cir. 1979). There, as here, the regulatory scheme expressly provided for the invocation of a formal suspension procedure upon the same ground argued by the SEC as a basis for automatic dissolution of the exemption. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.261(a)(2) (1979). Recognizing, as have we, that the SEC interpretation would circumvent and render superfluous this formal procedure, the Ninth Circuit rejected this approach and held that an exemption, once acquired, continues until formally suspended by the SEC pursuant to the prescribed formal procedure. 609 F.2d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">Accordingly, we hold that a post-filing occurrence that would have rendered the Regulation B exemption unavailable to an offeror for any subsequent offerings does not, aside from its use as grounds for formal suspension proceedings, result in the dissolution of previously acquired exemptions under which the offeror is conducting outstanding offerings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Accord, </em>3 L. Loss, <em>supra, </em>at 628. Consequently, Southwest\u2019s sales of securities from outstanding offerings in the interim between the issuance of the injunction and the formal suspension of all Southwest exemptions were made under a still viable Regulation B exemption and, therefore, were not in violation of \u00a7 5(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">B. <em>Fraud in Offering Sheet as Voiding Exemption Ab Initio</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">Our rejection of the automatic suspension theory upon which the district court predicated its holding does not end our inquiry into Southwest\u2019s alleged transgression of \u00a7 5(a), (c), however. This court has discretion to affirm the summary judgment under a different legal theory if that theory finds support in the record, and we would not wrongfully deny one party\u2019s right to trial or due process by so doing. <em>Davis v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>525 F.2d 1204, 1207-08 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>See Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 475 n.6, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1156 n.6, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>As an alternative ground in support of its motion for summary judgment below on the alleged \u00a7 5 violations, the SEC asserted that Southwest actually had never properly qualified for the Regulation B exemptions upon which it relied since its Schedule D offering sheets were all misleading due to the failure of Cash and Heflin to disclose significant facts in those documents. Such materially defective offering sheets, the SEC reasoned, did not satisfy the initial filing requirements of Regulation B, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.310, .326, .330(a) (1979). Since, as indicated above, the district court did eventually find after trial that there were such material omissions from these offering sheets, the SEC now contends that the summary judgment, holding the appellants to have violated \u00a7 5(a), (c) may be upheld on this alternative theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">The SEC relies for support for its theory primarily upon an analogy to the rule announced in <em>SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 1082, 1098-1100 (2d Cir. 1972). There the Second Circuit inferred a mandate of truthfulness in the prospectus content requirements of \u00a7 10(a) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77j(a), and held that a prospectus, which became misleading due to the issuer\u2019s failure to amend it to reflect material post-registration changes of circumstances, would not satisfy \u00a7 10(a). Therefore, sales pursuant to such a prospectus were held to have violated \u00a7 5 of the 1933 Act in addition to creating potential liability under the antifraud provisions. <em>Accord, e. g., A. J. White &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>556 F.2d 619, 622 (1st Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 969, 98 S.Ct. 516, 54 L.Ed.2d 457 (1977) (following <em>Manor Nursing </em>without analysis of principle); <em>SEC v. Wilis, </em>472 F.Supp. 1250, 1256 n.2 (D.D.C.1978) (dictum); <em>Jefferies &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Arkus-Duntov, </em>357 F.Supp. 1206, 1214-15 (S.D.N.Y.1973). Similarly, the SEC contends, an untruthful or misleading offering sheet cannot fulfill the Regulation B filing requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 230.310 and .326; therefore, any exemption purportedly secured upon such an offering sheet is void, and sales executed in reliance on it will have been without benefit of registration or exemption and, thus, in violation of \u00a7 5(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">There is some superficial logical appeal to the SEC thesis, as distilled from <em>Manor Nursing. </em>However, as was the case with its theory of automatic suspension of exemptions, we do not believe the SEC theory comports with the overall framework of Regulation B or the securities laws as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-9\">The federal securities laws were enacted primarily to serve two distinct goals: 1) to promote or require sufficient disclosure of information to allow those in securities markets to make intelligent investment decisions, and 2) to control fraud and manipulation in the trading of securities. <em>Accord, </em>Comment, <em>Truth Up to the Date of Use as a Requirement for a Section 10(a) Prospectus: The Implications of SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc., </em>24 Case W.Res.L.Rev. 771, 776-77 (1973); 71 Mich. L.Rev. 591, 594-96 (1973). Essentially discrete statutory mechanisms and provisions were designed to effectuate each of these goals. For example, \u00a7\u00a7 5-8, 10 and 12(1) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e-77h, 77j and 77/(1), relate the standards for disclosure or registration and sanctions and remedies for failure to follow these dictates, while \u00a7\u00a7 11,' 12(2) and 17, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 77/(2) and 77q, prescribe standards, sanctions and remedies for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">The <em>Manor Nursing </em>thesis of fraud as a basis for \u00a7 5 violations has been roundly criticized by commentators<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2014 we believe rightly so \u2014 for it ignores this dichotomy, intertwines these distinct concepts, and in so doing, derails the statutory balance and mechanisms specifically designed to serve each of these discrete goals. For example, \u00a7 12(1) provides strict liability for one who offers or sells a security in violation of \u00a7 5. Sections 11 and 12(2) similarly provide liability for offers or sales of securities upon misrepresentation or misleading nondisclosure of material facts, but only if the offer- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>or cannot demonstrate that he did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, of the untruth or omission. Under the <em>Manor Nursing </em>construct, however, one who proves a misrepresentation actionable under \u00a7 11 or \u00a7 12(2) has also proved a violation of \u00a7 5, thus automatically establishing liability <em>per se </em>under \u00a7 12(1). Not only does this interpretation render \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 12(2) essentially superfluous as remedial mechanisms, but it also obliterates the due diligence defense contained in these sections, plainly intended to be available to defendants in actions under the 1933 Act based on such misrepresentations or nondisclosures. Such a result could not possibly have been intended by the drafters of these provisions. <em>See Byrnes v. Faulkner, Dawkins &amp; Sullivan, </em>413 F.Supp. 453, 465-66 (S.D.N.Y.1976), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>550 F.2d 1303 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Since Regulation B merely erects alternative disclosure requirements to the statutory registration procedure, while retaining the statutory sanctions for fraud and for failure to meet these alternative disclosure or registration requirements, the theory urged here by the SEC \u2014 -that sales pursuant to a misleading Schedule D offering sheet cannot, by definition, have been made under a validly obtained Regulation B exemption \u2014 is susceptible to the same criticism as the <em>Manor Nursing </em>decision from which it derives. That an offering sheet which formally complies with the disclosure requirements of Schedule D is misleading in some respect, should not automatically render void <em>ab initio </em>a Regulation B exemption obtained on the basis of that offering sheet.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 3 L. Loss, <em>supra, </em>at 628-29. Rather, as in the <em>Manor Nursing </em>situation, these misrepresentations and material nondisclo-sures may be adequately dealt with under the pertinent antifraud provisions expressly designed for that purpose, <em>see </em>part III of this opinion <em>infra, </em>instead of under \u00a7 5(a), (c), which is more appropriately focused upon failures to adhere to the prescribed formal mechanisms or procedures for disclosure, offers, and sales.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We, therefore, reject the SEC\u2019s alternative theory in support of the district court\u2019s determination that Cash and Heflin violated \u00a7 5, and reverse the summary judgment on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-9\">III. ANTIFRAUD VIOLATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">As indicated above, the district court found that Southwest\u2019s Schedule D offering sheets, prepared by Cash and Heflin, were marked by material nondisclosures. Although Cash and Heflin conceded knowledge of the omitted facts, the district court explicitly found that the SEC had not proved the nondisclosures to have been the fruit of \u201can intent to defraud or deceive or a reckless disregard for the truth\u201d on their part.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 439 F.Supp. at 824-25. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>In attempting to apply the law to these findings of fact, the court reasoned that proof of scienter (an intent to deceive, defraud or manipulate) recently held to be a requisite element of private damages claims under \u00a7 10(b) and rule 10b-5, <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 193 &amp; n.12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1381 &amp; n.12, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), was also required in SEC injunctive actions under these provisions. Moreover, due to the congruity of the language of \u00a7 17(a)(1)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with that of \u00a7 10(b)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and rule 10b-5(a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the court concluded that proof of scienter should similarly be required under \u00a7 17(a)(1). Consequently, since in its view the SEC had failed to prove scienter, the district court found no violation of these provisions. On the other hand, the court reasoned that the language of \u00a7 17(a)(2) focused only on the <em>effects </em>of misrepresentations or nondisclosures and not on the state of mind of the defendant in making them, and therefore that it did not require proof of scienter. Accordingly, the court found that Cash and Heflin had run afoul of \u00a7 17(a)(2) simply on the basis of their material nondisclosures and entered an appropriate injunction upon that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">The SEC has attacked the district court judgment, contending that, unlike the situation in private damages actions, proof of scienter should not be required for prophylactic SEC injunctive actions based on \u00a7\u00a7 17(a)(1), 10(b) or rule 10b-5. Conversely, Cash and Heflin have argued that scien-ter is also an element of a \u00a7 17(a)(2) claim and that the district court therefore erred in finding any fraud violation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-13\">Although this court in <em>Steadman v. SEC, </em>603 F.2d 1126, 1131-33 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1849, 64 L.Ed.2d 271 (1980) and <em>SEC v. Blatt, </em>583 F.2d 1325, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978), had recently confirmed the district court\u2019s interpretation, we delayed decision in this case to await the Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of these issues in <em>Aaron v. SEC, </em>444 U.S. 914, 100 S.Ct. 227, 62 L.Ed.2d 168, <em>granting cert. to </em>605 F.2d 612 (2d Cir. 1979). The Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Aaron </em>completely and finally confirmed the prescient interpretation of the district court here as to the scienter requirements in SEC injunctive and enforcement actions based on the various antifraud provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>1933 and 1934 Acts. - U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1945, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980). Accordingly, we reject the challenges of both parties on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-6\">The SEC argues finally, however, that adequate evidence of Cash\u2019s and Heflin\u2019s reckless disregard for the truth was adduced to prove scienter.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>. <em>See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. at 193 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1381 n.12 (suggesting reckless disregard for truth may suffice as scienter in some circumstances); <em>First Virginia Bankshares v. Benson, </em>559 F.2d 1307, 1314 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 952, 98 S.Ct. 1580, 55 L.Ed.2d 802 (1978) (noting recklessness as adequate for scienter). The district court\u2019s express finding that the requisite intent or recklessness was not proved is, however, reviewable here only for clear error, and the SEC has not raised sufficient question to clear so substantial a hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons articulated above, the judgment of the district court with respect to Cash\u2019s and Heflin\u2019s violation of the various antifraud provisions is affirmed; the judgment holding Cash and Heflin to have contravened \u00a7 5(a), (c), however, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-8\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">. Section 5(a), (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a), (c), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-8\">(a) Unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-9\">(1) to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell such security through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-10\">(2) to carry or cause to be carried through the mails or in interstate commerce, by any means or instruments of transportation, any such security for the purpose of sale or for delivery after sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-12\">(c) it shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to make use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy through the use or medium of any prospectus or otherwise any security, unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security, or while the registration statement is the subject of a refusal order or stop order or (prior to the effective date of the registration statement) any public proceeding or examination under section [8],</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.306(a)(2) (1979), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azc\">(a) No exemption shall be available under this regulation to any offeror if such offeror or any officer, director, predecessor, or affiliate of such offeror as a result of any civil, criminal, or governmental or self-regulatory administrative proceeding, or examination commenced after January 1, 1973:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-19\"># * * # * Sk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-20\">(2) Is subject to any order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction entered within 5 years prior to the filing or use of an offering sheet, temporarily or permanently restraining or enjoining such offer- or from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, or arising out of such person\u2019s conduct as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment advisor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1395-21\">. The district court held the Regulation B exemption to have become unavailable upon the entry of the temporary injunction on December 18, 1975. Even though it appears that the earlier issuance of the temporary restraining orders, dated November 20, 1975, Pltf. exh. 25 &amp; 26, should also have triggered \u00a7 230.-306(a)(2), in this opinion we shall for the sake of convenience adopt the district court\u2019s focus on the injunction, since this discrepancy in dates is essentially irrelevant to the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1395-22\">. In fact, on November 20, 1975 \u2014 the date of the temporary restraining orders \u2014 Southwest apparently had submitted a Schedule D offering sheet for a new offering pursuant to Regulation B. Because of the Texas State Court injunction, however, the SEC requested that this application be withdrawn, and this request was complied with on December 1, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.334(a)(1) (1979), provides: (a) The Commission may, at any time after the filing of an offering sheet, enter an order temporarily suspending the exemption if it has reason to believe that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbaX\">(1) No exemption is available under Regulation B (\u00a7\u00a7 230.300-230.346) for the securities purported to be offered hereunder, or any of the terms or conditions of this Regulation B have not been complied with, including failure to file any reports.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">. The Regulation B exemption, promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(b), is available for offerings of certain fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights up to an aggregate amount of $250,-000 per offering. The principal prerequisite to obtaining an exemption is the filing of an \u201coffering sheet\u201d of the form and content prescribed by Schedule A, B, C, or D, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.326(a) (1979), whichever is appropriate to the particular type of interest to be offered. Generally, a properly submitted offering sheet becomes \u201ceffective\u201d and the offering may commence on the eleventh day after the filing. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.310(a) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">. We recognize that the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption from registration is on the party claiming it. <em>Pharo v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 656, 665 n.3 (5th Cir. 1980). There is, however, no dispute that Southwest had previously qualified for the purported exemption under which it continued sales of securities after the issuance of the injunction. The only issue here is the legal effect of the post-filing injunction on that exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">. Compare 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.320 (1979) which does automatically remove the cloak of the Regulation B exemption from offers and sales made in connection with improper estimations of the amount of oil and gas recoverable from the tract in question. In contrast to the provisions and contingencies involved here, \u00a7 230.-320 explicitly adverts to post-filing occurrences, and the basis for its automatic sanction is not also made a ground for formal suspension of the exemption under \u00a7 230.334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">. In so holding we do not suggest that where a \u00a7 230.306(a) disqualifying contingency has occurred prior to filing, the SEC in its suspension proceedings may not recognize this fact and declare the exemption void <em>ab initio </em>for the particular offering in question. In such a situation, unlike that here, the offeror will never have rightfully qualified for the exemption and \u2014 though the SEC may not discover this for some time \u2014 no exemption will ever have actually existed. Consequently, all sales in reliance on such an abortive attempt at exemption will from the outset have been potentially in violation of \u00a7 5(a), (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>2 A. Bromberg &amp; L. Lowenfels, Securities Fraud and Commodities Fraud \u00a7 6.11 (321) (1979); Comment, supra; 71 Mich.L.Rev. 591 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">. It might be that if an offering sheet were so incomplete or so permeated with misrepresentations that it was functionally equivalent to filing no offering sheet at all, the filing requirements of Regulation B would not be met, and sales pursuant to such an offering sheet would then contravene \u00a7 5(a), (c). Indeed, one district court has stated that this is the proper scope and interpretation of the rule in <em>Manor Nursing. Byrnes v. Faulkner, Dawkins &amp; Sullivan, </em>413 F.Supp. at 466. We are not faced with that situation here, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">. We do not intend by our holding here to intimate any view as to the viability of the SEC thesis in an analogous context under the Regulation A exemption. That a misleading offering circular may never be used is explicitly raised as a condition of that exemption. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.256(e) (1979). <em>See SEC v. Cooper, </em>402 F.Supp. 516, 524 (S.D.N.Y.1975). No analogous provision appears in Regulation B. <em>Cl </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.330(a) (1979) (closest Regulation B approximation of \u00a7 230.256(e), merely provides that offering sheets shall constitute continuing representations to investors who rely on them that their contents are \u201csubstantially correct and that no material fact has been omitted\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">. The SEC also alleged grosser affirmative misrepresentations by Southwest\u2019s salesmen. Without resolving the conflicting testimony on this point, the district court held that Cash and Heflin were not responsible for these misrepresentations, if they occurred, since they had delegated actual supervision of the sales crew to Parsons. 439 F.Supp. at 823-24. Moreover, the court found no reckless disregard for the truth in this delegation of supervision. <em>Id. </em>at 824. These conclusions are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">.

The degree of recklessness in one\u2019s disregard for the truth necessary to serve as scienter is extremely high. The generally accepted formulation of this standard of recklessness was articulated in <em>Franke v. Midwestern Okla. Dev-el. Auth., </em>428 F.Supp. 719, 725 (W.D.Okl.1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arg-dedup-0\">[R]eckless conduct may be defined as a highly unreasonable omission, involving not merely simple, or even unexcusable negligence, but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1401-11\"><em>Accord, e. g. McLean v. Alexander, </em>599 F.2d 1190, 1197 (3d Cir. 1979) (quoting <em>Franke </em>standard); <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben,</em></p>\n<p id=\"alv-dedup-0\">598 F.2d 1017, 1025 (6th Cir. 1979) (same); <em>Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chem.

Cash\u2019s and Heflin\u2019s mere knowledge of the omitted facts would not suffice as scienter under this formulation. Rather, the \u201cdanger of misleading buyers\u201d from these known omissions must have been actually known or so obvious that Cash and Heflin \u201cmust have been aware of it.\u201d <em>Sundstrand Corp. v.
