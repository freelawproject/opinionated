Appellants claimed that Wyman-Gordon maintained employment policies and practices which discriminated against members of the class on account of their race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The gravamen of appellants\u2019 complaint is that they were hired as janitors or porters in the defendant\u2019s Housekeeping Department, while white workers were hired for better paying jobs in other departments with greater opportunity for advancement. After a nine day trial on issues of liability before the court sitting without a jury, judgment was entered for the defendant and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The evidence produced at trial consisted of three days of statistical proof and expert testimony for both sides and six days of nonstatistical proof including the testimony of individual plaintiffs, representatives of the defendant, and nonparty employees concerning the hiring and promotion practices within the company. The statistical evidence indicated that the percentage of minorities working in the company as a whole and within most departments was greater than the percentage of minority workers in the relevant Worcester area work force. It also indicated that the relative \u201coverrepre-sentation\u201d of minorities in the Housekeeping Department was greater than that of the other departments. The nonstatistical evidence, including findings of credibility made by the district court, showed that an appreciable number of blacks preferred housekeeping jobs to jobs in some other departments. The evidence also showed that the distribution of workers among the several departments was largely the result of numerous factors, including employee preferences, job qualifications, and economic conditions affecting job availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\n<em>Limitations Period</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in issuing an \u201canticipatory ruling\u201d that questions of liability would be determined as of February 28, 1969, at the earliest. Appellants argue that this is a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d case involving class claims of ongoing discrimination and that the limitations period under Title VII remains open back to the Act\u2019s effective date, July 1, 1965. As for the \u00a7 1981 claim, appellants argue that the appropriate limitations period adopted by the district court should have been the Massachusetts six year period for contracts actions, M.G.L. c. 260 \u00a7 2, rather than the two year tort statute, M.G.L. c. 260 \u00a7 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">Whether the district court\u2019s \u201canticipatory ruling\u201d was in fact error is, we think, irrelevant to our decision. Appellants do not point to a single instance in which the ruling affected the presentation of their claim. The district court exhaustively considered all of appellants\u2019 evidence, extending back even beyond 1965, and it found that there was no discrimination post-1964. The court therefore never found it necessary to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>mine finally the applicable limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Statistics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Pursuant to <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), appellants attempted to establish a prima facie case of discrimination largely on the basis of statistical evidence. In the course of this attempt, a question arose concerning the level of statistical probability that appellants should be required to demonstrate. The district court concisely posed the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cIf one were viewing a purely chance event such as a coin tossing, theoretically, in the long run, heads and tails would come down an equal number of times. In practice, experience shows that this is never exact. Hence the question is, assuming there are enough occurrences to constitute a fair sample, how large a departure from the mathematically expected norm may be attributed simply to chance, and when there is to be thought a significant variance, sufficient to suggest that some factor other than chance was operating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In answering this question, the district court decided to adopt the .05 level of significance, i. e., a level of precision that allows a variance from norms to be chalked up to randomness unless the probability of such a variance occurring is one out of twenty or less. This is a figure that was proposed by experts for both parties, that is commonly accepted in nonlegal contexts, and that is used by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in examining the validity of purportedly discriminatory employment tests, <em>see </em>Hallock, <em>The Numbers Game </em>\u2014 The <em>Use and Misuse of Statistics in Civil Rights Litigation, </em>23 Villanova Law Review 5, 11-13 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Appellants objected to the district court\u2019s decision and they contend that the .05 figure, while perhaps appropriate in other contexts, is in the context of this case arbitrary and unduly restrictive. They point out that, for example, a .10 figure would indicate that there was only a one out of ten chance that randomness was the explanation for a given disparity in the racial make-up of various departments of the company. Such an indication, appellants argue, should be adequate to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">In so arguing, appellants fail to suggest how the district court\u2019s adoption of the .05 figure harmed them, even assuming it was error. If the district court had completely adopted appellant\u2019s statistical theory, this would only have demonstrated that chance was not the cause of the disparity. To follow appellants to their goal, the establishment of a prima facie case, we would have to assume further that such a statistical demonstration would itself, in the absence of any corroborative nonstatistical proof, be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of race-based discrimination in the context of the suit. While such an assumption is by no means dictated by analogous Supreme Court precedent, <em>see International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 339, 97 S.Ct. at 1856 (\u201cBut, as even our brief summary of the evidence shows, this was not a case in which the Government relied on \u2018statistics alone\u2019.\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are willing to entertain it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>this instance for the purpose of demonstrating the flaw in appellants\u2019 argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">This flaw lies in the fact that fully adopting appellants\u2019 reasoning only brings us to the point of finding that they made out a prima facie case. The district court, however, specifically found that even assuming that appellants\u2019 statistics established a pri-ma facie case, it \u201cwas so clear that defendant did not discriminate, that I would make an ultimate finding in its favor, even if for some reason, it had the burden.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court supported this statement with additional factual findings, based on the testimony of witnesses for both parties, that employee preferences and job qualifications were major causes of the disparity. Viewed in this context, appellants\u2019 argument concerning the use of statistics is merely academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>SMSA Projections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The United States Department of the Census has prepared certain statistical projections, the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area projections (SMSA projections), which show the percentage racial composition of the Worcester area work force in each job category. The district court noted that on the basis of these projections, blacks were proportionately \u201cover-represented in virtually all job categories and departments at Wyman-Gordon. Appellants assert that the district court erroneously relied upon this fact as evidence establishing that ap-pellee did not discriminate. Appellants point out that they are not challenging defendants\u2019 aggregate hiring of blacks, but rather claiming that given the total number of blacks hired, a disproportionate number of them are assigned to the Housekeeping Department, a \u201cdead-end job\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Appellants misconstrue the impact of the district court\u2019s reliance <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the SMSA projections. The district court merely used the projections to demonstrate the narrow focus of plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Based on their own statistical evidence (which was their chief evidence aside from the testimony of individuals whom the district court found lacking in credibility), the court concluded that \u201cplaintiffs are reduced to a single, allegedly disparate fact: that there were, from time to time, substantial (but steadily declining) overages in the hiring and complement of the housekeeping department.\u201d In so reasoning, the district court was simply restating appellants\u2019 own theory of the case. The fact that this restatement highlighted the weakness of the evidentiary support for that theory is by no means a reason to find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">\n<em>EEOC Investigatory Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">Appellants introduced \u00e1s evidence a report of the EEOC critical of appellee. The district court examined the report, but found \u201cthat whatever presumptive weight attached to this report was dissipated after lengthy discovery and a nine-day trial at which both sides have had, and have exercised, a full opportunity to present all aspects of the case.\u201d Specifically, the district court criticized the report as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201cIn addition, I find the report superficial in its reasoning. Defendant is criticized for having no blacks in housekeeping in [the Grafton plant] (in point of fact there were more blacks in Gr\u00e1fton than had applied to go there), without any indication that blacks were purposely excluded from Grafton or why they were prejudiced thereby, and without apparent consideration of the fact that, as was pointed out to the EEOC, and as plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses brought out at trial, blacks chose not to go there, although offered the opportunity, because of transportation difficulties. In relating statistics, no mention was made of Worcester SMS A figures. Particularly important, defendant was condemned for the alleged effects of a departmental seniority system without even a suggestion that that system was purposely discriminatory . [T]here are enough untruths, or only partial truths, so that I choose not to accept as probative any specific findings that were not independently supported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMm\">Appellants mount a feeble attack on these findings of the district court primarily by challenging the credibility of one of defendant\u2019s witnesses who criticized the report. We would have thought it needless to point out that determinations of credibility are for the trial court. In any event, as the above excerpt from the court\u2019s opinion demonstrates, its findings rested on much more than the critical testimony of a defense witness. Appellants also attempt to defend the EEOC\u2019s failure to consider defendant\u2019s intent by pointing out that the relevance of intent in employment discrimination cases was not made clear until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Teamsters, </em>decided after the EEOC report was produced. While this chronology may explain the EEOC\u2019s error, it does not mean that the district court should adopt that error as its own.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Appellants also cite to our dictum in <em>Blizard v. Fielding, </em>572 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1978) that an EEOC investigatory finding is entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d from the trial court. As the context of that language in <em>Blizard </em>makes clear however, EEOC findings \u201cwill not bar a trial <em>de novo </em>\u201d in which \u201cboth parties are entitled to an inquiry by a court into the charges.\u201d Moreover, as this case makes abundantly clear, while EEOC findings in general may be significant evidence, their probative force in individual cases varies considerably and is left to the determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\n<em>Seniority System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Appellants devote the last seven pages of their brief to the claim that the district court erred in failing to find that appellee\u2019s seniority system violated Title VII. Appellants contend that the issue here is not subject to the clearly erroneous standard. Appellants, however, concede that even if the seniority system, which they agree is neutral on its face, \u201clocked-in\u201d blacks to less desirable jobs,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it would not constitute a violation of Title VII unless its adoption was the result of an intention to discriminate. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 355-56, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1864-65, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). Thus, contrary to appellants\u2019 argument, the issue \u2014 whether appellee intended to discriminate \u2014 is most certainly governed by the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Sweeney v. Bd. of Trustees of Keene State College, </em>604 F.2d 106 (1st Cir. 1979). Here, there was more than ample evidence including the testimony of appellee\u2019s officers and employees, to support the district court\u2019s finding that there was no intent to discriminate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that appellants can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>point to other evidence giving rise to contrary inferences (some of which are questionable) is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\">. The court in <em>Teamsters </em>did refer to \u201cthe use of statistical proof ... to establish a pri-ma facie case of racial discrimination in jury selection cases, <em>see, e. g., Turner v. Fouche, </em>396 U.S. 346 [, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567]: <em>Hernandez v. Texas, </em>347 U.S. 475 [, 74 S.Ct. 667, 98 L.Ed. 866]; <em>Norris v. Alabama, </em>294 U.S. 587 [, 55 S.Ct. 579, 79 L.Ed. 1074]\u201d, and stated that \u201c[statistics are equally competent in proving employment discrimination.\u201d 431 U.S. at 339, 97 S.Ct. at 1856. However, even reading this language as stating that the use which may be made of statistics in the two contexts \u2014 employment discrimination and jury selection cases\u2014 is identical (a reading which is somewhat undercut by the court\u2019s subsequent statement that statistics\u2019 \u201cusefulness depends on all the surrounding facts and circumstances\u201d), in the jury selection cases as well the findings of prima facie discrimination rested on more than statistics alone, see, e. g., <em>Turner v. Fouche, </em>396 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>U.S. 346, 360, 90 S.Ct. 532, 540, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">. We do note, however, that in this case such an assumption is particularly suspect since the statistics themselves give rise to conflicting inferences. Thus, for example, one could infer from the statistics that the defendant never discriminates against blacks, but that he does discriminate against whites in the hiring of workers for the Housekeeping Department. Obviously, this inference is not the one which appellants draw. The point is, however, that at best the statistics are ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-17\">. Of course the burden of <em>proof </em>always remained with appellants, <em>Sweeney v. Bd. of Trustees, Keene State College, </em>439 U.S. 24, 99 S.Ct. 295, 58 L.Ed.2d 216 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-18\">. The word \u201creliance\u201d is itself a bit of a mis-characterization of the court\u2019s use of the projections. In determining that appellee did not discriminate, the district court relied primarily upon the extensive testimony of numerous witnesses for both sides. It used the SMSA projections merely to show how weak were the statistical inferences upon which appellants relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\">. Appellants do not even attempt to defend the report\u2019s reasoning pertaining to Grafton.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. The district court found that it did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">. In this regard, it is helpful to quote a portion of the district court\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">\u201cThere are many departments, housekeeping being only one. Whatever plan defendant adopted would affect all departments and all employees. The alleged improper target, housekeeping blacks, constituted well under 2% of the total payroll. In the absence of evidence of extraordinary prejudice against them, it would be entirely unreasonable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>assume that an employer would adopt a company-wide plan, not for business reasons, but in order to restrict the mobility of a small number of blacks in housekeeping. It would be particularly unreasonable to believe this in the present case in light of the fact that defendant was voluntarily \u2014 there was no union at the time \u2014 instituting changes whose effect was markedly to increase the mobility of housekeeping blacks, as was demonstrated by the fact that in the ensuing months almost 30% of the housekeeping blacks transferred out, almost none having done so before. I find defendant\u2019s actions were bona fide.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
